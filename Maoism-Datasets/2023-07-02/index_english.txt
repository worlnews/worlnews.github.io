Right -wing parties rose around Europe 
July 1, 2023![] Image source, reuters
France is on the edge of crisis. 
This week, a 17-year-old boy from the French-Algerian family was shot and killed by the police near Paris. The riots spread to all parts of the country. From the suburbs (usually ignored by society), people held their breath.
This type of riots are not unheard of in France. But strong emotions swept the whole country, whether they were sympathized with the police or sympathy for the suburbs and the family members of the victims. Since the summer of 2005, this emotion has never appeared in France.
Although President Macron is obviously working hard to control the situation, his right -wing political opponent Marine Lepen has a tough position and anti -immigrant theory on security issues, which is likely to eventually benefit from polls.
Looking at the south, north, east, and west of Europe, you will see the extreme right -wing parties of different styles -nostalgia nationalism, populist nationalism, extreme conservatives with a new fascist source, etc. -are clearly recovering.

In 2016, the French National Front leader Marin Le Pen gave a speech at the National Front political rally held by Frejus.
It can be traced back to the ancient taboos of the devastating war of anti -Nazi and anti -fascist Italy in the 20th century -most voters believe that you should not vote to the right -wing, and the mainstream party refuses to cooperate with the extremely right -wing organization. This taboo is gradually eroding.
In 2000, I lived in Vienna. At that time, the right -wing for the first time with the Freedom Party of the Freedom Party. Become a headline news from all over the world. The European Union even imposed foreign sanctions on Vienna.
Now, the third -largest EU economy is led by Giorgiameloni, a leader in Giorgiameloni, who is a leader of a new fascist party. In Finland, after three months of debate, the Right -wing nationalist "Finnish Party" recently joined the United Government.
In Sweden, the "Swedish Democratic Party", which resolutely oppose immigration and multiculturalism, is the second largest party in parliament and supports the right -wing joint government.
Last Sunday, in Greece, three extremely right -wing parties won enough seats to enter the parliament. In Spain, the controversial nationalist party "VOX" (VOX) -since 1975 fascist dictator Francisco Franca The first successful right -wing party in Spain since the death of Franciscofranco -the performance in the recent regional elections exceeded everyone's expectations.

On May 21, 2023, the chairman of the "Sound of the People's Republic of China" San Diego Abaskal participated in a political rally in Laer City, Spain.
There are rumors that they may form a joint government with the Conservative Party after three weeks later.
Then there are Poland and Hungary's extremely conservative and dictatorship governments.
The list goes on.
Even Germany, which is so sensitive to its fascist history.
Police surveys show that the German "Alternative Selection Party" (AFD) in Germany is ahead of Prime Minister Schultz ’s“ Social Democratic Party ”(SPD), or it is on the same way. Last weekend, a German alternative selection of party candidates won the local leadership position for the first time. The Social Democratic Party calls it a "political dam."
In the end what happened? Is the millions of European voters really turned to the right wing? Or is this more like a protest vote? Or a sign of polarization between urban liberal voters and other conservative voters? What does it mean when we describe political parties as "extreme right wing"?

On June 25, 2023, in eastern Germany, Robert Sesselmann of Robert Sesselman of the East of Germany, RobD, was given a speech at the election activity.
Take a look at the tough attitude of some mainstream politicians, especially before the election, on the issue of immigration, such as Markrutte, the right Dutch Prime Minister of the Right -wing, or a security issue. Er Macron.
Mark Leonard, director of the European Foreign Relations Commission, said we are facing a huge paradox.
On the one hand, in recent years, many mainstream politicians have grabbed slogans or positions from the extremely right -wing hands, hoping to snatch their supporters. But by doing so, they helped the right wing look more mainstream.
At the same time, some of the extremely right -wing parties in Europe are intending to move closer to political centers, hoping to attract more intermediate voters.
Take an attitude towards Russia as an example. Many right -wing parties, such as the Italian Alliance Party, Marine Le Pen, France, and the Austrian Liberal Party, have traditionally have close relations with Moscow.
After the Russian President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, this situation became even more embarrassing, which led these party leaders to change their words.
Mark Leonard quoted the relationship between the right wing and the European Union as another example of their "centralization".
You may still remember that after the Brexit referendum in 2016, Brussels worried that there would be a Domino brand -French Brexit, Denmark Brexit, Italian Brexit and so on.
Many European countries had a populist party who had a strong doubt about Europe at the time, but over the years, these political parties have been obliged to stop advocating to withdraw from the EU and even withdraw from the euro.
For many European voters, this seems too aggressive.Image source, PA Media

Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a speech at the Conservative Party Conference held by the Manchester Conference Center.
They studied Brexit's influence on the social and political influence of Britain (not to mention the heated economic impact). Many people concluded that withdrawal from the EU will lead to further unstable world of unstable world.
Think about it: The new crown epidemic is popular, and it is adjacent to the aggressive and unpredictable Russia. Worried about China, struggling to survive the cost of living, millions of European families are still undergoing the sequelae of the 2008 economic crisis.
Police investigations have shown that the EU is currently more popular among Europeans than in the past few years.
So far, the extremely right -wing party is talking about reforming the EU instead of leaving the EU. They are expected to perform strongly in the European Parliament elections next year.
Georginawright, director of the Institut Montaigne in Paris, told me that she believed that the rejuvenation of Europe's right wing stemmed from dissatisfaction with mainstream politics. For example, in Germany, one -fifth of voters say they are not satisfied with the coalition government.
Wright said that many European voters were attracted by the outspoken right of the extremely right -wing party. The three key areas of traditional politicians seemed to have no clear answer in the three key areas of life, which made people feel obvious:
1 . Issues related to identity: Fear open borders and national identity and traditional values are eroded
2 . Economy: The rejection of globalization and the descendants cannot guarantee that there is a better future resentment
3 . Social justice: a national government cannot control the feeling of managing citizen life
You can see that these problems have also infiltrated European debate on green energy.
In the Netherlands, the "Farmer-CitizenMovement" of the right-wing populism this year, after the provincial election, he won the most seats in the parliament and became the headlines of major political parties.
In France, Macron tried to increase the price of gasoline to prevent people from driving, but it was opposed by the so -called "yellow vest" protesters, including extremely right -wing groups.
In Germany, the public's concerns about fiscal conditions and anger hindered the environmental reform that ruling the Green Party promoted its commitment.

In response to the upcoming White House, Swedish Prime Minister Christison issued a statement saying that "President Bayeng invited us to meet next week before President Bayeng Bayeng's Vilnius summit next week." He said: "The focus of this visit will be the NATO application case in Sweden."
The White House stated that Biden and Criston would also "discuss common commitments to support Ukraine under the face of Russian brutal aggression war."
The two will also discuss cross -Atlantic cooperation in order to respond to issues such as China, climate change, and emerging technology.

(Voice of German in Chinese) Ms. Lin said she was a native of Hong Kong. "I was studying in Hong Kong. When I was in college, I went to Britain to study in the last year. Then I worked in Hong Kong. I was in an accounting firm. I got married and had children."
In 2021, Ms. Lin applied for a master's degree in Germany, and later came to Germany with her husband and son through this visa. She tells that half of the reason to come to Germany is because of children. Her son read Waldorf Education in Hong Kong, because in the mainstream school, the child reads language-Chinese and English have obstacles, and psychological pressure is great. "He begged the teacher to give him less homework, but it didn't work." After taking the child to see the psychologist, she was worried that the child may "take medicine and read". She felt that the little child was "unreasonable" Essence So she took her child away from the mainstream school and went to the co-LearningCenter under the Waltedford system in Hong Kong, and the child was very happy and could grow back to the child's original state. However, since the autumn of 2019, she cannot find a teacher with such qualifications in Hong Kong to continue the so -called "alternative education" to the children. When she saw a master's degree in Germany who provided education in Education in early 2021, she had a interest in her own entry and was applied and was admitted. "I ask if I can bring my child to study, the answer is okay." "I also want to see why Waldorf's education can help my children. My child has obstacles to study language, but he can be in Waldorf in Waldorf. When growing up, he can learn well. His grades are not necessarily very good, but he loves reading, and he has more reading than me. "
After graduating from Germany, although Ms. Lin did not engage in teachers' work due to German, she found a job in the accounting industry of the Bank, and continued to stay in Germany with her family.
Ms. Lin said that for her husband, she made immigration Germany's decision is difficult. "Because he doesn't want to leave Hong Kong. He actually loves Hong Kong. He feels that he shouldn't leave Hong Kong. We didn't come out of the parade in 2019. What did you publish? But we also love Hong Kong at all. But we also love Hong Kong. All of our family members. All in Hong Kong. "
The other half of the reason for Germany is related to politics. "Politics does not mean freedom of speech, or something," Ms. Lin said. She said that Hong Kong's implementation of the TSA examination system in the past ten years has led to the school's first grade in primary school in order to achieve good scores. "They practice their children from this direction, and his homework and exams are also in this direction. Teachers regardless of their children's ability. I say that my child has limited ability when he is studying language. He has more than ten homework at that time. He did his homework until 12 am and 1 am, and he would get up at 6 o'clock the next day. "In 2015, the government held public hearing on the TSA examination system under social criticism. Ms. Lin participated in the public hearing and feedback her child. However, the end result is, "They continue to let the children test TSA. I was cold at that time. Why can education be done like this and ignore the life and death of the child. At that time, I felt that there was no confidence in the government. They do education, but they ignore their children, as long as their grades. "
One person election: Li Jiachao in the eyes of Hong Kong people 
In addition, Ms. Lin also observed that the government has gradually moved towards the direction of control. "Control is more, and it has an impact on my children. What topics do you want to read, it is not allowed. It is something that is not sensitive. If the government feels on his adults, you are not allowed to go. Well. "In addition, considering the privilege class and social unfairness of the Mainland, Ms. Lin is also worried that children will encounter uneven opportunities in the future.
Today, more than two years have passed, Ms. Lin feels that the decision to leave Hong Kong is correct. "Now my child is very happy to live here." Ms. Lin said, the child can learn what he wants to learn freely. "For example, he likes the history of World War II, he can read. That is surprising to me, because his teacher allowed him to study." In contrast, Ms. Lin said, when she left It has been said that the degree of freedom in Hong Kong will decline, and it is true. Whether it is the use of "peaceful travel" application software during the epidemic period, or the difficulty of extracting compulsory provident fund in advance, Hong Kong people reflect this.
The Hong Kong Government Push the "Anxin Travel" APP why Hong Kong people are uneasy 
Ms. Lin said: "Also, if my child continues to grow in Hong Kong, he has to at least 50,000 yuan in the Hong Kong government to complete the" Tomorrow Lantau "-is a big place to develop the north. Because all of them are all. Things No need to go to the parliament to discuss Well. So no matter how much you say, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion, 10 trillion, no problem, you can pass within 3 seconds. Therefore, if we continue to stay in Hong Kong, we will pay a lot of taxes, and my child will pay a lot of taxes. Just like the Mainland, the child will lie flat, because he can work hard, and he can't be the person he wants to do, and he wants the job he wants. The more he earns, the worse the quality of life. "
"Now there is only a unilateral sound" 
Mr. Li and his family came to Germany because of an opportunity at work. In April last year, Mr. Li's company in Hong Kong had a vacancy in his parent company in Germany. He applied and got it. "You also know that the situation in Hong Kong at that time was relatively chaotic, and the government's situation was not very good. It was worse than the previous year and the previous year. Especially the situation of children's education. Seeing that there was an opportunity to work in Germany to work, Decide here. "
Mr. Li said that after the Citizen Movement, he discovered that "why does the Hong Kong government do this? It seems that it doesn't care about our freedom." The Hong Kong government should do what. He felt that he was usually a little fair before. "The sound of the positive and negative sounds must be together, but now it seems to be gone. There is only a single voice. Even if the other party strives to say, explain it until the end (the other party) There is no way to accept it, and then just do it according to my plan. I think this situation is not good. "
Mr. Li said, I don’t know when I can return to the state of Hong Kong ten years ago or 20 years ago. "That is, I want to say anything, you can go to the parade, or what I do. Don't violate the law. The situation in Hong Kong is more dangerous now. You can also see some reports, saying that what I said on the street, said on the same day that he did not catch you that day, but I set up one in the future. I set up one in the future. The law can go back to what you did before, what bad things you did, and he caught you again. I don't think it is good. "###? Many Hong Kong people have encountered hardships after immigrating to Britain
Mr. Li said that it would be difficult to leave Hong Kong without this job opportunity in Germany, because there were more things to give up. "I know that many Hong Kong people have gone to Britain. Because the method to go to the UK is more convenient. But what do you want after going to Britain? If you don't have a job, you need to think about it. So this part also needs to be considered. Come out, but after a few years, it is still impossible, and if you have to return to Hong Kong, it doesn't make sense. "
Now more than a year in Germany, Mr. Li said that his family liked life here. Of course, "the contrast between Hong Kong and Germany is also quite large." Hong Kong is a major metropolis, and in Germany, they live in a small village. "But overall, our life here is happy. There is not much difficulty when children study." Mr. Li contacted the Hong Kong people in the German Association German, of course, I do n’t understand when I came, I ca n’t say German. Many things have to help others. So if you want to find some Hong Kong people in Germany, we can understand at least what we can say and help each other. " You can talk about your language.
Hong Kong Foreign Institute of Foreign Experts Examination: What makes them go? 
In Germany, Mr. Li has always paid attention to the news of Hong Kong. His feeling is that Hong Kong's economic situation and security have continued to decline. "I don't know when it will return to my situation when I was in Hong Kong before. I guess it may not have this opportunity in the next five years and eight years, and it may not be able to return to the previous level. The Chinese or Hong Kong government has a big change. But I haven't seen this opportunity now. "
Mr. Li said that he has no plans to return to Hong Kong. "I thought about it a little, but there was no chance to go back. Especially what are the other 23 articles Ah, Guoan Law These two have a great impact on us. Because its rules are not clear, for example, it still has to be banned That Rongguang's Song of Hong Kong Essence Its legislation is unclear. It is not clear how it goes to this legislation and how to implement this regulation. "

The Koreans are "young" at once, one to two years old
(Voice of Germany Chinese) When the Koreans woke up on Wednesday (June 28) in the morning, they found that they were one year younger than Tuesday, and some were even two years younger.
This large -scale "aging" is attributed to the effectiveness of a new law. The law abolish the traditional age calculation method (virtual age) and requires Koreans to use the internationalization method of internationalization.
Lee Wan-Kyu, director of the South Korean Legal Department, said at a press conference on Monday: "We expect legal disputes, complaints and social confusion caused by age computing will greatly reduce."
Korean people used to use virtual years before 
According to the traditional method of calculating the age in South Korea, a person is already one year old when he is born. Everyone's age will increase by one year on January 1, not only the age of birthday.
Although the international age calculation method has been used in South Korea for legal documents and medical documents since the early 1960s, the traditional calculation method is still used in daily life.
But the law passed in December last year ended this traditional system. According to a government polls in September last year, 86% of Koreans plan to use international systems.
"I will be 30 years old next year." Choi Hyun-Ji, a 27-year-old office staff member, told Reuters when talking about the traditional age algorithm. "But now I have more time, it's great."
"Squid Game" reveal Korean social problems 
Why is the virtual age continued in South Korea to this day? 
This traditional algorithm has also been used in other countries in East Asia before, for example China , Japan and North Korea, but they were abandoned decades ago.
It continues in South Korea, partly because of the importance of "age" to Korean, because people usually use respect, such as "Unni" (sister) and "OPPA" (brother), not personal names.
"Age is indeed important." Humanologist Mo Hyun-Joo told AFP, "If you don't know people's age, it is difficult to communicate with them."
In the traditional algorithm, everyone in a grade in the school is considered the same age, so we can talk to without a language level.
There are also the third age computing system in South Korea. It is used to calculate a person's school year, when to participate in the compulsory military service, and when to buy alcoholic beverages.
The system is similar to the traditional algorithm, but starts from the age of zero. The system is not affected by new laws and will continue to exist.

For African governments, which are working hard to cope with upgraded domestic unsafe situation, Wagner has become a lifeline.
In 2018, after the mercenaries helped the President of the Chinese and African Republic, the President of the Republic of China, Fostein Alchandra to fight against the rebels, Russian became the official language taught by the country in the country, and Wagner's leader became precious in the capital Banji.
In Mali, the military loses patience in the cooperation between unsafe problems brought by the unsafe problems brought by the unannounced problems brought by the armed groups that are linked to the base organization and the "Islamic State" (ISIS). Instead, he signed a contract with Wagner.
However, after the Attempts of Wagner's rebellion last week, Wuyun not only shrouded the armed organization's external activities, but also covered bilateral relations between Russia and African countries hired by the organization.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week that the "hundreds of soldiers" in the Central African Republic should be the "instructor" at the request of the government, and they will continue their efforts.
Gilles Yabi, the founder of WATHI, told Peninsula TV that these comments were not surprising.
Gils said, "Lavrov's statement clearly shows some obvious things. Wagner is not just a mercenary company. Wagner is a company that has been tolerated by the Russian government and has always acted for Russia's interests, especially abroad. "
"For Mali and the Chinese and African Republic, it is important to ensure that cooperation with Russia will continue."
 Analysis: Wagner Group(Peninsula TV Station)#### "What will happen"
In recent years, other private military contractors have also started business in Africa, so if Wagner is withdrawn from the African continent, there will also be military choices.
The International Organization of the International Crisis Organization CharlesBouessel, a senior analyst in the China African Republic, said: "These new companies are the former employees of Wagner, who have in -depth understanding of Wagner's activities in Africa, and the Russian government can easily use it easily. These people will help to regain all activities of Wagner, especially in China and Africa. "
Nonetheless, this uncertainty still aroused concerns from the government that relies on Wagner's security expertise.
Busel pointed out, "We see a little pressure from the authorities. This pressure comes from what they cannot be 100 % determined, and Wagner will survive in the next few months."
But like the Kremlin, it turns out that the Wagner rebellion is a warning for governments of African countries.
Bakary Sembe, director of the regional regional region of Tingbacu Africa, said that African countries will now be extremely cautious because Wagner's resistance to Moscow is easily staged in the country.
He pointed out, "They must stop considering the method of outsourcing security. This is not a feasible strategy. Now, in the new situation, African countries will be more cautious when using Wagner."
Despite Moscow's guarantee, Mali and the Chinese and African Republic are still embarrassed. Mori said, "Mali and other countries that are connected with these non -national elements are now embarrassed in the weapon of Wagner and Moscow's anger."
 Russia -Ukraine's Wagner Group rebelled in Russia on June 24, the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group controlled Rostov, one of Russia's largest city of Russia, and was heading to Moscow, but his leader Yofgen Perigo was appointed Ordering them to return to the base to avoid bleeding, Putin described these behaviors as a traitor.
Western retreat, Wagner enters 
At the request of Bamako, the French army, which was popular in Mali in the 201 2013 conflict, has now withdrawn. After the United Nations Security Council voted for a decision to withdraw immediately, the UN peacekeeping troops were about to evacuate.
Analysts said that this is dissatisfaction with France. France was the only external influence in the region and failed to prevent the expansion of the armed groups and support the dictatorship. Wagner opened the door.
Senbe told the Peninsula TV, "In French countries, the existence of Russia is expressing protest against France. This is a sign of resistance, but it also caused them to alienate the West."
"France conducted many intervention operations on Mali, but France and international partners failed to support Mali to get rid of the unsafe situation."
With the retreat of the United Nations forces and the instability of Wagner, the fragile atmosphere of Mali and its impact on the Sahele region that had already fallen into the dilemma was worrying.
Gils said, "Obviously, we must realize that these countries do not have their own institutions. At the same time, there is a reality faced by these countries that they have no internal reform in order to truly control our safety."
Although Wagner was invited, this mercenary was accused of participating in human rights in Africa. The United States has listed Wagner as a "multinational criminal organization" and is responsible for extensive infringement.
Replacement may not reverse the status quo. "I think this cannot substantially changes Wagner's accountability, and the event will definitely maintain this form."
"It is not important whether it is Porigerin or other war entrepreneurs. More importantly, who will control this company."

(Voice of Germany) Europe is fragile. This is a key lesson from Russia's war against Ukraine. Europe is responding to this, and the first is to use money. For example, in order to block the largest gap, the German government has set up a special fund of 100 billion euros Essence
Not only that, Germany also decided to use 2%of the GDP of domestic social production in the future to develop national defense. This standard has been clearly formulated as early as 2014, but in 2022, only 4 of NATO member states from the EU from the EU were only 4 A country meets the standards. In view of the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, 20 EU countries have promised to greatly increase military expenditure.
The European Defense Report issued by the Munich Safety Conference pointed out that although it is very important to supplement funds, it is an art reasonable and effective use of funds.
lesson of the Ukrainian war 
In order to write this report, Mu'an first studied the Ukrainian war. One of the reports of the report, Leonardschütte, told Germany that they summarized three conclusions, "First, the so -called old military materials, such as tanks, artillery and air defense equipment, still play a huge role."
The second conclusion at first glance, it is contradictory with the first, because it involves new military supplies, "we see that cheap drones and idle ammunition play an important role." The third conclusion that the reporter emphasizes is that "satellite communication is particularly important. On the one hand, it controls drones, but at the same time it guarantees that the communication between different departments of the troops."
The Ukrainian military densely uses the network system provided by Musk's Star Chain Company. The experts from Mu'an said that in the middle period, the European Union will gradually get rid of the dependence on private enterprises. "The European Union has a related initiative to launch 170 satellites to the earth's close orbit, which fills our vacancy in this ability. "
Old military materials are very effective
isolated and scattered military industry 
If this initiative is successful, it will become a model of not many internal EU. It is precisely the military industry, and it is difficult to cooperate in the sky. The European Union does not have a European army so far, and 27 member states have their own army, and more than a dozen countries have the local military industry. Hans-PeterBartels, a Politician of the Social Democratic Party, complained that the result was isolation and scattered, each of which was politics. He said: "A fundamental disorder is the small state of the industry. We have too many companies that produce independent systems in Europe. In the era of unscrupulous, they rely on orders to maintain. The merger is merged. But this state has led to the lack of overall views to the overall situation, which is also very expensive. "
Baters has worked as a representative of the Federal House for 5 years. In an interview with Voice of Germany, he analyzed, "We do need European companies such as European (military) enterprises, just as European companies such as the empty passenger group in the civil field, and make it into a world -class brand. Similarly, we are at least large -scale in large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale in large -scale large -scale in large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale large -scale is at least large -scale. The weapon system is in the field of weapon systems at least two to three European companies, allowing them to compete at the top level. "
Musk's Star Chain Company provides a network system with a close -to -floor table.
cooperate? Yes, no, you can come a little bit 
In a government statement on June 22, German Prime Minister Salz said, "Our national defense efforts must be implemented with the efforts; we must allow the military industry to have a long -term development prospect and accelerate their production."
But the good idea soon encountered the country's selfishness as soon as it reached. Xu Te, a security expert of Mu Anhui, said, "We are looking for a common military cooperation project, hoping to find positive examples for future reference learning. But we only see very few examples."
The scattered distribution of military industry not only caused waste of resources, but also made him worry about military costs. "We see that the most common military items such as ammunition of artillery, ammunition purchased in Germany, cannot be used in terms of ammunition. Bulletin in other countries is different because the standards of the cannon are really absurd enough. "
But cooperation is often overwhelming. For example, the FCAS project of Germany, France, and Western countries, this is a development project of the fighter system. It is precisely it has become a large platform for the Three Kingdoms to patent, work allocation, and leadership responsible for controversy. "We must say goodbye to this phenomenon!This type of project should stay in the hands of European companies and be responsible for Europe."
There will also be problems in the process of German and French cooperation projects, such as jointly developed combat tanks (MGCS). The project has been stranded and the German side has begun to produce alternative products.
Scharsez, Macron and FCAS project supervisor
No action now, when will it be? 
The Russian and Ukraine War made people once again realize the necessity and sense of urgency to promote the improvement of European cooperation. Xu Te asked, "When will not change the cooperation now?"
He has seen an example of changing. "As a response to the war, the EU has improved its attractiveness for the first time for the first time in history. This has never happened before."
The European Defense Report also pointed out another defect: huge product vacancies have been formed in the past few decades. Many European countries can only purchase military products in large quantities outside Europe, because the speed of picking up goods is fast. But this weakens the European military industry, and it will cause dependence in the long run. The contradiction between speed and European sovereignty is highlighted.
German Defense Minister Borispistorius decided: speed priority. The German Ministry of Defense wrote in an order issued by the Ministry of Defense at the end of April this year, "The time factor has the highest priority. From now on, in all federal troops currently and future projects, it is a factor that determines the essence. The purpose is to let the troops as soon as possible as soon as possible Can use the supplies purchased. "

The Wagner Legion has been active on the front line of the war, such as playing an extremely important role in Bachmum's surrounding war. However, in recent months, Pleigo and the senior officials of the Russian army broke out fierce quarrels. They believed that the Ministry of National Defense did not provide enough ammunition supplies during the Bach Murut Campaign.

Former Prime Minister: Rebellion weaken Putin's influence 
Former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, currently exiled overseas, believes in a recent interview with DW that Wagner's rebellion has greatly weakened Putin's influence.
He said that in 20 years, Russia's propaganda has always tried to guarantee that "the main foundation of Putin's rule is stable and potential prosperity."

"They understand that Putin is no longer a mediation person or protector of their interests."
When the leader of the Wagner Mercenary Corps, Porigerjin questioned the significance of the Russian and Ukraine War during the short -term troops last week. He criticized that this was a war that began to "self -propaganda of a group of bastards".
Wagner Group "Rebellion" Head: What is the significance of war? 
Cassinov served as the Russian Prime Minister from 2000 to 2004, and was subsequently announced by Putin to dissolve his leadership. Cassinov was the leader of the Russian opposition People's Liberal Party, and the party was disbanded by the Russian Supreme Court in May this year.
For Belarusian President Lukashenko, assisting mediation between Putin regime and Wagner Group Cassianov said, "Now they have seen a reconciliation between the two robbers," seem to mean that Lukashenko, who is the mediation person, will become the second "robbers" after Porigin.

After a teenager was shot by the police, France experienced the third night of riots
Ri riots began on Tuesday to weekends. From south to north, from Paris to a number of cities in Marseille, France appeared to have a smashing and burning incident.
On Thursday evening, the French Ministry of the Interior said that more than 3880 fires occurred on public roads, and Wednesday was 2391 on Wednesday.
In Ryleos in the suburbs of Paris, the attacker hit a car to the mayor's house. When his wife tried to escape with their two children, he was injured.
In Marseille, about 30 young people broke into a gun shop and stole at least four shotguns. Mayor Marseille called on the state government to immediately send the army.
Lyon Mayor Gregory Dussey(Grégory Doucet)He called the city's "unprecedented" riots and called on the police for reinforcement. After he had a crisis meeting at the city hall, he said that the city was "troubled by unprecedented intensity, degeneration and violence."

French Minister of Home Affairs Gérald Darmanin revealed that France deployed 45,000 police officers. Starting from Tuesday, there are people arrested every night, as few as three or four hundred, as many as thousands of people.
Darmaning asked their parents not to let their children participate in riots, and some children participating in riots were only 13 years old.
The government also requires closing overnight bus and tram services, and said that armored vehicles will be used to assist in law enforcement.
Police, Mother, Macron 
Tuesday, French President Macron(Emmanuel Macron)It is said that the behavior of shooting Nahler is "unforgivable."
But his remarks caused anger by the police union, accusing him of being eager to judge the police involved. Police unions called for them to be innocent before discovering guilty.
Another French police group posted a tweet saying that the police officer who "opened a fire to a young criminal" "was great" and blamed the death of the teenager on his parents, claiming that they "could not educate their sons."
The Minister of the Interior Dalmarn said the tweet was "despicable and unacceptable" and would take legal operations. This tweet has been deleted.
Nahler's mother Mounia said in a video circulating in social media that they took her child and urged people to participate in the parade and commemorate her son.
"He is still a child. He needs his mother," she said. "He kissed me in the morning and said," I love you, mother '. "
"One hour later, I was told someone to shoot at my son. What should I do? He is my life. He is my everything."

President Macron told reporters in Marseille: "Nothing can prove that the death of a young man is reasonable," he called for, "keep calm and realize justice."
"I want to express the feelings of the whole country about what happened and the death of the young Nayer, and tell his family's support and the emotions of the country."
"We have a teenager." He said: "This is puzzling and unforgivable." He added that the case had been handed over to the court immediately, and he hoped that the judicial would "quickly complete his work."
2017 Dispute Dispute 
Nahler was the second person to be shot and killed by the police during the traffic law enforcement this year. Last year, 13 people died in this way and set a record.

The human rights organization criticized a law amended in 2017, expanded the scope of police guns, and allowed the police to shoot without the driver's ignorance of the parking order. Official statistics show that after the law is revised, the number of police shooting vehicles during driving has been increasing every year.
Reuters said that since 2017, the French policeman's deadly shooting during the traffic interception process was black or Arabs.
The police officer said that he shot because he felt that he was in danger. However, a video released online and verified by AFP showed that a policeman pointed at the driver with a gun through a window and seemed to shoot at close range when he tried to drive away.
Agence France -Presse also reported that in the video, you can hear a person saying, "You will be shot on the head", but it is not clear who said it.
When the shooting occurred, there were still two people in the car. One of them escaped, and the other was a minor and was arrested and detained by the police.
Is the French policeman a racist?

The core issue of these protests is that French police are racists?
The riots on the streets believe that this is the case. Many people interviewed by BBCs have the same feeling of people from the Nantaili ethnic communities from Paris.On Friday, the UN Security Council called on France to "seriously solve the deep problem of racism and discrimination in law enforcement."
In response, the French government said that there was no basis for these charges.
But protesters are the problem.
They said that unless the French government acknowledged and started dialogue on their concerns, they would continue to the streets.
However, business owners and residents in the community are paying a price, and their property is destroyed every day, and they want the riots to stop.

Social media short video to help long riots 
Many comments say that the scene in the past few days is reminiscent of the 2005 riots.
At that time, the riots were taken by "outsiders" -most of them were photographers or reporters recorded on the spot.
This time, through the rough observation of Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat, you can see the latest riots' first -person perspective.
Through the labels such as "NaHel" and "riots", we can see hundreds of videos, showing that teenagers run in French cities, break into the store, set fire to destroy cars and trash cans.
In one of the videos, the masked people were closer to an automatic cash machine with a circular saw, and dozens of people cheered.
In another news, a senior asked helplessly who was shooting: "Why do you do this?"
The third video shows that a shop was smashed by a group of people, and many people were shooting with mobile phones.
Many videos have a humorous tone, and there are even a few videos to show riots to show riots.
President Macron has accused the social media platform in terms of inciting violence and promoting organizational protests.

 Laja was presented to Sri Lanka by the Thai authorities in 2001, but Thailand requested to return Lataga last year because it was believed that it was abused in a Buddhist temple in southern Sri Lanka, and the owner was neglected to take care of it. Lataga, 29, is also known as Saksurin in Thailand.
This morning, the 4,000 kg elephant took a one -way commercial flight from the airport of COLOMBO, the capital of Sri Lanka. Thai officials said the cost of boarding was $ 700,000.
After the plane landed in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Laga will be isolated in the nearby nature reserve.
Madushaperra, chief veterinarian of the Sri Lanka Zoo, pointed out to Agence France -Presse that when Lajaga was rescued last year, his body was full of abscess and pain.
Multiple animal welfare groups said that the elephant was forced to work with the logging worker, but its wound was ignored. Some Lajia wounds are said to be caused by owners.
Peri -La said that the elephant will receive spa after returning to Thailand to treat the remaining wounds of its left front leg.
Elephant is regarded as sacred animals in Sri Lanka and was protected by law.
The Sri Lanka's Ramal Rights Andenvalonment "Rally for Animal Rights and EnnVIRORORONMENMER" previously launched a event to rescue Laja from the temple and also expressed dissatisfaction with Laja's leaving Sri Lanka.
The "Animal Rights and Environmental Alliance" organized a Buddhist blessing activity on June 30; the organization is currently petitioning from the authorities to ask those who are allegedly neglected to take care of Lajia.
Sri Lanka Wildlife and Forest Resources Protection Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said that Thailand has always "persisted" to "persist" to return elephants.
Sri Lanka Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told Congress in June that he had personally expressed to the King of Thailand, and Sri Lanka regretted the situation of elephants.
Thailand's Natural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-Racha did not disclose whether La Jia was abused last month, but said that the Thai government no longer presented elephants to foreign countries.
He also said that the Thai Pavilion Division is currently being checked that the elephant situation has been sent to overseas.

According to reports, the growth of second -hand housing listings shows that after more than two years of epidemic prevention and control, the Chinese economy is beginning to be normalized. During the epidemic, many people suspended their life plans; but after the epidemic, people now start to get married, have children or relocate. For this reason, they will sell the house.
However, many sellers said that they were getting off before the housing market worse because of the deterioration of financial conditions.
Some analysts pointed out that if the housing market is too serious, it will drag the price of the entire housing market further and cause damage to the already weak economy.

Pan Gongsheng with British and American study and research background became the new secretary of the Party Committee of the People's Bank of China. The picture shows the appearance of the People's Bank of China
(Voice of Germany Chinese) The official changes of the central bank -the People's Bank of China on Saturday (July 1) of China. Pan Gongsheng, deputy president of the People's Bank of China and director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, took over as the party secretary of the People's Bank of China, eliminating Guo Shuqing's party secretary of the Central Bank of China and the deputy secretary of the Central Bank Party Committee of Yi Gang.
Among them, Yi Gang has also served as the governor of the central bank since 2018, and is still staying in office. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pan Gongsheng might be appointed by the government as the president of the central bank after taking over as the party secretary of the central bank.
According to the website of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Pan Gongsheng, who is about to be 60 years old this month, has served as the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China since 2012 and has deep business experience and policy experience. He used to be a master's degree in the School of Labor and Personnel of Renmin University of China and a doctoral student at the Department of Economics. From 1997 to 1998, Pan Gongsheng studied at the University of Cambridge, England; in the first half of 2011, he served as a senior researcher at the Kennedy School of Government Management in Harvard University.
By the international background? 
On the day before this personnel change announced, the People's Bank of China issued a statement of the "Second quarter of the 2023" statement on Friday, " Consumption environment, promoting a virtuous cycle of economy, and providing more powerful support for the real economy](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國推就業攻堅救青年失業率-網民質疑/a-66029450)"". The outside world believes that the appointment of Pan Gongsheng as the party committee secretary is one of the authorities to save China's downturn economy.
The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter and said that Pan Gongsheng won the candidate because of his international background, and the authorities expect him to cooperate more harmoniously with the governor of the world.
Former International Monetary Fund Organization, Plazal, Professor of Economics, Professor of Economics, Cornete University(EswarPrasad)It is pointed out to the Wall Street Journal: "Pan Gongsheng has technical capabilities and skills, which can guide the Bank of China to spend difficulties, provide support for economic growth, promote the market -oriented reform of the financial sector, and manage the risk of banking systems."
Faced with the risk of currency tightening 
From the latest statistics in June, the prices of Chinese consumption and production departments have fallen sharply, and the risk of currency tightening risks has risen sharply. In view of this, many economists have called on the People's Bank of China to use monetary policy means to stimulate the economy.
Chen Long, the co -founder of Quanhui Research, the headquarters in Beijing, told the Financial Times: "Among all possible candidates, he (Pan Gongsheng) is the person who knows the market most and the person who knows the most." However, he also added that Pan Gongsheng was unlikely to take over as the Secretary of the Party Committee of the People's Republic of China, which caused a major change in China's monetary policy, because after the financial regulatory reform in Beijing in March this year, the central bank's power has been weakened.
Affected by comprehensive factors, the recent RMB exchange rate on the US dollar hit a new low since November last year.

Major technology and financial companies around the world are still undergoing layoffs. According to the data platform Layoffs.fyi, in 2022, the number of layoffs of technology companies worldwide reached 164,000, and in the first quarter of 2023, it reduced 166,000 positions. In China, statistical data show that the youth unemployment rate has further increased, reaching 20%in April this year.
"Green Employment" ushered in spring. In the United States, where the layoffs are the most turbulent, since August last year, companies have released more than 100,000 green position recruitment information in half a year. A report released by Lingying showed that the proportion of green talents in global labor increased from 9.6%in 2015 to 13.3%in 2021, with a growth rate of 38.5%.
In China, the government -led "comprehensive green transformation of socio -economic development" and the "double carbon" policy have triggered "green employment trend". It is expected that by 2025, practitioners in related industries will reach 1 million. The Internet is even more popular, and the monthly salary of related green positions can reach 150,000.
According to the "Green Industry Guidance Catalog" updated in 2023, the green industry includes energy -saving carbon reduction, environmental protection, resource recycling, clean energy, ecological protection and repair and utilization, green upgrade and green services of infrastructure. Many industries are emerging industries and are constantly creating employment.
On the other hand, in the past ten years, due to policy supervision, enterprises and investors have added green departments inside the company, such as the sustainable development department or the ENVIRONMENT, social responsibility, and ESG of Governance. Department, these departments also created more "green positions". This trend has also created positions focusing on green topics in many academic institutions and media.
The above two dimensions constitute the so -called "green employment": one is the opportunity of the green industry, and the other is the environment and social responsibility related positions of the business or administrative department.
So, what is the overall situation of "green employment" in China?
Policy Promotion: The "double carbon" employment of the leading array 
The popularity of green positions is mainly from policy promotion. According to the statistics of Lingying, although from 2017 to 2021, Chinese green positions decreased year by year in all recruitment shares, in 2021, positions required for green skills increased significantly, accounting for about 50%of the total number of recruitment. Far higher than the global average.
This may be related to the "double carbon" goal of 2030 carbon peaks and 2060 carbon neutralization in September 2020. After the "double carbon" target was released, the green industry, which was originally concentrated in problems such as air and water pollution, and wildlife protection, began to attach importance to the problem of climate change.
The "Double Carbon" Talent Insight Report released by the Climate Action Youth Alliance (Caya) pointed out that although China's carbon industry has gradually begun since the "Kyoto Protocol" has gradually started since 2005, it has always been in At a very primary stage, even the Milestone "Paris Agreement" in 2015 has a small impact on employees in China's carbon industry. Establishing a "1+N" policy system issued by the government and the government (1 top -level design document+double -carbon implementation plan in multiple sub -field branches) finally brought the trend of in -depth adjustment of socio -economic development. This expands the gap in green talent. At present, "double carbon" related practitioners have grown from about 10,000 to about 100,000 before. The number of related employees is expected to increase to 50,000-1 million in 2025.
The "Double Carbon" Talent Insight Report "is currently the author, Zhihan, is currently working in a head Internet company, and is mainly responsible for the work of carbon neutralization and ESG management. Before 2018, she did not know the future employment direction when she was studying at an environmental economy in college. "After the carbon neutralization became a hot topic, many students and sisters came to me to consult with employment issues." Zhihan told Chinese and foreign dialogue: "This industry is relatively new. So I hope to use a report to summarize the problem of 'double carbon' employment. "
According to the research results of the report, the employment of "double carbon" includes four major businesses: carbon management, carbon emissions accounting, carbon market transaction, carbon neutralization technology, and involves multiple industries such as energy, industry, construction, transportation, and finance. Among them, there are the most carbon management consulting, followed by carbon emissions accounting. Most of the 121 investigators work in consulting agencies and Party A. In addition, Zhihan also introduced that some comprehensive businesses are gradually developing, including carbon neutralization, carbon neutralization training, and so on.
 The market is hot: popular ESG and green finance 
Policy supervision has become increasingly perfect, and the popularity of the market has followed. In an enterprise, ESG, including "double carbon", has become a more popular topic. ESG is an abbreviation of environmental, social and governance. It not only focuses on a series of environmental issues including climate change and biological diversity, but also pay attention to the social impact of corporate behavior, as well as the company's governance on issues such as mechanism structure. With the strengthening of supervision and the improvement of public environmental and social consciousness, more and more enterprises have begun to set up the ESG department to strengthen environmental and social surveys, supply chain management, and relevant information disclosure in daily operations to avoid risks, maintain brand image, and Improve long -term returns. Because of business and finance, ESG has become one of the most considerable wages in green employment in recent years, and has also been favored by many job seekers.
Du Bowen, who has recently joined the United Nations institution, told China and foreign countries that the road of career development "lucky on the two industries": Internet and ESG. As a student, Du Bowen began to pay attention to public welfare, and therefore chose to study for a master's degree in humanitarian aid. After graduating in 2015, he has worked in two large international public welfare organizations for four years, and has accumulated experience in social problems such as environmental protection, reducing poverty and hunger. After that, he entered the byte beating with these experiences and began to work in charge of cooperating with international organizations in the Tiktok Marketing Department. "Tiktok set up the function of corporate social liability around 2020 (CSR) functions, and later recruited some talents in Europe and the United States. There are also the motivation for the supervision of Internet platforms around the world around the world. . "Du Bowen introduced.Behind the enterprise also has the driving force of investors. Data show that at present, more than 110 investors in China have signed the UN Support Principles Forresible Investment (UNPRI), and most of the institutions signed after 2017. After calculation, the public offering fund signed by PRI manages more than half of the Chinese fund market. These investors promise to incorporate ESG considerations in investment decisions and will strive to promote the ESG performance of the investing enterprise through communication and voting. When talking about ESG's job job, Zhihan mentioned: "There are many issues involved in ESG. In addition to carbon neutralization and such climate issues, we will also pay attention to the direction of other investors such as human capital and corporate governance. "She introduced that the popularity of employment in the ESG industry has continued to increase in recent years, and Caya will also focus on the next green talent report to ESG.
"I feel that I have worked in these years. It is really difficult for people to solve the environment and social problems alone by people's goodwill, so I personally think that it is a good trend for capital participation." Du Bowen mentioned that investment and investment and investment in the green industry and Investors' management of the invested enterprise, "In addition, the government's supervision was relatively loose before, the motivation was even more insufficient. Now the policy is gradually improved, and some investors are incentives.
Because ESG and Green Finance became popular, the saying of "ESG Manager's monthly salary is as high as 150,000" on the Internet, which caused heated discussions. However, many industry insiders told China and foreign countries that such salary should be very small even if they exist. The salary level of an ESG position mainly depends on the overall salary level of its company. If it is originally a position set by the financial industry company, the salary will be relatively high. But if it is only an ESG position within non -financial enterprises, the salary will not exceed the general level of the company. After the "halo" from leaving finance, according to the survey results of the "Double Carbon" Talent Insight Report, most of the monthly salary of "double carbon" practitioners is between 10 and 20,000 yuan, and the region is concentrated in Beijing. Lord's first -tier city.
Women become the main force of green talents? 
"I have a observation, I'm not sure if it is accurate." Du Bowen shared: "The proportion of women practitioners in the ESG industry is very high. If you go to some ESG summits, you may find that many companies in charge of ESG are women. , Including the entire Asia -Pacific region, it seems that this is the case. "
Similar to his feelings, the China -British bilingual podcast "Environment China" also put forward an observation of "sustainable circle or more girls", and therefore created a series of programs for young people engaged in sustainable work. The guests of this show include many outstanding young women, such as officials engaged in climate and green finance -related work in the embassy, female sustainable managers of consumer goods companies, and female founders of environmental protection agencies. Yuan Xiaodan, the producer of the podcast and the former head of the Beijing Energy Network, told China and foreign countries that "the green industry is a large category. Generally speaking, I think that girls are not small, and the participation is very high."
This has always been verified to a certain extent. RBC Global Asset Management Co., Ltd. has done a survey and found that female customers are twice the possibility of promoting ESG. In this regard, Du Bowen said that it may be because ESG itself contains the attention of gender equality and diversified tolerance, so women may also be more likely to have interest in such work.
The results of big data analysis in the green industry are more conservative. Lingying's "Green Skills Report" shows that from 2015-2021, only 62 women were considered green talents compared to every 100 men. Although the proportion of men and women's green talents increased in general talents, men's transfer to green positions is faster than women. However, the report also pointed out that in half of the countries interviewed (mostly in Europe), the gender gap has been narrowed, and the growth rate of female green talents is faster than male green talents.
"The definition of the green industry is very wide. It may be in some research and lifestyle -related interesting industries. You will see more women's participation, such as climate change think tanks and academic research, ESG dual carbon media reports, sustainable sustainable, sustainable Restaurant, second -hand market, vegetarian industry, etc. "Yuan Xiaodan shared:" But according to my observation, there are many men in the emerging departments of traditional industries, such as the promotion of energy transformation, the traditional automobile industry has a new student electric vehicle department. , Traditional energy companies have set up renewable energy departments and so on. "
Early emerging industries 
The "sustainable upsurge" that came into being under policy and market -driven also brought a more mixed employment environment.
The first is the mixed fish and dragons on the market. "After the target of 2060 carbon neutrality, China has set off a sustainable wave, especially the boom of carbon emission reduction." Yang Yifan, the sustainable development manager of Oatly China office, shared it in "Environment China Podcast": "But I am A pain point that I feel is that although there is this boom, the knowledge accumulated behind it and related professionals are still insufficient, so there will be a group of green washing. For example, a variety of 'zero carbon' suddenly appeared on the market. Products. "Sino -foreign dialogue had analyzed such phenomena in 2021.
Yang Yifan also pointed out that it makes everyone feel like it is easy to achieve zero carbon. "Followers should do a good job of professional work, so as to promote consumers to understand how their choices will affect carbon emissions, and what impact these carbon emissions will affect the earth."
The other is the problem of no matching of talents. The survey results of the "Double Carbon" Talent Insight Report also showed that many job seekers temporarily decided to enter the carbon industry because of the favorable macro policies and "bet" in the industry. Compared with the space for personal growth and learning, job applicants are more concerned about the development prospects of units or departments. Zhi Hanzheng told China and foreign dialogue: "These job seekers may not have enough channels to understand the actual content of the work, resulting in a large deviation of the last actual work and imagination."
Enterprises are suffering from candidates' skills and knowledge levels that do not meet their requirements, and middle -level talents are even more difficult to recruit. Job seekers found that it was difficult to obtain and understand recruitment information, posts did not meet the expectations, and the place of work was too concentrated in first -tier cities.
The absence of education may be a major reason behind this. According to the "Insight Report", nearly half of the carbon industry job seekers graduated from environmental related majors. However, there are currently few majors for climatic changes and carbon -related majors in Chinese higher education, and the training system is not perfect. The seemingly related "environmental engineering" and "environmental science" and other majors are mainly concerned about water and air pollutants. It may rarely set up carbon -related courses at all.
During the two sessions, "Double Carbon Talent Training" also appeared in the proposal of members of the CPPCC. The proposal pointed out that the high -end scientific and technological talents currently facing the development of double carbon are still scarce. It should build a talent training model for integration of production and education, so that students can contact the front line of the "double carbon" industry.
It is foreseeable that the "green" industry related to the environment, energy and even sustainable consumption, and future employment demand will be further increased. It is only a microcosm to fill the gap in green talents, which is an important reminder of Chinese education and labor transformation.

In the construction of a factory for chip manufacturers, all countries and regions have begun to sprinkle money. The amount of money and subsidy amount of nearly 10 billion Euros is unprecedented, and throw money out of the window ... These description words are enough to reflect how controversy caused by Intel in the German government in the German government's huge subsidy commitment.
The chip manufacturer Intel invested in Magdeburg, Germany, and the construction factory was above the schedule, and in the past few months, Intel and the German government have been negotiating for subsidies. At the beginning of this year, the subsidy mentioned by the German government was obviously 6.8 billion euros, and now it is tentatively scheduled to be at 9.9 billion euros. It shows that Intel's powerful bargaining ability is not included, which does not include possible industrial electricity subsidies in the future. In June, the German federal government signed a letter of intent for investment with Intel. The German Economic Minister of Economic Head said that the investment shows that Germany is very attractive as a high -tech base. Obviously, the subsidy of these 9.9 billion euros is actually attractive.
This is the largest foreign investment in Germany so far. The German government said that Intel will invest more than 30 billion euros in Magdeburg, thereby directly generating 3,000 jobs in Germany, and 7,000 jobs will be generated in the process of building factories. Other employment opportunities. Germany Prime Minister Shuerz said that the investment allowed Germany to establish its own chip production capacity is an important step in Germany to consolidate high -tech bases and improve resistance. It's all good news.
On the issue of incompatible, the Director of the Institute of Economics (IWH), Germany, Reintgropp, which came to the conclusion different from the German government. He bluntly said that Germany was "throwing it out the window "Money", "distribution of gifts", ask why subsidies are quite profitable. He pointed out that the investment cost of an average of 1 million euros per job on the subsidy is too expensive. The director of the Institute of Economics (IFW), also known as the buying and selling between Intel and the German government, also seems to be quite expensive. He pointed out that the government often holds the subsidy policy regardless of its primary and second subsidies, and often cannot bring expected results. Significantly subsidies in chip manufacturing cannot ensure that Germany will obtain a cost -effective chip supply in the future.
In addition to questioning the amount, there is also controversy in input and output. The resources are limited, the funds are limited, what to support, and the decision of subsidies needs to distinguish the weight and make the screening. In Intel, the controversy points of input and output are mainly concentrated in two aspects: Does it really focus on supporting chip manufacturing? Do you really want to make advanced chips in chip manufacturing?
The first aspect is actually whether to join the chip competition. Groop said in a media interview, "Of course, I do not call for 100 % to depend on Taiwan in semiconductors, but it does not mean that we must be self -sufficient in all aspects." However, the world has entered a chip subsidy competition. Essence The United States took 50 billion euros, and the European Union intends to leverage more private investment with the EU chip law. The production capacity of the "European Chip Law" is the current 10%of the global chip production capacity, which has doubled in 2030. The President of the European Commission Feng Delin has invested Intel Germany as the first great achievement of the EU chip law.
During the shortage of chip supply during the epidemic, the European automobile industry was particularly impacted. The European Union's judgment on the new situation is that the shortage of supply in the epidemic and the dependence consequences exposed by the Russian and Ukraine War explained that in terms of chip supply, the EU cannot rely too much on a certain country. Clemensfuest, director of the Institute of Economic Research Institute, also said that Intel subsidies are very problematic and are bets in the future. He pointed out that the risk of supply chain is a normal economic phenomenon, and how to alleviate it is not the government's task. Groop also said that it cannot determine whether the chip supply will be shortage in the future.
The 2023 opinion of the research and innovation expert committee supports the German government's decision to support semiconductors. This opinion advocates strengthening Germany's technical independence in the era of globalization, saying that Germany's dependence on important raw materials and key technologies such as semiconductors is getting worse, making Germany gradually lose technology. In the future, a large number of private investment is essential, and it is supplemented by strategic and wise public investment, especially in the research and innovation of key technologies. The opinion emphasizes investment in research and innovation.
Groop also believes that Germany and Europe should invest funds into the development and innovation of future technology. He advocates supporting innovation in universities, research institutions and enterprises, and said that the effective German model has always been based on innovation, and it is not possible to give up their own model because of the bad consequences of the epidemic. Alicia García-Herrero from the think tank BRUEGEL also wrote that it should be vigorously invested in research and development to increase the EU's weight in chip design instead of waste a large number of public funds in other regions. Chip production. She stands at a high degree of strategy and pointed out that there is no need to produce high -end chips, as long as it controls part of the value chain.
As for the need for advanced process chips in Europe or mature process chips, I have already made in the "EU's advanced chip manufacturing. Can I help realize the semiconductor industry strategy? "A discussion in one article. The three pillars in the Draft EU Chip Law can be summarized as: investment research and development and innovation, and allowing manufacturers of government subsidies to subsidize member states to settle in and respond to the supply crisis in the European Union. The second pillar is the top priority. The EU believes that the lack of advanced chip manufacturing is the main weak link of its semiconductor industry. The draft emphasizes the insufficient professional technology of the EU in semiconductor production capacity and less than 20nm process manufacturing. Although Europe has the only manufacturing equipment below 7nm, there is no process manufacturing plant below 22nm, and the future trend will be chip below 5nm. The European Union focused its strategic focus on chip manufacturing, and the focus was on TSMC, Samsung, and Intel with the most advanced process technology. The European Union wants to build a semiconductor ecosystem that can compete with the United States to attract the three giants of the chip to establish a manufacturing plant in Europe.
Intel establishes two semiconductor manufacturing factories in Magdeburg, Germany, and will use Intel's most advanced Angstrom-Era crystal pipe technology to produce chips for computer equipment, servers and smartphones. The questioner believes that Europe does not need a computer or mobile phone industry for advanced process chips. Because European demand for chips is mainly from automotive and industrial applications, European domestic semiconductor companies have not tried to enter the advanced process runway. Sensor, power semiconductor, and radio frequency chip. In other words, investing in a large amount of public funds in Europe may not be able to benefit from it.

What is the impact of Xi Jinping's mutiny in Russia? The picture shows Xi Jinping and Putin in September last year to meet in Samalham
(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Taiwan "reported" published an article "Xi Jinping Wu's attack on Taiwan will also" also "Huaga Group's Disposal". The CCP's response should be the strongest. Of course, netizens are lucky enough, and the words "Qingjun side" are masked by Weibo, indicating that the authorities are very nervous now. As if Biden said that Xi Jinping is a dictator, all the media in the mainland avoided the words "Xi Jinping dictatorship", "Qingjun side" It is in this subtle.
The author pointed out that in the June 4th incident, the Communist Army was completely reduced to the SS. The shame that could not be dropped by the washing and brushed a huge shadow for the Communist Army to attack the Taiwan compatriots. This problem is not like Xi Jinping's anti -corruption in the army, and it can be solved by cleaning aliens. When more and more people are perceived, Xi Jinping's control of the Communist Army can be maintained on the most surface. Once major events occur, the dissatisfaction of the army's savings, and the hope of changing. of.
Xi Jinping inspected the Joint Combat Command Center of the Military Commission in November last year
The author believes that the reason why Pricigin was instantly prosperous and the instantly "surrendering" was that the mercenary was fighting for money. They were machines, and prison prisoners were not interested in politics. The CCP soldiers are not criminals. They have relatively thoughts. In the military command, the possibility of listening to the mountain is more likely. But it should not be "scattered" like Russian mercenaries. What they can learn from is the last direction of the soldiers after the soldiers. From this point of view, Xi Jinping's authorities will definitely make noise to settle Putin after the autumn, and strictly punish them, leaving a period of reference to the general leader of the CCP's army.
Hong Kong media, from critical to archived 
Recently, the female anchor of cable news in Hong Kong has suspected that it is a controversy to imitate the change of colleagues to change their jobs and imitate the Korean group dance steps. The online media headquarters in Washington published an article "Hong Kong News Ten Years", and the author Lusda pointed out that in the industry's internal remarks that aimed at maintaining the "serious professional image" of the press in the press. The news anchor suddenly played his heart and danced, and the problems in the press structure seemed to be more distressed. The critical overall decline of news content is seen, and it is replaced by "information". The loss of the audience is actually very real.
The article said that from the end of 2021 to the beginning of 2022, the editor and leader of the two media of "Apple Daily" and "Position News" were accused of publishing incite publication crimes or other crimes](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/立場新聞煽動案17篇涉案文章被指控什麼/a-63616772)Essence At that time, the immediate impact was that the white snow was snowy. There were many local news and local journalists who were unemployed. Later, the problem was that the incident was fast, and the public did not have much means to archive previous news in the past. The so -called archive, in this era, plus the essence of the Internet media, is actually just searching for the engine of the engine, and then whether it can be connected to read, graphic, and even videos. After this batch of online media is lost, there will be many empty caves that are no longer determined during that period.

The newspaper has a clear position. There are many current affairs review columns to criticize the CCP's senior management and Hong Kong Government, and often report to the mainland rights defenders such as Liu Xiaobo. At the same time, they support the Hong Kong Democracy Movement high -profile. After the transfer of sovereignty in Hong Kong in 1997, many local newspapers such as the South China Morning Post and Ming Pao were successively entered and acquired by Chinese capital. The Apple Daily was regarded as the only mainstream media in Hong Kong that had not been "dyed".

Hong Kong Police has become a "foreign nation" 
Taiwan's "Wind Media" published an article "How Hong Kong Police Become a" Foreign Race "". Kai Daxiong believes that in the summer of 2019, Hong Kong people recognize the difference between citizens and police and gradually treat them as foreign nations. Although this is quite micro Change, but the entire process and macro identity have been evolved. In this summer, Hong Kong has experienced a series of hopes and torture, and the hostility between the police and the people has continued to spirally upgrade with the conflict on both sides. However, if only everything is used as a hostile reincarnation of continuous spiral upgrades, it is a pity, which will flatten the entire process, ignore how the two hostile ethnic groups view each other, build each other's image, and generate follow -up ones Behavior. After the atrocities of the Prince Station on August 31 of that year, the gap between the police and the civilians of Hong Kong can no longer be able to make up for it The resistance no longer thought that the police were only infiltrated by foreign ethnic groups, but directly regarded them as foreign people.
On August 31, 2019, the police arrested a number of demonstrators and people
The article said that the policeman confrontation turned the police into a foreign nation, which specifically reflected the entire history since 1997. "In the process of becoming a foreign ethnic group, there are not only anger and opposition, but also various observations and analysis. People have gradually realized that the so -called" people's babysitters' are protecting another foreign colonial regime. Regardless of whether they are Is it the source and development of the dismissal of the unity of the illusion, the source and development of the misconduct in Hong Kong, or the use of "Hong Kong is not China" to express the power of being suppressed in the past, which will bring power.

A survey of the German Industry and Commerce Conference shows that overseas German companies are trying their best to make their industrial chain diversify, but when doing so, obstacles are encountered.
(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The "Global Commercial Outlook for the German Overseas Chamber of Commerce" by the German Industry and Commerce Conference (DIHK) shows that German overseas companies are currently trying to make their industrial chain diversified, but they have encountered obstacles at this time. Nearly half (47%) of German companies who are active in overseas encountered difficulties when looking for appropriate suppliers and business partners.
"For many companies, diversification is now necessary, but everything is not successful." The head of the foreign trade field of the German Business Conference told Reuters on Sunday. He introduced the situation of the survey, saying that many things "cannot change overnight."

Reuters reports that the German business conference asked the survey to inquire about 5,100 branches around the world.
The new crown epidemic made many companies realize that they are how dependent on overseas suppliers such as China. This situation was further prominent in the Russian and Ukraine War. Because of its high dependence on Russia's natural gas, Germany once faced an energy crisis. According to the previous investigation of the German Business Conference, two -thirds of German companies began to find new or additional suppliers, and some have found such suppliers.
The head of the foreign trade sector of the German Industry and Commerce Conference said to Reuters: "Obviously, the German economic community does not simply restore daily business, but is currently analyzing the impact of the new crown epidemic and new geographical risks."
He said that companies have felt multiple crises, and these crises have been rarely considered in the business strategy before. However, now, companies have begun to look at the business model with a wider range of framework so that they can be better prepared during the crisis. Essence

Senior civil servants of the South Korean government changed blood. South Korean President Yin Xiyue appointed a new unified minister and pointed out that the unity of the Ministry had paid too much attention to providing assistance to North Korea and needed to change.
Yonhap reported that Yin Xiyue's senior secretary Kim Eun-Hye revealed on Sunday (July 2) that Yin Xiyue believes that the operation of the unified department so far is like a supporting department to the DPRK. This situation should not continue. " The unity department is time to make changes. "
Yin Xiyue appointed conservative scholar Kim Yung-Ho as the new unity minister. Jin Yinghao served as a professor of political science at the Honesty Girls' University and touched the position of the DPRK. He once talked about pressure on North Korea by emphasizing the human rights of the North Korean regime, and pointed out that North Korean human rights issues should be given priority in the North Korean policy of Seoul.
Yin Xiyue emphasized at the appointment meeting that from now on, the Unification Department must fulfill its appropriate responsibilities based on the principles of the Constitution, that is, on the basis of the free and democratic order. "The unity we (South Korea) must be the people in the south and the north must enjoy a better life and get better treatment as a person."
A senior official in the Presidential Office said that the Unified Department will mainly analyze and respond to the latest trends in North Korea, while dealing with North Korea's human rights issues.
However, critics believe that once Congress certification is used as a unified minister, the role of the unified department may be weakened, because the priority of the ministry is to seek communication and reconciliation with North Korea.

 Russian President Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks in Moscow in March 2023. Reuters pictures
According to a report from the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, the first Xi Jinping ideological research institution outside China was established in Russia. Russian is called "Chinese Contemporary Ideology and Xi Jinping Ideological Research Office". The Asian Institute was established to systematically study Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Kiril Barbayev, director of the Institute of China and Hyundai Asia, said that the research center aims to objectively analyze the ideas and concepts that constitute the foundation of modern China, which will enable the Russian government, business and scientific circles to better Understand modern China and formulate more accurate strategies and predictions for Russian -China relations.
According to Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post", Li Lifan, an expert in Russia and Central Asia at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that this new research center has reflected the changes in the Russian academic community in the West and China in the past two years. The point of ‘looking east’ is becoming more and more important in Russia. Some of China's success in poverty reduction and industrial development policies are considered to be useful for some problems in the Russian academic community. He predicts that in the future, researchers and students who specialize in Chinese ideology and students enter Russia's institutes, think tanks, and decision -making institutions will increase China's influence there.
It is worth noting that from the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2017, by the end of 2021, China has established at least 18 similar Xi Jinping ideological research institutions to study this theory. In 2018, the constitutional amendment canceled the term system of the President of the State, and paved the way for Xi Jinping's re -election of the third national chairman.

The Japanese economy seems to return to the World Following Center.
In the past, when talking about Japan, the first impression was that the "lost twenty years" or even thirty years, so that many investment banks reported that Asia is a benchmark for emerging markets as a vigorous growth, it is often removed from Japan. Nowadays, the stock god Buffett has increased its holdings of the five comprehensive marketing of Japan. Japan has become its largest investment place outside the United States. The Japanese stock market has recently reached a new high, and it is even expected to become the best performance in the world this year. Everything has made the world re -examine. Is the Japanese economy really back?
Looking at the Japanese economy in the world, it is always easy to fall into extreme myths. Regardless of criticism or praise, it is often easy to associate the gains and losses of the Japanese economy more with factors such as culture. It seems that Japan's success or failure is accompanied by Japanese characteristics. This simplified perspective in fact makes understanding that Japan has entered a dead cycle of explanation. Because of the characteristics of Japan, Japan becomes like this, which makes the Japanese problem become a self -derived ambiguous mystery, becoming an unable to explain.
In the past ten years, I have been paying attention to the Japanese economy, and I have written Japanese trilogy in the process. From the perspective of economic perspective, although the Japanese economy has its own characteristics, it is essentially the basic law of separation from the economy -the essence behind the restoration of the Japanese economic story is still a post -developed economy fell from reform to a decline in growth rate. The struggle story, the standard economics principles are still effective, helping to understand the many seemingly unique characteristics of the Japanese economy.
For Chinese people, the most concerned is naturally the story of "20 years lost" after Japan in the 1990s. Regarding this period of history, there are still a lot of controversy. Some people think that "the loss of 20 years" does not exist, and some people emphasize that they have been "lost thirty years". Overall, everyone tends to treat the past Japanese economy as a overall stage: either think this is a thorough "lost twenty years", which is the era of failure. Many people even think that this is a typical Japanese strategy that is daring. For example, there is always a saying that Japanese overseas investment has re -created an overseas Japan.
How is the truth? In fact, "the 20 years of loss" exist naturally, but it is difficult to simply judge the right and wrong, but this history is actually divided into different stages in these twenty years. The so -called "lost twenty years" is generally identified as from 1992 to 2012. During this period, the economic growth rate was low or even close to 0. Data showed that in the past 20 years, the actual annual growth rate of the Japanese economy was 0.8%. The growth rate is 0%; at the same time, the inflation is even negative, and the contraction is raging. Obviously, this is obviously contrasting with the era of high -speed growth in the high -speed growth of Japanese fire, and it also makes people reflect. What happened?
It is undeniable that this is the 20 years of lost and 20 years of shrinking. Long -term low growth means that in the era of stock economy, enterprises and individuals need enough effort to survive. In the past 20 years, in fact, it has experienced different stages. It can be said that the reason why the Japanese economy has not performed well is often due to the internal and external transportation. It is often the internal adjustment that is exterior and encountered a storm.
I visited Japan in 2017 and could not visit people in the economy. I talked about a lot of macro problems, but a micro -case impressed me. Once, my friend took me to visit an enterprise that is an foundry for Apple. This company is a typical Japanese small and medium -sized enterprise with some technologies, but the scale is not large. The main business is that large companies are foundry. They were founded before the war. The products have also experienced several iterations. The chairman of the reception is the third -generation business owner. He shared the decades of development of his own company. It can be described as a thrilling. It is a microcosm of different cycles in a macro environment. The shock is not waiting; the early 1990s had recession, and the economy had just returned to 3%in the mid -1990s. Japan broke out in a bank crisis. After that, there was a relatively stable period of development after the reform of the Koizumi era, but suddenly the 2008 financial crisis and the aging of Japan all affected the company's strategy and development to varying degrees.
For this visit, the deepest thing I feel is that in a society where investment returns are gradually declining, the stock economy has become the main body. Even a small company, the macro cycle can be described as far -reaching impact on them. It can be said that enterprises in the macro -ripple nuclear and waves need to work hard to grasp the trend in order to barely seek for survival.
A few years ago, Chinese companies did not seem to feel the harsh experience of Japanese counterparts. After all, they are in an incremental economy era. It seems that there are new opportunities every day. Grasp a wave of bonus and fast money. After I returned to China, when I talked about Japan in economic sharing, many people always disagreed. Everyone felt that no matter from the growth rate or the volume, Japan and China were not comparable after all. Unexpectedly, a few years have passed, and when the growth rate falls "accidents", everyone realizes that everything we have experienced, Japan may have gone through, in a sense, it can even be said that Many people began to study the golden track of the downward era of Japan.
Recently, domestic social media has re -paid attention to the research by Gu Chaoming, the Institute of Institute of Obuya. The core theory of Gu Chaoming is to explain the 20 years that Japan lost in the decline of the balance sheet. Simply put, if the liabilities of the enterprise are too high, once the decline occurs, enterprises tend to repay debts, and the economy will face the lack of demand, which will lead to a simple decline evolution to a more serious long -term depression. I personally think that in a sense, the decline of the balance sheet can be regarded as a severe form of shrinking.
When I was in Japan, I met Gu Chaoming once. I had a long talk. The most impressive point is that he told me that China is the best candidate for the crisis of the balance sheet. For this reason, he is very worried and his expression is moving.
From the perspective of Japanese corporate asset -liability statements, explaining the sinking of the Japanese economy undoubtedly provided a good angle, and it also has a strong reference significance for the Chinese situation today. Of course, the behavior of the balance sheet itself is not the ultimate source of itself. The reduction of the return on investment behind it and the changes in the international political and economic pattern change are more valued. Compared to how to explain for two decades, what is important is how to get out. The difficulty is that no matter how close the economic explanation, it cannot avoid reforms, because economic difficulties are not only economical, but also politics, and even the combination of geopolitics. Vertical.
In a sense, the success or failure of an economy itself is the success of a subsystem in a complex system, not the success of a separate system. It depends directly on the surrounding geographical relationships, and sometimes it is even a zero -sum game game. For example, sometimes the loss of Japan is the gain of other countries, and sometimes the gain of Japan also means the loss of other countries.The sun falls, the sun rises again, and the Japanese economy will return, but who will leave the scene? ** Note: This article only represents the author's own point of view. Xu Jin is the author of the "Japanese trilogy", and it is also the "important economy" of the public account.
