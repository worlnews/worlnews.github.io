<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65666897/65003694"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-19T00-13-00Z/65003694_303.jpg" /></a>The US Congress and the state government have become increasingly alert to TIKTOK, and they are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The US Montana has completely disabled Tiktok through the bill, prompting 5 Tiktok users and creators to filed a lawsuit with the state court of the state in the state. implement.</p>
<p>Tiktok users believe that the state tries to "exercise the national security power that Montana does not have and prohibit the freedom of speech without the right to suppress the state." It has violated the basic rights guaranteed by the US constitution. Before the deadline, Austinknudsen, the chief prosecutor of Montana, had not responded to Reuters' comment request.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will be submitted to Democratic Judge Donald Mollay; Morro was nominated by the former Democratic President Billclinton in 1995 as a judge. Some Democrats are not tough for Tiktok.</p>
<p>On the 17th, a Tiktok spokesman Brookeoberwetter issued a statement saying that the bill was unconstitutional and "violated the freedom of speech of the people of Montana." She said, "We want to guarantee the people of Montana, and they can continue to use Tiktok to express ourselves, make a living, and join the community, because we continue to work hard to defend the rights of users inside and outside Montana."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-19T00-13-00Z/65096240_401.jpg" />In March of this year, the chief CEO of Tiktok went to the US Congress to testify, and the hearing president has been in the past 6 hours.</p>
<p>The first amendment to the US Constitution stipulates that no law formulated by Congress shall violate the basic human rights of citizens, which contains freedom of speech.</p>
<p>In 2020, the then US President Donaldtrump tried to stop downloading Tiktok and WeChat through the norms of the Ministry of Commerce, which was blocked by multiple courts and never took effect.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全盘禁止tiktok-美国民主党内有反对声音/a-65213817)It also supports American users to maintain the right to use Tiktok in order to exercise freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Greg Gianforte, governor of Montana, officially signed legislation on the 17th to prohibit Tiktok from operating in the state, saying that this move will further "protect the Mongolian Mongolian people's surveillance."</p>
<p>After the bill takes effect, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全面禁止tiktok美国蒙大拿州先行一步/a-65333928"></a>Essence Emily Flower, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of Montana, publicly stated on the 17th: "We expect to have legal challenges and have been fully prepared to defend the legal defense."</p>
<p>The ban stipulates that Tiktok will not be downloaded in Montana, which means that applications such as Google and Apple are not allowed to "illegally" to provide TIKTOK. Whenever someone uses TIKTOK, whether it is "providing the ability to use this application" or "download it", TIKTOK or App Store will touch the France, which will face a fine of up to $ 10,000 a day.</p>
<p>The bill is expected to take effect on January 1, 2024, and punishment will not apply to the user.</p>
<h3>Tiktok's ban is feasible?</h3>
<p>The Associated Press quoted an analysis of online security experts. This ban has no incentive measures except for the fines, and no incentive measures make relevant companies willing to comply with regulations, so "full law enforcement will be very difficult."</p>
<p>In addition, compared with China's control of citizens' access to the Internet, the United States does not have any similar means or tools. The decree also excludes online service providers.</p>
<p>A member of the members included a representative of Apple and Google's trade group TechNet that the Associated Press told the Associated Press that the application store was unable to "geographical fence" in specific applications in different states, so it was impossible to prevent Tiktok from being downloaded in Montana. The organization also said that the application itself should decide the running range, not an app store.</p>
<p>Odedvanunu, the product vulnerability director of the Internet Security Corporation, also believes that it is difficult for app stores to isolate the application download of a single country. He suggested that it is more feasible to comply with the rules by Tiktok, because the application itself has the right to "adjust the settings according to the user's geographical location or IP address."</p>
<h3>Disabast</h3>
<h3>American Stepping Tiktok</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体不断升级的tiktok之争/a-65171272"></a>They are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform and thus requires the application of the application nationwide. However, it is not easy to face many difficulties in Montana, a state of more than 1 million; it is not easy to expand the scope of the ban to more than 150 million TIKTOK users throughout the United States.</p>
<p>March this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/抖音执行长赴美国会作证前夕-专家怎么说/a-65078532"></a>The hearing president has been in the atmosphere for nearly 6 hours. Both members of the parliament questioned that the Tiktok's parent company Bytedance will enable the Chinese government to obtain user data or affect American users in the application.</p>
<p>In this regard, TIKTOK constantly denied that it had shared data with the Chinese government and said that if it was asked, the platform would not do so.</p>
<p>At present, TIKTOK is undergoing an initiative called "Projecttexas". It wants to create an independent entity to store data from American users on the US server and operate by American technology company Oracle.</p>

The former military capital Hiroshima has now become a symbol of peaceful cities in the minds of the Japanese</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) On the morning of May 19, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澤連斯基將現身廣島-親臨21日g7峰會/a-65673473"></a>The Prime Minister Kishida and Mrs. Yuzi stood in front of the Peace Memorial Park and welcome leaders from various countries. Kishida Wenxiong personally took the leaders of various countries to visit the museum. The various items displayed by the guide and explained, the time reached about 40 minutes. The leaders of various countries talked to the victims of the nuclear explosion and presented flowers in front of the monument.</p>
<p>This is also the first time that leaders of various countries have gathered a visit to the nuclear explosion museum. Bayeng became the second US president to visit the place after Obama. However, the difference is [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/历史性访问奥巴马为广岛献上花圈/a-19289744"></a>Only for about 10 minutes, only watching a few exhibits on the first floor of the lobby. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was Kishida, and he received Obama with the then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>
<p>Although Kishida was born in Tokyo, the family is a political family from Hiroshima. He will go back to visit relatives from the New Year since he was a child. He also understands many local history. Many relatives of the Kishida family died of nuclear explosion attacks. Although they were born in Tokyo, they were always natives of Hiroshima.</p>
<p>Kishida stretched out the "Nuclear Martial Arts World" at the peak of this summit, and was also a appeal to the current tension of the current international situation. Today's Hiroshima is a symbol of peace cities in the minds of the Japanese. However, before the end of World War II, Hiroshima was actually the center of the Japanese army's very important sea, land and air supply hub, and was known as the "military capital". The place where the hotel where the G7 summit is located is an important transport port.</p>

<h3>50 years ago, Hiroshima was a "military capital"</h3>
<p>Hiroshima's army starts, and it can be mentioned that it is during the Meiji Restoration period. In 1873, the Grand Japanese Empire set up six major town and Taiwan military camps. Hiroshima was one of them, and soon it was changed to the 5th Division Command. In the following 20 years, Japan's modern military power grew rapidly. During the Sino -Japanese Sino -Japanese War, Hiroshima became the dispatch base of the army at that time. The coalition forces fighting with the Daqingshui Division that year was sent from Yu Pinang.</p>
<p>Yuba Island is a small island on the south of Hiroshima. Because it is located in the Seto Inland Sea, the terrain is easy to defend and difficult to attack. The island's Urpot Port gradually became the focus of empire training at that time. The Japanese army only spent two weeks to build the railway to connect Yu Pin Island, and continued to transport troops to the Korean Peninsula, mainland China and other. The capital is full of first -level dignitaries.</p>
<p>Later, the military began to strengthen infrastructure across Hiroshima, and build military water supply and power systems to ensure the safety and stability of military strength. In the 1900 Boxer Chaos and the Japanese and Russian War in 1905, Hiroshima has become the main place for Japan to send troops. Manual driver.</p>
<p>As the September 18th incident occurred, the Sino -Japanese War broke out. Hiroshima's military role is becoming more and more important. In addition to Yupin in Hiroshima County, other places such as Wu Shi have also become important military ports and counties in the county.</p>
<p>In the end of World War II, Hiroshima carried out a large amount of evacuation, but at this time Hiroshima has become a military town that must be attacked in the eyes of the U.S. military. On August 6, 1945, the U.S. military voted at the atomic bomb. Hiroshima became the first nuclear explosion in human history. city ​​of.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-19T12-57-00Z/65675626_401.jpg" />The G7 leader came to Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park on the morning of May 19th. In the picture, they are participating in the tree planting ceremony</p>
<h3>From the time of the war, it became a natural attraction</h3>
<p>Facing the hometown of the hometown in the past, the atomic bomb was hit hard, and Kishida was not easy to feel deeply in his childhood, and he was resolutely opposed to nuclear weapons. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/自民党新总裁岸田文雄有哪些内政外交主张/a-59351403"></a>Essence When the outbreak of Russia and Ukraine and the use of Nuclear weapons, the fear of people's nuclear weapons emerged again.</p>
<p>After World War II, Yu Pin Island put aside the rich battlefield color in the past and gradually transformed into passenger use and ordinary fishing port. Residents have also approached 10,000 people to about 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Once, the former island, Aoki, who once lived in the local island, said in an interview with Japan's "Daily News" that he returned to Yu Pin's hometown after the nuclear explosion, and saw that the whole island had become a scorched earth. There were many burnt and painful pains nearby nearby. After the injured people, after waiting for their pain and dying, the living people pushed their bodies on the steel barrel and burned. The smell of smell so far still makes him unforgettable.</p>
<p>At that time, the Military Fortune Port, now the place where the G7 leaders shook hands, including the United States who dropped the atomic bomb that year. For Kishida Wenxiong, as well as Hiroshima, and even every Japanese, Hiroshima was attacked by nuclear bombs as like every generation. Most of the locations on the island now become parks and native forests. The island's viewing historical sites and natural plant walks have become the source of the current financial source.</p>
<p>However, now, the threat of military expansion of Russia's nuclear weapons and China's military expansion still allows the international situation at any time to move the whole body. At this time, again reviewing the journey of Hiroshima from the army to a peaceful city that year, maybe you can once again understand the idea of Kishida Vancouver resort to the "Nuclear Martial Arts World", because for many Hiroshima people, many memories are still vividly remembered.</p>

<p>In the past five years, hundreds of thousands of Uighurs have been sent to the re -education camp. At the same time, millions of Uighurs still have scattered Central Asian countries, and they are not controlled by the Communist Party of China.

Later, the relevant authorities also dissolved all Uyghur people. Cultural organizations. And in the past few years, even the innocent people will be tightly monitored by the authorities. In view of this, the "World Uyghur Conference" headquartered in Munich's "World Uyghur Conference" said in a statement.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T16-57-00-04-00/000000.png" />Abdulhakmu Idreis, director of Washington Uygur Research Center in the United States (middle), met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for RFA [] on April 19, 2023 in Kuala Lumpur.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jieduxinjiang/xinjiang-05192023100034.html/@@stream)Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, welcome you to interpret Xinjiang with me. Recently, a well -known Uighur activist calls on Malaysian Prime Minister Anwal Ibrahim to support Muslim ethnic minorities in the persecution of Xinjiang in northwestern China. Anwal Ibrahim expressed sympathy for the Uighurs in the conversation, but also called this as the "internal affairs" of China. In addition, the human rights organization claims that the Chinese authorities' telephone search plans in Xinjiang are targeted at Uighurs and other Turkic minorities. The Chinese police database also marked the queen scriptures as possible. It is understood that a research funded by the Chinese government suggested that the second capital in Xinjiang, the western part of the country, to re -balance the Chinese economy, solve racial tensions, and strengthen relations with Eurasian countries. In this episode, we will learn more about the situation together.</p>
<p>A well -known Uighur activist calls on Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to support Muslim ethnic minorities in the persecution of Xinjiang in northwestern China.</p>
<p>Abdulhakmu Idreis, director of the Uyghur Research Center of Washington, USA, met Anwar during the fasting party held in an Islamic center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Eid with a meal after the sunset during Muslims, which ended on April 20. Idris told Liberty Asia,</p>
<p>"We learned earlier that Malaysian Prime Minister Anwal Ibrahim would attend this Eid, so I prepared a letter to him, describing the current situation of the Uighurs."</p>
<p>Idreis said that in the rally, Anwar gave a speech saying that he would protect all oppressed Muslims all over the world and sympathize with the Uighurs. In 2018, Anwar asked the Chinese government to allow Uighurs to enjoy religious freedom and freedom of migration.</p>
<p>However, during the visit to China a few weeks ago, Ibrahim took a more loose attitude, saying that the Uyghur issue was "internal affairs of the Chinese government."</p>
<p>No one answered the phone call to the Malaysian Prime Minister's office afterwards.</p>
<p>Because of fear of anger China, many Muslims accounted for the majority of national governments did not publicly talk about the suppression of Uyghur people. Some countries have important trade and infrastructure projects with China under the "Belt and Road" initiative.</p>
<p>Idreis emphasized that the Uighurs were in a critical situation in Xinjiang and sought help from Premier Awars.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, Idrez gave Anwal a traditional Uyghur endless hats Doppa, as well as the letter and his book "threatened: China's colonization and Uyghur ethnic extinction to the Islamic world and the web ethnic group extinction ".</p>
<p>Erken Ekin Ekrem, deputy chairman of the World Uyghur Congress and Hacettepe, Hacettepe, said that as an experienced politician, Anwar is likely to be playing with coins - — On the one hand, deal with the Chinese government, and deal with the Uighurs on the other hand. Ik Rebu told Liberty Radio,</p>
<p>"He did not mention the Uyghur issue during his visit to China three weeks ago," Equest told Liberty Radio. "After expressing the desire to strengthen the relationship between the two countries, he returned to Malaysia."</p>
<p>"The words he conveyed to the Uyghur delegation was just a political strategy," he said. "If they do nothing, they will say,‘ we have no power. ’”</p>
<p>In addition, according to human rights observation of a report released in early May, the Xinjiang police relied on a list of multimedia documents containing 50,000 "violence and horror" to mark Uighurs and other Turkic Muslim residents for interrogation.</p>
<p>One of the results of this headquarters in New York is that the Uighurs only need to store the Gulan Scriptures on their mobile phones to cause police trial.</p>
<p>Human rights observation said in a statement that using this list is another example of China ’s“ abuse of monitoring technology in Xinjiang ”.</p>
<p>Human Rights Observation Asian Agency Director Wang Songlian(Virtual)It is said that the police use this list to compare the data of the two applications installed on mobile phones with the authorities requesting the residents of Urumqi, the authorities of Xinjiang. In an interview with Radio Free Asia, she said,</p>
<p>"In essence, these applications on people's mobile phones are checking this list -the main list -and search for other information."</p>
<p>In a statement in May, the organization stated: "Human rights observations are concerned about the way China cracks down on its so -called 'terrorism' and 'extremism' behaviors."</p>
<p>The definition of "Chinese anti -terrorism law on" terrorism "and" extremism "is too broad and blurred to sue, deprives freedom, and deprive freedom, and deprives of freedom or serious personal injury to the purpose of political, religious or ideological purposes. Other restrictions.</p>
<p>The main list of multimedia files is part of the large database of more than 1,600 data tables leaked to the online media "The Intercept" in 2019. The news agency reported that the Urumqi police monitored and arrested the police reported in the database from 2015 to 2019. Human rights observation states that the list of the organization's inspection is not reported or analyzed before the different parts of the same database.</p>
<p>Human rights observations also found that in the nine months from 2017 to 2018, Urumqi police conducted nearly 11 million search on 1.2 million mobile phones. Police searched the main list of more than 1,000 different files on the 1,000 mobile phones, and found a total of 11,000 matching.</p>
<p>The organization stated that the analysis of human rights observations found photos, audio and video files containing violent content, "there are other materials that have no obvious connection with violence", including common religious materials.</p>
<p>Human rights observation stated in its statement that the UN Human Rights Council should conduct investigations, and relevant governments should find out technology companies participating in telephone monitoring and take action to terminate their participation. Wang Songlian told Liberty Asia,</p>
<p>"I think what happened in Xinjiang is very important for the future of China, and how to use these systems for the government. What does they have to do with the general technology and human freedom in the world? This is why we have been working hard to put together these puzzles ","</p>
<p>It is understood that a research funded by the Chinese government suggested that the second capital in Xinjiang, the western part of the country, to re -balance the Chinese economy, solve racial tensions, and strengthen relations with Eurasian countries.</p>
<p>The report was published on April 21 in the Chinese journal "Xinjiang Social Sciences". It is recommended that the capital, which is specially built, is close to Kashgar in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Kashgar borders Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan.However, according to a report from the South China Morning Post, the study did not provide details of the central government's distribution functions between Beijing and the potential second capital.</p>
<p>Xinjiang has a vast desert and mountainous areas, living with more than 11 million Muslim Uighurs and other Turkic minorities. In recent years, they have been suppressed by the Chinese government, including "re -education" camp detention, torture and forced labor.</p>
<p>The study caused foreign experts and researchers in Xinjiang to question the possible motivation for the establishment of the second capital in the region and its impact on Uighurs and other ethnic minorities living there.</p>
<p>Elken Elkimu, deputy chairman of the World Uyghur Congress and associate professor of History at the University of Hastopa, Turkey, believes that the establishment of the second capital in Xinjiang will be related to China to become a world power by 2049. At that time, China will become the world's power. Essence The 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Ik Rebu told Liberty Asia,</p>
<p>"Uyghur region is important for China to dream. It is a gateway to Central Asia, West Asia, Turkey, and Europe. Therefore, the establishment of a second capital in Uighur is strategic significance to China."</p>
<p>Aike Rebu said, at the same time, the plan will create unfavorable conditions for the Uyghur people.</p>
<p>"To establish the second capital in East Turkestan, it is necessary to sinlate the region first."</p>
<p>Aike Timi uses the Uyghur's name to Xinjiang. He said that the vast territory lacks cultivated land and requires China to divert water to the area. This will need to reorganize more Han people. He said,</p>
<p>"These problems are not conducive to Uighurs, causing them to disappear due to integration."</p>
<p>Sean Roberts, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University(Sean Roberts)He wrote a large number of articles about the Chinese Uyghur and Central Asia, and he said that the move may have a dual purpose. He said,</p>
<p>"On the one hand, this may be to make the Northwest region more integrated into China. This is what China has been working hard since the 1990s. One of the motivations. "</p>
<p>On the other hand, Roberts said that the potential second capital will also be a defensive move. He pointed out,</p>
<p>"For a long time, the Chinese authorities have been worried that the Northwest region has been incorporated into the country more and placed under the jurisdiction of the country, because it is worried that it may become the root cause of unstable, and it may exacerbate due to external forces. This does not mean that the Chinese people Worried about the invasion of Central Asia or Russia, but they may worry that there are more unstable factors in Eurasia, and they hope to have a second capital nearby to ensure the security of China and make it not spread to China. "</p>
<p>Roberts also said that in the end, the plan was not a good sign for Uighurs.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion: misleading </strong></p>
<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>In mid -April, the U.S. Department of Justice sued 44 suspects on the grounds of "cross -border harassment", including police, officials, and two Chinese people who worked in the American company. The Chinese government's subsequent criticism of the United States was "cross -border suppression" and "based on fabricated allegations to exercise the jurisdiction of long -arm long -arm."</p>
<p>Asian facts check the laboratory after reading the lawsuit document, and found that the saying of "fabricating charges" is misleading. The US judicial department announced a large amount of evidence to support its allegations.</p>
<p>Chinese officials' remarks also confuse two different legal concepts: "long -arm jurisdiction" and "overseas jurisdiction". China ’s accusations for the United States to apply their laws to overseas. Although it is reasonable in some aspects, it has ignored the laws that China’ s recent promulgation and applicable laws that have recently promulgated and applicable. It is also disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis:</strong></p>
<p>On April 17, American officials were [] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/40-officers-china-s-national-police-charged-transnational-repression-schemes-targeting-us"></a>Essence One of the cases accused 34 Chinese police; 6 of the 10 defendants in the other case, 6 Chinese policemen, 2 online information office officials and 2 civil company staff. The U.S. Department of Justice has accused them harassing American residents who have criticized the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chinese Embassy of the United States, Liu Pengyu, then facing Reuters [] [] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-two-new-yorkers-with-conspiring-act-chinese-agents-statement-2023-04-17/"></a>"The United States exercises long -arm jurisdiction based on the crime of fabrication(Long -arm jurisdiction)Essence "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a press conference on April 21 [] <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/fyrbt_673021/jzhsl_673025/202304/t20230421_11063331.shtml"></a>"The United States' allegations are completely political, without facts and legal basis." The statement of Liu Pengyu and Wang Wenbin echoed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China earlier this year to criticize the United States <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230203_11019281.html"></a>Essence</p>
<p><strong> Is the US official evidence for the allegations of harassment? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. The United States has indeed made evidence for harassment. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-04/squad_912_-_23-mj-0334_redacted_complaint_signed.pdf"></a>It describes how 34 officials in the Ministry of Public Security of China harass 14 American residents. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-04/jin_-_20-mj-1103_redacted_amended_complaint_signed.pdf"></a>In the indictment, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-04/jin_-_20-mj-1103_redacted_amended_complaint_signed.pdf"></a>For the harassment of 10 other Chinese officials, a detailed record document was proposed. For the accused online harassment, these two indictments put forward pictures, citations, and internal communication of members of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.</p>
<p>For example, the indictment quotes a tweet that comes from a social media account. The purpose of establishing this account is to harass a victim.(Edit: Refers to this victim)Controlled by the media!"</p>
<p>On May 31, 2020, another comment published by the suspected harassment to commemorate the 1989 video conference on the protest of Tiananmen Square was: "The mother of all the families of the civil movement of the civil movement will die!"!"!"!Do you have no idea? How many soldiers did you kill at Tiananmen at that time, how many shots did you grab, and how many tanks were burned? "</p>
<p>The indictment mentioned that a suspect deleted the ZOOM account of 15 American residents because the 15 people suspected that the 15 people were related to a CCP critics living in the United States.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T19-08-00-04-00/000001.png" />Two Chinese were arrested in New York in the United States. They were charged with the "Overseas Police Department" in the United States, and the picture left was one of the suspects.(Reuters)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05192023180623.html/pic-1.jpeg"></a><strong> Does this case exercise the case of "long -arm jurisdiction"? </strong></p>
<p>Liu Pengyu criticized the United States to exercise "long -arm jurisdiction". However, the Asian Facts Investigation Center found that it was not "long -arm jurisdiction" in the United States. William Dodge of International Law Expert, University of California Davis(WilliamS.Dodge)The professor checked the laboratory to Asian facts that the so -called "long -arm jurisdiction"(Long -arm jurisdiction)It is not the concept of international law. In fact, the topic discussed here is the boundaries of criminal jurisdictions exercised in the US legal system.</p>
<p>In fact, in late April, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-individuals-arrested-operating-undeclared-police-station-chinese-government"></a>, They were charged with the "Overseas Police Department." The "Overseas Police Department." Strategic operation and media officials in the Office of Prosecutor's Office of the Eastern District of New York(Strategic Operations &amp; CommunicationsOfficer)Daniel Has(DanielleHass)In the interpretation of the Asian factual investigation of the laboratory, the case said: "People in the jurisdiction of the federal court have to exercise their jurisdictions; what is the nationality of the suspect, and do not ask."Song Chengen, director of the Taiwan Constitutional Foundation and an international law expert, stated to the Asian factual investigation laboratory: According to the above -mentioned U.S. officials, the basis of the American court in this case belongs to the "territorialism" of criminal jurisdiction. Within the court's jurisdiction, the court can cause criminal jurisdiction. In practice, this is the boundary of the criminal jurisdiction of a country. There are the same regulations in criminal law in many countries, including the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T19-08-00-04-00/000002.png" />Two suspects who have been charged in the "Overseas Police Department" in the United States appear in court in New York(Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05192023180623.html/pic-2.jpeg"></a><strong> What exactly is "long arm jurisdiction"? </strong></p>
<p>Song Chengen said that "long arm jurisdiction" is different from the above -mentioned "territorialism". The term "long arm jurisdiction", like Professor Daoqi interviewed, pointed out that it is the definition of the United States between the United States and the state. If the state legislative stipulates that the state has the right to manage the people in State B, it is legal to ask: What is the basis for the legislation of the state in this state? Is there any connection between the people in State B with the state?</p>
<p>To expand to international law, if the national law is authorized to authorize itself to manage the people or entities (such as companies), it is also legal to ask: What is the basis for country A's legislation? In China's discussions, this is also called "long -arm jurisdiction", but Song Chengen pointed out that in order to avoid confusion with the concept of US law, it should be called "Extraterritaljurism".</p>
<p>An example of advocating "overseas jurisdiction", for example, in the 1980s, the United States exported such technology to the Soviet Union in order to prevent the Soviet Union's military -sensitive technology from obtaining military -sensitive technology, and the legislation prohibited anyone located at any place. Or the legislation based on the famous "Meng Wanzhou Case", based on the US sanctions on Iran, prohibit any individual or company's transactions with Iran's entities.</p>
<p>Song Chengen pointed out that whether it is called "long -arm jurisdiction" or "overseas jurisdiction", the above legislative examples point to those who claim such jurisdictions, the boundaries of their jurisdictions, and the boundaries between criminal jurisdictions are jurisdiction in different scope of things.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T19-08-00-04-00/000003.png" />Meng Wanzhou, the current vice chairman of Huawei, was accused of violating the US government's sanctions on Iran by the U.S. government. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05192023180623.html/pic-3.jpeg"></a><strong> When Chinese officials criticize "long -arm jurisdiction", what really wants to criticize? </strong></p>
<p>What China really opposes is that the United States exercises criminal jurisdiction abroad.</p>
<p>Singapore International Law experts Zhengxin Huo and Man Yip are <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cjcl/article-abstract/9/3/328/6274891?redirectedFrom=fulltext"></a>In a article, it is pointed out: "The practice of long -arm jurisdictions that the Chinese government strongly condemns the US long -arm jurisdiction is especially referring to the United States unilaterally used its domestic laws overseas and imposed sanctions on foreign entities and citizens. Reasonable foundation or reason. "</p>
<p>It is not necessary to say that the United States is indeed based on its own interests and applies its laws to overseas examples. Recently, the suspect was detained in Guantanamo to escape judicial control, or illegally exposed the crime of secretly exposing the US secrets, the founder of the WikiLeaks, the founder of the WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. However, there is still a check -and -balance mechanism in the US system to ensure that the authorities will not prosecute any foreign people.</p>
<p>Professor Dodge pointed out: "Only in the case of explicit regulations in the criminal law that the charged crimes conform to the criminal law. It is clear that it is also applicable overseas, and the court usually only limits regulations in China. The court also applies a assumption that Congress does not intend to violate international law. Therefore, when the court explains the law (including the provisions of the criminal law) 'Instead of interpreting the regulations as a violation of international law, it is applied outside the territory. "</p>
<p>But does Chinese law also have the same situation of overseas applications?</p>
<p>There are also. Article 6 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The act of crime or the result occurred in the field of the People's Republic of China and believed that it was criminal in the field of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is misleading about the "no basis" of the US public security sector officials' allegations. AFCL believes that the U.S. judicial sector did submit a considerable evidence to the court to support its prosecution, not without evidence.</p>
<p>AFCL also found that Chinese diplomats criticized the United States to sue Chinese citizens as "long -arm jurisdiction", which is a misuse of legal concepts. The Chinese authorities actually commented that the United States exercises criminal jurisdiction over foreign citizens or entities. But in China's own laws, there are also applicable overseas regulations. It is equally disturbed by this expansion power.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese)) The highest railway bridge in the world is expected to be opened soon in Indian control Kashmir, connecting the remote Himalayas and the huge railway network in India.</p>
<p>The bridge is 359 meters high and 1315 meters long, spanning the Chenab River. The railway bridge cost $ 168 million, and it was 35 meters higher than the Eiffel Tower after completion.</p>
<p>This bridge is the Anghampur-Srinagar-Baramulla connection project of 272 kilometers long 272 kilometers long 272 kilometers long.(USBRL)Part of the construction started more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>This arch bridge across the Chenabu River is built in areas with frequent earthquakes, rugged terrain, and harsh climate conditions. However, engineers said that the strength of the bridge is enough to resist the magnitude 8 earthquake in Li's, and it is expected to have a life span of 120 years.</p>
<p>The Indian Prime Minister Modi, who personally supervised the project, praised the bridge to reflect "India's growth in modern engineering and technology."</p>
<p>The administrative Indian People's Party government also believes that this bridge is important to bring further development to the region.</p>
<p>The Indian Federal Railway Minister ASHWINIVAISHNAW claims that this is a strategic project. "Connecting Jammo and Kashmir through the railway is one of the most difficult project challenges in the world." He said, adding that the railway network leading to Kashmir will be completed later or early next year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-20T06-32-00Z/62824886_401.jpg" />The Indian Federal Railway Minister said that the railway network leading to Kashmir will be completed later or early next year</p>
<h3>"One of the most difficult projects in the world"</h3>
<p>An official who was unwilling to disclose the project told the Voice of Germany that the construction of the bridge between the villages between the southern part of Jammu used 28,000 tons of steel.</p>
<p>This railway line that mobilized thousands of construction workers and engineers to participate in the construction has missed several final deadlines.</p>
<p>"This is not an easy task. We have to fight against the harsh terrain." A engineer involved in the project and asked anonymous told Germany that "the entire area is very sensitive and belongs to the high earthquake belt."</p>
<p>According to the engineer, trial operation and speed testing is currently underway.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is Katra, which connects Jammo and Banhar in Lanban District, which is composed of Shenhe Canyon and rock terrain. Farewell to landslides and bad weather make it full of challenges. However, the completion of this railway construction will eventually connect the region to India's vast railway network.</p>
<h3>helps tourism and mobilize troops</h3>
<p>Muhammad Unis of Slinaga Travel Agency told Germany that the railway line would change the tourism industry in the region. He said: "This will reduce travel costs and make it easier for tourists to enter the area."</p>
<p>As one of the most militaryized areas in the world, this will also help India to mobilize troops and logistics to the region. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印度外长中印争议边境局势脆弱而危险/a-65034832"></a>Such troops and equipment mobs may bring major advantages.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>2000 kilometers border, 120,000 square kilometers dispute</h3>
<p>The total length of the China -India border is nearly 2,000 kilometers, and there are also 120,000 square kilometers of territorial disputes. The border with territorial disputes involves three parts: Western (600 kilometers), mid -section (450 kilometers), and eastern section (650 kilometers). In May 2020, there was a conflict (mid -section) in northern Sikkim; on June 16, a soldier conflict in the Palestin Valley (western section) of China and India caused dozens of casualties, at least the Indian side, at least India, at least India. It was said that 20 soldiers died.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>McMahon Line</h3>
<p>Markma Hong Line(Mcmahonline, the eastern section line)It is a border between British India and Tibet, which is drawn by a British adventureist to measure India. In 1914, the British diplomat McMahon convened the three -party meeting of Central, India, and Tibet. Because the Republic of China did not agree to divide the McMahon line in Tibet, and the Tibetan party failed to get an independent change in advance discussion, he also gave up the recognition of the McMa red line. As a result, Tibetan did not sign the "Simra Treaty". India and Myanmar believe that the McMahon line is a historical boundary. To this day, although the People's Republic of China refused to recognize the McMahon line, it regarded it as the actual control line. In the 1962 Battle of the China -India, although the Chinese army once occupied Darwon, the area, it was later withdrawn to the north of the actual control line.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>South Tibet (India: Arunechal)</h3>
<p>The southern Tibet is known as "Arunachalpradesh" in India, with an area of about 60,000 square kilometers and is located on the south side of the Himalayas. The west is Bhutan, Myanmar east is India, and the south is Tibet in China. China calls the south of Tibet and belongs to the administrative division of the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, according to the division of the "McMahon Line", the place belongs to India, and India also actually controls the place. However, the Tibetan side and the Republic of China refused to sign on the treaty. This route continues after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1948, India, which was just independent, began to send troops into this area. In 1960, India completely occupied the south of the wheat line, and China controlled north. In 1972, India established Arunechal's central area in the area. In 1987, the district was changed to "Arunecal Pradesh".</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>Britain occupied the Kim Kingdom in 1887 and sent troops to Tibet the following year. In 1950, India was called the protection of Sikkim after independence. In 2003, after the Indian Prime Minister Vajapa visited China, Beijing acknowledged New Delhi's sovereignty over Sikkim, and India also recognized China to Tibet sovereignty. After 2005, Sikkim is no longer marked as a sovereign state on the map published by China.#</p>

<h3>Battle of China and India in 1962: Indian Prime Minister Nehru defeated</h3>
<p>In April 1960, in order to seek resolution of territorial disputes, the Chinese and Indian governments were negotiated with Indian Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi by Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, but did not obtain consensus. The China -India border war broke out in 1962. When the Chinese army launched an offense at the same time from the east and west places on October 20 of that year, the military force was 5 to 10 times that of the Indian army. The Chinese army had been deeply deepened to India today's Arunachal and Himalayas. The entire war continued for a month, causing a total of 2,000 people to be killed. On November 20, 1962, China unilaterally announced a ceasefire and withdrew it to 20 kilometers after the McMahon line. After the war, China -India relations have entered a trough due to border conflicts.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>From December 19th to 23rd, 1988, Indian Prime Minister Ragov Gandhi conducted a formal visit to China and met with Deng Xiaoping. This is the first time that Indian Prime Minister has visited China in 34 years. This visit has been regarded as a sign of the warmth of the Sino -Indian relations after years of tension. In 1993, while Indian Prime Minister Narasimharao visited China, the two sides signed the "Agreement on Maintaining peace and peace in the actual control line of the China -India border." This interview marked a new era that Sino -Indian relations have opened. Since the 1990s, China and India have signed a total of 5 agreements on peaceful resolution of border conflicts.</p>

<h3>2017 Zhongyin Donglang area confrontation</h3>
<p>Doklam, which covers an area of about 100 square kilometers, is a controversial area between China and Bhutan, and India has never declared sovereignty to the place. In June 2017, India sent troops to cross the border between China and India on the grounds of "receiving help from the Bhutan government" and "supporting Bhutan sovereignty" to prevent China from building roads there and form a confrontation with the Chinese army for 71 days. Bhutan is the only country in China's 14 neighboring countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China, and its country's diplomatic power and defense power are in India. In 2014, Modi was Bhutan as the first visit to Prime Minister.</p>

<h3>concerns about visitors from other places</h3>
<p>Despite these benefits, some locals are worried about building the bridge. Local private school teacher Nisal(Maroofa Nisar)Tell the Voice of Germany: "We are worried that there will be more foreigners poured into this ecological fragile area."</p>
<p>Article 370, which gave the region's special constitution in 2019, and other measures adopted by the Indian People's Party Government, gave more rights to non -local people to start a business and purchase real estate -these rights were only permanent residents.</p>

<p>The US President Biden changed his position to allow Ukraine pilots to receive training from F-16 fighters, and plans to approve other countries to transfer the US-made F-16 fighters to Ukraine.</p>
<p>This is a great support for Kiev, which seeks to enhance air defense capabilities, and will significantly enhance Ukraine's combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Reuters and Bloomberg reported that at the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) summit held in Hiroshima, Japan on Friday (May 19), the decision told other G7 leaders.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that the F-16 fighter joint training plan will be launched within a few weeks and is carried out at European locations outside Ukraine. The fastest time for training and delivery of the F-16 fighter is 18 months.</p>
<p>One of the officials said: "The national alliance participating in this plan will decide when to provide a fighter, how many frames will be provided, and who will provide it."</p>
<p>Although the official did not explain which countries will participate, British Prime Minister Sunak said that Britain will cooperate with the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark to "let Ukraine get the air combat capabilities it needed."</p>
<p>Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands welcomed Biden's decision.</p>
<p>After the Danish Department of Defense announced the decision, it said that it had provided F-16 fighters for Ukraine pilots to be prepared for training. Denmark is one of NATO member states.</p>
<p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine, some US Congress has been urging the government to help Ukraine to strengthen air defense capabilities, including providing fighter and other forms of air support. <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230201-1358463"></a>It takes time to call Ukraine pilots and take a longer time.</p>
<p>The United States is also worried that providing F-16 fighters will occupy the Ukrainian military aid funds that have been allocated by Congress. Biden is also worried that providing F-16 fighters may be regarded as provocative or upgrade war.</p>

<p>He said, "We have come to see and ask," What do you need in Ukraine ... (in the future) to scare and resist Russia's invasion. "</p>
<p>"The F-16 is part of this multiple task. The first step will obviously carry out training, and then cooperate with allies, partners and Ukraines to decide what to do when the aircraft is actually provided, and keep pace with the times."</p>

The legislation will definitely not pass through the Democratic Senate.</p>
<p>After the White House and Republican representatives were interrupted for several hours, McCarthy said in an interview with Fox Business News Television: "We will resume negotiation tonight."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), Malaysian Chinese talk show Huang Jinyu (art name: Uncle Rogeroger) has recently been fully blocked by Chinese online social media including Weibo and B. The reason is that the UP owner, who is famous for its funny evaluation of food programs, previews a talk show program about June 4th, among which there are many irony and criticism of the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Huang Jinyu?</h3>
<p>Huang Jinyu was born in Malaysia. His parents are Chinese in Malaysia and are currently permanent in Britain. Special deliberately use Southeast Asian accent English to ridicule other food videos.

However, Huang Jinyu and his team learned that Chen Xing was a member of the Falun Gong organization. After a critical attitude towards the Chinese government, he deleted the related programs of the two on the entire network and apologized to the audience.</p>
<p>However, just on May 16, 2023, that is, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被指冒犯解放军-脱口秀演员被警方立案调查/a-65638312"></a>One day later.

All mobile phones are eavesdropping and are eavesdropping. The nephew's mobile phone is Huawei. listen!"</p>
<p>It can also be seen from the latest trailer that Huang Jinyu asked if there were audiences from Taiwan in the same live performance. Someone responded on the stage. He said: "(Taiwan) is not a real country. I hope that one day you can return to the arms of the mother of the motherland. A China!" In the show, Huang Jinyu claimed that "Uncle Roger would be banned after tonight." And hoping that the audience to write a report to the Communist Party, I would like to mention that Uncle Roger was a "good comrade".</p>
<h3>China: Fighting Uncle Roger in the whole network</h3>
<p>What happened later was in the expectations of Huang Jinyu. He has more than 400,000 fan bases' Weibo accounts and then blocked. The official information given by Weibo is: "The user is currently banned because of violations of relevant laws and regulations." His last public video Weibo date was locked on April 21. At the same time, Huang Jinyu also had more than 400,000 fans, and the B station account number B was also banned.</p>

House, a talk show actor, who performed in Beijing on the 13th, said that the scene of the two wild dogs chasing the pine of the two wild dogs that he adopted reminded him of 8 words "excellent style, can win the battle". This paragraph was accused of offending the PLA, and the Beijing Cultural and Tourism Bureau suspended all its performances in Beijing indefinitely. After that, the public security organs announced the investigation.</p>
<p>Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing, told Reuters on the ban on Li Haoshi by Li Haoshi: "The talk show comedy has always been the last fortress that people can still enjoy the public life and entertainment comments." After the actor is severely handled, "the space for talk show comedy and the public expression will inevitably continue to shrink."</p>

<h3>The death of a Kashmir separate person</h3>
<p>In July 2016, after a young separatist leader Burhanwani was killed, the security situation in the printed Kashmir region deteriorated. Since then, the protests against India and the conflict between the separatists and the security forces have killed hundreds of people.</p>

<h3>Anti -human rights</h3>
<p>After the video of India's security forces infringement of human rights, the Indian authorities banned Kashmir from many social media websites. One of the videos showed that a Kashmir protest was used as a human flesh shield by a military vehicle in India. The video caused a wave of anger in social media.</p>

<h3>Kashmir non -militaryization</h3>
<p>Support Kashmir independence hopes that Pakistan and India can make the Kashmiers decide their own future.

<h3></h3>
<p>But most Kashmir problems believe that this will not happen in the near future. They said that although India strictly implemented a strategy aimed at Kashmir's militants and separatists, and partial results were partially achieved, sooner or later, New Delhi needed to find a political solution to this crisis. They said that Kashmir wanted to separate and had no chance.</p>

<p>Description: Hiroshima G7 Summit entered May 20, and Ukrainian President Zelei arrived in Hiroshima on this afternoon and set off a wave in Japan. Zelegiski, who was originally expected to attend the online meeting, suddenly changed its schedule — the action seemed to be sudden. In fact, there were many background considerations and planning.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) At about 3:30 pm on May 20, Japan time, there was a sudden restless venue at the G7 Media Center in Hiroshima. Various Japanese and international media have gathered in front of the big screen and watching immediately. Many people shouted, "Zelei is here!" Various media picked up mobile phones and cameras to shoot.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Zelezzky stepped out of the cabin with a brisk step at about 3:45, quickly settled down the ladder of the machine and took the official rotor arranged by the Japanese officially. The National Highway on the road is closed and several helicopters are monitored at high altitude. Zelenezki's team enters the G7 main venue located on the south of Hiroshima at about 4:40.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-20T11-42-00Z/65685138_401.jpeg" />When Zelei arrived in Hiroshima, various reporters in the media center picked up mobile phones and cameras to shoot</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澤連斯基將現身廣島-親臨21日g7峰會/a-65673473"></a>Essence In addition to the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong, the US President Biden, and the leaders of various countries discussing against Russia with the host country, it is expected that he will also visit the Peace Memorial Park and personally feel the journey of the nuclear explosion of Hiroshima.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/岸田突訪烏-澤倫斯基讚國際秩序捍衛者/a-65073082"></a>However, although Kanada was invited at the time, it was still on the premise of online participation. This time, it was possible to visit Japan in less than 24 hours. But instead of Lightning Visit Japan, there are still G7 countries behind the countertops.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-20T11-42-00Z/65071248_401.jpg" />Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kishida visited Ukraine on March 21 this year to express support for Kiev with action.</p>
<h3>constant negotiation under the table</h3>
<p>Since Russia has waved in Ukraine at the end of February 2022, Ukraine has still been occupied by about 20 % of the land. Among them, the original Russian offensive was fierce, and even the capital Kiev had almost suffered a crisis of occupation. However, after autumn, the weather gradually turned cold, [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄乌战况俄预备役官兵呼吁普京关心军人疾苦/a-64960318"></a>In December of this year, Zeelianzki launched a diplomatic schedule for more than 300 days after Ukraine was invaded, and went to the United States to talk to President Biden. Later, with the stability of the new crown epidemic and the battlefield of Russia, the battlefield of Russia fell into a deadlock. From February 2023, Zelei has visited France, Britain, Belgium and other countries. It visited Finland, the Netherlands, etc., and directly appealed to fight against Russia.</p>
<p>From the side, Russia was still strong and strong at this time at this time. If Zelei was good at leaving his duties, he was likely to be strongly attacked by Russia. Therefore, he attended the G7 in Germany at that time. He only attended online. However, after a year, Russia is in trouble, both military power or supplies, and the front line is insufficient. This also made Ukraine officials boldly make a decision to go to Asia to attend the G7 summit at this time.</p>
<p>However, in order to ensure that the news is out of flow, Zelei Sky's visit to Japan is only controlled by several high -level Japanese. Even when the Voice of Germany asked the senior officials of the Japanese side on the 19th, the other party only said that "the Japanese government has not officially published this", and it was not until the morning of the 20th that they officially visited Japan. Even before the Japanese media lived on the plane on the live broadcast of Hiroshima on the spot, the title was "President Zellezki suspected of arriving", and he would not say to death.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-20T11-42-00Z/65684377_401.jpg" />From the airport to Zediski from the G7 venue, the Japanese government dispatched a large number of manpower maintenance and safety.</p>
<h3>Show the war "Development"</h3>
<p>According to Japanese media reports, on the 19th, when the Japanese police high -level officials learned that "Zelezki might come", he discussed how to conduct further police strengthening. Originally, the official explanation of the Summit's police forces was 24,000 people, and the police forces of almost counties and cities came to support, but Zerrenzki was the leader of the "war parties". The warning of the Ukraine Embassy in Tokyo has been fully strengthened.</p>
<p>According to Japan's "Fuji TV", the original Zelei Sky is expected to visit Hiroshima on the first day of the summit. However, Zellenzki's schedule is not fixed. The original expected itinerary also temporarily changed to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Arab League summit, and then came to Hiroshima with a low -key aircraft through a series of French official arrangements.</p>
<p>The last time Zelezki was in Japan in 2019, he participated in the ascending ceremony of the Emperor. However, this time, it is already the leader of the war country. For Ukraine, which is changing in the war, the appearance of Zellezky is undoubtedly a strong needle for the Western Free Democratic camp. At this moment, the Prime Minister Kishida from Hiroshima Kishida also came to a new wave of peaks in politics.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-20T11-42-00Z/65675615_401.jpg" />The leaders of G7 member states went to Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park to pay tribute to the victims in 1945</p>

Zelekiski's schedule seemed to be erratic, but to some extent, it also showed the dynamics of random response to leaders in the troubled times. From the original online participation, to the last moment, it was only before the G7 main stage, and through this way, Zelei said to the world that the Ukrainian regime's sense of stability and confidence were confident.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-20T12-27-20-04-00/000000.png" />China -Central Asia Summit will be held in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province since May 19, 2023 <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/2-05202023122331.html/@@images/image"></a>Reuters pictures</p>
<p>According to the French media reports on the 20th, the China-Central Asian Summit rushed to be held one day before the Western Seven Group Summit. From the welcome scale, it was very luxurious. Essence</p>
<p>It is reported that Beijing has done an article. Xi Jinping welcomes the heads of East Asia in Xi'an, which symbolizes the beginning of the ancient Silk Road, and holds the traditional welcome ceremony of the "Tang Dynasty" in the Furong Garden of the Tang Dynasty in Xi'an. Xi Jinping is on a huge round table with the equivalent Kazakh President Toccyev, Gilgisstan President Zaparov, Tajikistan President Rachmond, Turkmenistan President Beldemamedorf, Uzbekistan Stan President Mirchiyev met, like the guests who were worshiped by ancient emperors to worship.</p>
<p>Compared with this, in Hiroshima, neighbors in China, the head of the G7 Group, as always, crowded with a much more small table to negotiate, and the atmosphere seemed close.</p>
<p>Many netizens on Twitter compared two photos together. Where is the difference? Opinions are different: "The difference between developed countries and developing countries is big", "dictatorship countries and democratic countries", "do not admit that they are developed countries, who bluffs, sprinkle so much money." "20.4%of urban youths Unemployed, true or false? "</p>
<p>The scene of the Central Asian Summit ’s banquet is also extremely luxurious: a screenshot entitled“ Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan held a welcome ceremony and a welcome banquet for the leaders and wives of the five Central Asian countries ”. The "court guard" with the word "Tang". Red Palace, red lantern, red chair, carved beams and paintings, Qionglou Yuyu ... Someone asked, did Afang Palace have such luxury and gas?</p>
<p>The Chinese official media highly appreciated the atmosphere of the meeting. The Global Times also compared the Central Asian Summit and the G7 Summit. Multilateralism, the geopolitics discharged by G7 in Hiroshima and sewage in small circles are how clear the contrast is.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping's choice of opening such in Xi'an will attract international media's attention. French Fergaro said that Xi'an has once again become a place where Eurasia's ambitions serving Xi Jinping are out of place. The starting point of this former imperial capital, the starting point of the Silk Road, and the first summit between the Chinese President of China and the five republics from the five Republics of the Central Asia, which was once the Russian backyard, which was once Putin.</p>
<p>The newspaper stated that the world's second largest country is promoting chess pieces on the west side of it, seeking strategic depth at the moment of "American blocking", competing with the previous scope of the Russian brother, and does not care about the sensitivity of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>The New York Times said in an article "Holding the Central Asian Summit with the G7 -point court, China held the Central Asian Summit", in 2013, Xi Jinping chose Kazakhstan as a speech place, where to outline the vision of the "Belt and Road" initiative. This is a $ 1 trillion worth of US dollars worth $ 1 trillion The plan is to build infrastructure projects in developing countries in order to incorporate them into China. Nevertheless, this relationship is not always smooth. Several "Belt and Road" projects in the region have been stagnant or involved in scandals.</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens have directly criticized the "Belt and Road" as the "big coin project", but Xi Jinping did not think so. After three years of Qingli, Xi Jinping's China is going to dispatch. Agence France -Presse reports that Xi Jinping must expand the scope of the influence of Central Asia through the "big development plan". Xi Jinping decided to provide 26 billion yuan in financial support to Central Asian countries.</p>
<p>The gratitude of the five heads of Central Asia is essential. It is unclear what they said, but the tone and style of the head of the Central Asian five countries are very similar to the People's Daily.</p>
<p>And more than a dozen countries have collapsed due to their background in Chinese debt. A report of the Associated Press pointed out that China's loans have pushed the economy of more than a dozen poor countries in the world to collapse, including Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, Laos and Mongolia. Although these poor countries are responsible for heavy debt, China is unwilling to avoid loans.</p>

Among them, the "most urgent situation" occurred in the northern Ralaima, and the area of forest felling increased by 73%year -on -year.</p>
<p>Amazon Institute of Humans and Environment, Amalin said that from a historical point of view, the cutting area of forests in the Amazon region often increases after summer, so it is necessary to perform emergency inspections, identification, and punishment for illegal lipped people in the most stressful regions.</p>
<p>Researchers Biaca Santos warned that the current pressure of agricultural expansion is very great, and measures such as emergency inspections should be taken to avoid re -raising behavior.</p>

<p>According to the British Economist Magazine, the Starlink system of Billionaire Musk caught Russia's invasion of Ukraine. China is worried that if Taiwan obtains the star chain system service, it will greatly increase the difficulty of the PLA to attack Taiwan.</p>
<p>After Russia launched a comprehensive invasion last year, Ukraine obtained the star chain system service. The star chain system is very important for the war in Ukraine, and this system is also difficult to interfere with.</p>
<p>From the perspective of China, the Star Chain system not only puts Chinese friends in Russia into disadvantages, but also causes anxiety.</p>
<p>However, China ’s concerns are not only here. China is also worried that the United States has greatly occupied low -orbital space through the star chain system, and China also wants to become the power in this field and wants to obtain the ability provided by systems such as star chain. Therefore, it is developing its own version. Essence</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that if China invades Taiwan, it may first cut off 14 underwater network cables that make Taiwan connect with the world. Taiwan is increasing the number of cables and plans to defend the landing point.</p>
<p>Taiwan is also testing antennas at 700 locations, and some are deployed outside Taiwan. These antennas will be available through the low -orbital satellite signal used by the star chain system.</p>
<p>China may be more expected to let SpaceX founder Elonmusk refuse to provide Taiwan Star Chain System Services, because after all, Musk's other company Tesla has a large factory in Shanghai.</p>
<p>But Taiwan is also reducing dependence on the outside world. The National Space Center in Taiwan is developing a self -made low -orbital communication satellite and strive to take off in 2025.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-20T16-45-00-04-00/000000.png" />In April, China's exports and bilateral trade volumes on North Korea have increased significantly <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/9-05202023162312.html/@@images/image"></a>Reuters pictures</p>
<p>According to the number released by Chinese Customs on Saturday, in April, China's exports and bilateral trade over North Korea increased significantly. The Seventh Kingdom of Industry urged Pyongyang to stop missile testing and nuclear tests, and warned that North Korea will never enjoy the status of "nuclear countries" stipulated by international law.</p>
<p>The China Customs General Administration reported that the total outbound goods from China in April soared by 69%to US $ 166 million. The most exported products are wool used in wig and wig production, with a amount of about 11.6 million US dollars. The products after wigs are a wide range of fertilizer phosphate dilate, with a total amount of 8.84 million US dollars.</p>
<p>In April, North Korea also purchased rice with a total amount of about 5 million US dollars from China. From January to April, China exported North Korea from $ 270 million a year ago to $ 603 million.</p>
<p>The new data released by the General Administration of Customs also shows that in April, North Korea's exports to China also rose significantly, reaching the highest point in the past five years.

In mid-April this year, North Korea conducted a test firing of the solid-state fuel intercontinental ballistic missile "Mars-18". The U.S. military believes that North Korea's missile launch capacity has improved significantly, and it has developed from a short -range ballistic missile in liquid fuel to long -range fuel remote missiles.</p>
<p>General Kennethwilsbach, commander of the Pacific Air Force, recently told the media that in response to this major change, the U.S. military may send strategic bombers to regularly go to the Korean Peninsula to perform tasks and may land at the US military base in South Korea.</p>
<p>After the Seven Kingdoms Group issued a joint statement after the Hiroshima Summit, it urged North Korea to completely abandon its missiles and nuclear weapons projects, and promised "no more use of ballistic missile technology for nuclear tests or nuclear testing." The statement said, "North Korea cannot, and it will never never, and it will never. There are nuclear status stipulated in the International Nuclear Treaty. "</p>

<p>The World Health Statistics report released by the World Health Organization pointed out that the progress of key health indicators in recent years has stagnated, and the report also reminds people to pay attention to the increasingly serious threat of non -infectious diseases and climate change.</p>
<p>The report released by the World Health Organization on Friday (May 19) has emphasized that as of 2022, compared with the trend from 2000 to 2015, the progress of key health indicators in recent years has stagnated. The report calls on countries to coordinate and strengthen response measures.</p>
<p>The United Nations News Center reported that the report records the latest data of the crown disease epidemic on global health. These losses have led to the continuous decline in the progress of sustainable development goals. From 2020 to 2021, crown diseases have caused 336.8 billion years of life losses worldwide, which is equivalent to a 22 -year life of a person's average loss per person.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the number of mothers and children has decreased by one -third and one -half, respectively. The incidence of infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria also decreased, and the risk of premature death due to non -infectious diseases and injuries was also reduced. These progress has increased the life expectancy worldwide from 67 in 2000 to 73 in 2019.</p>
<p>The Director -General of the WHO Tan Desai said: "The report issued severe information about the threat of non -infectious diseases. These diseases have caused huge and increasingly serious losses to life, livelihood, health systems, communities, economy and society. The report calls on countries to greatly increase investment in health and health systems in order to return to the orbit of achieving sustainable development goals. "</p>
<p>Data show that although the overall health status has improved, the percentage of deaths caused by non -infectious diseases each year has been increasing. At present, nearly three -quarters of people who die due to diseases are caused by non -infectious diseases.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, it is expected that in the middle of this century, non -infectious diseases will account for about 86%of the annual number of deaths, that is, 77 million deaths will be attributed to non -infectious diseases. Since 2019, absolute numbers have increased by nearly 90%.</p>
<p>Although the health risks of smoking, drinking, violence, unsafe water and sanitary facilities, and children's development are reduced, the progress is still insufficient, and the risks of air pollution and other issues are still high. The prevalence of rising obesity shows no signs of reversal.</p>
