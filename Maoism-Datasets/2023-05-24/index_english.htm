<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-23T-38-01-00-04-00/000000.png" />Police in many places in China have issued a notice asking parents and teachers to check whether the children's mobile phones are installed in overseas communication software such as Telegram and Twitter. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/hx1-05232023092839.html/@@images/image"></a>Screenshots of the network <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/hx1-05232023092839.html/@@stream"></a>Recently, the police in many places in China issued a notice asking parents and teachers to check whether the child's mobile phone installed overseas communication software. Some comments believe that the authorities are suspected of preventing the tide similar to white paper sports on the eve of June 4th.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-05212023113915.html"><strong> Children's mobile phones can not install "telegraphs" in many places in China to request for parents </strong></a>According to Chinese media reports, the Public Security Bureau has recently issued an announcement saying that the suspects of overseas telecommunications network fraud have recently used "paper aircraft (Telegram)", "WhatsApp", "Seagull Twitter) "," Too Mida "and other overseas mobile phone chat software to induce minors to engage in telecommunications network fraud and help crimes. The announcement stated that teachers and parents need to check whether the child's mobile phone is installed with such software. Your child may be assisted by overseas scammers to engage in illegal crimes. "</p>
<p>Police announcement also said: "If you find that the child has been installed, pay attention to the harm, and take the child to the recent public security organs to find out whether the child is engaged in illegal crimes." The guardians of higher vocational students), do not wait for the child to crimes in violation of the law, affect the future and regret it. "</p>

(Internet screenshot) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/hx1-05232023092839.html/4e00.jpg"></a><strong> Experts criticize infringement and suspects that the front of June 4th to prevent the formation of white paper sports academic tide </strong></p>
<p>Society legal person Taiwan Youth Rights and Welfare Promotion Alliance Deputy Secretary -General Lin Yu Sheng accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and pointed out: "The principle of violation of the proportion is like buying a kitchen knife. To what extent, they are not assured of encrypted communication software alone. Whether it will be in the sixth or fourth, students are the conscience of national society. Will they feel that students and student ethnic groups will get something that they want to cover up the truth. They are not assured? Because they are afraid of the people know the truth. "</p>
<p>Lin Yusheng emphasized that the installation software itself is not committed to the law, and requires force to bring them to the police station to infringe on personal freedom and privacy, and also violate the country's principles of law. The Convention on the UN Children's Rights stipulates that there must be a clear fact that criminal facts must take forced measures to adopt adolescents. Standing on the position of protecting and respecting privacy, parents cannot even peek at their children's diary, and the Chinese government has become a habit of infringing citizens' privacy.</p>
<p><strong> An expert of the security security: China ’s network management is incompetent to ask for parents and teachers to check children mobile phones </strong></p>
<p>Taiwanese security worker Wu Yiting accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty: "China does this, which in turn does not end up with these software, which means that their online monitoring layers have no way to catch the side and keyword filtering of these software. It can only be done from the most native and most original way; it also shows that the Chinese network management is incompetent, so that parents and teachers will help solve this. China has more parents or more police? Chinese police are not OK to use these softwares for parents. Call the child to delete it, and he will do what the government told him to do it in the future. "</p>
<p>Wu Yiting asked, from the perspective of "prevention of crime", many scams in China were carried out on WeChat and QQ. Why did not see the authorities check on domestic software?</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia recently disclosed that Skype hit all over China to present the "signal too weak" problem. Wu Yiting said that these are all Chinese authorities intentionally intercepting overseas information, and the ultimate goal is to consolidate the regional network with national characteristics.</p>
<p>Wu Yiting pointed out that the Chinese authorities also warned the public that the public could not use these software. It was reported that some software that could communicate in China in China could not be prohibited. Among some well -known cases such as "Programming and Thinking" sentenced to seven years in prison for inciting charges, they were used to use overseas software, and the mobile phone was deducted and cleared when the arrest was arrested. When white paper moves, many resistances use Telegram and Twitter to spread videos and pictures to the outside world.</p>
<p>** Parents: Advocating each other is like the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>Ren Ruiting, who fled China, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that children would also use overseas software with adults, and she used WhatsApp, Telegram, and other software that the CCP could not reach. Overseas democratic people, such as Wang Dan, will build groups to release information activities such as June 4th, democratic constitutional government, and embrace freedom; many netizens mentioned that they have realized that the Communist Party is so bad to contact Twitter. The Chinese Communist Party uses relatives to report each other and grabs all places where the network supervision cannot be regulated, completely separated.</p>
<p>Ren Ruiting criticized the authorities to advocate the social atmosphere of mutual reporting as each other: "The most terrible thing is that parents and teachers are going to check their children's mobile phones. Parents can not give their mobile phones, but they will not give their mobile phones. Destroy the trust between parents and children. Today, the parents can take it to the police station. In a few days, the child can peek at his parents' mobile phones and sue his parents. "</p>
<p>Ren Ruting found that Telegram had a lot of stolen numbers. "It is not sure if it was a malicious attack on the Communist Party. Many groups were stolen and friends were almost lost. If you are doing it, it is possible that someone may deliberately teach students how to stole numbers and give you how much money to help overseas fraud, and then warn parents and teachers to investigate students' mobile phones to grab crimes.</p>

<p>In the middle of this month, a Chinese talk show caused a sensation in public opinion. Netizens uploaded the performance video clip of House, a talk show actor of the Guo Culture on May 13, showing that Li Haoshi ridiculed in the performance. He picked up two wild dogs from the mountain. When he saw the wild dog chasing pine squirrels, " I just want to say eight characters in my heart: excellent style, can win the battle. "</p>

Some netizens believe that "this is an insult to the people of the people's children" and "this manuscript is not appropriate, and it can be joked with nothing."</p>
<p>As soon as the incident came out, although Li Haoshi and Xiao Guo culture issued an apology statement for the first time, it still attracted a number of official media. On the afternoon of the 16th, Xinhua News Agency's Weibo official number posted: "'Listening to the party's command, can win the battle, and excellent style', each word cannot be offended!" The People's Daily also released a comment on the same day, "One -sided pursuit of laughter fruit and At the expense of stepping on the line, you caught up with a misunderstanding. "</p>
<p>With the fermentation of public opinion in the past few days, Li Haoshi and the smiling fruit culture company belonged to the relevant departments by Chinese netizens. The Beijing and Shanghai Cultural Tourism departments immediately involved in the investigation, and the police quickly followed up.</p>
<p>Wang Juntao, a Chinese political scholar in the United States, said in an interview with this station that reporting itself is not a problem, and Western democratic countries also generally have a "whistle" system. However, in China, whether the punishment mechanism after reporting can follow laws and regulations is the focus.</p>
<p>"I think the report is not a problem. The main problem is persecution. In the rule of law society, all reporting materials must be disclosed in the procedure and approved.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-23T16-05-00-04-00/000002.png" />On May 17, 2023, the notice of canceling the performance of Xiaoguo Company was canceled outside a theater of Shanghai. (Agencelet) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/jw-05232023101542.html/afp.jpeg"></a>After the official shot, the former editor -in -chief of the party media "Global Times", Hu Xijin posted on Weibo, supporting Xiao Guo culture.

Later, Hu Xi changed his stance to change his tone to support the punishment of laughing fruit culture. He also said that "the bottom line will pay a heavy price!"</p>
<p>Hu Ping, editor -in -chief of the honorary editor -in -chief of overseas political journals living in New York, USA, told the station that the authorities were strictly, fast, and re -handled the reports of Li Haoshi and Swordsman culture, and released a dangerous signal in China today.</p>
<p>"This incident is a very dangerous signal, that is, the authorities must strengthen the text prison and strengthen the crime of language. Using the so -called masses to disclose, it will cause a wider fear effect. This is no stranger to us as the person in the Cultural Revolution." He said, "Things have now reached this step, in this sense, it is completely the deadly repetition of the practice of the Cultural Revolution."</p>
<p>However, Hu Ping believes that the political high pressure of the Cultural Revolution for ten years directly caused the liberation of ideological liberation in the later system, which is currently concerned by Xi Jinping authorities. He said: "Now Xi Jinping is going to re -engage in this set, it will definitely evoke many painful memories of the humanities revolution, and many people will resist this approach."</p>

<p>Under political high pressure, the reporting behavior seems to be the sequelae since the establishment of the Communist Party of China. During the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, the incidents of their children and couples that caused their deaths to cause their families to be broken. Under the harsh political oppression, everyone has become an eternal trauma for a generation since everyone is in danger.</p>
<p>China ’s official Media’ s Daily Online has reproduced an interview report from the Beijing News, telling that a Red Guard in the Cultural Revolution reported his mother and was shot after being shot.</p>
<p>In this report, Zhang Hongbing, who has become a lawyer of Beijing Bosheng Law Firm, tells his wishes. In 1970, Zhang Hongbing's mother, Fang Zhongmou, said at home with some remarks that supported Liu Shaoqi and criticized Mao Zedong, and was reported by Zhang Hongbing. Fang Zhongmou's remarks were characterized as "anti -revolutionary" and were shot dead two months later. In 1980, the case of Fang Zhongmou was rehabilitated. At that time, the court ruled that "the killing was unjust, and Zhao Xue should be given."</p>
<p>Zhang Hongbing said, "At that time, everyone was wrapped in a kind of atmosphere, and they couldn't run. The kindness, beauty in my human nature was completely and irreparable." It was tortured by the inner pain and applied to the relevant departments since 2011. I hope that the mothers' cemeteries are cultural relics, but they have not been successful.</p>
<p>Zhang Hongbing emphasized that the disclosure of the painful experience was to hope that people remember the cruelty of the history.</p>
<p>Chen Chuangchuang, the executive chief of the Chinese Democratic Party Committee and a lawyer in New York, pointed out that China's reporting phenomenon did not begin with the Cultural Revolution, but the Cultural Revolution was the most prosperous.</p>
<p>"Reporting this atmosphere, environment, habits, or even culture, is not just to have the Cultural Revolution. This does not allow you to be peaceful in any private small environment. In the performance of the entire political system, loyalty is the most important. This loyalty is just a personal loyalty to Xi Jinping. In the past few years, Xi Jinping is very concerned about improving the image of the soldiers. In fact, he just wants the army to play Taiwan for him. It becomes more sensitive. "</p>
<p>Chen Chuangchuang believes that, in view of the Chinese public opinion environment under Xi Jinping, the results of the "laughter incident" are not optimistic, and Li Haoshi himself may also face unreamulated persecution.</p>

<p>Yonhap News Agency reported that Zhao Taiyong put forward the above views on a program of Yonhap News Agency's TV on Tuesday (May 23). He said that if the DPRK launch a reconnaissance satellite, South Korea will "further strive to make North Korea more isolated from international diplomacy, and the same countries with the same position adopt unilateral sanctions and call on the international community to implement sanctions on North Korea."</p>
<p>He emphasized that it is more important to make North Korea clearly realize that he can no longer have a sense of existence in the international community with acts such as stars and nuclear tests, nor can he obtain economic benefits.</p>
<p>Zhao Taiyong said that North Korean leader Kim Jong -un claimed that he would launch a reconnaissance satellite before the end of April, but it has not yet been implemented, and the North Korean side seems to have encountered various problems.</p>

<p>The draft proposal seen by Reuters on Tuesday (May 23) suggests that countries with more "capabilities and resources" should bear the "corresponding" responsibility for preparation and response to global health threats.</p>
<p>This treaty negotiated by the WHO member states is a legal constraint agreement to solve the "catastrophic failure" of the international community's popularity against crown diseases around the world.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the crown disease, there are more than 750 million infected cases in the world, and there are about 7 million cumulative death cases. The 42 -page document aims to help the world do better when dealing with the next epidemic disease. Member states can choose to delete many paragraphs in future negotiations, including paragraphs about responsibility.</p>
<p>In the early draft, the controversial part, including the intellectual property rights and the preservation of 20%of the testing, treatment and vaccine, for the WTO to distribute to the poor countries in the emergency situation and still retain the new draft, but It may still be deleted.</p>
<p>This document also defines "big popularity" as "a global spread of a pathogen or variant", which is not only easy to spread, but also dangerous. It can cause the health system to be overwhelmed and require international coordination. This treaty will be completed in 2024.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Chinese Embassy in the United States announced on Wednesday (May 23) that the current deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Xie Feng served as the 12th ambassador to the United States in China and has arrived in the United States. Xie Feng told the media at New York Airport that she came to enhance the exchange and cooperation between China and the United States and to defend the interests of China.</p>
<p>Xie Feng admits, "At present, Sino -US relations have suffered serious difficulties and are facing severe challenges." The three principles of "mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation" proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping are the root causes of China and the United States in the new period.

<h3>Who is Xie Feng?</h3>
<p>Xie Feng, 59, is regarded as "American". According to public information, he graduated from the Chinese School of Foreign Affairs and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the 1980s. He was fluent in English and familiar with the work of the United States. He used to be a counselor and spokesman in the United States, the Minister of the United States, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>In 2017, Xie Feng served as a special commissioner in Hong Kong, during which the anti -repair movement broke out in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong "Sing Tao Daily", which is pro -built by the position, stated that Xie Feng criticized "street violence" at that time, such as virus raging, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong was appreciated by high -level appreciation for "daring to fight." In 2021, Xie Feng was transferred to the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, and he was in charge of the US affairs.</p>
<p>US State Department spokesman Matthewmiller said the United States welcomes Xie Feng and looks forward to cooperating with him. He reiterated: "As we said on many occasions, we are still committed to maintaining communication channels with the People's Republic of China to manage competition responsible."</p>
<h3>"War Wolf" or the problem solveor?</h3>
<p>In January of this year, Qin Gang, the former Chinese ambassador to the United States, left his office and returned to China as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since then, Sino -US relations have deteriorated. The shortage of the job for more than 4 months is the longest since the normalization of Sino -US relations in 1979.</p>
<p>Xie Feng, an experienced diplomat with rich experience in the United States, has been appointed as the Chinese Embassy in the United States. It is regarded as a signal that Beijing may intend to thaw relationship with the United States. Reuters pointed out that for a long time, the Chinese ambassador to the United States has a long vacancy, and now it is finally sending people to a new one, which may help Beijing to fight back on the criticism of its ignorance of the Biden government calling for strengthening contact.</p>
<p>Bonnieglaser, an expert at the Marshall Foundation in the United States, told Reuters that China "finally decided to send Xie Feng, partly because of the to prevent spiral deterioration of bilateral relations." She said that as an experienced diplomat, Xie Feng was very familiar with American decision makers. If he is willing to promote better communication between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal also believes that "this may indicate that although a series of diplomatic disputes have occurred recently, Beijing is still willing to improve communication." Politico said that there were sources in the Huafu diplomatic circle at the beginning of the year. Ambassador, not the current assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying. According to the news, when Hua Chunying was a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she was notorious because of sharp counterattacks on foreign critics. The choice of Xie Feng in Chinese seniors may mean that they are more inclined to choose a less rude dialogue to alleviate bilateral dislikes.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Canadian media recently said that the Chinese government has repeatedly intervened in Canadian elections. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [] March <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國疑干預選舉-加拿大總理任命特別專員調查/a-64837426"></a>The survey report was released on Tuesday (May 23).</p>
<p>The report wrote: "There is no doubt that some foreign governments are trying to influence Canadian candidates and voters." However, Canadian elections are protected by precision mechanisms, these attempts <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/談中國干預加拿大-特魯多選舉未受北京影響/a-63867171"></a>"There is no reason to lose confidence in the results of these (elections)."</p>
<h3>What did you say?</h3>
<p>Earlier, media and other media such as the Canada "The Globe Andmail" had quoted foreign leaked capital, saying that the Chinese government hoped that the Trudean government would continue to take power, so it was politically contributed, and the political contributions, social media fake information, and funding Chinese volunteers voted to vote. Mobilization and other methods to intervene in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections. However, a special investigation reporter Davidjohnston's report pointed out that some foreign leaks were misunderstood by the media because of lack of pulse.</p>
<p>According to this preliminary investigation report, common foreign interference methods include online attacks, online information warfare, false information, and "abuse of interpersonal relationships."</p>
<p>The report also said that because most of the emotional capital is necessary to maintain confidentiality, Johnston believes that it should not or need to launch an open investigation separately. Instead, he should hold a hearing. The situation to protect Canada's democratic society.</p>
<p>As for whether Prime Minister Trudeau deliberately concealed intelligence and did not target <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/加拿大召見中國大使-考慮驅逐外交官/a-65509675"></a>In the event of action, investigators said that although there are major problems in the communication and processing of emotional capital, there is no reason to think that Trudeau's "deliberately ignore" information.</p>
<p>Johnston will release a final investigation report in October.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T03-35-00Z/59234984_401.jpg" />The picture shows the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau attended the situation in September 2021.</p>
<h3>Canadian opposition party dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>Trudeau said on the 23rd that foreign interference is not new, but not only for elections, but also affects academic institutions, enterprises and overall society. He wrote on Twitter: "We will make necessary actions, implement his (investigators) suggestions, and continue to take action to strengthen and defend our democracy."</p>
<p>However, the Trudeau government is still facing strong political pressure, and it is mainly demanding public investigations in the wild party. Special investigators Johnston called for the confidential part of the report in the wild party to obtain permissions and read the report he wrote; this move will be limited by legal restrictions and cannot publicly talk about relevant details.</p>
<p>"I won't be stunned," said Pierrepoilievre, a Canadian conservative party leader, said: "This report has been passive from the beginning, and the credibility is zero." Friends of the family assisted Trudeau's "covering the Beijing government's influence on Canadian democracy." Johnston was a member of the Governor of Canada and a member of the Pierrelliott Trudeau Foundation.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party also accused the Trudeau government ignored the previous emotions because the results of foreign intervention elections were beneficial to the Liberal Party.

<h3>China deny intervention in Canadian elections</h3>

In March, while Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang attended the G20 Summit of the 20th Group (G20), he met with the Canadian Foreign Minister Mélaniejoy (also translated Zhao Meilan) to refute China's interference in Canadian elections. Qin Gang said: "The interference behavior is completely unique and nonsense, and China has resolutely opposed it. China has never interfered with other domestic politics, and also opposes that any country interfere with domestic politics."</p>

<h1>The US debt limit approaches Bayiden and inadvertently quotes the 14th amendment to resolve the crisis</h1>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Washington, 23rd) The White House said today that President Biden did not intend to quote the 14th amendment of the Constitution to avoid the possibility of the United States' debt defaults and exclude the possibility of resolving the current deadlock with the constitution. Progress in the talks.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-24T06-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the Republican House of Representatives, has held three rounds of face -to -face talks in an attempt to reach an agreement to increase the upper limit of the US debt to fulfill the existing US expenditure commitment.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that the 14th amendment to the Constitution can make the US Ministry of Finance ignore the upper limit of debt, but the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that this move "cannot solve the problems we are facing."</p>
<p>Biden previously stated that he was studying whether he could quote the 14th amendment, but he was also worried that such legal challenges brought economic losses.</p>
<p>Shangpier's statement shows that Biden has had to use any plans to use constitutional mechanisms to solve the debt crisis.</p>
<p>Shangpiey also seems to exclude the short -term extended debt limit to allow the possibility of Biden and McCarthy's teams to have more negotiation time. She told reporters that such solutions "are not within the scope of consideration."</p>
<p>The White House said that it has made progress in the latest round of talks with Republican negotiations, and hopes to avoid catastrophic debt defaults before June 1.</p>
<p>"We see some movements ... Both sides must understand that they will not fully get their wishes."</p>
<p>The negotiations between Biden and the Republicans of Congress seem to be known until the last moment. The negotiating representatives have been trying to reach an agreement since the 21st this month to increase or temporarily cancel the upper limit of debt bonds to avoid disasters of US debt defaults.</p>
<p>However, Republicans still refuse to cooperate so far unless Democrats promise to reduce expenditure next year and start to reduce the US debt burden of more than $ 31 trillion. McCarthy said in Twitter today: "Only 9 days are left, Republicans are still the people who can only increase their debt limit and avoid breach of contract."</p>
<p>Minister of Finance, Janet Yellen, said that the United States may spend funds for existing expenditure commitments next week; the Congressional BudgetOffice predicts that the so-called "X-day" (X-day "(x-" that is caught in the debt breach (X- Date) will arrive 2 weeks later.

<p>In a statement issued by the Swedish clothing brand H &amp; M last fall, "the Xinjiang ethnic minorities reported deep concerns about the civic social groups and the media reported deep concern." The statement stated that the company "does not cooperate with any clothing manufacturing plant in Xinjiang, nor does it purchase products or raw materials from the region." In March 2021, the statement was extensively reposted by Chinese netizens in social media, and it also set off a storm that resisted H &amp; M products in turn. On March 25, the H &amp; M brand was removed by multiple e -commerce platforms in China. There are also some protesters who went to H &amp; M to express their protests in front of the physical stores in many places in China.</p>

<p>The article states that "mainland tourists are one of the parents of the Hong Kong service industry". No matter from what perspective, "the mainlanders who discriminate against Mandarin in Hong Kong people" should never be allowed. There is an British -funded background. "Its company culture seems to retain some kind of worship of foreigners, relative respect for Hong Kong people, and look down on the surplus emotions and inexplicable superiority of the mainlanders." It even refers to some "extremists" since the 2019 Hong Kong Repair Movement.

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The Ministry of Economic and Industry of Japan announced on Tuesday (May 23) that the export restrictions on 23 chip manufacturing equipment will take effect as soon as July 23 this year. The Ministry of Commerce of China criticized that this was "abuse of export control measures, a serious departure of free trade and international economic and trade rules, and demanded that Japan" immediately corrects the wrong approach "and China" reserves the right to take measures. "</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/跟進美國-日本限制半導體設備出口/a-65190882"></a>The scope covers 6 major types of equipment involving semiconductor manufacturing. Its products such as Tokyo Electron and Nikon will be affected.</p>
<p>The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a statement in April to criticize Japan to "interfere with global trade liberalization and distorting supply and demand" and call on the Chinese government to "decisively take measures to deal with it." The association advocates that the scope of Japanese control is too wide, "far exceeding the list of controlling items of international traffic", and "vague expression may affect the mature industrial supply chain."</p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/荷蘭跟進美國-祭半導體技術出口管制/a-64926059"></a>It is rumored that the United States, Japan and the Netherlands have reached an agreement to join forces to restrict China's channels for getting advanced semiconductor equipment. April, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美日荷協議限制芯片出口中國要求澄清/a-65232052"></a>And call on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to pay attention to the matter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T09-01-00Z/65208339_401.jpg" />Japanese Foreign Minister Lin Fang met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang when he visited China in April. Qin Gang said that the United States had used the "bullying method" to suppress the Japanese semiconductor industry, calling on Japan to "do not want to do what you do."</p>
<h3>stricter than the United States?</h3>
<p>The British "Financial Times" reported on the 23rd that Chinese semiconductor operators are worried that Japan's export control scope is wide, and lower -order chip production for cars and washing machines may be impacted. A Chinese industry executive who did not want to be named said that after seeing the specifications of expected implementation, he believed that "Japan's export control will be more worrying than last year's sanctions for China."</p>
<p>A Chinese official who exchanged close to chip manufacturers said that the Dutch semiconductor industry ASML (ASML) will only have advanced chip manufacturing equipment, but the scope of control between Japanese companies is more extensive. ASML relevant sources said: "The Japanese government means that they will ask all products to obtain permission, and whether the permission will be approved is a problem ... the Japanese go further than us."</p>
<p>According to reports, the device controlled by the United States in October last year involved 14, 16nm or more precise processes, and the Japanese specifications covered the 45nm process for the use of immersionLithogram equipment.</p>
<p>However, some Japanese officials said that it is difficult to judge which specifications are more stringent based on the chip specifications, because although enterprises have to go through the review procedures, they still have the opportunity to obtain export permits. In addition, although the US measures are directly pointing to China, the geographical scope of Japanese control is wider.</p>
<p>The process of more than 28 nanometers and the maturity of technology is an important strategy to respond to the United States' control for China; SMIC, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in China, is included in the United States <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美國列36家中企為貿易黑名單-長江存儲入列/a-64100609"></a>After that, four new factories are being built in the near future to increase the production of low -order chips. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體中國投入超過一萬億人民幣發展晶片產業/a-64084909"></a>However, China still relies heavily on imported chip manufacturing equipment, so it has hoped that it can replace the United States through Korean or Japanese technology.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T09-01-00Z/65686453_401.jpg" />Japan hosted the G7 Summit in Hiroshima from May 19th to 22nd, emphasizing that facing China is not seeking "decontle", but "De-Risk".</p>
<h3>Japan or Cheng Cheng's industrial layout site</h3>
<p>China last Sunday (21st) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國封殺美光-美反對無事實根據的限制/a-65693360"></a> ， <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美半導體大戰封殺美光韓企得利/a-65705950"></a>But in the long run, the semiconductor industry will face more uncertainty as a whole, and as an American allies such as Samsung, Hemiliation, Kaidi, and other Japanese and Korean companies, it is unlikely that it is unlikely to expand in China regardless of the pressure of the United States.</p>
<p>The Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) recently held a summit in Hiroshima, Japan, emphasizing that it is necessary to seek "de-Risk" for China and reduce dependence on China in terms of supply chain. With the deepening of Europe and the United States' doubts about China, countries have sought diversified supply chain. "Wall Street Journal" analyzed on the 23rd that Japan may become the main layout of various countries. For example, Micron announced last week that with the support of the Japanese government, it will invest 3.6 billion US dollars in Japan to develop a new generation of memory chip process.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kanada also met with executives of global semiconductor giants on the 18th, hoping to strengthen the competitiveness of the Japanese semiconductor industry. Intel CEO Patrickelsinger, Chairman of TSMC (TSMC) Liu Deyin, and Samsung (Samsung Samsung), Micron, IBM, and Applied Materials are present.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Japanese media "Japanese Industry News" reported that TSMC will establish the second chip factory factory in Kumamoto, Japan, with a total investment of more than 1 trillion yen. When TSMC's chairman Liu Deyin went to Japan in May, although he did not mention the specific planning of the new investment case, it was said that "the Japanese government's measures to strengthen the semiconductor ecosystem were impressive" and looked forward to continuing to cooperate with Japan.</p>
<p>South Korea's Samsung Electronics is also coordinating subsidy measures with the Japanese government. Reuters quoted the saying on the 18th that Japan's subsidies to Samsung may reach 15 billion yen and assist Samsung to set up factories near Tokyo.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-24T09-02-09-00-00/000000.png" />The epidemic has led to a surge in demand for semiconductors, and the global supply chain is tight. Western countries that have long relying on Asian cheap chips have faced a sudden shortage and suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>In addition to the European Union's shock, it quickly took action to launch a plan, which increased the EU chip market to increase to 20%by 2030, and the investment amount started from billions of euros.</p>
<p>The major industrial power of the automotive industry in the automotive industry, Germany, hopes to lead this wave of European revitalization campaign, and has recently announced a number of large investment.</p>
<p>The global chip factory TSMC also considers the construction of the first European factory in Dresden, eastern Germany.</p>
<p>But not all projects can be carried out smoothly.</p>
<p>In March last year, Intel announced a high -profile plan to build a large chip factory in Magdeburg, which initially invested 17 billion euros. This project was put on hold, and it was originally planned to start in the first half of this year, and has not yet begun.</p>
<p>It is said that Intel requires higher government subsidies to make up for the impact of rising costs.</p>
<p>For the German chip ecosystem, another major challenge is lack of workers.</p>
<p>According to the German Economic Institute in December last year, the key occupation of the chip industry lacks 62,000 technical talents.</p>
<p>In addition to Germany, other EU countries have also announced investment cases, including new factories built by STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries in France.</p>
<p>There are many chips in Europe to be recovered. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association and BostonConsulting Group (BCG), Europe's global chip production capacity fell from 44%in 1990 to 9 in 2020. %.</p>
<p>Europe is also facing American competition. The United States is promoting chips in large coins, and Japan and South Korea also say that it has smashed billions of dollars in development capacity.</p>
<p>However, some people are worried that the direction of the production chip production of tens of billions of euros is wrong. After all, Europe may still rely on semiconductors produced in other places.</p>

<p>On the long -established Chinatown, the Chinese signboards hanging on the busy stores and food supermarkets can be seen in the Canadian maple leaf logo. Many people here seem to be unwilling to discuss recent racial discrimination and threats.</p>
<p>In recent years, human rights sports people and Canadian ethnic groups have proposed some harassment allegations, and the INESTY International Organization has recorded.</p>
<p>Some people accused Chinese undercover agents or agents threatening Chinese Canadians and vowed to retaliate against their relatives in their hometown.</p>
<p>Cheukkwan, co -chairman of the TORONTO Association for Democracy in China</p>
<p>Guan Zhuozhong, wearing black leather clothes, said that the methods they used contained "death threats, words intimidation, or just a simple sentence" We know where your parents live ".</p>
<p>In order to avoid China's persecution, Dilnur Anwar, who moved to Canada in 2019, has personally experienced such telephone threats for many years and received almost every day.</p>
<p>Anwar, who currently lives in Montreal, said: "I blocked those (telephone) numbers, but this is useless because they will keep playing with other numbers."</p>
<p>Anwal explained: "Sometimes I will be asked to go to the embassy, and sometimes I receive an automatic voice message."</p>
<p>Ottawa (OTTAWA) has been tit -for -tat from Beijing since 2018. At that time, a senior Huawei director was arrested in the United States in Vancouver. China was obviously retaliated and then detained two Canadian citizens.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been COVID-19 civid-19 outbreaks, Chinese "spy balloons" in North America, and Canadian cities discovered the China Secret Police Station incident, as well as the allegations of Beijing's intervention in Canadian elections.</p>
<p>Under these disputes, Canadian Chinese immigrants and their offspring are often examined.</p>
<p>Many Chinese people believe that Ottawa urgently needs to take action to prevent the trend of recent racism.</p>
<p>Wu Tingting, co -founder of the Full Canadian Chinese Equalist Association (Jiaojin Association), said that the government needs to "ensure that Canadians, including new immigrants, are not interviewed by (Chinese special agents), nor will they face risks or threats from foreign countries."

<p>(Voice of Germany) Chairman of the "China Affairs Responsibility Committee" of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives proposed that the US Department of Commerce should introduce trade restrictions on China Storage chip manufacturer Changxin Storage Technology Co., Ltd. (CXMT).</p>
<p>Last weekend, the China Internet Information Office released news that the product of Micron, a US semiconductor company, "has a hidden danger of serious network security issues", which constitutes a major risk of China's key information infrastructure supply chain and affects national security. The review is not approved, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國封殺美光-美反對無事實根據的限制/a-65693360"></a>Essence</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that this is the latest incident in the expanding trade dispute between the two largest economies in the world. The response of the US Congress and the White House to China is tough.</p>
<p>The White House spokesman Jean-Pierre told the media on Tuesday (May 23) that China ’s allegations of Micron products“ lack the factual basis ”.</p>
<p>According to the White House, the US Department of Commerce is currently conducting "direct contact" with China on Micron.</p>
<p>The headquarters in Aida in the United States, with South Korea's Samsung and SKHynix, tied for three giants in the global stored chip market. Micron's main business is a variety of semiconductor devices, including dynamic random access memory, flash memory and solid -state drives; its main products include DRAM, NAND flash storage, CMOS image sensor, other semiconductor elements and memory modules.</p>
<p>Most leader of the Senate, Shu Mo, also said on Tuesday that he is discussing this issue with a wider business community and allies.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to the relevant inquiries raised by Reuters. Changxin Storage Technology did not comment immediately.</p>

But these pardon are about to expire or may be canceled.</p>
<p>Neither Samsung and SK Hynix immediately published a comment.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that the chips produced by Changxin Storage Technology are two to three generations behind the industry leaders Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a reporter asked a reporter on the relevant questions about the network security censorship of Micron's sales of products in China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning responded: "The relevant Chinese department's network security review of Micron's sales products in China is implemented in accordance with the law, and it is made based on the facts. China's network security review is not targeted at specific countries and regions, and we do not exclude it. The technology and products of any country. The United States takes national security as an excuse. Without any factual basis, more than 1,200 Chinese companies and individuals are included in various lists to implement various restrictions. This is economic coercion. Unacceptable. "</p>
<p>She also said: "Some people in the United States Congress proposed to include Chinese companies in the entity list. What I want to say is that China resolutely oppose the concept of US generalization of national security and abuse national power unreasonably to suppress Chinese enterprises. This discrimination is discriminated against. Sexual unfairness, seriously damage the normal economic and trade exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States, destroy market rules and international economic and trade order, and seriously disrupt the global production chain stability. China will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and institutions ","</p>

<p>Huang Renxun said that in order to compete with Nivine's graphics card chips, artificial intelligence chips and other products, China has begun to build its own semiconductor industry. He also said that the proportion of the Chinese market in the US technology company sales market is as high as one -third, and such a large market share cannot be replaced.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Science and Technology Information and Communication (hereinafter referred to as the "Ministry of Science and Technology") and the South Korean Aviation Universe Research Institute will be 6:24 pm on Wednesday (May 24) (Singapore time at 5:24 pm on Wednesday), the third time The "World" of the self -developed carrier rocket is planned to send the new generation of small satellite No. 2 into the 550 kilometer height of the Sun synchronization track.</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reported that although the second launch in June last year was successfully sent to the "Star", the focus of the satellite mission at that time was to verify the rocket's carrier capacity, so Wednesday was the first time the "World" was testing the practical satellite.</p>
<p>The "World" on Tuesday at 7:20 am from the installation plant of the Luo Lao Aerospace Center was transported to the launching table and fixed vertically. After that, the arrow body was connected to the supplier of supply power, the umbilical cord pipeline of the pushing agent and the oxidant, and the staff also checked With its qi, etc., the launch preparation work ended at 9:14 pm.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Science and Technology held a meeting of the Launch Management Committee on Tuesday evening that the launch preparation work was normal. On the 24th, the weather around Luo Lao Aerospace Center will meet the launch conditions. The possibility of rainfall on the day is low, the wind speed will be lower than 5 meters per second, and the possibility of thunderstorms in the rocket flight route is also very low.</p>
<p>Luo Lao Aerospace Center implements land, sea and air safety control around the center. The ground personnel and vehicles and vehicles and rockets within 3 kilometers of the launch rack are 24 kilometers wide. Personnel and ships within 78 kilometers long will be controlled. The aircraft in the airspace of 95 kilometers wide by 44 kilometers wide also belongs to the scope of control.</p>
<p>The success or failure of the "World" depends on whether the new generation of small satellites can be sent to the orbit with a height of 550 kilometers (the error range does not exceed 5%). The Ministry of Science and Technology of China will announce the launch results at 7 pm on Wednesday.</p>

Emotionally excited workers are at a loss, they will [] <a href="https://maps.clb.org.hk/?i18n_language=zh_CN&amp;map=1&amp;startDate=2023-04&amp;endDate=2023-04&amp;eventId=2023042615322574978&amp;addressId=440300&amp;address=%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E5%B8%82"></a>, Asking the boss to promise to make reasonable compensation.</p>
<p>The local police came to the scene, and the fire was laid the inflatable cushion downstairs to prevent unexpected. The local union was absent as usual.</p>
<p>A news from the website of Songgang Street Office, Baoan District said that just three weeks before the incident, the Songgang Street Trade Union just opened <a href="http://www.baoan.gov.cn/sgjd/zwgk/qt/gzdt/content/post_10517892.html"></a>Chen Jinhua, vice chairman of Baoan District Trade Union, spoke at the meeting, requiring the grassroots trade unions to do their best to do practical things, do good things, and solve difficult things for employees, so as to continuously enhance the sense of perception, response, influence and cohesion of the union. The brand and union chairman are bright. "</p>
<p>Ding Yan, chairman of the Songgang Street Trade Union, stated at the meeting that she would work hard to build a strong team of union cadres to do well To realize "the yearning for employees for a better life", so that employees and masses can truly feel that the union is the "home of employees", and the union cadre is the most trusted "family".</p>
<p>The words of the chairman of the two -level trade union did not fall. Three weeks later, the Yunfeng factory appeared in the situation of "the party and government, the need for society, and the employee urgently".</p>
<p>According to Yunfeng Electronic Technology (Shenzhen) limited <a href="http://www.welfarepcb.com/profile_cn.html"></a>According to information, it was established in Hong Kong in May 1984. In May 1991, Shenzhen Songgang Yunfeng Circuit Board Factory was established. And renamed Yunfeng Electronic Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd..</p>
<p>The factory <a href="http://www.welfarepcb.com/index_cn.html"></a>Including internationally renowned brands such as Sony, Casio, Foxconn, Sanmei Electric, are <a href="http://www.welfarepcb.com/awards_cn.html"></a>"," The best supplier "and" key component supplier ", Foxconn's" quality performance supplier ", and twice received Sony's thank you.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yunfeng Plant was also awarded the "Green Enterprise" of Shenzhen, the advanced unit of legal education in Shenzhen, the excellent enterprise of Baoan District, the excellent enterprise of Songgang Street, and the China Customs Trusting Enterprise.</p>
<p>Such a customer stabilized and was awarded by governments at all levels, and the factory also established a trade union. Why is the trust between enterprises and employees so fragile? Why did workers ask for demands and developed to the roof of the floor at once? Have the workers looking for help before going to the roof? After the incident, did the local unions say what the chairman said at the union congress "bright brand and bright identity" to give full play to the union perception, response, influence and cohesion. Representatives of workers negotiated with corporate negotiations to solve problems?</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-24T10-56-00-04-00/000000.png" />From July this year, Japan will limit 23 key chip manufacturing equipment exports. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-05242023085515.html/@@images/image"></a>Reuters information picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-05242023085515.html/@@stream"></a>Following the ban on the semiconductor chip to China, Japan will also limit 23 key chip manufacturing equipment exports from July. Although the relevant regulations of Japan have not named China, some public opinion believes that its lethality may be even more American.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-03312023141625.html"></a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-03212023142218.html"><strong> New regulations for chip control in the United States: strictly restrict manufacturers business in China </strong></a>The Ministry of Economic and Industry of Japan announced on the 23rd that export restrictions on 23 semiconductor manufacturing technology will be officially effective on July 23. Nikkei Chinese website pointed out that 23 categories include extremely ultraviolet light(EUV)The manufacturing equipment of related products, as well as etching equipment for stereo stack storage components. According to the performance of logical semiconductors, related equipment is a cutting -edge chip product with a width of the manufacturing circuit below 10 to 14 nanometers. The report pointed out that this move is "keep the pace with the United States."</p>
<p>The British "Financial Times" disclosed that after the Chinese semiconductor operators reviewed the relevant rules of Japan's expected implementation, they found that in terms of restricting Chinese manufacturing semiconductor capabilities, the Japanese plan has greater lethality to China. Chinese chip factories who do not want to disclose their name admit: "Japan's export control is more disturbing China than last year's sanctions."</p>
<p>According to reports, there are currently only 3 light carved machine manufacturers in the global market, which are ASML in the Netherlands(Aismore), Japan Canon(Canon)Nikon(Nikon)The market share of these three devices is 82%, 10%and 8%in order.</p>
<p><strong> The Japanese ban may extend to 45nm chip </strong></p>
<p>"Two Japanese lithography machine manufacturers in the immersive DUV market share higher than that of Aismore, so Japan's heavy hands are killed. I am afraid that it is not the problem of advanced systems. It is likely to eliminate the manufacturing of the entire Chinese semiconductor. Lin Xiumin, a lecturer of the Enterprise Management Department of Taiwan Soochow University, told this station.</p>
<p>"Japan's semiconductor restrictions are even harder than the United States!" NetEase's well -known financial blogger "Internet. Ranchen Show" describes the lethality of Japan's restrictions. "Among the 23 types of products in Japan, it has involved 45 Nano -craftsmanship is stricter and widely more stringent and scope than Aismore and the United States. "</p>

<p>Ericjohnson, the chief CEO of Japanese light resistant agent JSR, told the Financial Times that it will be extremely ultraviolet light(EUV)The technology of Weiying's technology is not easy. Even if China obtains accurate chemical formulas, it must consider whether it can achieve high purity when manufacturing. It is very difficult to accurately and reproduce, and China does not have supportable supply chains.</p>
<p>According to Takuya Industrial Research Institute(Topology Research Institute)The report released in January this year is that China is the world's largest consumer market, but the domestic rate is less than 10%, which is high. In the context of the global semiconductor "against globalization", Chinese manufacturers are accelerating the localization of semiconductor photoretically obstructive agents to respond to possible risk of confession.</p>
<p>Wei Shaojun, a professor at the School of Integrated Circuit of Beijing Tsinghua University, recently voted in the First Financial and Economics, trying to analyze the Japanese ban on the advantages and disadvantages of Japanese manufacturers. He said, "China's semiconductor industry is rising, and the funds invested each year are nearly US $ 30 billion. Among them, the funds for purchasing Japanese equipment and materials exceeded 10 billion US dollars, which is not a number that is easy to ignore for anyone."</p>
<p><strong> Containment of China through economic security through economic security </strong></p>
<p>Chen Wenjia, a senior consultant of the National Policy Research Institute in Taiwan, said in an interview with this station that under the leadership of the G7 summit held in Hiroshima, Japan, in order to cope with China's "economic stress" measures, it has been sought to adopt a common approach to China, which is to reduce China to reduce China. risk(de-risk)That is to start the economic security of "supply chain to Sinicization" and "weakening China's economic hegemony".</p>
<p>After the summit, Japan officially proposed a semiconductor restriction order, highlighting the Kishida government in order to strengthen the US -Japan Alliance, and use the capital, technology and materials currently mastered the core production factors of the world semiconductor. Make it more extensive to China.</p>
<p>"Japan's economic security with diplomacy and economic security, on the basis of the United States and Japan alliances, will continue to cooperate with the United States to block and curb China by the United States." Chen Wenjia said.</p>
<p>Chen Wenjia expects that China will increase investment in the unlimited resources of the domestic semiconductor industry in the future to improve its independent research and development capabilities; secondly, China will also actively attract technological cooperation with European countries such as Germany, France, and Dutch Differentiated European relations with the United States and Japan. However, "in the short term, China still faces many difficulties and challenges to achieve breakthroughs."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce responded on the 23rd on the 23rd to respond to Japan ’s formal introduction of the export control measures of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, saying that this was an abuse of export control measures, a serious departure to free trade and international economic and trade rules, and China resolutely opposed it.</p>

<p>In the last fiscal year, Britain recruited a number of international nurses who broke the record, filling the shortage of manpower in the hospital, as many as 10%of them came from a "red list" country that should not be actively recruited by medical staff.</p>
<p>Reuters report, <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230316-1373259"></a>(NHS) has long hired medical staff overseas, and after the British referendum withdrew from the European Union in 2016, EU medical staff working in the UK has decreased sharply in recent years.</p>
<p>According to data from the British Nurses and Medical Assistance Committee (NMC), as of the year of March this year, nearly half of the nurses, midwives and nursing assistants registered in the UK have received international education. Nearly 3,500 people came from Nigeria.</p>
<p>Nigeria is one of the countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) red list. The two major sources of labor in British nurses -India and the Philippines -not on the red list.</p>
<p>The WHO has warned that poor countries are losing more and more medical staff and pay attention to the active recruitment operations of some rich countries.</p>
<p>Senior researcher of the Think Tank "Health Foundation" said, the nurses from the red list, especially Nigeria and Ghana, have increased significantly.</p>
<p>He said: "(WHO) member states should not be recruited in these countries, but the data cannot tell us how these nurses have become registered nurses in the UK."</p>
<p>Waterfield, the head of NHS employer development and employment, said that the hospital trust fund and other institutions hiring employees in NHS in England have been told that they can only cooperate with institutions that have been certified and reviewed and are not operated in the red list.</p>
<p>She said: "Personal application is a difficult issue."</p>
<p>The WHO does not stop medical staff from the Red List countries applying for work to the United Kingdom. Although recruitment agencies may not actively recruit medical staff in the Red list countries, these countries may have established related contacts, and applicants in some countries are therefore more.</p>

<p>May 24th is the Chinese Prayer Day that Pope Bendi 16 wrote to the Chinese Catholic in 2007. On this day, believers around the world will pray for churches in China.

The relationship between the Vatican and China has been difficult for decades. However, in 2018, the two sides appointed a controversial temporary secret agreement on the issue of Chinese Catholic Bishop.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that this agreement aims to alleviate the differences between the Chinese Underground Catholic Church and the official "Three Self -Patriotic" churches that have been loyal to the Pope for a long time. Since the 1950s, China first recognized the Pope as the supreme leader of the Catholic Church. However, critics pointed out that this temporary secret agreement is equivalent to the appeasement of the Vatican to the Chinese authoritarian government, and it has not substantially improved the situation of Chinese Catholic believers.</p>
<p>The above agreement was extended for the first time in 2020, but the appointment of few Chinese bishops was approved by Chinese officials and the Pope since then. In September 2022, the agreement was extended for another 2 years. In March of this year, China once again appointed a new bishop to Shanghai. The Vatican said that this obviously violated the agreement between the two parties.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65719316/65716059"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T11-22-00Z/65716059_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany) on Wednesday, German police and procuratorial agencies launched large -scale search operations on the "last generation". Munich and Bavarian criminal agencies said that in the early morning, the police conducted an assault search for 15 houses distributed in seven federal states with the crime of "suspected organization and supporting criminal gangs".</p>
<p>The survey was seven suspects aged 22 to 38, but no one was arrested during the operation. Two of these suspects were suspected of planning a destructive operation on a oil pipeline in April 2022.</p>
<p>Procuratorate stated that this search was adopted because a large number of criminal complaints were received before. "The last generation" is an aggressive climate protection organization. For a period of time, members of the organization have hoped that public society attaches great importance to the consequences of climate change in the form of blocking public transportation and applying museum exhibits. In the protest operation, the "last generation" members often used glue to stick themselves to the road pavement and museum art to increase the difficulty of the police away from them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T11-22-00Z/65491666_401.jpg" />"The last generation" When a member launched a protest on the highway, it used glue to stick his hands on the road to increase the difficulty of the police drive away.</p>
<p>Police and procuratorates said the focus of the search operation was a fundraising operation initiated by the "last generation" organization to raise funds for future protests. It is said that the fundraising operation has been raised at least 1.4 million euros. Police said existing evidence showed that most of the above -mentioned funds have been used to launch protests. The source of funds will be the focus of the future investigation. Police refused to disclose the specific amount of their confiscation of funds. Police also said that through this search operation, he hopes to master the constitution of the "last generation" members.</p>
<h3>Environmental activities are extremely dissatisfied with the search operation</h3>
<p>Police said that the search operation covered seven federal states, including Hamburg, Munich, and Dresden. The entire action was progressing smoothly without violence. According to the requirements of the procuratorial agency, the police had confiscated and closed the organization's website.</p>
<p>Copycrists with activists have strong criticism of the police's actions. The "Last World" organization published a tweet that the target of the search operation was "Those who warned the climate crisis, but let those who destroy the climate." "The last generation" also posted a tweet. " Go to search for those lobbying groups outside the hospital to confiscate the funds obtained by the government through petrochemical energy. "</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, the situation of "last generation" activists is very difficult. In the operation of the road, they were often added by the drivers, and even punched and kicked. The Potsdam District Court also said that the group had a preliminary suspicion of "criminal gang". This week, the German Chancellor Salz also made a public voice for the first time. He said that he used glue to use glue to "be stupid" with glue.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T11-22-00Z/65416621_401.jpg" />"The last generation" "blocking traffic protests also aroused dissatisfaction among many drivers. The picture shows a protest in Berlin in April this year.</p>
<p>The "last generation" had previously proposed to formulate the "Food Law" to curb the problem of food waste. The recent demand is the general speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour for the implementation of highways and long -term implementation of a nine euro public transportation monthly ticket.</p>
<h3>Police Union: Searching for "Send the correct signal"</h3>
<p>The investigation of the "last generation" is coordinated by the "Bavarian Based on Extremeism and Terrorism Center". A spokesman for the Munich Procuratorate emphasized that this division of labor does not mean incorporating "the last generation" into the category of extremeism and terrorism. "According to the situation we have now, we are charged with the criminal gang, not the crime of extremist organizations, and investigates the 'last generation'." The qualitative issue will eventually be determined by the court.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) "Programming" Bloger Ruan Xiaohuan's wife, Ms. Bi, said to Germany that the official sent a legal aid lawyer to Ruan Xiaohuan; his family members learned about his information from the channel of law aid lawyers. "I sent a WeChat to the lawyer before, so I said that his (referring to Ruan Xiaohuan) is okay, but the amount of information is not large."</p>
<p>Ms. Bi said that there is another channel to understand Ruan Xiaohuan through the Shanghai Letters and Calls Office. "When I went to Beijing on April 4th, did Beijing National Security talked to me? They understood that what I reflected from Ruan Xiaohuan was arrested for the first trial judgment. The problem in the judgment was good. Let me write an appeal of a text and they submit it for me. They said that they would also reflect my situation and demands to their channels. "</p>
<p>"Later, I called a staff member of the Shanghai Letter Office. This person may often run in Shanghai and Beijing. It is equivalent to the Beijing National Security found him and said that he was in Beijing. For channels, you can help me communicate with the Shanghai government and the current organizer to communicate with the case of Ruan Xiaohuan, and follow up with the problems I reflected and some demands. This is actually very good. "</p>
<p>Ms. Bi said that the people at the Shanghai letter of visiting on April 4 returned to Shanghai with her. After that, they talked twice, which was a matter of supporting legal aid lawyers. The latest conversation was last week.</p>
<p>Ms. Bi said: "According to the law, it is necessary to conclude within three months after the second instance case, which means that the case is filed on February 22, and the trial should be concluded before May 22. If you can't get in, the family lawyers can't get in, the family members have been questioning and asked the legal aid lawyer to withdraw and let the family lawyer go in. This is equivalent to the program problem. "</p>
<p>"Last week, the people at the Letters and Calls Office asked me to talk face to face, saying that it would definitely be too late on May 22. He told me that the High Court would be postponed. Then I questioned that the suspect is now or the defendant It is in the state of mind, and we do not let us take the bail pending trial. It is said that this is a national security class. What? What did the court postpone? The defendant was not detained at the detention center? "</p>
<p>"The person at the Shanghai letter and visit office told me another situation, that is, Ruan Xiaohuan is now in the detention center and is also guaranteed. It is to ensure him. He likes to eat apples, beef, all of which are guaranteed. Then he said that he can exercise inside. Body. You can read a book. "</p>
<p>Ms. Bi said: "So the situation of Ruan Xiaohuan now goes through the Shanghai Letters and Visits Office to help me communicate with the detention center and pass his situation to me."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俺写博客的历程/a-16721706"></a>Essence On May 10, 2021, Ruan Xiaohuan was taken away in Shanghai's home. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国政治启蒙博主编程随想证实被判刑7年监禁/a-65106470"></a>According to Radio Free Asia, Ms. Bi also saw her husband during the trial at the time. Visually, he lost half of his weight, and most of his hair turned white.</p>
<p>Ms. Bi introduced the voice of German Voice about the revocation of legal aid lawyers: "The requirements of our family members are also legal. It is a lawyer commissioned by our family members, and lawyers of Shangbaojun and Mo Shaoping. Qian Lai protects the defendant's right to defense. The applicable conditions are that the defendant's economic conditions are not allowed to ask for a defense lawyer. Then this premise does not exist on the case of Ruan Xiaohuan. "</p>
<p>"If the court said, Ruan Xiaohuan insisted on using legal aid lawyers, then our family members explained Article 51 according to the Litigation Law, and demanded clearly that the defendant Ruan Xiaohuan, who was betrayed, knew that his family had invited two places from Mo Shaoping Law Firm. Lawyer. If he knows this situation, he still insists on using the court lawyer. Then ask the court to provide evidence that can be obtained and tell family members. "This is the situation."</p>
<p>Ms. Bi said that she and Ruan Xiaohuan's parents have been reporting to the situation of the Shanghai High Court. She said that in addition to hoping to withdraw legal aid lawyers in reason and reasonablely, the main demands, "because the undertaking judge Xu Meihua has been delayed in this matter for too long, it has been more than two months, so we want her to avoid suspicion. We questioned her professionalism and attitude of handling the case. We hope that the judge will avoid suspicion and do not participate in the second trial that everyone is concerned about, not suitable. " "The third one we have been talking about is that I hope that the second instance can be made public to express the justice of justice."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T11-29-00Z/65107245_401.jpg" />Programming the blog</p>
<p>Ms. Bi said: "In fact, our family members have always believed in Shanghai's judicial organs in this case. We also believe that in this judicial system, the second trial is a comprehensive inspection and correction of the first trial. Since the Shanghai Government has also been involved in the case through the Shanghai Credit Office, it has also seen that their Shanghai government attaches great importance to the case, and I do not want to have a bad judicial impact because of the case of Ruan Xiaohuan. Many netizens who are looking at them are to exercise social supervision. If the second instance of this case can openly and fairly give a reasonable and legitimate judgment, that is, a bad thing for bad things, for Shanghai judicial organs. We are looking forward to this result. "</p>

<p>The Republican Party has shown that the federal expenditure next year will be set to 2022 to the bottom line, but the Democratic Party has rejected a commitment so far.</p>
<p>Republican Federal Representative Ralph Norman warned yesterday that McCarthy said that the distance between the two parties was "far worse."</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Janetyellen has warned that the upper limit of debt must reach an agreement before June 1, otherwise the United States will explore debt defaults. Economists warn that once debt defaults in the United States may cause turbulence in the global economy and financial markets. STEPHENINES, a strategist of SPI Asset Management (SPI Asset Management), pointed out: "Except for the economy, the debt limit negotiation highlights the continued polarization of American politics and has cast a shadow on the political process of China."</p>
<p>He said, "Repeatedly resorted to dangerous marginal strategies, it may attract the attention of the Capital Evaluation Company again." International Capital Corporation, S &amp; P (S &amp; P), has reduced the US letter rating in the 2011 category.</p>
<p>Yinnis pointed out that at that time, "the fundamental problem was the deterioration of political differences. This situation has nothing else except for the continuous deterioration since 2011. This is difficult to argue."</p>

Behind this case, the entire 10 years, China from the government to the people, generally entered a pursuit of seeking The political state that recognizes is to acknowledge politics, which is a concrete manifestation of nationalist self -esteem. You have to deal with the mainlanders. You have to stand on the position of mainlanders. You have to speak Mandarin. It also refers to each individual, and nationalist education in the past 10 years is effective. "</p>

What is this? This is the brutal declaration of war to civilization, declaration of war to justice, and slavery to the freedom of war. Today is May 24, 2023. To this day, Russia has launched a "illegal, unprovoed and unreasonable war war war" for Ukraine, it has been fifteen months; the Ukrainian war bravely fights against Russian devils, it has been fifteen months; the majority of the United Nations member states It has been done for fifteen months for all -round support and assistance to Ukraine. To this day, the ending of the Russian and Ukraine War is no longer slightly closer, but is about to be in the world -May 19, 5 days ago, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Seven Nostalgia of Japan. The Summit was held in Hiroshima; in the "Statement of the Leaders of the Seventh Kingdoms Group on Ukraine" issued on the same day, the fifth point was "supporting Ukrainian recovery and reconstruction", the eighth point is "liability for damage compensation", and the ninth point is " Crime.

The Seven Kingdoms Group solemnly mentioned the official schedule, indicating that they were full of confidence in Ukraine's upcoming defeat Russia.</p>
<p>And how will the victory of Ukraine come? The premise of "never allows Russia to threaten the use of nuclear weapons during the invasion of Ukraine, not to mention the actual use of nuclear weapons" (quoted from the "Statement of the Leaders of the Seven Kingdoms Group on Ukraine").</p>
<p>In the past fifteen months, how to effectively stop Putin's lonely injection and use nuclear weapons to change the war process in the international anti -aggression camp, it has been thoughtful and painstaking. It should be said that even if you retreat 10,000 steps, Putin's nuclear nuclear will not change the ending of the Russian and Ukraine War. However, the catastrophic consequences of war are much more serious. Out of the responsible consideration of avoiding such consequences, three strict self -restrictions have been made for Ukraine's strong backing international anti -aggression camps: 1. Do not send troops to participate in the war directly. 2. Do not let warfire overflow in Ukraine. 3. It is better to squeeze on the provision of weapons to Ukraine. At the same time, use a variety of high -tech methods and multiple acquisitions to obtain intelligence, and closely monitor the movement of the Russian nuclear arsenal, so that their anti -commissioned power and nuclear strike force are prepared Study in the cradle, or limits it to a relatively minimum harm.</p>
<p>In the past fifteen months, Russia's military strength has been proven, and the timing of decision has come. If people regard the "Statement of the Leaders of the Seven Domestic Groups" as the ultimatum issued to Russia, I think it is inseparable from eight or nine. In addition, I noticed that "Statement" announced that "continuing to take action to provide substantial support for Russia's war in the war of Russia", and also seriously warned the so -called neutral "persuasion" such as Brazilian President Lula: If you are The Russian army and military equipment have not been completely withdrawn and unconditional, and it is impossible to achieve fair peace, so this must be included in any peaceful plan.</p>
<p>Three days ago, on May 21st, the President Zelezki warned at the Hiroshima press conference during the Ukrainian war: If the world does not unite to oppose the Russian invaders, "other criminals who are sitting in big positions want to launch a similar war. It's just a matter of time. " Following, Zeleizaki decided to declare in the attitude of victor the country: Ukraine's peace plan is to make Russia a "last invader". "We will eliminate other potential aggressors. When the world's defense is firm, they will dispel the idea of war. "However, I think it is necessary to make Russia a" last invader "on the planet and make other potential invaders dare not dare to launch the war. The thoughts are implemented, and there is something that it seems to be done, that is: the State Council of the Security Council of the Russia who defeats the country and Russia; the establishment of the United Nations Security Council's institutional settings and permissions arrangements.</p>
<p>Over the past fifteen months, the UN Security Council, the top legal institution in the world, is in vain, but even a paper statement that condemns Russia's aggression cannot be issued, let alone the intervention of stopping aggression. If the Security Council does not make fundamental reforms, and still retains a privilege of a one -vote veto of the permanent member of the country, if the strategic partner of a permanent member country will move the evil thoughts in the future, especially if it is still a permanent member of the nuclear, Is the Security Council just the deaf ears? Can the international anti -aggression camp only watch the military and civilians of the invaded national and civilians fighting alone and sprinking their homes alone? In my opinion, the reform of the United Nations Security Council should achieve the following goals: if there are still aggressors who dare to risk the world after Russia, no matter what their identity and nuclear support, the Security Council can make decisions decisively. The United Nations Army went to the country of aggressive, fighting side by side with the military and civilians of the country, fighting the invasive devils as soon as possible, and then warning the defeated aggressive country to nuclear and militaryization.</p>
<p>I believe that with the final victory of the Ukrainian Patriotic War, humans will usher in a milestone new victory, new victory in justice and freedom.</p>

<p>Description: After China's "May 1st" holiday, many people reported that they were infected with the new crown virus in the social media, that is, "Eryang". Zhong Nanshan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, recently stated that the second wave of epidemic in the new crown in China this year will be at the end of June. What are the characteristics of the new epidemic peak and how to deal with it? This reporter interviewed Jin Dongyan, an expert in the University of Hong Kong.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65719438/65470439"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T12-57-00Z/65470439_303.jpg" /></a>After the May Day holiday of the people traveling a lot, more discussions on "Eryang" appeared on Chinese social media.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) On May 22, Zhong Nanshan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said at a forum that according to the model forecast, the second wave of epidemic peaks this year was at the end of June, and the new infection was about 65 million/week. The highest peak infection at the end of May 2023 was 40 million/week. He said: "A Omikon infection can infect more than 30 people. Our epidemic prevention and control strategy has been adjusted from past prevention and control to the current prevention, because infection is difficult to prevent."</p>
<p>Jin Dongyan, a professor at the School of Biomedicine of the University of Hong Kong and virus expert, also believes that "the new crown virus will find every susceptible person, which is not transferred by people's will. Unless repeated vaccination is repeatedly vaccinated or is completely isolated from the world, Otherwise it may be infected. "</p>
<p>However, for the model prediction data, Jin Dongyan believes whether it will be accurate will be tested by practice, but because China's detection volume is too small, the monitoring network is not dense enough, and it may take time to announce. "So even if it happens, the second wave Come out or severely lag. "</p>
<p>As for how to prevent severe illnesses, Professor Jin Dongyan pointed out: "The two major weapons of severe diseases are the same efficient MRNA vaccine like Pfizermodner. "He suggested that once the high -risk person is infected," take the medicine immediately, the sooner the better, you can also strengthen personal protection. "</p>
<h3>"Most of the symptoms of healthy young age and secondary yang are mild"</h3>
<p>According to a report on May 23, "China News Weekly", Lu Mengji, a professor at the Institute of Virus Research, a Chinese virus of Germany and the University of Essen, said in an interview with "China News Weekly" that compared with the initial infection, the second time, the second time The infectious immune response time will be shorter and the symptoms will be slightly mild. He said that some people’s secondary infections or inevitable; China also faces the second and third waves of epidemic, but because the crowd already has basic immunity, the peak infection will not be too high, and the infection time will be stretched and will not happen. The first round of infection was infected within 6 to 8 weeks. In addition, most people's illness will improve within a few days. If someone has severe symptoms such as continuous high fever, medical treatment can avoid serious consequences in time.</p>
<p>According to the surging news report, Li Yan, chief physician of Beijing Youan Hospital infection, introduced the situation that he observed that the patients of "Eryang" are mainly young and middle -aged people from the age of 18 to 60. Symptoms are lighter than the first infection, the course of disease is relatively short, and there are very few severe cases. Therefore, the increase in the number of "Eryang" patients has a small impact on medical resources. "The entire medical condition and the treatment ability are far better than the peak infection at the beginning of the New Year." He said.</p>
<p>"Science and Technology Daily" reported that on May 18, Xie Xiaoliang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a professor at Peking University, said at an academic conference that from the statistical data of the current epidemic (take Beijing as an example), the trend chart of this round of epidemic is easier. There is no probability that there will be an epidemic situation at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Jin Dongyan, a virus expert of the University of Hong Kong, also pointed out that "Two waves are local popularity. With data from Hong Kong and Europe and the United States, the effective reproduction rate RT is below 2, and most of the cases are below 1.5. Vaccination is strengthened. "He also pointed out that the low degree of new crowns is conducive to supplementation of group immunity.</p>
<p>"Nature" magazine issued on May 4 this year that although the new crown virus has a trend of recovery, it is unlikely that the hospital's overwhelming blowout epidemic may appear again. All countries are now undergoing a high -frequency but lower mortality infection, which is characterized by a relatively high -proportion mild infection.</p>
<h3>New Crown Virus is still a threat</h3>
<p>On May 5th, the World Health Organization Director Director Tan Desai announced in Geneva that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国卫生官员新冠全球紧急状态结束但风险仍在/a-65531544"></a>, But he also emphasized that this does not mean that the new crown virus is no longer a global hygiene threat.</p>
<h3>epidemiologist: China has skipped the "buffer zone" of epidemic prevention</h3>
<p>Professor Jin Dongyan said in an interview with Voice of Germany on May 24 that after Hong Kong appeared tsunami in April last year, the first and second waves appeared in September last year and January last year. "It is currently at the third wave and is close to the peak. At least 3%to 5%of people infected each day, which is 21 to 350,000 people. 3.25%, 3.16%, and 3.62%. "He also said that the domestic new crown mortality rate is not known. Hong Kong is about 0.1%. The seasonal influenza dies in the same time interval is about or more dying from the new crown. "</p>
<p>Professor Jin Dongyan believes that "there will be small waves after a few months after the new crown. Most people have mild symptoms. The severe mortality rate is extremely low, but the absolute number will still be a lot. Extremely low probability incident, tsunami and blowouts should never come again.

<p>Description: The Hong Kong police team has been low in recent years, and the Hong Kong Police Department has once again reduced the entry standards, hoping to attract more young people to join. However, some views pointed out that the Hong Kong police in the 2019 "return" movement brutally suppressing protesters caused the police to be seriously damaged. Even if the government issued high salaries, it could not be attractive to young people.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Hong Kong Police Office said that in order to "maintain the competitiveness of the police in the human resources market and further improve the efficiency of recruitment," will be adjusted from May 5th. These include canceling the lowest height and weight required; reduce the requirements for the vision of the examinee, that is, the examiner passes the relevant test when wearing glasses or contact lenses, which will be considered as the vision requirements; (Written test) provides candidates with another way to meet the requirements of Chinese ability.</p>
<p>According to the documents submitted to the Legislative Council in January this year, as of March 31 last year, the Hong Kong Police Department became the department with the largest vacancy of civil servants, reaching 16.7%, of which the vacancy rate of primary police officers reached 17.7%.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Hong Kong police team has become more and more difficult to recruit, and the number of applicants has fallen sharply by 30%two years ago. In order to attract more young people to join, the Police Department has repeatedly reduced the requirements for admission. In March last year, the Hong Kong Police Office announced that starting from April 1, the cancellation of police officers, trainee inspections, and auxiliary police officers must be "lived in Hong Kong for 7 years or more". Special Administrative Region permanent resident. This means that born in Hong Kong but lived in mainland China <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港警察放寬招聘條件-不用居港七年可入職/a-61313018"></a>Essence</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Police Officer Mask talks about moral dilemma</h3>
<p>The British "Guardian" analysis believes that the willingness to be admitted to the police in Hong Kong has greatly reduced, mainly due to the 2019 "Return" campaign in 2019, the Hong Kong police suppressed protests to let the police's reputation plummeted. The Guardian interviewed an interview with the Hong Kong Police Force for 20 years and is now <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反送中破坏警民关系-港警现离职潮/a-53070492"></a>Mr. Wan (transliteration) who immigrate overseas. Mr. Wan said: "(2019) The police in Hong Kong have become the object of hate in Hong Kong." He said: "I am no longer proud of being a member of the police force. The sense of mission. I don’t want to be a person I despise. "</p>
<p>Former Hong Kong Member of the Hong Kong member of Scottish Guo Zijian told the Guardian: "In the protests, the police are too humane. Even if the government provides a high salary, people's views on the police are so bad. No one wants to be excluded by friends and family members. So everyone will think twice before choosing to join the police. "</p>
<p>The salary of the Hong Kong Police Force has continued to rise in recent years. Grass -roots police officers have increased their starting salary points to HK $ 26,190, and the top salary can reach HK $ 38,365. The inspection salary is 48,500 yuan, and the top salary can reach HK $ 91,615. In contrast, Hong Kong people's monthly income is only 19,600 Hong Kong dollars, and the average monthly salary of university graduates is only about 22,166 yuan after investing in the workplace.</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua, a former assistant professor of the Department of Applied Social Sciences in Hong Kong, also said: "The police's image in society is very bad, so this profession has lost its attractiveness among young people. When the whole society despise the police profession, whoever wants to be should be a person. What about the police? "</p>
<h3>The voice of the family members of the Police Police</h3>
<p>However, the Hong Kong police said that in recent years, the attack on police officers had worried about the police inspectors, and even worried that serving as the police would bring danger to the security of themselves and their families. In addition, some social surveys have found that young people have confusion about choosing a job, and recruitment difficulties in all walks of life. Among them, the intention and interests of young people to participate in disciplinary forces are also very different from those of the past, which has also led to a decline in the number of applicants.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's "Dagong" also reported that from May 16th to 19th, the Hong Kong police recruitment team went to the mainland universities for police recruitment. Chen Jiefeng, a police officer of the Hong Kong Police Department, said that during the two -day itinerary of the Guangdong Station, 90 applications for Hong Kong students from Jinan University were received, and the number of applications was chased near November last year to receive 106 copies of the Hong Kong Police Force for the first time in Mainland universities to receive 106 copies. The total score of the application form.</p>

This article entitled "The Radical Transformation of the Chinese Economic Model" wrote that Xi Jinping is gradually deviating from Deng Xiaoping's economic model of "opening to the outside world":</p>
<p>"Xi Jinping's new political route is: In order to stabilize, it would rather sacrifice development vitality, and would rather reduce economic growth, and it could not allow private enterprises such as Alibaba or Tencent to have too much influence.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Deng Xiaoping model is the continuous flow of domestic and overseas capital inflows, Western technology transfer, loans of state -owned bank preferential loans, and a large number of migrant workers into cities to work. Their income is extremely low and lack of basic guarantees.</p>
<p>The serious social consequences caused by the Deng Xiaoping model should never be beautified, but it is very effective at the economy level and has created China's increasingly large middle class. However, this model has also greatly weakened the power of the Communist Party of China: foreign influences are becoming increasingly obvious, and the middle class is becoming more confident. Migrant workers who are dissatisfied with the status quo have frequently launched protests.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Xi Jinping's power, he believed that the phenomenon of corruption was close to the edge of the out of control, which not only permeated all aspects of the CCP's leadership structure, but also threatened the stability of the regime from a long -term perspective. In view of this, there is only one interpretation point for the starting point of economic policy changes in the past few years: Xi Jinping firmly believes that if the centrifugal power of the economic field cannot be controlled, the monopoly position of the Chinese Communist Party will face danger. "</p>
<p>Comments pointed out that whether it is a remediation actions for the high -tech industry, a heavy punch of the real estate industry, or the decoustal operation of the West, it is due to the consideration of stabilizing the Communist regime.</p>
<p>"In the past seventy -five years, Mao and Deng He Xi did not have essential differences. After all, Deng Xiaoping also ordered the dispatch of tanks to suppress the students who protested in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The parallel existence of the species system will not be crisis to the dominant position of the Communist Party: allowing economic free operation to provide enterprises with a certain degree of rule of law security without intervening in the specific decision -making of private enterprises. Change.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-24T14-08-00Z/3571195_7.jpg" />The reform and opening up policy opened in the late 1970s brought the rapid development of the Chinese economy. The picture shows the night view of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Another major difference is that the leaders of the Communist Party have emphasized that Taiwan should "return to the embrace of the motherland ', and never promise to abandon the means of force. But Xi Jinping was the first person when the economy was opened. Because of this, China is extremely sensitive to any criticism from the West.</p>
<p>All these, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为什么说中国不太可能再次拯救全球经济/a-65613569"></a>"</p>
<p>The "Pillar of Guo Yan", which aims to commemorate the "June 4th" dead, was confiscated and destroyed by the Hong Kong authorities, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/六四纪念日前夕国殇之柱落户柏林/a-65707655"></a>Essence The "Photo News" commented that the encounter of the "Pillar of Guo Yan" in Hong Kong is by no means individual. "The Communist Party of China has already begun to expand its ruling scope to the West of free and democracy. For this purpose, the means they use include intimidation, their methods of intimidation, and their useful means, including intimidation and intimidation, and their useful means, including intimidation, and intimidation, and their use of intimidation, and their use of intimidation, and their use of intimidation, and their use of intimidation and intimidation. Extract and spy. "Comments::</p>
<p>"The Federal German government promises to reduce the economic dependence of Germany to China, but so far, there are very few practical actions for this. For the issue of Chinese trample on human rights, the German government will only respond with vivid remarks.</p>
<p>On the issue of dealing with Beijing, Germany's epoch -making turning is urgent because our freedom is also in a dangerous situation. "</p>

So, in the face of the "clear zero" sealing control, the Chinese people are ready?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/6-05222023140017.html"><strong> Zhong Nanshan: At the end of June, it may be approved by the epidemic peak XBB mutant plant vaccine </strong></a>Recently, many Chinese netizens have exposed the results of positive antigen testing, and related entries such as "Eryang" and "New Crown" have also rushed on Weibo. Zhong Nanshan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and epidemic prevention experts, recently stated publicly that the second wave of epidemic this year was mainly caused by the Omikon XBB series of strains. A peak will appear in mid -April to the end of May. The second wave of peaks will occur at the end of June, and the number of infections can be as high as 65 million per week.</p>
<p>In the three years of the epidemic, the Chinese authorities have carried out the "clear zero" sealing control of tens of millions of population cities, which is still remembered to the outside world. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that behind Zhong Nanshan's warning, the authorities were also anxious to launch new vaccines to prepare for the peak of the epidemic.</p>
<p>When attending the forum event on May 22, Zhong Nanshan also emphasized that as far as the current Chinese epidemic prevention situation is concerned, disadvantaged groups with basic diseases should be vaccinated to prevent infection. He said that the cause of Omikon's infection was not simply severe pneumonia, "the current death is often the aggravation of the basic disease caused by the new crown virus."</p>
<p>Zhong Nanshan revealed that there are two vaccines that can currently cover the XBB new crown variants, and they have been initially approved. It is expected to be available soon. In addition, the other 3 to 4 vaccines should be approved soon. But he did not provide details such as clinical test results of these vaccines.</p>
<p>US think tank Foreign Relations Committee(Council on Foreign Relation)Huang Yanzhong, a senior researcher at global health issues, said in an interview with this station that it is important for vaccination to prevent infection in infection, but it does not require excessive rendering vaccine prevention effectiveness.</p>
<p>"(China's second wave of epidemic) should be more gentle and will not cause great damage to the socio -economic." He said, "I don't know if this new type of vaccine can cope with XBB strains. I think the vaccination vaccine It must be necessary, but it cannot be excessively emphasized and how effective rendering. We can see that so far, the effectiveness of the vaccine is mainly to prevent severe diseases, and the prevention of prevention may not be accurate. "</p>
<p>However, the new types of vaccines promoted by Chinese official media do not seem to win the general trust of the public. There are specialists to comment, "It has been proven in December last year that three -shot domestic vaccine and new clinical vaccine have been unable to play." Some people say, "I have not been ready to accept any new vaccine, and it has not yet obeyed it. The old vaccine is recovered. "Some netizens also teased the economic interests behind the vaccine, saying," The new vaccine is developed, how can it not be promoted? "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-24T14-22-00-04-00/000001.png" />On May 23, 2023, pedestrians on the streets of Beijing put on a mask. (Federation of the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Before the China Red Cross Foundation, Ren Ruihong told the station that the international medical community had consensus during the epidemic, that is, the effectiveness of the domestic medicine and Kexing vaccine launched by China, which is far lower than that of the European and American MRNA vaccines. In view of the impact caused by the first wave of epidemic, this time the Chinese public is more difficult to regain confidence in domestic vaccines.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, my friends and relatives have a cold response. They don't think what is the use of vaccines at that time. At that time, it was said that the vaccine prevention was prevented, but most people were still seriously ill." She said, "The new vaccine is a variant virus virus. Activated vaccine based on the basis, or the original vaccine, should not improve much in this case. "</p>
<p>According to the Chinese media "Science and Technology Daily", Xie Xiaoliang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and biophysical chemists, stated at a academic conference last week that the current epidemic trend is more ease, and there is a great chance that it will not repeat the wave of infection at the end of last year to the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported that although Chinese officials have repeatedly stated that a new wave of epidemic will be relatively mild, public health experts believe that China still needs more active vaccine enhancement plans and ensure the supply of antiviral drugs in hospitals.</p>
<p>Huang Yanzhong also emphasized that when Chinese officials and the public face the upcoming second wave of epidemic, they should actively prepare for prevention, but it is unnecessary to restart the previous rigorous epidemic prevention and control measures. He believes that the Chinese medical system has sufficient supply to basic home antiviral drugs, but the reserves and reimbursement work for intensive special effects such as Paxlovid (Paxlovid) need to be strengthened: "Strict measures are actually not unnecessary. , Focus on vaccination and introduce effective antiviral drugs, take preventive measures, such as wearing masks. If these basic measures are in place, there is nothing to worry about. "</p>
<p>Ren Ruihong also believes that on the one hand, it is afraid of the people's grievances, and on the other hand, the financial gaps in various places are too large, so it is difficult for the Chinese authorities to restart the past mandatory epidemic prevention measures.</p>
<p>The epidemic report released by the Beijing CDC shows that since April 24, Beijing's new crown virus infection and anti -influenza have returned to the number one type of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>As for the soldiers signed a contract with the Wagner Group, the proportion of death was similar, but Porigjin did not provide exact figures.</p>

Ten years later, this policy has also become the core of China's foreign economic policy.</p>
<p>However, for countries participating in the "Belt and Road" project, accepting China's "assistance" funds have undoubtedly become a double -edged sword, and even negative consequences of unexpectedly.</p>
<p><strong> The "Belt and Road" ignores the fundamental demand of developing countries </strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Wilson Center in Washington think tank in the United States held a seminar on the impact of the "Belt and Road" on the world.</p>
<p>At the seminar, Narasritharan, a postdoctoral researcher at the US Public Data Center aid data (Aiddata), pointed out that China has greatly invested in Sri Lanka through the “Belt and Road” through the “Belt and Road”, but ignored the local human rights issues: The differences have not yet been resolved after the war. If it is a assistant in the West, they will coordinate the post -war conflict and ask the local government to investigate the crime of war; Differential differences are still rising. "</p>
<p>Nara also said that China aid Sri Lanka is not like Western countries. It assists the areas with the worst impact of the civil war. Instead, it is to choose to invest in port areas that are conducive to developing the China ’s“ Maritime Silk Road ”policy.</p>
<p>Nara pointed out that the Chinese authorities should pay more attention to social issues of developing countries, deal with national differences, and avoid the resurgence of civil war in developing countries. China needs to measure how to assist Sri Lanka. I believe that if the aid country has a way to repay the debt, this will help China's interests; if the aid countries re -start the civil war, they will reduce the possibility of repaying Chinese debt.

<p><strong> China thinks that "development" can solve all problems </strong></p>
<p>Mattferchen, a senior researcher at the Leiden Asia Center, also pointed out at the meeting that the Chinese authorities can solve all social problems through development: "Former Chinese Minister of Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in 2019, 'Development It is the key to solving all problems'. China has similar views in the internal affairs and diplomacy: in the late 1970s, the Chinese authorities believe that development is required; ... in terms of diplomacy, China also believes that development can bring peace to peace And security. "</p>
<p>Chen Yixiu pointed out that in fact, the development of the economy does not solve all social problems, especially in China since 2003, it has provided investment and assistance to the outside world. These policies have caused many people's livelihood problems at that time. However, when China was promoting the "Belt and Road", it did not take care of the previous problems, which caused the current situation to deteriorate: "environmental problems, conflicts with the people, lack of communication with local groups, liabilities, etc. Many existing negative issues exist before the implementation of the "Belt and Road" in China. "</p>
<p><strong> China helps developing countries to strengthen authoritarian monitoring </strong></p>
<p>At the seminar, Jonathansolis, a assistance data analyst at high -level research analysts, also pointed out that the Chinese authorities assisted the authoritarian government of developing countries through the "Belt and Road" project through the "Belt and Road" project: "The first is the system system Sexual tools, such as controlling the telecommunications field through legislation or government organizations. After all, the Chinese government has fully controlled technologies for its domestic telecommunications fields. We have found that many developing countries directly copy related laws of China and Russia to allow them The law serves the person in power. "</p>
<p>Solis added: "The second is technical, removed or attack related software through digital technology to block specific web pages or conduct network review; the last one is a traditional approach. What information is posted on the Internet, and government personnel will harass and arrest netizens the next day. "</p>
<p>According to Reuters on Wednesday, according to the relevant network security research reports, the testimony of many sources, and the technical data analysis of the Kenyan government of the Chinese liabilities country, it is found that when Kenya is caught in a Chinese debt trap, the Chinese network hacker targets Kenya, including Kenya, including Kenya Eight government departments, including the president's office, conducted several years of cyber attacks. Sources pointed out that at least some of the goals of Chinese hackers are to obtain information on Kenya and related East Africa countries on repaying Beijing's debt capabilities. These contents include China's repayment strategy of investing in countries in Africa, and whether related liabilities are possibilities for further compromise.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said "unknown" for the above hacker attack news, while the Chinese embassy in the UK stated that China opposes "all forms of cyber attacks and theft behaviors."</p>

This incident has attracted great attention, because Guam has the Pacific port and the huge U.S. Air Force base, which is the core of any military response to Taiwan's invasion or blockade of Taiwan.

<p>Reuters reported that Crimea Russia's head, Sergei Aksyonov, said earlier on Wednesday that the Russian authorities have closed the bridge for several hours due to "performing exercises".</p>
<p>It is unclear what the "exercise" referred to by the Russian authorities means.</p>
<p>However, according to a video released by a Russian media on social platforms, the main span position of the bridge's central center has emerged with white smoke during the "exercise", and more smoke rises from a passage on the bridge.</p>

<p>This is a bridge built four years after Russia occupied Crimea in 2014. It costs 228 billion rubles (nearly S $ 3.8 billion). In addition to strategic significance, it is also an important image project of Russian President Putin.</p>
<p>The Crimea Bridge is connected to Krasnodar and Crimea cities in southern Russia, which spans the strait between the Black Sea and the Azov.</p>

<p>In the melodious music of the French composer Claude Debussy, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, will and the first two presidents Jean-Claude Trichet and Mario Draghi ) Cut off the birthday cake of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>But when the European economy is challenging, the atmosphere of celebration is probably not as the joy of the European Central Bank's heads.</p>
<p>In the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine's push for energy prices and the recovery of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), the recovery of the supply chain has soared in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>This attractive economic indicator came to 7%in April. Although 10.6%fell at a high point in October last year, it is still much higher than the 2%target of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on the eve of the 25th birthday of the European Central Bank, President Lagarda optimisticly emphasized "there are sufficient reasons to celebrate."</p>
<p>Latter said in an interview with Dutch TV program buitenhof last week: "25 years ago, our goal was to maintain stability of prices, maintain European sovereignty, and show more unity."</p>
<p>"I think we have all achieved these three goals."</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China was founded in 1998 and launched the euro the following year.</p>
<p>Since the emergence of the euro in 1999, the per capita domestic production hair (GDP) per capita in the euro area has doubled; the unemployment rate of the euro zone has dropped to a historical low.</p>
<p>Although the recent inflation has reached a new high, in the 25 years since the establishment of the European Central Bank, an average inflation was 2.05%, close to the European Central Bank's target 2%.</p>
<p>In 2011, Terrie, then the president of the European Central Bank, raised interest rates many times when the economic performance of the euro zone was different, and forced Delagi to cut interest rates immediately as soon as he came to power.</p>
<p>Draggy itself is also criticized for the management style of the European debt crisis. Critics pointed out that the Dragi Central Bank Management Commission was split. Most members of the European Central Bank Management Commission are mostly president of the central bank of European countries.</p>
<p>However, analysts said that Lagarde has successfully healed division.</p>

After netizens complained about Cathay Pacific in the mainland's social media, Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao and Cathay Chief Executive Officer publicly apologized on May 24. Cathay Pacific decided to fire three air waiters involved in the incident. The official media "People's Daily" stated that it is necessary to "rectify heavy punch" for Cathay Pacific.

In addition, in recent years, Hong Kong people have deepened their dissatisfaction with mainland China, and Cathay Pacific incident occurred in this context. However, the Hong Kong government only looks at the surface and refuses to face the root cause of the problem.</p>
