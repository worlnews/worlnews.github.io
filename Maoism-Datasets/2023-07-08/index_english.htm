<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Berlin, 7th) Jane Diski, an administrator of a community apartment in Bavarian, Bavarian, southeast Germany, was charged with suspected killing of an elderly female tenant. After several litigation, it took more than 13 years in the prison. The court was not guilty and will be compensated by injustice.</p>

The ministry drowned her in the bathtub, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Janeyki has always denied the murder in the long -term litigation war, and this case has attracted much attention from the country. Now the judge of the Munich District Court ruled that Jane Diski was misjudged and ordered him to compensate him nearly 369,000 euros (about 12.61 million yuan). The latest judgment results seized media headlines.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the court said the new evidence showed that the deceased died unexpectedly. "This is not a murder together. He has been declared innocent and is innocent."</p>
<p>According to media reports, Jane Diski listened to his expression without expression, and many of his supporters in the court were happy.</p>
<p>Jane Diski, 63, had previously successfully turned the case in the federal court, but later was guilty of being convicted by the Munich Court in 2012.</p>
<p>When he was tried this time, the defense lawyer Regina Rick was able to put forward new evidence that the water temperature of the dead bath tank of the deceased's body was different from the initial infer of the initial inferring because of the progress of scientific scientific progress.</p>
<p>The defense also submitted a second scientific report to the court, showing that the computer simulation results confirmed that the deceased might die.</p>
<p>Because the outside world had a lot of questioning of Jane Disky's guilty judgment, and he had no criminal record before, Rick fought for her customers in August last August to release pre -release in August last year. Jane Diski returned home and served as a driver in a cheese factory.</p>
<p>At the end of the case, even the prosecutor also advocated that Jane Diski was not guilty. The court spokesman said that the verdict "is based on the report on the latest method of experts to study, and there is no available method in previous convictions."</p>
<p>Jane Diski spent 4915 days in the prison. He missed his children's growth and had no chance to see his grandson birth. He was finally sentenced to innocence. He sighed and said, "This is a tragedy, it is difficult to express it."</p>

<p>The "Chip and Science Act" passed by the United States in 2022 provided US $ 53 billion aid and subsidies to companies producing semiconductors in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zwgk/gkzcfb/202307/20230703419666.shtml">China announced</a><strong> Export control of the correlation items of the two metals, the two metals, from August 1st, is called the purpose of "maintaining national security and interests." </strong></p>
<p>These two metals are the key raw materials for manufacturing semiconductors. China's move is generally considered to be the latest countermeasures in the US -China chip war. Both the United States and China hope to occupy a dominant position in military core technology.</p>
<p>When the move was announced, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited China.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and the Biden government have adopted a series of measures in restricting the exports of Hua Gao technology. Especially in October last year, the Bayeng government has implemented more comprehensive restrictions to prohibit the use of American equipment and technology manufacturing. High -end chip exports to China. These measures have severely damaged China's high -end semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>China currently has no advantages in designing and manufacturing high -end semiconductors. Some analysts point out that China is using its dominant position in the rare metal market to try to counter Western export control.</p>
<p>"The Biden government has taken very targeted actions for the supply of high -end semiconductor chips, and Beijing has no other choices to confront them." Said Aadil Bra, a visiting scholar of Taipei National University of Political University.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that Beijing is taking action through export control and taking action in the scientific and technological warfare with Washington." He said, "This is a pure way of scientific and technological competition with teeth."</p>
<p>Wei Jianguo, deputy director of the China International Economic Exchange Center and former deputy minister of the Ministry of Commerce, said in an interview with the Chinese Daily Newspaper "China Daily" recently, "This is just the beginning of China's countermeasures. . If the restrictions on Hua Ga's technology will continue to be upgraded, China's countermeasures will be further upgraded. "</p>

Especially in October last year, the Bayeng government has implemented more comprehensive restrictions to prohibit the use of American equipment and technology manufacturing. High -end chip exports to China. These measures have severely damaged China's high -end semiconductor industry.</p>
<h3>American, Europe expressed concerns</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the US Department of Commerce said on Wednesday that the United States "resolutely" opposed China's export control of 镓 and 锗 material, and said that Washington will negotiate with partners and allies to solve this problem.</p>
<p>"These actions highlight the diversification of the supply chain. The United States will solve this problem with our allies and partners and establish flexibility in the critical supply chain," said Reuters, a spokesman for the US Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>EUROPEANCOMMISION also expressed concerns. His spokesman said on Tuesday afternoon that "镓 and 锗" is vital to our industry, especially in the strategic field, and (in a sense), we rely on a single supplier. "</p>
<p>The spokesman publicly questioned China's defense on the grounds of "national security", and urged China to consistent its trade policies with the World Trade Organization and based on "clear security considerations".</p>
<h3>镓? What is it? What is the purpose?</h3>
<p>Both 色 and 镓 are silver -white metals, and usually do not exist in nature. They are by -products for processing zinc, coal, and aluminum mine, which can be used after recycling.</p>
<p>These two metals are widely used in manufacturing semiconductors, communication equipment and solar panels.</p>
<p>In terms of semiconductors, combining 锗 and 锗 and other elements, respectively, can improve the speed and efficiency of transmission. For example, the compound of the pupa is nitride, and the U.S. military uses it for radar manufacturing. Another arsenide is more resistant to high temperature and humidity than commonly used semiconductor materials, and has better conductivity, so it is widely used for high -performance chips.</p>
<p>According to data from the market research institution Precept, the sales of chips using nitride last year reached US $ 2.47 billion, and it is expected to climb to 19.3 billion US dollars in 2030.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Research and Markets of research institutions, it is expected that by 2030, chips produced with gallium arsenidium will increase from $ 1.4 billion last year to $ 3.4 billion.</p>

<h3>How important is China?</h3>
<p>China is the largest producer of Kazuki, which has led China to occupy a strong dominant position on the global supply chain.</p>
<p>According to data from the European Industry Association Key Raw Materials Alliance (CRMA), China's cricket output accounts for about 80%of the global total output; 锗 output accounts for about 60%of the world's.</p>
<p>According to the US Geologicalsurvey (US Geologicalsurvey), 53%of the United States from 2018 to 2021 came from China, followed by Germany, Japan, Ukraine, etc. After the United States levied higher tariffs on China, imports in 2019 declined significantly.</p>
<p>According to Chinese customs data, in 2022, the largest importing country of Chinese products is Japan, Germany and the Netherlands. 是 The main import countries of products are Japan, France, Germany and the United States.</p>
<h3>What other countries are produced?</h3>
<p>Both metals of 金 and 两 are not particularly rare, but the processing costs are high. Because China has been exporting at relatively low prices for a long time, there are almost no mining facilities elsewhere.</p>
<p>According to CRU Group, the metal industry intelligence provider, other countries producing crickets include Japan, South Korea, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>比 is also produced in Canada, Belgium, the United States and Russia. Some analysts have pointed out that there are a large number of mines in the United States and other places. However, due to environmental impacts, it is difficult to replace China immediately in terms of environmental impact.Image source, getty images</p>
<h3>How to affect the supply chain?</h3>
<p>Comprehensive analysis pointed out that China ’s export ban will have a certain degree of impact in the short term, but it still needs to be observed in the long run.</p>
<p>Hindu scholar Bi Qingdian in Taiwan said, "In the short term, the cost of semiconductor chips may increase because suppliers need to purchase these two substances from other sources. China's output of these two substances has begun to top."</p>
<p>He also said, "The United States and other countries are seeking to replace China's share in the global mineral trade. If it cannot be reached an agreement on some semiconductor sanctions on China, Beijing's export control may accelerate this process."</p>
<p>According to many foreign media reports, the United States is considering expanding export control over the Chinese chip industry. It is unclear what the specific measures are.</p>
<p>Bi Qingdian believes that because the United States is about to enter the presidential election stage, it is unlikely to cancel sanctions so soon. When the alternative supply of and 锗 锗 is established, the price of semiconductors will eventually decline.</p>
<p>"In this case, China will be a loser."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T01-19-22.000Z/_130303799_gettyimages-1412784748.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Paultriolo, a senior researcher at the Senior Researcher of the CNTER for Strategic and Internationalstudies, told Hong Kong media that "If China chooses these supply chain weapons, it will reduce the United States, the European Union and Asia to reduce The consideration of China's dependence is greatly complicated. "</p>
<p>He also said, "Even if it is only part of the reconstruction of the key mineral supply chain, it takes a long time and investment."</p>
<p>Joo Young-Joon, the first official of the Ministry of Commerce Resources of South Korea, told the media that China's latest export control measures may have limited impact in the short term, but uncertainty still exists. He said: "It is unclear how long China's export control will last, and the possibility of expanding the ban to other projects cannot be ruled out."</p>
<p>The South Korean government plans to further diversify the procurement route of key materials and develop alternative materials for industries imported from specific countries.</p>
<p>The Japanese government also said on Tuesday that it is evaluating the relevant influence and promised to take measures to diversify the procurement of materials.</p>

<h3>Wagner's mercenary rebellion: Belarus leader Lukashenko said no one in the rebellion became a hero</h3>
<ul>
<li>Steve Rosenberg * BBC Reporter in Russia from Minsk</li>
</ul>
<p>July 7, 2023 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-66130115/p0fzj2zf/zh-hans">Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-66130115/P0FZJ2ZF/ZH-HansS</a><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T05-35-37.000Z/p0fzj3j0.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Will Belarus use nuclear weapons deployed by Russia? President Lukashenko answered like this</p>
<p><strong> It is said that Alexander Lukashenko, a Belarusian leader, promoted an agreement to end Wagner's mercenary rebellion. </strong></p>
<p>If this rumor is true, it will be the most vague part of this story. Therefore, if anyone can reveal the truth of this unknown story, it must be the Belarusian leader. At least we want this.</p>
<p>We are one of the few reporters who have been invited to the Minsk Independence Palace and Lukashenko.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, people kept guessing what his health was. However, the Belarusian strong man in front of me obviously had good energy. The "dialogue" lasted for nearly four hours.</p>
<p>However, he did not provide any key information for the recent Russian uprising, but made the information more chaotic.</p>
<p>According to the agreement between the Wagner Group and the Kremlin, the leader of the Wagner Group Yaviggeni Porigerin should move to Belarus with his mercenaries.</p>
<p>But this did not happen. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Lukashenko said: "Until this morning, these important Wagner soldiers are still stationed on the camp after the evacuation of the Bach Murut."</p>

<p>Russia claims to transport nuclear warheads to Belarus.</p>
<p>"As for Porigin, he is in St. Petersburg. Or maybe he flew to Moscow this morning. Or he may be in other places. But he is not in Belarus."</p>
<p>I asked Lukashenko whether this this means that the agreement is broken? He denied it. But I feel that there may be a conversation that we will not be told behind the scenes.</p>
<p>When discussing the problem of Wagner's rebellion, in fact, the positions of Moscow and Minsk were not completely consistent.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Russian National Television announced that Putin became a hero after these dramatic events.</p>
<p>"I think no one can become a hero in that case," Lukashenko said to me.</p>
<p>"Purigzin is not, Putin is not, and Lukashenko is not. There are no heroes. What are the lessons from this? If we create such armed organizations, we need to pay close attention to them and give serious attention. "</p>

<p>"God bless me without having to make a decision to use them," said Lukashenko. But he recently said, "But I will not hesitate to use them."</p>
<p>I remind him of these words.</p>
<p>"Joe Biden can also say the same thing, and Prime Minister Sonak," Lukashenko answered me. He added, "There are also my friends Xi Jinping and my elder brother President Putin."</p>
<p>I added, "But what we talk about is not your weapon, they are Russian weapons. This will not be your decision."</p>
<p>The leader retorted me, "In Ukraine, the entire army is using foreign weapons to fight, right? And NATO weapons. This is because Ukraine has exhausted his weapon. So why can't I use other people's weapons to fight combat Woolen cloth?"</p>
<p>But we are talking about nuclear weapons, not pistols, I replied.</p>
<p>"Nuclear weapons, yes. They are also weapons, tactical nuclear weapons." He answered me like this.</p>
<p>From these reviews about nuclear weapons, you may guess that Lukashenko is a controversial person.</p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom do not recognize him as a legal president of Belarus.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Belarusi people stepped on the street and accused him of stealing the presidential election of the country. The protests were brutally suppressed.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about this," he claims.</p>
<p>I reminded Mr. Lukashenko, "When I visited you in the fall of 2021, there were 873 political prisoners in Belarus, and it has now increased to 1,500 people."</p>
<p>"There is no clause on political crimes in our criminal law," he answered me.</p>
<p>However, I pointed out that there is no political prisoner without law about political crimes.</p>
<p>However, he insisted on responding, "If there are no relevant laws, prisoners cannot be regarded as political prisoners. How could they be a political prisoner?"</p>

<p>As the third largest party in the United Kingdom, the scale of the Liberal Democratic Party's training base surprised me -700 people can be trained at the same time, equipped with a full set of supporting and residential equipment, which is no different from hotel facilities. There are members of the training, as well as supporters and candidates who are preparing to run.</p>

<p>Zibo's outdoor barbecue provides people with delicious and low -cost leisure diet.</p>
<p><strong><em>* Zibo, Shandong Province, is experiencing a wave of outdoor barbecue. </em>* </strong></p>
<p>People from all over China come here to taste the famous lamb skewers, which has become a legend in social media.</p>
<p>This is a very noisy experience, and it is definitely not suitable for timid people.</p>
<p>The streets are crowded with people. You sit on a small plastic chair, drink beer, roll the meat pieces with the local onion cakes, and all sides are karaoke.</p>
<p>At first glance, these people seem to show a strong rebound after the emergency state of the crown epidemic -but according to economists, the truth is not the case.</p>
<p>They said that this is more that people have found a cheap and delicious choice under the face of great pressure on household income.</p>

<p>The lamb skewers and karaoke of Zibo barbecue restaurants have attracted people from all over the country.</p>
<p>A shirtless man told us that this was the ideal place for him and his family on the hot summer night, and the cost performance of this gameplay was in line with the current reality.</p>
<p>"This place is very suitable for the people," he said. "It is difficult to make money recently, but it is still easy to spend money. After three years of epidemic, the economy is just recovering slowly."</p>
<p>Chinese university graduates are particularly seriously impacted by economic downturn, and the unemployment rate has been hovering at 20%or more.</p>
<p>Some students are disturbed by their future.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm worried," said a girl who was about to graduate. "The competition is fierce and it is difficult to find a job. All my classmates have the same pressure."</p>
<p>For those who have a job, economic protection is an important reason for their unwillingness to spend more money.</p>
<p>They are worried that they may accidentally fall into the ranks of unemployment, and in many cases, the biggest investment of their family is not as valuable as they originally imagined.</p>
<p>China's real estate industry is under tremendous pressure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66131340/p0fzj6jm/zh-hans">Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/Chinese-News-66131340/P0FZJ6jm/ZH-HansS</a><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T08-18-28.000Z/p0fzj7g6.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>The hot Zibo barbecue and vacant Qingdao real estate reflect the reality of China's economic downturn</p>
<p>In order to understand this in person, we drove from Zibo to east for a few hours and came to a much larger city of Qingdao.</p>
<p>Here, the rapid outbreak of real estate does not match the real needs of buyers or tenants, and as a result, a large number of real estate built is rarely living inside.</p>
<p>A woman sells cold noodles on a mobile booth outside her residential area, and she has very few neighbors.</p>
<p>A few years ago, her husband bought a apartment here after moving to Qingdao. Because I heard that the school here is good, I want to give the child a better starting point.</p>
<p>I asked her if she was worried about her house depreciation.</p>
<p>"Of course worry," she said, "But what can I do?"</p>
<p>A couple next to the street cleaners were stopped for lunch. They pointed at the building behind them and said that no one lived there.</p>
<p>Opposite the road is a small piece of concrete real estate. The outer wall has no painting and no windows. The window frame looks dilapidated because of long exposure.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T08-18-28.000Z/_130310369_1478460f-0eb1-4546-bae0-e269595e621a.jpg" />Image source, Joyce LiU/BBC</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The outbreak of real estate in Qingdao exceeds the needs of buyers and tenants.</p>
<p>"The construction project over there suddenly stopped working last year," the man said.</p>
<p>According to his wife, the entire block is quite deserted. "There is nothing here, there is no gas station, and you have to go far away. Living here is very inconvenient," she said.</p>
<p>This place used to have hope to take off. At that time, the city hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping also recognized the investment and business of this place. Here it may also become the place of the International Expo and other activities.</p>
<p>Originally, there would be people who hired houses, startups, or other companies to buy houses here, but the fact is that there are not many companies.</p>
<p>According to a local real estate agent, the property sales in the area have been halved in recent years.</p>
<p>"The price decline is because of the market saturation," she said. "Too many houses have been built, it is difficult to sell."</p>
<p>We put a drone, and the scene overlooking from the air was worse than we saw on the ground.</p>
<p>A new real estate that is completely stopped around can be seen around, and the real estate that has been completed is almost not angry.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The prosperity of China's real estate has made the housing prices in many large cities exceed the ability of ordinary families.</p>
<p>Moreover, supply and demand issues are not unique to this area, or even the city. In China, it is easy to find evidence that real estate bubbles bring in danger.</p>
<p>In this country, one of the reasons for the proliferation of real estate speculation is the lack of other investment options. However, the prosperity of real estate has made the housing prices of many large cities exceed the ability of ordinary families. The government's response to this is to limit the number of personal purchase of houses.</p>
<p>This is a sincere attempt to make equal reforms, but now there is pressure to reverse this direction. In Qingdao, such measures have been relaxed, so as to bring stimulus to the stagnant real estate market.</p>
<p>The challenges faced by Chinese policy makers are to find a way to get economic growth and business confidence from getting rid of the heavy dependence of this real estate sales.He told the BBC in Australia: "China's economy urgently needs to be re -balanced. In the past two or three decades, the Chinese economy has increased huge growth through large -scale infrastructure construction and a substantial growth in the real estate market. The method is not sustainable. "</p>
<p>"Look at the world, developed economies need family as a key driving force for economic growth, and this is not available in China."</p>
<p>From reducing interest rates to cash allowances, the Chinese government is considering promoting individuals and enterprises to increase consumption in various ways.</p>
<p>However, the problem is emotion.</p>
<p>When there are more jobs, people will feel more secure. Enterprises need investment to create more employment opportunities, but when consumers lack security, companies are unwilling to do so.</p>
<p>As Harry Mufi Cruise said: "This is a bit like a chicken and egg. Without corporate expenditure, there will be no economic recovery. They will not spend before they see the recovery. So they become a The deadlock hinders the development of the key part of the economy. "</p>
<p>All these issues may affect global trade.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>On the other hand, Qingdao's beach shows that tourism is recovering</p>
<p>China is a big country. The ripples that occur in the world's second largest economy will cause waves.</p>
<p>The production output here has decreased -due to weak international demand -leading to decline in exports and decreased supply in Chinese manufacturing goods globally, the commercial activities of large Asian factories will decrease. After that, China's slowdown consumption means that the import of products of other countries will decrease.</p>
<p>For the Chinese government, the headache may have to make a choice or seek short -term stimulus measures. This will delay the re -balance it needs to face, or to bear more instant pain, so as to start a long -term solution to solve the long -term solution faster plan.</p>
<p>Naturally, there must be almost someone in Beijing's high levels of power. Some people are considering taking some intermediate routes. They first take slightly promoting measures to stabilize the economy, and then consider greater problems on hand.</p>
<p>Because they know that once negative emotions are formed, it may be difficult to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>However, if you want to be optimistic about Qingdao and life itself, you can go to the beach. In the famous coastline here, the tourism industry seems to have recovered.</p>
<p>There is a smile there, a sand castle piled up by tourists. Whether it is an industrial giant or a truck driver, everyone here is enjoying the embrace of the sea.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is in line with reality, here you can hardly feel that although everything is difficult, it will be better in the future.</p>

Among them, the judgments such as Harvard and other universities considering racial factors in enrollment violations based on the equal rights bill, which can be said to be a victory of common sense. It has a significant impact on future Asians' life in the United States.</p>
<p>First of all, let's review the history of the equality bill. In the 1960s, the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King changed the appearance of the United States. The Activity Act is an important result of the civil rights movement and one of the derivatives of the Civil Rights Law in 1964. It aims to take care of ethnic minorities in enrollment and employment. According to this bill, public schools in the United States have the responsibility to adopt a quota or extra point in enrollment to allow ethnic minorities to give priority to admission. In order to promote the diversification of American society, the bill has played an important role in creating equal opportunities for ethnic minorities in universities, workplace, and officialdom.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本核废水排海在即-原子能机构再赴福岛审查/a-65763766">UN International Atomic Energy Agency</a>A comprehensive report of safety review released this week states that Japan will be stored in the Water Election of Water Dedication at the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛废水排海iaea评估为安全-中国反对/a-66111067">conforms to the safety standards of atomic energy institutions</a>Essence The agency supports Tokyo Electric Power Corporation to discharge the ocean with a processing nuclear waste water that is equivalent to about 500 Olympic pool capacity. These nuclear waste water is a polluting water used to cool down the tsunami in the 2011 Japanese earthquake that causes tsunami to cool down the nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Although Japan guarantees that the wastewater is safe after filtering and removing most of the isotopes, the emission water plan is still <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛核废水倾倒海洋-渔民说不-中韩反对-美国支持/a-57244397">being opposed by domestic and foreign at home and abroad</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T08-46-00Z/66108983_401.png" />Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will discharge the ocean to about 500 Olympic pool capacity of the nuclear waste water.</p>
<p>The China Customs General Administration announced on Friday (July 7) that "in order to prevent Japanese food in China with radioactive pollution and protect Chinese consumers imported food safety, Chinese Customs prohibits the import of ten counties (cadres), including Fukushima in Japan, Strictly review the attached certification documents, strictly review foods, especially aquatic products (including edible aquatic animals), strengthen supervision, strictly implement 100%inspection, and continue to strengthen the detection and monitoring of radioactive substances to ensure the safety of Japanese food in Japan. Strictly prevent the input of risks. "</p>
<p>The General Administration of Customs of China also said: "The International Atomic Energy Agency has recently reported the opinions of the comprehensive evaluation report released by the Fukushima nuclear pollution water in Japan, which failed to fully reflect the opinions of all experts participating in the evaluation work. Approve. There are still many problems in the Japanese side's legitimacy, the reliability of purification devices, and the perfectness of the monitoring solution. "</p>
<p>Last year, China was the largest buyer in Japan's seafood exports, although China was one of the countries that restricted food imported from some parts of Japan due to the nuclear accident.</p>
<p>China is also the most intense critic of this drainage plan in Japan, saying that this threatens marine life and human health.</p>
<p>China had previously warned that Japan must "bear all the consequences of its actions." The implementation of the plan will begin in the next few weeks, and it will take up to 40 years to discharge.</p>
<p>Three Japanese government officials and a ruling member of the ruling party have said in an anonymous interview with Reuters in recent days that they expect that China will expand its restrictions on Japanese seafood.</p>
<p>"We think they may have a comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood." A official said, "They want to punish Japan economy."</p>
<p>He said: "For China, Japanese seafood imports only account for a small part of its market ... but for Japan, this is a large market."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T08-46-00Z/66109322_401.png" />The comprehensive report of safety review issued by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency this week pointed out that Japan's plans to store the water -rowed sea of water storage in the Fukushima first nuclear power plant meet the safety standards of atomic energy agencies.</p>
<h3>Some Chinese consumers call for resistance to Japanese products</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan stated that Japan had conducted scientific discussions with China on the issue of emissions and will continue.</p>
<p>China has prohibited seafood from 10 counties (including Fukushima Prefecture and Capital Tokyo) from 47 counties in Japan since 2011, and prohibit all food and feed from 9 counties from 9 counties. Do radioactive testing.</p>
<p>Japan's data show that most of the seafood fishing in Japanese fisheries consume in China. Despite the ban, China was still the largest buyer in Japan's seafood last year (calculated by value).</p>
<p>The Chinese market accounts for 22.5%of Japan's seafood exports, worth 87 billion yen (US $ 604 million), followed by Hong Kong (19.5%) and the United States (13.9%). China has purchased more than half of the total exports of Japanese scallops.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government said on Tuesday that when Japan began to implement an emission plan, Hong Kong will "immediately take control measures, including import control to aquatic products from high -risk counties."</p>
<p>China said that after the implementation of emissions plans in Japan, it will strengthen monitoring of marine and seafood.</p>
<p>South Korean consumers snap up sea salt and other products before the implementation of the emission plan. The South Korean government also promised to strengthen monitoring and try to alleviate public concerns, but did not threaten to expand its ban on Japanese products.</p>
<p>In China, some consumers have called for anti -Japanese products on social media. This wave of public opinion briefly cracked down on the stock price of Japanese cosmetics manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</p>

<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly rose. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."#</p>

<h3>Place of cooling water</h3>
<p>The damaged Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station scene at the scene of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is the focus of controversy. According to the authorities, these water storage tanks must be removed before rebuilding. These water is mainly used for cooling reactors after the disaster.</p>

<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<p>The radiation test standards cited by the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation and the Tokyo government are stricter than other countries that are also discharged.

<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns. He said that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation announced that the emission of polluting water was "unfortunate" for the fisheries that have just recovered in the region.</p>

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can." He said in an interview with Reuters and asked, "Why do you put water to the waters of Fukushima, why not put water to Tokyo or Osaka?" He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Since Russia launched the war against Ukraine in February 2022, Germany provided weapons, ammunition, equipment and training in Ukrainian soldiers in Germany, which was thus stabbed densely by the Russian intelligence department. The German Military Anti -Love News Agency (MAD) reported that Russia reached a new scale in Germany's intelligence activities.</p>
<p>The report states that the number of intelligence personnel sent by Russia shows the value of German military intelligence. In April 2022, after the outbreak of the Russian war against Ukraine, the German federal government announced that 40 Russian diplomats were "unpopular people." These diplomats were expelled from Germany and caused a blow to Russia's previous efficient spy activity in Germany. However, it can be determined that the Russian intelligence department will take other means to continue to obtain information.</p>
<p>According to the report, Russia's intention and ability to exploration of NATO key infrastructure and the intention and ability to destruct in some cases is a threat that must be treated seriously.</p>
<p>In addition, from 2021 to 2022, Russia also took a variety of measures to try to impact public opinions. This includes not only in Germany, but also the countries where the Federal Defense Force is stationed, such as the Baltic countries.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T10-27-00Z/66119575_401.png" />The Federal Defense Force provides training for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. This is the badge of a training Ukrainian soldier</p>
<p><strong>China</strong></p>
<p>For China, the report wrote: "China continues to hope to become a world power before 2049. And this idea is realized by the" Made in China 2025 'and the "New Silk Road Movement". "The report stated that it was to achieve this goal. The means also include online spies and traditional <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国内政部长要求加强防范来自中国的间谍活动/a-65840153">espionage</a>Wait for many ways.</p>
<p>The report states that for <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国三大情报机构警告不要对专制中国太天真/a-63472850">China</a>In terms of intelligence department, the common activities of the German Federal Defense Force under the framework of military cooperation are of special significance. These military cooperation includes: military training assistance, joint drill plan, and delegation visit. The report said that these military training aids lasted for several months, while Chinese participants used the contact authority of the Federal Defense Force and personnel to collect information intensively. In addition, another piercing focus on Chinese intelligence departments in Germany is in the field of academic research and research and development.</p>
<p>The report states that not only the formal staff of the embassy and consulate engaged in intelligence, but also the traditional spy staff who have been recruited or hidden.</p>
<p>The main tasks of the German Military Anti -Love News Agency include the protection of the Federal Defense Forces from [Spy activity] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/情报机构瑞士成为中俄间谍活动的中心/a-66035871">espionage</a>Damage and inspection of extremist personnel within the Federal Defense Force and a safety review of soldiers and civilian staff. The German Ministry of Defense has previously announced the number of cases of suspected extremism, which has declined significantly. The Military Anti-Love News Agency set seven people as right-wing extremists from 2021-2022.</p>
<p>The number of workers in the military anti -intelligence bureau increased. From January 2023, there were 1917 positions (1824 in 2022 and 1632 in 20121). The report believes that the agency has previously merged anti -spy and anti -polar endism into a department. The effect is not good and needs to be restarted. In view of Russia's war against Ukrainian aggression, "strengthening the combat spy activities and preventing possible damage to the unprecedented urgency".</p>

<p>The Chinese market accounts for 22.5%of Japan's seafood exports, worth 87 billion yen (US $ 604 million), followed by Hong Kong (19.5%) and the United States (13.9%). China has purchased more than half of the total exports of Japanese scallops.</p>
<p>On the 7th, the South Korean government released a research report on the safety of Nuclear pollution water in Fukushima in Japan, stating that if the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation in Japan complies with the disposal regulations, the radioactive material concentration will meet the emission standards and target values, which also meets international standards.</p>
<p>However, South Korea has not canceled the import ban on Fukushima aquatic products. According to the Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean government said that the international atomic agency determined that the Japanese nuclear sewage discharge plan meets the standard and the South Korean government prohibits the import of Fukushima aquatic products. The Changquan of the Korean Food and Medical Products Safety Division pointed out that Japan has not been able to submit high -concentration pollution water flowing into the sea in the Fukushima nuclear leakage accident and data contained in its nuclear. Because it cannot judge its impact, import controls are not judged. The measures will be maintained.</p>
<p>South Korea has banned all the aquatic products produced in eight counties such as Fukushima in Fukushima from September 2013.</p>

<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant.

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can."

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p>The last meeting record of the Feds showed that decision -making officials planned to raise interest rates again this month, which caused a blow to the market, because the market originally believed that the Feds' Association had reached or approached the final stage of the interest rate increase cycle. The Federal Reserve was suspended for the first time last month.</p>
<p>At the same time, China's data confirmed that after a few months of canceling the zero -clearing policy, the recovery of the second largest economy in the world has lost motivation. Investors are now preparing for non -agricultural employment data that will attract much attention today. This data is used as an important basis for measuring the country's economy and may provide some clues for the Fed's movement.

Selling ramen on the first floor, tax companies on the second floor, acupuncture doctors that advertised the leaders of Zhongnanhai on the third floor, and the fourth floor is the club of Changle. Most of the time, the elderly played mahjong next to the Chinese five -star red flag in the main conference room, accompanied by the rumbling sound from the elevated subway not far away.</p>
<p>On ordinary days, the Changle Guild is not particularly noticeable.</p>
<p>"Changle" is a coastal area with a large number of foreign immigrants in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. In 2013, the US Changle Association was formally registered for non -profit "charity organizations" in New York City, with the purpose of "providing social gatherings for Fujian immigrants."</p>
<p>However, the U.S. Department of Justice accused that the Changle Guild is not a simple place to party, but a overseas secret police station under the support of the Chinese government, which intimidated and monitored dissidents in the United States. In April of this year, the two American Changle Guild Overseas Chinese leader Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping were arrested for being suspected of conspiracy to act as the Chinese government agent and obstructing justice of judicial justice. If both crimes are established, the two will face a maximum of 25 years.</p>
<p>Both of them and their lawyers refused to comment on these allegations. However, Lu Jianwang's brother and the current chairman of the American Changle Association Lu Jianshun shouted unjustly for them.</p>
<p>"We just want to help travel to the United States." Lu Jianshun told this station that Changle's cadres were all free volunteers.</p>
<p>More than ten members of the Chinese community in New York were not surprised by the news of the two overseas Chinese leaders. They told Radio Radio of Liberty to tell the experience of members of the Changle Association, including harassment, threats and personal attacks.</p>
<p>These victims and Chinese research experts said that the case of the Changle Association is a typical example that reflects Beijing to penetrate overseas in a secret way. Even if the prosecutors in the United States take action, the victims are still worried, which may be difficult to stop the CCP ’s spy network increasingly operating overseas.</p>
<p><strong> Overseas Chinese "Lifeline" or the "Police Station" that monitors dissidents? </strong></p>
<p>The prototype of overseas Chinese immigrants today can be traced back to the beginning of the 19th century. For decades, most of these organizations exist to connect overseas compatriots. They help each other and face discrimination that they face in a foreign country.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, during the Deng Xiaoping era after the Cultural Revolution, these overseas groups began to change. Deng Xiaoping proposed that "overseas relations are a good thing", which has caused Chinese immigrants and abroad to study abroad, and overseas Chinese communities have flourished -by 2016, the number of global number exceeds <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2016-05/18/c_128991417.htm">25,000</a>indivual.</p>
<p>In recent years, overseas Chinese communities have begun to have stronger political colors. Those immigrants gathered together to make dumplings and drink tea and chat;</p>
<p>In these activities, it is not difficult to see the officials of the United Front Work Department. The United Front Work Department is the department that the Communist Party of China is responsible for directing its influence at home and abroad. Mao Zedong regarded the united front as one of the "magic weapons" for the Communist Party to defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Since Xi Jinping took over as the leader in 2012, the "revitalization of united front" has been his important ambition. Xi Jinping attributed the overseas Chinese affairs to the United Front Department. In his thoughts, overseas Chinese -no matter which country they held, the passport of which country they held -will play in the process of China's rise as a strong world, "<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2014-06/06/c_1111025922.htm">irreplaceable role</a>"" ".</p>
<p>Today, more and more overseas Chinese communities have been included in the United Front Leader. They may organize the "Xi Jinping Thought" learning group, or collectively vocals when encountering international disputes in the CCP, and help promote Beijing's views on issues such as unified Taiwan. Essence</p>
<p>These political actions filled with the color of the Communist Party of China are intertwined in normal community services, festive gifts, and public diplomatic activities.</p>
<p>A volunteer of the Changle Association described that for Chinese immigrants who left the country, Changle Guild is an "important lifeline." The volunteer was unwilling to disclose his name because he was not authorized by the guild. For example, the association provides manpower to help translation, fundraising and rescue folks, and also introduce opportunities for work and housing.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit document of the US Department of Justice pointed out that since 2022, the Changle Association has officially established the overseas branch of the Chinese police department to help track critics who live in the United States.</p>
<p>A photo attached to the criminal indictment. Chen Jinping, Lu Jianwang and other members of the Changle Association were standing up in front of the banner with the same red scarf around, saying "Fuzhou Police Overseas Service Station, New York, USA New York "" ".[Report] released by the human rights organization "Protecting Guard" in Madrid, Spain in 2022(https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/patrol-and-persuade-follow-110-overseas-investigation)According to China, such overseas police service stations are located in 53 countries around the world. In similar ways, they have established branches of the Chinese public security sector in the Chinese fellows and chambers of commerce.</p>
<p>Protection guards said that the police service stations represent the Communist Party of China to monitor, intimidation, harassment, detention, and repatriation of disgraceful people and immigrants.</p>

<p><strong> Hall behind the scenes of violence? </strong></p>
<p>Several interviewees told Radio Free Asia that before the establishment of the "Police Station" of the Changle Association, some members of its members had intimidated groups who advocated democracy or religious freedom.</p>
<p>Lu Jianwang also acknowledged to the investigators that when Xi Jinping visited the United States in 2015, he recruited 15 members with other overseas Chinese leaders to the capital Washington to interfere with the public demonstration of Xi Falun believers in Xi. He said that the participating overseas Chinese can receive a $ 60 cash issued by the Chinese consulate.</p>
<p>Lin Hai, 44, was sitting in his Rental apartment in Brooklyn, recalling violent attacks suffered in Manhattan in 2019. He accused these thugs from pro -communist groups including Changle Association.</p>
<p>It was the first summer after Lin Hai immigrated to the United States. He changed his leather shoes and trousers with great interest, and joined the welcome team that supported Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen's transit in New York. When Lin Hai crossed the Manhattan Park Avenue and squeezed towards the first row of the team, he was startled by a "Red Sea" in front of him.</p>
<p>"There are five -star red flags in China everywhere, and the loudspeaker has a patriotic song of the Communist Party of China." Lin Hai recalled, "They shouted 'long live the motherland', 'knocking down Cai Yingwen' ...; we are unwilling to show weakness!Hold on the small flag and shouting 'long live democracy' and 'knocking down the Communist Party'!"</p>
<p>"Suddenly, they passed through the road to our side ... I think this is a target and premeditated attack." Lin Hai said, this scene reminds him of the scene in China. Lin Hai worked in a state -owned enterprise until he took the lead in participating in an environmental protection struggle in his hometown, and began to be tracked and harassed by the National Security. In early 2019, he fled to the United States with his family.</p>
<p>A scene of conflict on the scene showed that a man with a red hat waved about two meters long Chinese flag pole and waved to Lin Hai's head. In the afternoon of the same day, five democratic initiatives including Lin Hai were injured and sent to the hospital, and they reported the case to the New York City Police Department. As the police arrived at the scene after the violent conflict, the chaotic scene was difficult to determine the identity of the attackers, and no one was officially sued in the end.</p>
<p>Lin Hai touched the scars on his forehead, describing the mood when he saw the news of Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping's arrest. "I still feel more comforting and sleep that night ... justice will be stretched."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T13-12-00-04-00/000008.png" />Lin Hai, who moved from China to the United States in 2019, said that overseas pro -communist groups organized the scene where the streets were arranged in the streets, reminding him of the scene in China(KAREN DIAS 摄)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/diaocha-baodao/db-07072023124652.html/3-man.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T13-12-00-04-00/000009.png" /></a>The Changle Association did not respond to a review request for allegations against violent incidents in 2019.</p>
<p>Some diaspora pointed out that sometimes the "harassment" from the Changle Association may be performed in a more indirect way.</p>
<p>In 2015, the former Chinese judge Zhong Jinhua, who moved to the United States in the 709 case, said that he was put pressure on several overseas Chinese leaders who had a good relationship with the embassy and consulate for anti -communist remarks, and urged him to withdraw from a New York Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>"I have no choice, I can only leave." Zhong Jinhua said, "But I made it clear to them that we are an independent organization in the United States, not the branch of the Communist Party of China, and should not have such a way of thinking or doing things."</p>

Since moving to the United States in 2018, he has been committed to the overseas democratic movement, including the campaign assistant to the leader of Xiong Yan, the leader of the first Sixth Sixth Fourth Scholarship.</p>
<p>"Even if I am overseas, the CCP seems to never give up me!" As soon as I talked about several suspected monitoring experience in the United States, Gobitong's voice was full of anger. "I thought I could move to the United States and stay away from these harassment!"</p>
<p>Once, Gobi Dong encountered suspected deliberate attacks on the highway for two consecutive days after participating in democratic activities in the Mohawan Desert Free Sculpture Park in California. On the first day, a pickup card maliciously forced the car and then left quickly; the next day, a truck forced the car again to cause him to almost happen. In the other two different occasions, Gobi Dong described his car tires to be cut.</p>
<p>When he published a comment on the Chinese government on the Internet, he received thousands of unknown calls from China within a week. In these phone calls, there is a threat to hurt his family in China."I judge that is me -I meet all the descriptions," Gobi Dong said.</p>

<p>Lu Jianwang's younger brother Lu Jianshun explained differently on the overseas police service station. He said that Changle Guild just helped arrange to set up "Qiaohai Tong" cross -border videos, so that the villagers in the United States can connect to the public security bureau of Fuzhou during the new crown epidemic. Wait for business.</p>
<p>"1.3 million people in Fuzhou live in the United States, and more than half of them hold a green card. They often need to return to China. The epidemic can not return to China. Cross -border videos can help them change their documents." Lu Jianshun said that the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau established in 21 countries <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrbhwb/html/2022-06/18/content_25923933.htm">38 </a>Similar "service stations" implement such overseas Chinese services.</p>
<p>Investigators of the US Department of Justice pointed out that when Lu Jianwang visited China, he met officials from the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau through an official of the United Front Department. They discussed the establishment of an overseas police service station.</p>
<p>In January 2022, a formal installed La Jianwang's grand launching ceremony at the Fuzhou Overseas Police Service Station at Wuyi Plaza Park, Fuzhou. On February 13, two days after Lu Jianwang returned to New York, Changle Guild held the opening ceremony of the first Fuzhou overseas police service station in the United States. [File] by the US Department of Justice(https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-04/police_station_-_23-mj-265_amended_complaint_signed.pdf)It is pointed out that Chen Jinping, then the then Secretary -General of Changle, asked Chen Jinping to deal with the relevant work of setting up the "police station".</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Chen Jinping acknowledged to the Federal Investigation Bureau that he kept in touch with the Chinese public security and helped the "police station" operation. He also confirmed that the "police station" was operated under the guidance of the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau under the Ministry of Public Security.</p>
<p>In the questioning, Chen Jinping admitted to the US judicial personnel that he realized that helping collect personal information in the United States and handed him to the Chinese authorities "may not be a good idea."</p>

One of the drivers come from the values of desire "Guangzong Yaozu" and "Yijin to return to their hometown".</p>
<p>"The Communist Party of China deliberately confuses the concept of the party's interests and national interests." Cherylyu explained that on the one hand, this group of struggles in a foreign country and a hard work leap in the mainstream society; It is easy to be the goal of the Communist Party of China. "</p>
<p>Chinese embassies and consulates often reward overseas overseas Chinese leaders in various ways, such as inviting them to watch in China <a href="http://qwgzyj.gqb.gov.cn/xdbt/151/1550.shtml">Parade Ceremony</a>, Participate in the CPPCC conference, or overseas Chinese conference. This group of overseas Chinese leaders have the opportunity to walk in the red carpet in front of Tiananmen, and even <a href="https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/2023-05/08/content_5754577.htm">enter</a>The Great Hall of the People took a group photo with the top leader of China.</p>
<p>In China, these photos and personal contacts with Chinese officials can bring personal and business interests to overseas Chinese -from accelerating the processing of relatives and friends, solving legal disputes, to unique local investment opportunities, and so on.</p>
<p><strong> From immigration model to </strong> <strong> "</strong> <strong> overseas agent </strong> <strong>" </strong> <strong>? </strong></p>
<p>In early 1980, the Lu Jianwang family immigrated to the Chinatown of the East District of Manhattan from the Monkey Island of Monupping from Fukushi, the governor of Fu Fu, who was close to the mouth of the Fujian River.</p>
<p>Lu Jianshun told reporters that their start is far from easy, and the language is not available and the resources are limited. He and his brother Lu Jianwang went to high school during the day, worked with his uncle at night, and worshiped Min Entang, full of Fujian immigrants on Sunday. These locations are within one mile of the Changle Association today.</p>
<p>It took decades, and the Lu family brothers accumulated wealth in the food wholesale industry and real estate investment. In 2016, Lu Jianwang was accepting Changle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230419155705/https:/mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EdqUYquepLeeSpO3aaZZyQ">local media</a>In the interview, he used some of his wealth to fund the projects of his hometown -nursing home, tap water plants, parks and tourist attractions.</p>
<p>In the United States, Lu Jianwang is active in Chinese communities. He led overseas overseas Chinese to protest the South China Sea arbitration case, celebrated the return of Hong Kong's return to the motherland in the New York Times Square, and participated in the celebration ceremony of the Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary in the United States.</p>
<p>His social media account never avoids sharing a photo with Chinese officials. When he was interviewed by the Chinese media <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230419173050/https:/mp.weixin.qq.com/s/V7-4VpFL-acx4avJ6CHzvg">once said</a>: "Patriotic love is our fine tradition, and the powerful motherland is our strong backing.</p>
<p>However, some people who know Lu Jianwang said that rather than a savvy Chinese agent, he seems to be more like a overseas co -worker who has been involved in the CCP's political actions and poor methods.</p>
<p>The Chinese community in New York also has different views on the prosecution of Lu and Chen. Some people sympathize with the judicial cases when the two people are tight in Sino -US relations, and believe that they are just chess pieces controlled by the Communist Party of China; the other group believes that these overseas Chinese leaders are voluntary participants in Beijing's illegal operations overseas.</p>
<p>In any case, the US Department of Justice has stated that the prosecution is an important step in taking action against the Chinese government's illegal operation in the United States.</p>
<p>"Under the instructions and control of the officials of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, these defendants secretly fulfilled the Chinese official tasks," the US prosecutor Bron Pis(BreonPeace)At a press conference on the case in April, he shouted to Beijing, "We know what you are doing, we will prevent it from happening in the United States."However, experts and victims still have skepticism about whether the prosecution can end the Chinese Communist Party's overseas infiltration actions. They pointed out that these actions abused the freedom of Western rally and the spirit of protecting the multi -ethnic ethnic group.</p>
<p>Common sense association(Common Sense Society)Cheryl Yu believes that judicial surveys may make the CCP's overseas interference operations more cautious, but "will not be reduced."</p>
<p>"The CCP will not change its political ideology because of the US prosecution. It may be able to change the packaging, but the essence is the same." She said.</p>
<p>A typical example is the "Confucius Institute" that was once characterized by the US State Department as a "foreign envoy" and controversial "Confucius Institute". Now it is "re -packaged" into a "Sino -foreign Language Exchange and Cooperation Center" and continues to operate on the American campus.</p>

<p>Although Lu Jianwang has unloaded the chairman of the Changle Association, in March of this year, he was selected as another influential Chinese fellow organization in New York, the co -chairman of the Fujian Township Association.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Fujian Township Association is separated from the streets of Changle Guild. On the streets of the mountains, the Changle Association is operated as usual.</p>
<p>Even if the Changle Guild has not reported taxes for three consecutive years, it was disqualified by the IRS. A member told this station that Changle's fundraising this year has been successful, and it has been close to raising enough funds to pay for their purchase of new offices.</p>
<p>After living in the fear of harassment for many years, Gobi Dong decided to relocate from New York to a small town in New Hampshire to settle in order to "keep a distance from the Chinese community" as much as possible.</p>
<p>Lin Hai did not participate in a welcome rally held for Tsai Ing -wen in New York City in April 2023.</p>
<p>"But I must remind people who are going to the streets to pay attention to safety ... Maybe we put on running shoes." Lin Hai said.</p>

According to the New York Times, Yellen expressed the attention of the Chinese government's punitive behavior against the Chinese government in the conversation with these companies. Yellen said: "When meeting with Chinese officials, I will convey concerns in the American business community, including China using non -market tools to subsidize state -owned enterprises and domestic companies, and block foreign companies into the Chinese market ... In addition, I am particularly in China in China. In recent months, it is uneasy about punishing American companies. "</p>

However, eight years have passed.

For their family members who have always been by Zhu Lian, the eight -year anti -Japanese war of 709 has not yet been sued. The reporter of this station produced two episodes. The following are the first episodes. Please listen to the episodes first. 709 human rights lawyers Li Heping and Wang Quanzhang told their experience in the past eight years.</p>

<p>"709 arrest" has passed eight years. However, for the arrested lawyers and family members who have been fighting against each other, the "709 incident" is still entangled with them like a nightmare.</p>
<p>Li Heping still remembers that on July 10, 2015, he took his daughter to drive to a law firm to see the client. At that time, the news that he was taken away on the mobile phone. As soon as he arrived downstairs in the law firm, he was surrounded by a group of national security and plainclothes, and then took him home to search.</p>
<p>He has a wealth of experience in dealing with sensitive cases. At that time, he thought that this time he was taken away, which was no different from the previous situation.</p>
<p>"One of their leading young people said," You are quite calm ', he said that I have a "general". In fact, as a lawyer in China, the risks have always existed, and they have been caught and disappeared. I am in 2007. They were kidnapped several times in the year, so there was nothing particularly lied. Nothing, then it was quite calm. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chinese human rights lawyer Li Heping (middle) and family (provided by Wang Qiaoling) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/al-07072023121001.html/img_9238.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> "The first horrible is, he asked you to take medicine" </strong></p>
<p>However, he never expected that this wave of arrests involved nearly 300 people, covering lawyers, rights protection, visits, Christians, and even family members, covering 23 provinces across the country. He was put on a black head cover, handcuffed, and brought to a guest house.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the beginning, he was constantly shifted by his head. He didn't know where he was, nor did he know whether he was the armed police, National Security or Public Security.</p>
<p>This is also the common experience of many 709 arrested. Like many arrested people, Li Heping suffered a "hell" torture and was tortured into "living dead". Every time he mentioned, he was extremely painful.</p>
<p>"I think the first horrible thing is that he asked you to take medicine and fill your medicine. You don't know what medicine is. Anyway, let you take medicine on the first day, and take a lot of medicines. You don't know why. "Li Heping said.</p>
<p>"The second is to let you stand and keep a standing posture for a long time. So after I returned from 709, I can't run away. The feeling of the legs is separated from the knee. The wire is broken. Also, don't let you eat it, and don't let you drink water. And the detention center is frozen enough, the whole is a systematic torture. "<strong> "709 court drama" by the script "</strong></p>
<p>One and a half years after the arrest, Li Heping was charged by the Tianjin Procuratorate as "the crime of subverting the state power." However, he said that at that time, everyone in charge of the case knew that it was a injustice, but the real led case was the "709 task force", and the judge was only the tool of the "task force".</p>
<p>Li Heping has always insisted on not pleading guilty. However, the pressure of the international community at that time made the judge's burnt, and even proposed to Li Heping that he hoped to "solve the problem" as soon as possible. In the end, Li Heping and the judge reached an agreement, "We are defending innocence, how do you judge your affairs" and "each expression" in a vague way.</p>
<p>The entire closed -door trial process was required to be carried out strictly in accordance with the "script". Li Heping's wife Wang Qianling was completely unaware. Participants such as the procuratorate, judges and other participants must participate in "rehearsal". However, when the sentence was pronounced, Li Heping's words made the "task force" dissatisfied, and the entire trial had to "repeat itself."</p>
<p>"They asked me to say 'obey the judgment and not appeal.' When they were sentenced, I said that the" retaining opinion, not appealing ', not the same as their script. " The actors, lawyers, and prosecutors all left, but the people in the task force felt inappropriate, and called them back and called them back to the second court. Let me talk about the "obedience to the judgment, not appealing '."</p>
<p>On April 28, 2017, Tianjin Second Intermediate People's Court determined that Li Heping's crime of "subverting the state power" was successful, sentenced to three years in prison, four years in probation, and depriving political rights for four years. The official news stated that Li Heping expressed regret in the court, "obeying the judgment does not appeal." Ten days later, Li Heping was released, but due to probation restrictions, it was not allowed to be interviewed by the media for 4 years. These details forced to speak in court have been forbearing to this day.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000008.png" />Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang and Li Heping couple (provided by Wang Qiaoling) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/al-07072023121001.html/img_9237.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000009.png" /></a><strong> Wang Quanzhang: I resolutely not cooperate with this "perfect trial" </strong></p>
<p>However, another 709 lawyer Wang Quanzhang always refused to cooperate with the performance of the "709 drama". "What is the most pursuing case in this case? They pursue the so -called 100 points. What is 100 points? What is perfect judgment? For judges, there are several key judgments, such as representatives of the People's Congress, members of the CPPCC, journalists Participate in the listening, the defense lawyer fully defended, the parties pleaded guilty, served the law, and did not appeal, and then expressed their statements on TV. This is a perfect trial for the court. "</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said: "They are pursuing this effect, but I will not make such a cooperation for them at all. On the one hand, they vilify the lawyers, and on the one hand, they want to realize their perfect trial from me, and then insert their lawyers, I Resolutely resist. "</p>
<p>That's it. Every time the official arranged officials to send officials to Wang Quanzhang, he dismissed directly, so that the judge could not promote the case, was anxious, and even cried directly to him to ask him to cooperate.</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang admitted that when he was just held in a secret place, torture made him not as good as death. However, after transferring to the detention center, his treatment improved, and he decided to use the past to defend the parties. The illegal act on the case "stops the persecution machine to stop turning."</p>
<p>"At that time, I actually entered a state of power flip. They also began to test, not as hostile to me, told me brother and brother, I hope I will give them face, give them a step, and then let me go. I said. You used to humiliate me in the past. Like Grandpa, why are you becoming a grandson now? I won't give you a word. "</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said, "The kind of bitterness and freedom in it, after a long period of systemization, it was numb. At that time, the director of the detention center said that I had worked out for 30 years and never saw a case -handling unit. An object of censorship. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000010.png" />Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang (provided by Wang Quanzhang) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/al-07072023121001.html/img_9216.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000011.png" /></a><strong> "The last person in the 709 case" </strong></p>
<p>When his wife Li Wenzu ran to him outside the high wall and hoped that he was released as soon as possible, and the court was anxious to "solve" him as soon as possible, but Wang Quanzhang hoped that the case would "drag for one day". The unable to judge him, but must change his mandatory measures to him after the interrogation period is over, so that he will take the bail pending trial. In this way, he can accept the interview and tell the truth.</p>
<p>However, Wang Quanzhang admitted that he underestimated the "shamelessness" of the Supreme Court. Under the approval of the Supreme Court, the Tianjin Second Intermediate People's Court violated the regulations and repeatedly delayed his case trial, making him the "last person of the 709 case" and had only been dragged until 2019. As a result, Wang Quanzhang was sentenced to "subverting the crime of state power". He was sentenced to four years and six months, deprived of political rights for five years. He was released from prison until April 5, 2020, and his freedom was nearly 5 years.</p>
<p>After regaining freedom, he felt that he was disconnected from the times. He could not even use WeChat payment, and could not concentrate on doing things, and deeply felt anxious. It wasn't until the former judicial minister Fu Zhenghua, who was accused of planning the "709 arrest", and Sun Lijun, the former deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security. Wang Quanzhang felt that his anxiety was cured.</p>
<p>"The person who persecuted you was ended. Some lawyers said very well. The end of these people today was pursued by them. They persecuted human rights lawyers for a long time. One day they were detained. People must be human rights lawyers. "Wang Quanzhang said," They stepped down, making people feel very fast, not only me, but also many people who have been persecuted by them are very happy. "</p>
<p>To fight with those who persecuted himself, Wang Quanzhang paid a heavy price. His lawyer's license was revoked, making him unable to defend the parties as a lawyer.<strong> Destruction of career, living in the house </strong></p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said: "After the 709 incident, my career was interrupted by my career, that is, my entire career was destroyed. I have achieved some results in the case before. Judge, actually effectively helped those people who were persecuted at the grassroots level. But the 709 incident was interrupted, and my past experience was all invalid, causing great damage to my career ideals. "</p>
<p>In addition to the destruction of his career, the Wang Quanzhang family has also been monitored for a long time, and every sensitive day will be restricted. Starting from April this year, with a number of senior officials from European countries visited China, the authorities have greatly improved their suppression of them. They are constantly disturbed by landlords, police, and even underworlds, and they have broken water and power. They do not stop them. In just two months, Wang Quanzhang's family moved 13 times and was rushed to rush around in different regions of Beijing.</p>
<p><strong> Can't escape the cage </strong> **</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said that he can foresee that even if he leaves Beijing, he will only be monitored more seriously like Chen Guangcheng of that year. As long as they are still on the land in China, they cannot be separated from trouble. When asked if he wanted to leave China, his answer was yes. However, the couple have been rejected by trying to apply for a passport.</p>
<p>The Li Heping family, also forced to move, was intercepted at Chengdu Airport when she successfully handled her passport. The police read out the restriction notice, saying that they "may endanger national security."</p>
<p>Li Heping said: "Entering the border is the right of citizens. If there is this right, I can choose to stay in China or choose to leave China. This should be free. But now he will not let you leave China. Already restricted you, deprive your choice. "</p>
<p><strong> Endless oppression </strong></p>
<p>The lawyers who were suspended, monitored, forced to relocate, and were controlled, and more like Li Yuhan, who were defended by lawyers 709 cases, were arrested; lawyers of Yu Wensheng were arrested for the second time, and this time, he also brought his wife Xu Xu Xu Yan, all charged with Guoan related crimes. The two lawyers of Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi were sentenced to 14 years and 12 years in prison for the "Xiamen gathering case".</p>
<p>For Chinese human rights lawyers, the eight -year anti -Japanese war in 709 is not known.</p>
<p>Li Heping said, "Did you say 709 is over? For the Wang Quanzhang family and my family, they want to drive us away from Beijing, so as not to let us rent a house in Beijing, break the water and power off, and let us live here. In the world's eyes, the eyes of the world. They all violated the law like this. Are you saying that 709 is over? "</p>
<p><strong> After 709, the construction of the rule of law in China is extinguished by gray smoke </strong></p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang believes that before and after the "709 arrest", the Chinese official passed the new "Criminal Procedure Law", "Career Code of Lawyers", and the "Management Measures for Law Firm" to eliminate all the space for human rights lawyers. The rule of law in China is no longer hopeful.</p>
<p>For Li Heping, 709's research that he has been doing has been doing, and the work that promotes the introduction of the referee (jury) system in China has been interrupted. The "709 Incident" has also become the beginning of China's rule of law, and lawyers dare not tell the truth anymore.</p>
<p>"The 706 case has caused China to negotiate the market economy subject status that China is seeking, and the bottom of the kettle is drawn. Second, you have made the two major achievements of China's reform and opening up. A great social harm. "Li Heping said," The government said in a word of mouth to hope that the rule of law is hoped, so then of us lawyers really lead the rule of law and pursue the rule of law. When the rule of law is about to approach, he is afraid. , I want to do it for him. "</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly that the "709 incident" brought him to him was to let him experience torture in person and experienced a Chinese legal system "in -depth tour". However, he still firmly believes that a country must develop in a good direction, and the rule of law is indispensable. He quoted a sentence of Zhang Sizhi, the late Chinese Thai Dato -class lawyer: Human rights are the largest face in a country.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Washington, 7th) Russia invaded Ukraine for nearly a year and a half.

However, if the small bomb in this ammunition is not completely exploded, it will constitute a danger, so human rights groups are fiercely criticized.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-07-08T-5-02-10-00-00/000000.png" />The United States stated that it has received guarantees from Ukraine that Ukraine will minimize the risk of civilians, including using this ammunition in a dense population area.</p>
<p>U.S. President Biden told the United States CNN (CNN) that the decision to provide cluster ammunition was "very difficult", but the "ammunition" of the Ukraine was exhausted. "If they can't get the weapons to stop the Russians from now on, they don't let them prevent the Ukraine's offensive in these regions. The statement stated that the new military aid plan announced today includes the "dual -effect improvement version of traditional ammunition" (DPICM, which is the cluster ammunition). Ukraine President Volodymyrzlenskyy quickly thanked the United States for this Ukraine's urgent help in Twitter. Provide new tools peacefully. "</p>
<p>US National Security Consultant Jakesullivan said when he talked about this decision: "If Ukraine does not have enough firepower, the Russian army and the chariot will chase the Ukraine position, seize more Ukraine territories, and conquer more Urban civilians. Civilians will face huge risk of damage. "</p>
<p>Su Lvin said that the Ukrainian government "provides written guarantees and uses these weapons very cautiously," and the Ukraine government "has sufficient reasons to minimize the risks suffered by civilians because it is their citizen." COLIN KAHL, the Second Minister of Defense, added that Ukraine guarantees that it will not use cluster ammunition in areas where civilians gather, and will also record the location of the use in order to clear the unprepared bullet after the war.</p>
<p>Carl also said that the United States does not provide a bundle ammunition with a fault rate of more than 2.35%; in comparison, Russia's bundle ammunition in Ukraine is as high as 30 to 40%.</p>
<p>However, human rights groups strongly oppose the United States to provide bundle ammunition to Ukraine.</p>
<p>"Human Rights Watch" said that these weapons will inevitably cause civilians to be tortured for a long time; the "AMNESTYINTERNAT" believes that the use of cluster ammunition is likely to take more civilian life because the killing of this weapon is killed The power is not to be distinguished. Even after a long time after the war, it will pose a serious threat to civilians. "In any case, it will not meet international law by transporting and using this ammunition." UN Secretary -General Antonio Guterres also objected, a spokesman said Gutteris "do not want to continue to use cluster ammunition on the battlefield."</p>

<p>U.S. President Biden said in an interview with the United States Cable Television News (CNN) that he had followed the Pentagon's proposal to provide a bundle ammunition to Ukraine, and this decision was extremely difficult, but this was made after discussions with Washington allies and Congress. In view of "the ammunition of the Ukraine is exhausted."</p>
<p>In this context, US National Security Consultant Jack Shalvin said that Ukraine is committed to removing clusters of ammunition after the conflict is over to reduce the harm to civilians. After negotiating with the allies, this decision was made.</p>
<p>A total of more than 120 countries have signed the "International Convention on Betlated Bombs". These ammunitions are usually scattered into a large number of small bombs to strike a large area, and the unblied ammunition may be killed or after the next few months or years. Break the civilians who know nothing about these ammunition. But Russia, Ukraine and the United States refused to sign the treaty.</p>
<p>In this regard, France stated that it insisted on not producing or using such fatal weapons, but it understood the decision in the United States, while Germany said he opposed the transportation of clustering ammunition to Ukraine.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Russian Security Council Vice Chairman Dmitry Modvejev said on the 7th that it was a very dangerous behavior to provide modern destruction to Ukraine in the West.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian President Zelegski thanked the new assistance plan provided by the Biden government.</p>
<h4>bomb</h4>
<p>The ammunition that the United States supplied to Ukraine for the first time was launched through the "howitzer", weighing 430 kg, and 88 small bombs can be loaded.</p>
<p>The coverage area of each bomb can reach 30,000 square meters, and the specific situation will depend on the height of the launch of a small bomb.</p>
<p>This type of bomb aims to crack down on tanks and armored vehicles, destroy such vehicles or paralyze at least.</p>
<p>The dumb bullet rate of these ammunitions is very high. Unblied ammunition may explode and cause civilians to die or disabled for several years or even decades.</p>
<p>The last time the United States used this type of ammunition was during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. According to the United States Cable Television News, Russia and Ukraine have used such ammunition in the current war.</p>

<p><strong> The Taiwan Presidential Election will be held early next year. The DPP candidate and the current vice president Lai Qingde published a signature article on the Wall Streetjournal on July 5th to propose the "Four-Pillar" of the Taiwan Strait Peace. Plan for people, emphasizing the need to strengthen Taiwan's defense and maintain the status quo on cross -strait issues. </strong></p>
<p>This was regarded as the "intersection" of Washington before he went to the United States to "interview". Taiwan's official or Lai Qingde's campaign headquarters has not yet announced the relevant itinerary, but it was reported that he had previously participated in the President President's inauguration next month or transit the United States.</p>
<p>A number of scholars analyzed the BBC Chinese analysis that Lai Qingde asked for weakening the image of Taiwan independence to win the trust of the United States, and he was expected to continue Cai Yingwen's route in international and cross -strait policies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-64261592">Will Lai Qingde be elected as the Democratic Progressive Party Chairman, "Platform Taiwan Independence", will he be the president of Taiwan? </a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66039161">Taiwan 2024 Presidential Election: Who is supporting "Critic" Ke Wenzhe</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65618692">Taiwan Election 2024: Why can Hou Youyi represent the Kuomintang to participate in the war</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65818510">Taiwan 2024 Presidential Election: The issue of sexual harassment is accidentally becoming a political storm</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-63790222">Taiwan Nine -in -1 Election: Why is the DPP being governed by young voters? </a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-65788057">Taiwan and the United States signed the 21st Century Trade Initiative Beijing to say that the United States "knocks bone and absorb" in Taiwan</a></p>
<h3>What is the "Four Pillar"?</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-08T03-17-45.000Z/_130316104_pic1.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Lai Qingde's signed article stated that the Taiwan Strait crisis 27 years ago saw the threat of missiles and made him determined to abandon medical politics. Today, Beijing's military strength is stronger than in the past. , But this is the reality we face. "</p>
<p>He said that he is determined to defend Taiwan's democracy and the current peaceful status quo of cross -strait.</p>
<p>The first is to strengthen national defense deterrence. It will continue President Tsai Ing -wen's plan to accelerate the transformation of national defense, strengthen the asymmetric combat power of cost -effectiveness, mobility, and seek further communication with allies in terms of army training, civil defense, and information exchange. This will increase the cost of moving martial arts in Beijing, thereby reducing the risk of military conflicts.</p>
<p>The second is to improve economic security, reduce dependence on Chinese trade, consolidate Taiwan's supply chain security, promote the diversification of trade through the new trade agreement, and support domestic new industries, and reduce unnecessary regulatory measures.</p>
<p>The third is to establish partnership with global democratic countries and seek further communication with allies.</p>
<p>The fourth is that there are "stable and principled cross -strait leadership". The first task is to maintain pragmatic and consistent cross -strait policies. It does not rule out to start a dialogue with the opposite bank under mutual benefit, dignity, and no prerequisites.</p>
<p>He shows that it will support the maintenance of the status quo on both sides of the strait, "this is in line with the formal name of the Republic of China -Taiwan -the best interests with the international community."</p>
<h3>The timing of the statement</h3>

<p>On April 5, 2023, McCarthy (left), Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen spoke to the press in the press in the Reagan Presidential Library of California.</p>
<p>Lai Qingde's journal was the first time after the Kuomintang candidate Hou Youyi expressed his "1992 Consensus" on July 3. Hou Youyi's statement was to "accept the 1992 consensus in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China", and pointed out that it may be restored for four months after being elected. It is reported that this statement has caused the United States to dissatisfy.</p>
<p>Weng Luzhong, an associate professor of the Department of Political Department of Sam Houston State University in Texas, told BBC in Chinese that Lai Qingde announced its position at this time to emphasize that the DPP has a firm position on strengthening the national defense and guarding Taiwan. bedding.</p>
<p>"The Book" Wall Street Journal "is a conservative in the United States Washington to win the support of the eagle." Weng Luzhong said.</p>
<p>He believes that the focus of the "four pillars" is the first point, because the US policy on Taiwan's policies is most important, and the annual defense authorization law that is discussed will also emphasize that Taiwan US military cooperation, especially the assistance of Taiwan military training, Essence "At this point, Vice President Lai obviously mastered the wind direction of Washington, emphasizing that national defense and the establishment of Taiwan's deterrence can already allow many people in the United States, especially the readers of the Wall Street Journal."</p>
<p>This time is also accused of related to the United States and China. The United States is seeking a stable relationship with China, and Secretary of State Brosky and Treasury Secretary Yellen have visited Beijing.</p>
<p>Song Wendi, a lecturer of the Asia -Pacific College of the National University of Australia, told the BBC Chinese that Lai Qingde wanted to reassure Washington. No matter how the government changes, Taiwan's attitude towards China will still be predictable and pragmatic. Express or excessive response to Re -ngagement.</p>
<p>"Expressing confidence in the United States and Taiwan relations, I believe that improving US-China relations will not at the expense of US-Taiwan relations. When the United States'" de-Risk "in the United States, Taiwan must conceptually put on conceptually Defamation of US-China relations and US-Taiwan relations (de-link) to ensure that the former will not be at the cost.

<h3>Standards on both sides of the strait is the "Tsai Ingham 2.0" version?</h3>

<p>Lai Qingde once said that he was a "pragmatic Taiwan independence worker" and believed that Taiwan was an independent country of sovereignty. He did not need to declare "Taiwan independence" separately. His cross -strait position has attracted much attention.</p>
<p>Hou Youyi, a Kuomintang candidate, questioned that Lai Qingde's "four pillars" solutions were constructed on the foundation of "pragmatic Taiwan independence". There is still a risk of war, which may cause Taiwan to collapse soon.</p>
<p>Scholar Song Wendi described Lai Qingde's plan is the "Cai Yingwen 2.0" version. The cross -strait discussion has no new idea, but it is said that he emphasizes that maintaining the status quo of the two sides of the strait is the primary task, and it is to guarantee his position on Washington and Beijing on the issue of "Taiwan independence". "He clearly said that it is the best interest for the" Republic of China ", and it has no intention to unilaterally change Taiwan's political status."</p>
<p>Scholar Weng Luo also pointed out that Lai Qingde should persuade the United States to maintain the status quo and not "Taiwan independence" to reduce US doubts. "Although Huafu's long -term Taiwan -related people may not change their doubts because of this, as long as more people believe that the DPP's governance has nothing to do with 'Taiwan independence', and the two parties in the wild have not shown enough to guard Taiwan to persuade the United States to persuade the United States For many American politicians, the Democratic Progressive Party is more in line with the interests of the United States. "</p>
<p>He expected that Lai Qingde will continue the tone of Cai Yingwen's "pro -American anti -anti -anti -Chinese". "Cai is considered by the United States to be a representative of pragmatic and rational. Continuing her route is the best choice. Of course, because President Lai has no international political background and continuing the existing security route, it is necessary to not worry about the United States. The process and even if the future is in power, the main axis of the US policy. "</p>

<p>Taiwan Nine -in -1 Election: What do voters think of cross -strait issues?</p>
<h3>Democracy VS Nationalism</h3>
<p>Zhuang Jiaying, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science and Carnegie China Project of Singapore, told BBC in Chinese that Lai Qingde's statement was not only the United States, but also other democratic countries in the international community. "In recent years, the relationship with the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. also has obvious positive development. Lai should want to maintain such a trend and then build its own achievements."</p>
<p>He pointed out that Chinese leaders Xi Jinping often emphasizes "the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation", and Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee, recently called on China, Japan and South Korea to cooperate, " No matter how sharp, you can't become a Westerner. You need to know where your roots are. "</p>
<p>Professor Zhuang said: "Tsai Ing -wen and Lai Qingde are based on democratic value as one of the policy axis. This has formed a strong contrast with Xi Jinping and Wang Yi from the perspective of race and ethnic groups."</p>
<p>He pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party's decision -making level is not very important except for Taiwan's compromise. Although the United States plays an important role on the Taiwan Strait issue, the most important thing is Beijing's attitude.</p>
<p>"What China wants to think of the United States and Lai Qingde, who may be elected, is not something that can be influenced in Taipei. After all, the relationship between the Taiwan Strait depends on how Beijing decides. If the current situation does not change, Lai continues Cai's policy, then at least it will cause unstable instability. The factor will not come from Taiwan. "</p>

<p>A senior US Treasury official said that he had lunch with Chinese female economists to provide Yellen with a "opportunity to interact with some people outside the usual policy structure". The U.S. Treasury Department did not disclose the names of the women's participation.</p>
<p>76 -year -old Yellen said that since her career in the 1970s, she has witnessed that China has introduced market -based economic policies to change the entire country and make hundreds of millions of people get rid of poverty.</p>
<p>Yellen said: "I hope these policies can continue to be implemented, which is good for both China and the United States and a wider global economy." It emphasizes that her claims when meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang again on Friday and urging China to turn to a more marketing market. Reform.</p>
<p>Yellen told these women -one of them claimed to be feminist economists -she wanted to learn more about their background and research.</p>
<h3>Female candidates in Taiwan's local elections</h3>
<h3>"The only woman in the room"</h3>
<p>"I am convinced that we have similar stories and experiences in the career status of the economic field and the possible challenges." Yellen said: "When I was almost the only woman in the room, I often saw this situation. I believe that Many of you have the same experience in the decision -making team. "</p>

<p>A report released by the United Nations in June urged China to adopt <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/里程碑德内阁规定董事会女性成员最低比例/a-56155672">legal quota and gender equality system</a>In order to improve the representativeness of women in the government.</p>
<p>The United Nations elimination of the Women's Discrimination Commission found that women accounted for only about 26%of the representatives of the 14th National People's Congress of China. And since October last year, there was no woman in the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China consisting of 24 members, which was the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>The highest -ranking female politician in China is Xi Yiqin. She was appointed as one of the five state members in March this year. Her level is higher than the minister and is responsible for supervising social welfare, retired soldiers, and sports.</p>
<p>In contrast, Yellen is one of the 13 women led by President Biden Biden. This is the most diverse cabinet in American history.</p>
<p>According to data from the female politics center of the University of Rogers, a quarter of the US Senate seats and 28.7%of the House seats occupied by women.</p>

<p>The research team collects samples from 716 national representative locations. Among them, 447 are dependent on public water supply systems, and 269 are from private wells.</p>
<p>Most places where PFAS is detected is in the metropolitan area, or it is known to have high concentrations of PFAS, such as industrial areas and garbage buried fields. Including the Greatplains in the central region, the five Great Lakes in the Middle East, and the east coast and the west coast city.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides some home water purification methods. For example, water purifiers with reverse osmosis technology, activated carbon, ion exchange resin filtration, etc. have proven to be very effective to remove PFAS.</p>
<p>Bottle water is not the best choice. Research released by USGS in 2022 pointed out that bottled water is often contaminated with inorganic and organic compounds, and the most common includes arsenic, lead and uranium.</p>
<p>The US Industrial Giant 3M Company announced last month that it would pay up to US $ 12.5 billion, reaching a settlement with the accusation of 3M pollution of the US Volkswagen's water supply system. 3M announced last December that PFAS will be suspended by the end of 2025, and this substance will also stop using this material in its products.</p>

<p>The Dutch Government, which was only about a year and a half, fell.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the Dutch Prime Minister Ratt announced on Friday (July 7) and announced that the co -government composed of the four parties decided to dissolve because of "unsolved differences".</p>
<p>This crisis was caused by the conservative Liberty Democratic People's Party (VVD) led by Lutter's leadership. Lutter's proposal is to restrict the entry of war refugee children who have arrived in the Netherlands, and stipulate that families who apply for shelter are waiting for at least two years to reunite.</p>
<p>The Christian Alliance and Liberal Six Six Democratic Party (D66) in the Governance Alliance believed that the proposal was too much and refused to support it.</p>
<p>Lone said at a television press conference: "The alliance partners have different opinions on the immigration policy, which is not a secret. Unfortunately, our conclusion today is that these differences can no longer be resolved, so I will propose to the king's total rhetoric ","</p>
<p>Lutter will submit his resignation to King William-Alexander on Saturday. Prior to the new election, the cabinet will operate in the form of a guard.</p>
<p>Lutter said that the guardian government cannot formulate new policies, but this will not affect the Dutch support for Ukraine. The ANP news agency in the Netherlands said the election would not be held before mid -11.</p>
<p>The "Farmers-Citizen Movement Party" (BBB), which opposes the government's promoting the EU's environmental protection rules, is a newly-rising populist party in the Netherlands. It has won beautiful results in the early Senate elections this year.</p>

<p>The Farmers-Citizen Movement Party leader Caroline Van Der Plas previously refused to form a joint government with Lutter. If she won the most seats in the election, it would not be ruled out that the election prime minister was not ruled out.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is one of the strictest countries in European immigration policies, but in the face of the continuous pressure of right -wing political parties, Lutter has been trying to further reduce the entry of asylums for a few months.</p>
<p>Last year, more than 47,000 people applied for asylum in the Netherlands, an increase of one -third from the previous year.</p>

<h3>The world's largest nickel production country Indonesia faces enthusiastic mining consequences to warn that mining is threatening its lifestyle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Valdya Baraputri * BBC Indonesia Group</li>
</ul>
<p>July 8, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-08T10-01-36.000Z/_130292874_6ae6ddc2-7d19-4e8b-8c7b-9fab0d1caa50.jpg"></a><strong> Nickel is an indispensable part of life, for stainless steel, mobile phone and electric vehicle batteries. As the world turns to more environmentally friendly cars, the demand for metals is expected to increase significantly. However, environmentalists warned that in Indonesia, the largest nickel producer in the world, mining of nickel may have a destructive effect on the environment. </strong></p>
<p>This is a night on Labngki, southeast of Sulawesi, Indonesia. We follow the two people holding the torch and homemade arrows. They sneaked into the sea to catch fish, lobster and sea cucumbers. In the evening when the fish was not active, the harvest of other prey was better.</p>
<p>These people come from the indigenous community of Bajau, known for free divers and hunters. But they are worried that their traditional lifestyles are not much time.</p>
<p>"Now, water is still clear," said one of the fishermen Tawing. "But will not always do this ... Nickel waste enters the water in the rainy season, and the ocean flows bring it here."</p>
<p>He warned that if the government does not take action, the waste produced by nickel ore will eventually flow into the sea and hurt the island and the surrounding marine creatures.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Australia have the world's largest nickel reserves. The International Energy Agency predicts that as we turn to electric vehicles, we need more rechargeable batteries. By 2030, the demand for nickel will increase at least 65%.</p>
<p>Some institutions predict that Indonesia will meet two -thirds of copper demand in the world, and the country has signed an agreement worth billions of dollars with an international enterprise that is eager to invest in its processing plants and mines.</p>
<p>According to data from the Indonesian government, about 50 nickel ore companies are currently operating in the North Konawe region, which is separated from the water from Laibenki Island.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-08T10-01-36.000Z/_130296816_tawingbajau.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Fisherman Tawing and aquatic products he captured.</p>
<p>It takes about an hour to take a boat. When we approached, the green hills were replaced by brown and fed forests. You can see the excavator and the carrier of excavation and transporting "new gold". The water under our feet is reddish brown.</p>
<p>In the coastal village Boenaga, we met another Baggio fisherman Lukman, who said he could no longer fish near his house.</p>
<p>"We can't see anything when we sneak into the water," he pointed at the brown seawater behind the house. "It may hit the stone." The cost of fuel made him unable to fish farther away. He said that if they were a fuss about it, the police would eventually intervene.</p>
<p>In order to minimize nickel, large -scale trees were fell, and the land was excavated into an open -air pit. Because the root of the trees no longer exists, it cannot stabilize the ground, and the soil is more likely to be washed away when it rains.</p>
<p>Government data shows that at least 21 floods and mudslides occurred in the southeast of Sulawesi in 2022. According to data from the Japanese national disaster countermeasures, between 2005 and 2008, the mining scope was expanded from 2005 to 2008.</p>
<p>Chemicals such as sodium cyanide and diesel can also be used for mining. This made local environmentalists Habib Nadjarbuduha. He said that if the waste and water are not properly managed, the sediments will eventually flow into the sea.</p>
<p>He showed me a video that he shot about 10 miles along the coast of Bahubulu. In the video, there was a coral reef that was "suffocated" by deposits.</p>

<p>Baggio fisherman Lukman.</p>
<p>He was worried that the same thing would happen on Lampenki, so he established an organization that protects giant clams in 2009. "They can never defeat nickel pollution," he said.</p>
<p>"The sediment will bury and destroy them."</p>
<p>Individual nickel ore companies near Bonaga did not respond to our comment requests, but we talked with the Indonesian Nickel Miner Society -about half of the Beikonovi Mining Company was a member of the association.</p>
<p>Secretary -General Meidy Katrin said that in order to obtain a license, the company must agree to re -establish or reclaim land after the mining.</p>
<p>She said, "The question is, do these companies do this?" She acknowledged that there were some naked land that did not restore afforestation. But she said that this may not be a company with a license: "There are also many illegal mining activities in this area."</p>
<p>She believes that the government is responsible for checking miners to ensure that they comply with regulations and ensure that the content they wrote in the report are consistent with reality.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-08T10-01-36.000Z/_130292878_f2fd9d00-280d-4343-9cdb-781a675c2dc0.jpg" />Image source, habib nadjar buduha</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Environmentalists warn that sediments will cover coral reefs and suffocate them.</p>
<p>Jufriasri, the village chief of Bonasa Village, has different views on things from Lukeman and Habib. He believes that these mines have brought benefits to the community. "Taking the price of fish as an example," he said, "I don't take the fish to the city, because the price here is higher. These companies also need fish."</p>
<p>His 21 -year -old son worked at a nickel mining company nearby. Like other families in Bona, they received a compensation fee of at least $ 70 from mining each month.</p>
<p>The fiscal agreement is common, and its purpose is to offset the inconvenience caused by the residential of mining activities and heavy vehicles when traveling to and from the pit. Jewei pointed out that if the nickel production increases, the compensation they get will increase.</p>
<p>In the capital Jakarta, we saw Novita Indri, who was a activist of the non -governmental organization "Trendasia" that promoted sustainable development. She accused the authorities of being "too weak" — she hopes to see higher environmental standards and stricter supervision.</p>
<p>"We have no record of sustainable mining," said Derry. "Indonesia also has a lot of work to do, including strengthening law enforcement, improving emission standards, and implementation of environmental regulations."</p>
<p>When we asked Professor Irwandyarif, a consultant to the Energy and Mineral Resources Department (ESDM), he told us that the government cares about "the impact of mining activities on coastal deposits", not just this Region, but throughout Indonesia.He insisted that laws and regulations mean that legal operators have appropriate water management systems to ensure that no dangerous substances flow into the sea. He does not believe that operators will ignore these rules and risk losing a license.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-08T10-01-36.000Z/_130304853_mediaitem130304821.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Even if we comply with regulations, mining will have a significant impact on the landscape.</p>
<p>However, Professor Arff admit that "soil will only be eroded in illegal mines without processing systems.</p>
<p>He told us that anyone who does not comply with the regulations is banned from selling nickels, and two illegal miners have been taken to courts in the county of Beica -Bonaga.</p>
<p>However, Professor Arff acknowledged that supervision needs to be improved. He said: "Illegal mining is everywhere in Indonesia."</p>
<p>He said: "So far, we have not yet supervised it properly ... We need to determine which are legal and illegal, so that we can minimize the destruction of the environment to the greatest extent."</p>
<p>He pointed out that in order to improve this situation, the government has recently established a national illegal mining work group.</p>
<p>But many of the Baggagians we have interviewed said that the speed of changes is not fast enough. Natural resource protector Habib warned that if things continue, damage may be irreversible.</p>
<p>"They are destroying our future," he said.</p>

<h3>Shooting</h3>
<p>A balloon in China fluttered over the United States for a few days. On February 4, the U.S. military shot down in the coastal waters of the South Carolina. The United States has accused China of using balloons for espionage. But China said that this is just an out of control meteorological balloon.</p>

<h3>wreckage</h3>
<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters. The U.S. military is trying to salvage more wreckage in order to more accurately understand the actual use of this flying object.</p>

<p>The U.S. military uses special equipment such as underwater drones to search and salvage balloon wreckage. The "Explorer" -class marine measurement ship uses the sound of sound to find the wreckage fragments in the fall area. According to the U.S. military, the search area is about 2.25 square kilometers.</p>

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>Description: President Joe Biden is still one of the most unwilling to join the Ukrainian fast -rails to join in the NATO junior. This will launch a fierce debate with NATO member states at the Summit of NATO next week at the Summit in Lithuania. These countries urgently hope that once the conflict between Ukraine and Russia is over, they will immediately absorb this war -torn country to join the NATO Alliance.</p>

<p>Description: Germany's investigation news media Correctiv reported that a young Chinese man with German nationality was pressured by the Chinese police while traveling in China not long ago, forcing him to provide Chinese government information in Germany who criticized the Chinese government.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) When the Germans of the pseudonym Alex arrived at a airport in a certain place in China, they were invited by the police to enter a small room and asked if they participated in Germany to participate in the [attacking the Chinese government's assembly demonstration] in Germany.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/白紙革命在柏林海外九零後為何吶喊/a-63978431)Essence At first, he denied it, but later the police took out the scenes showing Alex present, so they had to admit it. "They later asked very directly: Who is the organizer of the demonstration? Who else is there? What are the appearance characteristics of the participants? They are particularly concerned about the names of the participants."</p>
<p>Alex said that the interrogation lasted for several hours, and he endured the police's roar in hunger and fear. "I don't know when I finally collapsed, so I provided the pseudonym of two demonstrators I know. Nodded the location, and then let me print in the interrogation transcript and an apology book. "</p>
<p>Currently, Alex has returned to Germany. Correctiv has talked with the Germans many times, and has also checked the photos and chat records it provided to determine that its narrative is basically true. The chat record also showed that he asked him to continue to provide information at the airport.</p>
<p>According to Correctiv's information, the German security organs have been involved in the matter. If the Chinese authorities have been confirmed to have put pressure on German citizens to provide information about other people in Germany, the already intense German -China relations will be further affected.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-08T10-23-00Z/64023493_404.png" />At the beginning of December last year, a demonstration rally was held in front of the Chinese Embassy in Berlin to protest the Chinese authorities' zero -epidemic prevention policy</p>
<p><strong> Germany has not updated travel security warnings </strong></p>
<p>At present, the German Federal Parliament Liberal Democratic Party Foreign Affairs spokesman Lahit(Ulrich leins)Halter(Jürgenhardt)The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been required to issue a Chinese travel warning in this matter. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that German citizens with Chinese descent also enjoyed the right to consular protection. "As for whether the German citizenship of the Chinese who joined the German nationality is not recognized by the Chinese side, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not know about it." China also said that there have been cases that have previously showed that "Chinese people do not fully abide by the obligations of international law when they face the Chinese who joined the foreign nationality." The German Foreign Ministry did not mention whether it would update the Chinese travel warning information.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the US State Department went to mainland China to issue a security warning, calling on U.S. citizens to take into account the unable to leave China and illegally arrest due to the "local law's wanton execution".</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities have put pressure on Chinese citizens or Chinese who live overseas or Chinese, and have had many precedents earlier. In March of this year, the Voice of Germany and Correctiv have cooperated with investigation to reveal: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国如何控制在德留学的精英学子/a-64905899">Chinese students studying in Germany are strictly controlled by the Chinese government</a>Especially for international students who have received scholarships from the China Study Abroad Fund Commission. The scholarships of the China Study Abroad Fund must sign an agreement in advance, promising that "activities that are not engaged in the interests and security of the motherland" must be promised. They are obliged to report to the Chinese Embassy. Those who violate the agreement may be punished. A young man who also signed an agreement on the China Fund Commission herself said that he would never dare to participate in demonstrations in Germany because the Chinese embassies and consulates will make a "very severe" response. The other five Chinese students also revealed in the conversation <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/参与白纸运动就像赌上人生-部分留学生畏惧回家/a-64485906">fear of the Chinese government monitoring</a>Essence</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The Iranian Ministry of Justice stated that two men who participated in the Shahchera tomb of Shahchera who participated in October last year were executed on Saturday (July 8).</p>
<p>On October 26 last year, the Sunni Muslim extremist "Islamic State" (IS) claimed that it was responsible for the attack on the Shihcheragh (also translated "Tomb of the Light King"). The attack killed 13 people and 30 people were injured.</p>

<p>The United States announced that it would provide a bundle bomb for Ukraine for more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>US President Biden said this is a difficult decision, but he believes that Kiev needs this ammunition so that Russia cannot resist Ukraine's counterattack.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the United States announced on Friday (July 7) that it provided Ukraine with a new military assistance of $ 800 million (about S $ 180 million), including a collection of bombs.</p>
<p>Since Russia has invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the total military aid provided by Ukraine has exceeded US $ 40 billion.</p>
<p>When Biden was interviewed by the United States CNN (CNN), it was said that the Russian army was "trying to cross the trenches to prevent tanks from driving. This is not an easy decision."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-07-08T13-50/000000.png" />The White House national security adviser Sha Liewen said that Ukraine provided a written guarantee to the United States that they promised to use a bundle bomb very cautiously to minimize the risks facing civilians. (Reuters)</p>
<p>"Ukraine has provided us with a written guarantee, and they promised to use these ammunition very carefully to minimize the risks facing civilians.</p>
<p>An official of the Pentagon told reporters that the timetable for supplying a bundle bomb will cooperate with the countermeasures of the Ukraine.</p>
<p>According to the Tas News Agency, the Russian Ambassador to the United States Antonov criticized the United States' decision: "Washington's attitude of transferring fatal weapons to Kiev is obviously cruel and indifferent."</p>
<p>"Now, worship the United States, for many years, innocent civilians will face the risk of being killed."</p>
<p>More than 120 countries in the world are banned from using bundle bombs, but the United States, Ukraine and Russia have not signed relevant agreements.</p>
<p>The bundle bomb will release a large number of smaller bombs, which can attack multiple targets on a large scale and strong lethality. Unexpected small bombs often pose a threat to the life safety of civilians after the conflict ended for many years.</p>

However, Europe has no such power in reality. "</p>
<p>"China understands this, and it is also using this. Just this week, China has postponed the visits to China, a senior representative of EU diplomacy and security policy. A signal of power is out, pointing out that if Chinese manufacturers are restricted in the key European market, Europe will inevitably be tough. "</p>
<p>"The situation in Europe is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the three parties of the German ruling alliance are even more important to reach China as soon as possible. The same important position is the same as the EU countries. Empty. "</p>

<p>"In the increasingly stronger and Chinese chip dispute, Europe is in an extremely unfavorable position. On the one hand, EU companies rely on the US semiconductor industry leading companies. Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm's high -performance chips are applied to today's data centers, as well as Mercedes and Mercedes, and Volkswagen will produce unmanned cars in the future. "</p>
<p>"On the other hand, European companies are also inseparable from Chinese products. Many technical levels are not top -standard standardized chips. They are indispensable for German machinery, heat pumps, and solar equipment. These chips often come from China."</p>
<p>"Moreover, there are not many chip companies that occupy an important position in the global industrial chain, and at the same time rely on China and the United States.

These European companies also have thousands of employees in the United States. At the same time, the Chinese market is also difficult to replace these European companies. For example, German giant Yingfei Ling, which has a turnover of 1/4 of its turnover, comes from Chinese business. Another country that exceeds Yingfei Ling. "</p>
<p>"The United States and China almost do not rely on the European semiconductor industry.

<p>(Voice of Germany) According to the newly issued decree in Taliban, thousands of beauty salons in Afghanistan will be forced to close this month. For many women, these salons are the last chance for them to make money. Not only are they the only source of income from many families, but they also provide women with a welcome security space for women.</p>
<p>Few countries restrict women's rights on large -scale as Afghanistan. According to reports, women's lives in this country are like jail and have been widely prohibited from participating in public life.</p>
<p>Nada Al-Nashif, deputy senior commissioner of the United Nations Human Rights Affairs, said in a statement issued on June 19th: "In the past 22 months, (Afghanistan) women and girls' lives are limited. All are discriminated against. "</p>
<p>A recent report released by the UN Human Rights Council further pointed out that "the serious, systematic and institutionalized discrimination of women and girls is the core of the Taliban ideology and rule." "</p>
<h3>Woman who is in danger of selling books</h3>
<h3>Women were kicked out of the university campus</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/塔利班禁女性讀大學-聯合國美英轟違反承諾/a-64172440">Since Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, women have received strict restrictions on higher education. </a>Initially, men and women in college were strictly separated. For a while, girls can only teach by other women or older men. At the end of 2022, the Ministry of Education of Afghanistan issued a decree, and even such an opportunity to study ended, women were completely driven out of the university campus.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many women have interrupted their studies because of this. UNESCO (UNESCO) estimates about 90,000 women may be affected -this is also the number of admission girls in 2018.</p>
<p>Taliban claims that many female students do not wear appropriate Islamic clothing, such as wearing a headscarf and a gender mixed, so they have issued a ban.</p>
<p>In December 2022, UN spokesman Stephanedujarric said it was difficult to imagine how Afghanistan would develop and respond to the challenges facing without the active participation of women and the education brought by them, and pointed out that "this is" for this "to this" to this "to this" to this " The future of the country has a devastating effect. "</p>
<p>According to various media reports, some Afghan women are currently continuing to be educated through online seminars. However, because the country's Internet connection is poor and lack of work and career prospects, it is almost impossible to become an alternative.</p>
<h3>"This was my only hope"</h3>
<h3>Women lost employment opportunities</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/塔利班禁雇佣女性-三国际组织暂停在阿运作/a-64212761">Afghan women are not only prohibited from being educated, but also excluded from the employment market. </a>According to data from the International Labor Organization, the number of women employed last year decreased by 25%compared to mid -2021.</p>
<p>Taliban prohibits women from cooperating with the United Nations or other non -governmental organizations. This leads to a number of international non -governmental organizations such as Save The Children, the Norwegian RefugeeCouncil and the International Organization (Care) business in Afghanistan, because if there are no female staff, they will not be able to Implement projects. Thousands of female government employees were fired and even paid their salary at home.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Yaminimishra, director of the regional regional of the International Amnesty Organization, said that women are prohibiting women from exacerbating the humanitarian crisis for non -governmental organizations in Afghanistan. "Taliban seemed to make the country fall into famine," she said.</p>
<p>"Their discriminatory policy has caused unsafe food to shock and makes international assistance almost impossible." She added. Women who need help can only receive assistance from other women because they are banned from contacting strangers.</p>
<h3>Afghanistan female doctor</h3>
<h3>Female medical health environment seriously deteriorates</h3>
<p>For women, mothers, and babies, Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Each year, 7%of women die during pregnancy or childbirth. Many mothers do not have enough food, which increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. After giving birth, they struggled hard to raise children.</p>
<p>The humanitarian organization "Dr. No Borders" believes that Taliban excludes women outside of higher education and does not allow them to help organize employment, which greatly worsen the medical service environment. Especially due to Taliban's travel restrictions on women, this environment is worse.</p>
<p>In rural areas in Afghanistan, the nearest hospital is usually 75 kilometers away; and without "Mahram" (father, husband, or brother acting as a guardian), women must not travel. To make matters worse, many people in Afghanistan are unbearable to the travel expenses of this distance, let alone two people travel.</p>
<p>More importantly, Taliban stipulates that women can only be treated with female doctors. So far, women have been allowed to stay in the hospital, but the female doctor is very short, especially in rural areas. The female doctor is also limited by the same action as the patient. Those who couldn't find the companion were forced to stay at home. Almost the entire Afghanistan lacks female doctors and midwives.</p>

<h4>They and sports equipment: Afghan women who are prohibited from participating in sports</h4>
<h3>Football means "offside"</h3>
<p>Since Taliban has re -controlled in August 2021, a series of measures taken by the regime have seriously limited the lives of women and girls. It is part of the prohibition of women's sports activities, but many women are dissatisfied with it. The Associated Press took an anonymous shooting for them and their sports equipment. This is a former women's football team in Kabul.</p>

<h3>"I feel like I'm dead"</h3>
<p>Nora is a fighter. She grew up in a poverty -stricken area in Kabul and always insisted on her position without fear of difficulties. However, when she and her family were threatened by Taliban, she left Kabul with a trembling manner and hid in her parents' hometown for a few weeks. She told the Associated Press: "Since the back of the Taliban, I feel that I am dead."</p>

<h3>Exercise becomes extravagant hopes</h3>
<p>For this young woman in Kabul, even playing basketball is a luxury. A spokesman for the Taliban National Olympic Committee announced that the authorities are planning new sports facilities to enable women to participate in sports again. However, the authorities had previously issued a similar statement on the girls of girls in junior high school and high school, but no progress has been made so far.</p>

<h3>restrictions on dresses and exercise</h3>
<p>Dressing restrictions have become equally strict. In the summer of 2022, Sonia Niazi, the host of Afghanistan TV show, resisted the provisions of covering the face, but was eventually forced to comply when he appeared.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, women must wear a robe when they go out, a kind of clothes covering the whole body. If women do not comply with this rule, her male relatives will face the risk of prison.</p>
<p>The women's sports team is no longer allowed to participate in the competition. Due to this provision, Afghanistan women's football is exiled in Australia. The Taliban decree also prohibits Afghanistan from going to parks, gyms, public swimming pools, gymnasiums and sports clubs, which makes it almost impossible for women to participate in any sports activities.</p>

<p>According to international media on the 8th, the Chinese PLA sent 13 aircraft and six warships in the airspace and waters around Taiwan within the past 24 hours of Saturday morning. At this time, US Finance Minister Yellen was visiting Beijing.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense said that from the development of air and maritime surveillance, the land -based missile system has been prepared. According to a press release of the Ministry of National Defense, the four Chinese aircraft-two SU-30 fighters, a BZK-005 reconnaissance aircraft, and a Y-8 anti-submarine fighter-cross the midline of the Taiwan Strait and enter the Southwest Air Defense identification zone in Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait midline was once regarded as the de facto line of the two sides, but China said it did not recognize the so -called midline.</p>
<p>China claims that Taiwan is part of its territory. If necessary, it can be annexed force, and the Air Force and the Navy are sent to perform so -called tasks around Taiwan almost every day to try to weaken Taiwan's defense capabilities and intimidate 23 million people in Taiwan. However, so far, the people of Taiwan seem to be basically not affected by the Armiculi of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>It is expected that Xi Jinping will not meet her while visiting China.</p>
