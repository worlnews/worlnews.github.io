<p>German Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德外长访华有感如今中国更是制度对手/a-65374287"></a>Essence During her visit to China, she stated that the European Union recently stated that China is a partner, competitors and system opponents. She said that it is clear that we must face such a world -renowned country with more than one billion people, and are our largest trading partners. Moreover, close communication is necessary, which is also in line with the interests of the people, employment and economic circles. "But it is also very clear that we are dependent on China in some areas and are unhealthy."</p>
<p>Belbak said that this does not mean "decoupling", but to reduce risks and clearly know that economic dependence may bring risks. Belbak said that economic security will be a central issue for China.</p>
<p>On the Taiwan issue, Belbak stated that for the German government, it is decisive that "military conflicts should not occur there." The goal is to downgrade conflicts and maintain peace and stability. This means that "the status quo should not be changed unilaterally, let alone the use of military force."</p>
<h3>How can the German Foreign Minister visit China for "correction" for Macron?</h3>
<h3>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned the EU not to impose sanctions on Chinese companies</h3>
<p>According to the British "Financial Times", Brussels will first propose <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705"></a>Essence The newspaper quoted a copy of the sanctions list pointed out that a total of 7 Chinese companies were listed in the sale of equipment for weapon production to the Russian military industry. EU member states will discuss this new sanctions this week, but in practice, it is necessary to obtain unanimous consent from 27 member states.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to this, "If the report is true, the European side will seriously damage China -Europe mutual trust and cooperation, exacerbate world division and confrontation, which is very dangerous." He emphasized that China urged the European side not to embark on the wrong path, otherwise China will firmly safeguard its reasonable and legitimate rights and interests.</p>

He emphasized that the gate of the United States is open, but the improvement of the relationship between the two countries in the next step depends on the attitude of Beijing.</p>
<p>In February of this year, after the U.S. military shot down a suspected spy balloon from China, the progress of US -China relations also deviated from the track. This incident also caused US Secretary of State Brillin to cancel the original Beijing trip.</p>

<p>A balloon in China fluttered over the United States for a few days. On February 4, the U.S. military shot down in the coastal waters of the South Carolina. The United States has accused China of using balloons for espionage. But China said that this is just an out of control meteorological balloon.</p>

<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters.

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

Reuters analysis pointed out that this seems to show that Brinken has hopes to visit Beijing.</p>
<p>The "Shangri -La Dialogue" will be held in Singapore from the 2nd to 4th next month. Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources saying that Pentagram Building was trying to arrange for the Minister of Defense Austin and Minister of Defense Li Shangfu during the "Shangri -La dialogue". This attempt happened when the Biden government tried to restart military contact with China, but was repeatedly rejected by the latter.</p>
<p>On September 20, 2018, the State Department of the United States announced that due to the "major transactions" involved in the "major transactions" of Russian defense products export companies with major weapons exporters in Russia, they will be immediately signed in August 2017 to sign an effect on the "US Enemies Act". At that time, Li Shangfu, the Equipment Development Department and Minister of the CPC Central Military Commission, imposed sanctions.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Li Shangfu was appointed Minister of Defense.</p>
<p>If the talks during the "Shangri -La Dialogue" will be actions, this will be the first face -to -face meeting after the Campaign of the NMC after the balloon incident in February this year.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Presidential Climate Special Envoy, Cliff, revealed to Reuters that China has "invited him to visit China in the near future" to avoid negotiations on the global climate change crisis. He stated that President Biden had approved the meeting, but the specific time was uncertain.</p>
<p>However, Chinese officials did not confirm the news. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said in response to related questions last week: "On the issue of climate change, the Chinese position is consistent. (Ciriflowing Cry's visit to China), please learn from the Chinese competent authorities."</p>
<p>For a period of time, US Secretary of State Brosky, Minister of Finance Yellen, and Minister of Commerce Raymond have expressed <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美財政部團隊傳2月赴中-媒體為耶倫訪華鋪路/a-64459379"></a>Wishes, but have not made progress for the time being.</p>
<p>When a meeting with the US Ambassador to China on Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang also said that the United States should correctly recognize China, return to rationality, and deduct the first buttons of Sino -US relations. Achieve each other. On the one hand, we cannot talk about communication, but on the other hand, it is constantly suppressing and curbing China. Can't say one set. It is necessary to respect the red line of the bottom line of China, stop harming China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits. In particular, it is necessary to properly handle the Taiwan issue, stop continuing to empty the Chinese principle, and stop supporting the "Taiwan independence" split forces.</p>
<h3>How to solve the problem of Taiwan in Beijing</h3>
<p>Last week, Reuters reported that the US Congress approved the provision of 500 million US dollars of weapons assistance to Taiwan through the Presidential Dialogue (PDA). Presidential appropriation rights are authorized methods for providing security assistance. U.S. aid Ukraine has adopted this way, that is, the US president allows US presidents to transfer items and services in US inventory without the permission of Congress.</p>
<p>The United States Ambassador to China, Bernus, said on Twitter on Monday: "Today, Qin Gang, a State Councilor and Foreign Minister, held a meeting. We discussed the challenges in US -China relations, as well as the necessity of stable relationships and expanding high -level communication. ","</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-08T-36-00-00-04-00/000000.png" />On March 21, 2023, Russian President Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/yujie/yj2-05012023075017.html/@@images/image"></a>Associated Press picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/yujie/yj2-05012023075017.html/m0501-yj3ee.mp3/@@stream"></a><strong> The iron blood suppression of Putin and Xi Jinping is to let all critics shut up </strong></p>
<p>On April 18, 2012, Putin regime sentenced 41 -year -old dissident Karamulza for a 25 -year imprisonment in the crime of betrayal. This is the heaviest sentence of the dissident since Putin took power.</p>
<p>After hearing the verdict in the court, Karamulz smiled at the lawyer. The lawyer later quoted Karamurz, saying that he was repeatedly sentenced to reflect the Kremlin's "affirmative" work. Karamurz's wife, Yefunia, also pointed out in a statement that the judgment showed that the Kremlin was very scared and hated his husband, so that they wanted to locked him in the prison for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>As early as seventeen years old, Karamurza criticized Putin like a prophet. In December 1999, Putin, then the then Prime Minister of Russia, unveiled a plaque to pay tribute to the latter to commemorate the former Soviet leader and the Chairman of the Kigger. At that moment, Karamulza realized where Russia's Russia would develop. A few weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Karamulza accused the "Cremlin's dictatorship" in a speech. After more than a year, he issued a warning again, but this time was in the conclusion of the crime trial. He was poisoned twice in his early years and caused neuropathy. He accused him that the Moscow regime would assassinate him, but the Russian authorities denied it.</p>
<p>Kangos Proor, director of the Herbinck Alien Research Center, commented that Karamulza was repeatedly sentenced to a warning from the Putin regime to other opposition characters. Russia in Putin is tightening. According to the human rights organization, nearly 20,000 Russians were detained for opposing the Ukrainian war.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, on April 10th, eight days ago, Xi Jinping's political power sentenced human rights activist Xu Zhiyong to the fourteen years in prison for subverting the state power, depriving political rights for eight years; another human rights activist Ding Jiaxi was sentenced to twelve prisoners for the same charges. In the year, he deprived of political rights for three years. China's trial is more secretive than Russia's closed -door trial: no information on the case on the official website of the court system. The results of the trial were informed by the lawyer, and the lawyer was threatened and must not be transferred to the family members.</p>
<p>Ding Jiaxi's wife Luo Shengchun immediately announced the final statement that Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi were not allowed in court. Xu Zhiyong said that his dream is to build a beautiful, free, fair, and happy China. "The world is still the world of people in the world. Like Karamusza, Xu Zhiyong is also an early -mature political opposition. He vowed to overthrow the communist tyranny in his diary in his diary. Ding Jiaxi emphasized that "autocracy will die", "the huge changes in China are in front of me, even if I am in the high wall, I can clearly feel it. The footsteps of civilization are like a thunderous sound!I saw such a scene: The Chinese people will wake up from extreme slavery ... As long as the people no longer trust and obey their authoritarian rule, the privileges of dictators and their privileges will collapse. "</p>
<p>Ni Weiping, a researcher at the "Chinese Human Rights Defender" in the United States, said that this is the most severe result in his impression. The two men's sentence exceeded Liu Xiaobo, a symbolic figure of the democratic movement of the 11 -year democratic movement at the end of the Huwen era. The two were sentenced to a long term, which was like "trample on the public." Wang Yaqiu, a senior researcher at the "Human Rights Observation" of the headquarters in New York, pointed out that Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi suffered "cruel and absurd convictions", reflecting that Xi Jinping would "see the same as Kou". In Xi Jinping's power, anyone must shut up to avoid prison.</p>
<p>Recently, China and Russia have unreasonably amended the law and increased their punishment for crimes such as the crime of rebellion and spy. The governments of the two countries often punished the opponents with these crimes. Putin and Xi Jinping maintain their power through human rights cases that have been made as well as cattle and hair, but their powers such as the castle built on the beach have been crumbling. These two dictators who hold heating are starting a game who is more dictatorship and who is more vicious. So, who would eventually win?</p>
<p><strong> Re -sentenced to the disgusting person, showing that Putin and Xi Jinping and the West parted ways </strong></p>
<p>After Xi Jinping's regime reorganized Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, the U.S. State Department spokesman Weipa Patt issued a statement that condemned the Chinese government's "unfair detention and judgment". The two human rights defenders. The recognized basic freedom, such as assembly and expression freedom. The statement urged the Chinese authorities to release the two "immediately and unconditional", and also urged the Chinese government to allow everyone to exercise internationally recognized basic freedom. "The United States will always stand with those who bravely defended human rights in China and around the world." Britain and several European countries have also condemned the judgment. Ni Weiping analyzed that Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi were repeatedly sentenced, and it was a clear signal issued by the Chinese government, that is, "Anyone who advocates freedom, democracy and human rights in accordance with Western standards in China will be relentlessly suppressed." The Chinese government treats the most well -known human rights defenders in the country. "For some foreign leaders who are anxious to restore the normal relationship of China relations, they do not drink." The international community "must stand with those who pay the greatest sacrifices for the Chinese people for their rights."</p>
<p>The judgment led by Putin has also been severely condemned globally. The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Russian ambassador, and London also announced that it would sanction the five people arrested related to Karamurza. The European Union condemned that the sentence was "beyond" and urged Russia to immediately release all political prisoners unconditionally. The United Nations described the judgment as "the Russian government's blow again for civil rights and the rule of law."</p>
<p>In Xi Jinping's China and Russia in Putin, this judgment is not the first case. In China, the "July Nine" arrest was the largest national sweeping of rights protection lawyers and unusual people after the June 4th slaughter. In this process, the generally applied torture, the family members, and the first -hand director of the first -hand director of the authorities of the authorities of the television confession, all showed clearly that Xi Jinping's regime has already torn off the final mask. Recently, the Chinese authorities have detained the well -known publisher Fucha in Taiwan and Dong Yuyu, a senior commentator of the official media "Guangming Daily", and many Japanese diplomats were also arrested. In Russia, the opposition leader Navari was poisoned and sentenced to nine years in prison. Reporter Savroonov was sentenced to 22 years of prison for writing articles about the Russian defense industry. Shen was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for public opposition to the Ukrainian war and the Russian army in Butzia. Siberian reporter Maria Pinomalianko was sentenced to six years in prison for reporting Russia's bombing of the Marwopol Theater.Similarly, Xi Jinping also frequently learned from Mao Zedong, and his way of thinking and language has been shaped in the Mao era. Whether it is "Fengqiao Experience", or "rectifying the three winds", and mobilizing the urban youth to start a business, it is a wonderful plan from Mao Zedong. As Taiwanese scholar Wang Yun said: "Xi Governance is under the signboard of the Chinese institutional advantage. In fact, it is the collectivism under the logic of the top advantage. It requires individuals to abandon their ideals and needs. They can only serve the party state. To make it worse, Xi Jinping's team did not contribute any new discussion or methods in the Internet era; It practiced in the 21st century, but the rectification language or technique of the early 20th century. "</p>
<p>Xi Jinping and Putin are tougher than their predecessors than their predecessors. They no longer cooperate with the Western "Human Rights Show" and will not release political prisoners under the pressure of the West. Russian political scientist Gudkov believes that Putin's Russia is not an authoritarian society, but an upgraded version of the totalitarian society, which can be called "to be a total of totalitarianism" or "recurrence of totalitarianism". Democratic government that runs normally. This analysis is also used in Xi Jinping's China. American journalist Martha Ge Sen, who grew up in Russia, lamented: "This country wants to commit suicide. All living things -the words of the people, the people's protests, and the love of the people -all will attract attacks because they will attract attacks because The energy of life becomes unbearable for this society. "This is the same in China. Because of the strict blockade of the news, the struggle between Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi is unknown. The only way for ordinary Chinese to fight Xi Jinping seems to be" lying flat flat flat "" ".</p>

<p>U.S. President Biden is expected to announce a new rule on Monday (May 8) that requires US Airlines to provide compensation for passengers when major flight delays or cancellations.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg and Reuters, the Minister of Transport Pete Buttigieg issued a statement saying: "When the airline is canceled or delayed, passengers should not buy it."</p>
<p>The statement pointed out that the Ministry of Communications plans to write regulations that require airlines and other carriers to be responsible for retention passengers, including dining and hotels.</p>
<p>An anonymous White House official said that the government will also launch a new version of the Ministry of Communications official website to show which airlines have provided compensation for passengers who have encountered delays and cancellations. He said that the White House hopes to promote the existing benefits of airlines, saying that almost no airlines provide passengers with compensation except for refund.</p>
<p>The US Transport Safety Administration predicts that flight demand this summer will exceed the level before the crown disease. In order to protect the rights and interests of passengers, the Bayeng government planned to promote the corresponding regulatory measures.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2022, U.S. airlines could not quickly increase flights, prompting tens of thousands of flight delays and cancellation. In the winter, Southwest Airlines had technical system problems, and hundreds of thousands of passengers were affected.</p>
<p>The American Aviation Association said: "There is no motivation to postpone or cancel the flight, and do its best to ensure that the flight takes off and arrives on time, but security is always the first task."</p>
<p>The US Airlines Association believes that flight delays or cancellations are related to the pressure of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce system pressure and reduce flight. FAA has pointed out that due to the lack of air traffic control personnel, some flights will be reduced.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) is located in the Shangshui border between Shangshui, northern Hong Kong. It is not only a hotspot of tourists in mainland China, but also a "parallelist" town. The new crown epidemic has made them extinct for three years. Since <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港与内地2月6日开始无检疫无上限通关/a-64604713"></a>Later, the drugstore once again stood on both sides of the street, and customers dragged their luggage to buy and packed on the spot. The crowd is not as crowded as before the epidemic, but the influence of passengers is obviously easy to see.</p>
<p>Ms. Bai, a mainland man, just leased the new store on Shangshui, and planned to decorate to open cosmetics stores, do parallel imports and purchasing business. She said to Germany's voice: "Mainland cosmetics (parallel imports) are relatively strict, and often check it. After all, doing this in Hong Kong is a legitimate operation, which is more advantageous." The store is concentrated. The predecessor was a "parallel import shop" specializing in the grocery of Hong Kong -made goods. It was originally opened by Hong Kong people in the epidemic.</p>
<p>Now on the streets of Shangshui, it is not difficult to find a drugstore named after Putonghua Pinyin, which is less common in the past. Ms. Bai, who had been in business in Shenzhen for the first time, came to Hong Kong to open a store, and several mainland friends around her went to Shangshui to open a physical store. She described this as an industry trend, but frankly said that the rent was higher than that of the budget, and the people in the market did not reach expectations. "It may have just cleared the customs, and the customs are too strict, so no many people have come to buy a large number of purchases." However, she is still optimistic about the prospects: "Although the three -year epidemic crack down on the economic capabilities of many people in China, I think they have the ability to consume frequently. The desire to consume is still there. "</p>
<p>Shortly after the customs clearance, the residents of Shangshui had felt the changes in the community. Miss Liao told Germany: "Many of the well -made small shops can't hold the rent increase, and the environment is relatively comfortable during the epidemic, and now everything is returned to the original shape." She said that when the government announced the switch, most of the vacant shops immediately immediately closed the shops immediately. Change the drugstore, as a resident, "unable to change and was forced to accept." Mr. Tan also has a similar experience. In an interview with the Voice of Germany, he said: "A lot of local shops have closed. The usual night food shops and stationery stores are gone. Worried about the load capacity of public transportation: "After the customs clearance, take the train to the city, and the carriage will be a lot crowded.</p>
<h3>China Switch: Vaccine Tourism has become popular in Hong Kong</h3>
<h3>?</h3>
<p>Mainland ’s labor season leave is the peak season of traditional tourism. During the five -day“ Golden Week ”of the Hong Kong Government, 625,000 in the Mainland visit Hong Kong, which was slightly exceeded by the authorities expectations, but resumed only 60 % of the same period in the same period in 2019. Long -dragon dragon emerged in the stars, and the ticket lobby was full of mainland passengers who scrambled to buy tickets to cross the sea. During the epidemic, the Hong Kong Palace Museum and M+Museums, which were opened during the epidemic, all recorded the highest number of entrants since the opening of the museum.</p>
<p>However, in the water -this mainland tourist hotspot, the merchant has gone through the "abnormal" golden week. Jewelry store clerk, Miss Wang pointed out that the store did not have mainland customers to patronize during the May Day holiday, and the business amount was 40%worse than expected, and the nearby drugstores were also very deserted. She told Germany's voice: "It is completely unexpected, we originally hoped that the business would be good and prepared a lot of special products. Unexpectedly, even if the price was set very low, there were still no guests." When the epidemic was the worst, she said After the customs clearance, the business volume was only more than 20 %, and it was pessimistic that "it is impossible to reply to the level of 2018."</p>
<p>Miss Wang has been engaged in jewelry retail for many years. The client group of the store is a passenger in Guangdong Province. Jewelry stores are a must -have where many mainland passengers come to Hong Kong, but she observed the change after the epidemic: "The guests are more cautious. If they feel beautiful a few years ago, it is common for them to buy a ring tens of thousands. I will be reluctant. "Therefore, her shop dare not enter too much valuable products, and she has to study a special style to cater to the new taste. "The consumption model has changed. They paid attention to shopping in the past, and now they pay more attention to the tourism experience.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T04-06-00Z/65545365_401.jpg" />During the Golden Week, there were crowds of popular attractions in Hong Kong, but it only returned to 60 % of the same period in 2019.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Not only the consumption model, but also travel habits. During the Golden Week, traditional attractions such as Victoria Harbor, Daodian Street in Guangdong, and famous milk tea stalls in Central, still have mainland tourists. At the same time, many Hong Kong "check -in" hot spots can be seen on the mainland social media small red book. Some mainland passengers eat McDonald's fast food under the McDonald's road sign of Hong Kong Island, and take photos to the Land Police Station of the Landmark of the Hong Kong -made film. There are even posts on Xiaohong's book about alternative travel strategies and private room attractions to do medical examinations and bank accounts as "tourist strokes."</p>
<p>Miss Li Li, a free travel tourist from mainland China, visited Hong Kong last week. She said to Germany: "This trip mainly went to Hong Kong tea restaurant to eat food, and came to visit with friends for four weeks. I felt that there were more Macau passengers in Hong Kong. She said that she was different from the past. She did not arrange a luxury shopping itinerary, but just bought some snacks and daily necessities. "Because I think Hong Kong is similar to the mainland, and many products have been on the mainland, so I buy it in Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Hong Kong's economic growth in the first quarter of this year was 2.7%, reversing the disadvantages of economic shrinkage for four consecutive seasons last year. Due to the low base effect during the epidemic period, private consumption expenditure in the first quarter increased by 12%. The Hong Kong Government and the business community hope that the tourism industry will become this year after switching [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港千億赤字創史上第二高-學者預算案缺乏遠見/a-64785613"></a>One of the main motivation. Li Zhaobo, a honorary teaching and researcher at the Institute of Asia -Pacific Business Institute of CUHK, analyzed that the latest data reflects the average value before the private consumption power does not meet the epidemic. Looking at the May Day holiday market, he is not optimistic about the speed of recovering the tourism industry. He said to Germany: "The epidemic is like a reshuffle. Mainland passengers replaced other channels for shopping in Hong Kong. This habit can be permanent."</p>
<p>Li Zhaobo believes that mainland tourists in Hong Kong have a peak of consumption -oriented travel models. "The situation will not be as beautiful as before the epidemic. The most capable group will choose to go shopping in other countries. After all, Hong Kong is not a product of the product. More people are pursuing an authentic culture, not simply rushing to famous stores." Under the influence of social media and the change of economic conditions and shopping models after the epidemic, the authorities and the industry must think about the new way. He warned: "Hong Kong's tourism industry is still dreaming, thinking about relying on the past. The reality is that the tourism industry alone (Agent) is not sustainable. You need to meet the transformation at any time."</p>

This visit was a return visit to Yin Xiyue's visit to Japan in March. Previously, it was speculated that Kishida visits to South Korea to July, so this visits in advance means that the relationship between the two countries has risen rapidly. The Chinese media's reports on this interview are mainly concentrated in South Korea's protests. South Korean observers believe that visiting South Korea's visit to South Korea is wary.</p>

After Kishida Wenxiong arrived in Seoul, he first worshiped the National Xianzhong Institute in Tongqui District, Seoul. Since then, South Korean President Yin Xiyue held a summit on Kishida Wento, who visited the Presidential Palace. Kishida Wenxiong's visit to South Korea means that the "shuttle diplomacy" that South Korea and Japan have launched the summit for each other after 12 years.</p>
<p><strong> Why did Kishida visit to Korea in advance? </strong></p>
<p>Yin Xiyue conducted a two -day work visit to Japan from March 16th to 17th. Kishida Wenxiong conducted a return visit this time. This is a re -meeting of the leaders of the two countries after 52 days. Earlier, some media speculated that Kishida Wenxiong also received July in South Korea, but this visit to South Korea this time means that the relationship between the two countries has heated rapidly.</p>

The first is Yin Xiyue visited Japan in March and visited the United States in April. The influence; the second is that the seven major industrial group (G7) summit will be held in Japan from May 19th to 20th. Yin Xiyue has been invited to prepare for the attendance. Before the summit discuss the specific issues, visit Korea. South Korea's respect, avoid the misunderstanding of Yin Xiyue's visit to Japan twice, and the Japanese Prime Minister visited South Korea.

<p>In response to this visit to Kishida, Chinese media have reported many reports, but the theme of the report is more concentrated in South Korea. The topic of the Global Network is "Welcome and oppose Kishida visits to South Korea in front of the Presidential Palace". The report is "Yin Xiyue kneels first, how much returned Kishida visits to Han?"</p>
<p>In response to the attitude of the Chinese media, South Korea's current political commentator Li Zhengxun believes: "China and North Korea are watching this visit. After Yin Xiyue took office, he visited the President of the United States and talks with the Japanese Prime Minister. This time, the Japanese Prime Minister visited Korea. This In a series of actions, China must be wary: it seems that the cooperation between the United States and Japan and South Korea has begun to form. China will definitely threaten South Korea, but there is nothing terrible. Major South Korea's companies have been withdrawn from China. In the past, we should not have been When we are so close to China, when China needs in the past, our funds and technology have been invested in. Now China is strong and is a permanent member of the Security Council. ","</p>
<p>Li Zhengxun further believes that China hopes that there is no nuclearization of the peninsula, but its true idea is that North Korea in the north should not conduct nuclear tests. South Korea in the south should not hold a joint military exercise with the United States to maintain the current division. The willingness.</p>
<p>According to reports, during the talks, the two heads of the two countries first conducted small -scale private talks, then a large -scale talks, and met with reporters together. Leaders of the two countries discussed the cooperation in security, high -tech industries, youth and cultural fields during the talks.</p>

<p>Since February 24, 2022, the Chinese President Xi Jinping did not contact the Ukrainian President Zeelianzki. Until the spring of this year, Ukraine was preparing to counterattack. After the war of the war, the two called for the first time after the war; China insisted on persuading and promoting talks, and sent representatives to visit countries such as Ukraine to visit in -depth communication with all parties. On the day of Xi Ze's call, a proposal of the United Nations General Assembly mentioned "Russia's invasion of Ukraine", and China still voted in favor of the voting in the whole case. This made the outside world speculate that China's attitude towards the Russian and Ukraine War changed.</p>
<p>In the past year, the United States and other Western countries have continued to condemn Russia to invade Ukraine, and China, which is "friendly" with Russia, has always claimed to maintain a neutrality against Russia and Ukraine. The government and its control of public opinion have actually assisted in preaching Russia's arguments on war.</p>
<p>Recently, the Asian Facts Research Lab and Taiwan Democratic Laboratory (Doublethink Lab), Ukrainian Citizen Organization Detector Media and research institutions Iri BeaconProject jointly released a research- [] [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05082023081536.html/first-100-days-full-report-chn-simplified.pdf"></a>。研究报告显示，从俄军侵乌后100天内，中文信息空间的叙事以低成本的方式重复俄语叙事，并且，中俄两个信息空间中可观察到共同主题︰反美主义与反西方情绪、认定俄罗斯为受害者和英雄。</p>
<p>俄乌战事进入第二年，类似传播现象仍在持续。亚洲事实查核实验室观察中国对俄乌冲突的叙事，发现，中国媒体仍经常转载俄方论点，但宣传重点有所调整，两个主题逐渐成为主流叙事：中国为“劝和促谈”的“英雄”、美国为“拱火浇油”的“反派”。</p>
<p><strong>研究：俄乌战期间 中国复制俄语叙事</strong></p>
<p>上述报告收集了2022年2月12日至5月31日的叙事，选择三个话题进行分析：生物武器实验室理论、布查大屠杀、制裁俄罗斯。根据角色、故事寓意和操纵技巧分析叙事，其中将西方国家、俄罗斯、乌克兰等国家的角色进一步细分为英雄、反派、受害者、棋子。</p>
<p>叙事分析表明，中国叙事在普通话信息空间中以低成本的方式重复俄语叙事，一种方法是在中文语境中间接或直接引用俄罗斯官员或媒体的言论。在生物武器实验室阴谋论中，俄罗斯在两个信息空间中都扮演了英雄和受害者的双重身份，中俄宣传都旨在推动一个叙事，即美国和乌克兰正在合作攻击俄罗斯。</p>
<p>在针对俄罗斯制裁的叙事中，俄罗斯通常被描绘成受害者，且在中俄两个信息空间观察到的叙事都突出了西方机构和国际社会在俄罗斯制裁问题上存在分歧和对立。例如，在布查大屠杀的叙事中，很多媒体报道将西方社会描绘为反派，俄罗斯则被描绘为受害者，这些叙事格外注意将布查大屠杀的责任转嫁给乌克兰和西方。</p>
<p>亦有其他机构发现，俄罗斯虚假信息使用的主要叙事在俄乌战争期间持续进行。美国国务院为揭露和打击外国宣传和虚假信息所设立的“全球参与中心”(GlobalEngagement Center, GEC)，在俄乌战周年之际发布 <a href="https://www.state.gov/disarming-disinformation/%E8%99%9A%E5%81%87%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E8%BD%AE%E7%9B%98%E8%B5%8C%E5%8D%9A%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%8B%E9%87%8C%E5%A7%86%E6%9E%97%E5%AE%AB%E4%B8%BA%E6%97%A0%E7%90%86%E6%88%98%E4%BA%89%E8%AF%A1%E8%BE%A9%E7%9A%84/"> </a>Report, the five most important false remarks used in Russia's false information and publicity ecosystems: 1)NATO's siege to Russia and Russia "not an invaders"; 2)"Ukrainian provocation" and "racial extinction to Donbas"; 3)Naziization and de -militaryization; 4)Re -describe the war from "de -Nazi" to "Satanhua"; 5)"Defend Russia's sovereignty" against the West.</p>
<p>"Global Participation Center" special envoy and coordinator James Rubin recently accepted <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1629040287212269570"></a>It was said that China repeated Russia's lies on this war over and over again, repeating Russia's lies in biological weapons claims, and also said that the United States promoted the war, which was their false statement. According to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%9B%BD%E5%8A%A1%E9%99%A2%E7%89%B9%E4%BD%BF%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%A8%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E8%8A%B1%E8%B4%B9%E6%95%B0%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%BF%E4%BC%A0%E6%92%AD%E8%99%9A%E5%81%87%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF/a-64852300"></a>Rubin said that China spent billions of spreading false information worldwide, including false information that is completely consistent with Russia on the Ukraine issue.</p>

<p>Many major events occurred from February to April this year, including the anniversary of the Russian and Ukraine War, Xi Jinping visited Russia, Finland to join NATO, etc.; Asian facts investigated the laboratory to review Chinese diplomats recently about Russia and Ukraine's conflict, and found that they often mentioned China " Persuading and talking "," arch fire "in the United States.

But the peak of use occurred from from February to April this year. It should be noted that China often uses these two words to respond to the issue of Russia and Ukraine, but when talking about the situation of the Taiwan Strait, it will also accuse the American arch fire.</p>

<p>The Chinese statement after the call of Xi Jinping and Zeelianzki made it clear that "the core position is to persuade and promote talks", "China will persist in persuasion and talk, and make its own efforts to stop the fire and restore peace as soon as possible." If the set is listed at the beginning of this article, according to the character category defined in the report, China is shaping itself as a "hero".</p>
<p>Faced with Western countries such as the United States accusing China of might help Russia, China has denied that any of the conflict provides weapons and shaped its "victims" to be discredited.</p>
<p>Regarding military aid disputes, China clarified on the one hand, on the one hand, it takes the opportunity to spread the United States and other Western countries as the "arched fire" anti -decent to transport deadly weapons to the Ukraine battlefield and the fortune of war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning said on April 6. "There are military groups such as NATO in the United States that have unprecedented responsibilities for the Ukrainian crisis."

<p><strong> The media played the problem and enlarge the false narrative </strong></p>
<p>Asian facts investigated the laboratory observed that in the Russia and Ukraine War, China stood criticized the United States and NATO, but when foreign officials spoke in formal occasions, they were relatively restrained on certain sensitive issues. However, many official background media will further interpret and add misleading and false details on the basis of official statements (Reference: <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-03232023132923.html"></a>); In view of view reviews, Chinese media often unilaterally quote the comments from Russian media and experts.</p>
<p>For example, when Bayeng visited Ukraine in February, <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/202302/t20230221_11028718.shtml"></a>Only a brief response: "All parties, especially large powers, should adopt a responsible attitude to create conditions for persuasion and talks, and do more things that are conducive to politics, and should not be poured on the fire, let alone profit."</p>
<p>From February 20th to 21st, the Global Network issued many targeted reports on Biden's visit to Ukraine. The following three are listed:</p>
<p><a href="https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4Bme6NdOHID"></a>It is pointed out that Medvedev, vice chairman of the Russian Federal Security Conference, issued a post in a social media, saying that Kiev, the west direction, provides a large number of weapons and funds, allows NATO countries to earn a lot of funds and "hide" weapons to sell Give terrorists from all over the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4BnCpMdCqsq"> </a> <a href="https://m.huanqiu.com/article/4BnCpMdCqsq"></a>"One article quoted a large number of Twitter netizens and questioned why Biden did not go to Ohio, who had not recently occurred in the" poison train incident ", and mocked Biden's comics, photos, etc., and this article also appeared Russian scholars quoted by the above reports. Gu Xiefu and Zalin.</p>
<p>Some of the previous news, some only reported a single Russian official statement. Although some quoted the contents of British and American media such as the Guardian and New Year, the content of the British and American media reports, but in terms of views, it is obvious that the Russian scholars interviewed by Russian media reports are obviously reported by Russian media reports. Mainly.</p>
<p>Another case is Finland's joining NATO. Chinese diplomats have repeatedly criticized NATO's eastward expansion in the past, but in May last year, when talking about Finland's application to join NATO, the Chinese side called "major progress" and said that it would bring new factors to China and Fen relations. It was officially joined in NATO in April, and the official Chinese official did not make a statement.</p>
<p>Asian facts investigation of the laboratory noticed that Chinese officials dealt with Finland's entry into NATO relatively cold, but China Daily, CCTV and other media reported <a href="https://cn.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202304/05/WS642cae03a3102ada8b236dff.html"></a> ，<a href="https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20230405/1049292973.html"> </a>It also quoted the analysis of the so -called Chinese experts, saying that Finland's joining NATO will damage European security.</p>
<p>From the above reports, we can see that Chinese official media continue to quote the remarks of Russian officials or media, as well as traces of China -Russia propaganda and cooperation; on the other hand, it also shows the role and division of labor in propaganda work by Chinese officials and official media.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Through the above -mentioned research, the data of the Future Media and False Information Research Center, and the in -depth analysis of the main points of China and Ukraine's conflict on Russia and Ukraine, we have found that since the war, China has a narrative on this war. Its changes and unchanged. It is unchanged that the war narrative of the Chinese media has always maintained a certain degree of consistency with the public opinion of the Russian media; what changes is that in the war narrative of Chinese media and official speeches, China has a subtle change in its own role positioning. From the beginning of the war, from the early stage The official surface maintains neutrality, and if he wants to put himself out of the event, it will become a "person" that actively builds peaceful maintenanceers in the later period.</p>
<p>Asian facts check the laboratory summary observed phenomenon: 1)Since the Kaijie War of Russia and Ukraine, China has been assisting Russia to propaganda through quotation, reprinting, etc., and has continued to blame the United States and the West; 2)China particularly spread its "persuasion and talk" in particular this year, accusing the United States "arch fire pouring fuel", including the Chinese statement after Xi Jinping and Zeelianki called, and also used these two words; 3)A more sensitive issues involving US leaders' visits and specific countries joining NATO. The official official speeches are relatively restrained. The official media quoted Russian officials, media statements, or so -called international expert analysis to achieve critical purposes.</p>

Under the policy instructions of "retreating to forests and returning to farming", local officials implement the "one -size -fits -all" policy similar to the epidemic "clear zero". Many farmers' non -grain crops have been flattened, the trees on the hillside are fell, and rice is planted on the slope. A heavy rain washed out of the rice fields. People saw a bare hillside. In a video online, the rice just planted under the hillside was rushed away by the water: "Rice goes up the mountain."</p>
<p>According to a number of people in the special network, on May 5, the agricultural management of Zhangzhou in Fujian destroyed the field water pipes and did not automatically spray and irrigate the villagers. It is strictly forbidden to lay waterway irrigation farmland. In addition, agricultural management also prohibits farmers from fertilizing with fertilizer water, and offenders fined 50,000 yuan (RMB). Hubei netizen Gao Gao said in an interview with Liberty Asia on Monday that local officials in order to please the central government, violate the scientific principles, and work as a big formalism: "Regardless of the price of formalism, how much cost is paid, just finish it, just finish it, just finish it, just finish it, just finish it. As for the consequences, it has nothing to do with them. Otherwise, how can local officials continue to be officials? "</p>

Planting sweet potatoes on cement floor and planting rice on hillsides are typical formalism. Right: Recently, netizens calculated that local officials went to the countryside to assist in farming for two days, and planted 2 acres of rice to spend 490,000 yuan. Official rumors, but netizens believe that it is not a rumor, just a picture is wrong.

The town government covered the soil in the cement field and passed the inspection of the land department. But the villagers were miserable and did not buy the town government account. It means that you have died 5 times of sweet potatoes. Now weeds are overgrown, and cement fields cannot grow crops at all.</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang, a senior commentator who is concerned about the rural issues of China, said in an interview with this station that under the order that must be consistent with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, local officials can only invest in their official position. He said that political correctness is the way of survival of officials. For the scientific principles, officials do not understand: "It is just like the large -scale refining of steel in the 1950s and practicing waste steel slag. This behavior is to test the loyalty of local officials. If you don't listen, he thinks you are not loyal, just like dynamic clearing zero, you execute are the right political route. "</p>

Netizens questioned abuse of public funds and shows. According to Jimu News Sunday, on May 6, Henan officially rumored that the above -mentioned information referenced about farming activities and pictures, from the Farming Folk Culture Festival in Gray Tang Town, Hunan Ning Township. On the evening of the 6th, Gray Tang Town Government confirmed to Jimu Journalists that this is the second farming folk customs cultural festival held in the town, but the information of the Internet is not true. Government people pointed out that the farming folk culture festival activities for a total of 2 days.

It is not content to transfer you a huge amount of transfer payment? Forget the book!</p>
<p>Sheep: Leading is wise!You see, the inland provinces can not help the wall, so large assistance strength, still liabilities, sometimes, do not want to transfer payment for them!</p>
<p>Dragon: Dangerous thought!You little comrade, do you feel that your coastal is geographically unique, and can you develop the economy casually? Intersection If it wasn't for our party that the party has given you the policy of giving you a policy and helping you attract investment, you can still develop like this?

Yin Xiyue said that South Korea needs to get rid of the long -term model of diplomatic thinking in Japan. It is not advisable to take a step for the cooperation that does not fully solve historical problems.</p>

<p>Wang Zunyan, an associate researcher at the National Security Research Institute of Taiwan's National Security Research Institute, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia: "Restarting the" shuttle diplomacy "between the heads of state of the two countries. It is quite meaningful. The last time Yin Xiyue visited Japan was already a big step. This time Kishida visited South Korea, expressing Japan's determination to improve relations with South Korea. "</p>
<p>Wang Zunyan mentioned that in the field of security, the two sides promoted bilateral security cooperation between the United States and Japan, the United States and Japan, the United States and South Korea, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Japan, and South Korea to strengthen the provocation of North Korea. In addition, the two also mentioned the progress of Japan and South Korea's economic security cooperation and the progress of adjustment of export restrictions in economic and trade.</p>
<p>In response to the strategic meaning of Japan and South Korea's improvement relationship, Chen Wenjia, a senior consultant of the National Policy Research Institute in Taiwan, accepted an interview and analysis of Radio Free Asia. In response to the expansion of China ’s hegemony, the threat of the Urpine War, and the Nuclear military threat of North Korea, Japan and South Korea had consensus on the historical friction.</p>
<p>Chen Wenjia said: "Abandoning the appeasement of Wen Zaiyin and Trump's era, they are now ironic, and they must stop China's alliance with North Korea and Russia from military, diplomacy, economic and trade, security. Too much cooperation with China, negotiating with North Korea, and expectations for Russia. This is an important change. "</p>
<p>There were differences in historical issues such as Japan and South Korea's colonial rule in Japan during the Korean Peninsula. Reuters reported that Kanada did not apologize again on the 7th, and mentioned that in March, he expressed to Yin Xiyue. His government inherited the stance of the previous cabinet on recognition of history, including apology from the suffering of the colonial era, and the Japanese government's position will not shake.</p>

South Korea mainly criticized Yin Xiyue's attitude in the Wild Party Democratic Party, engaging in "humiliation diplomacy" and "forgetting history".</p>
<p>Chen Wenjia said: "The focus of this time is not to talk about historical events and apologies, because their national security is threatened by China and North Korea, coupled with the leadership of the United States. And how to ensure the safety of the Taiwan Strait. "</p>
<p>Chen Wenjia pointed out that once there is something wrong with the Taiwan Strait, China may cooperate with North Korea and Russia to attack South Korea and Japan in order to achieve the power of the so -called regional refusal and anti -intervention. When the national security is everything, history, economy, trade, and interests will become unimportant.</p>
<p><strong> The Communist Party of the Communist Party of China attacked the Korean President's storm to burn the Korean Pavilion to reprimand the vulgar vulgarity </strong></p>
<p>Yin Xiyue visited the United States a few days ago, talks with US President Biden and published the Washington Declaration. Yin Xiyue once mentioned the truth of the Changjin Lake Campaign in the Korean War, and also told the US media that he could not ask Japan to kneel about Japan's invasion of North Korea a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The English version of the Communist Party of China "Global Times" published social reviews and related articles one after another, accusing Yin Xiyue of the people's feelings of the people of South Korea and other Asian countries, and blindly followed the United States and Japan politically; The Korean government of national independence.After the South Korean Embassy rarely publicly expressed protests against Chinese media, "Times" posted a post on the 8th, and the anti -batch of the Korean Embassy could "interfere with independent reports of other media in a rough way."</p>

<p>Wang Zunyan mentioned that Kishida mentioned at the joint press conference that "you can still see the status quo by trying to change with force", which is a secret criticism of China; in addition, the talks between the two heads of state do not seem to discuss China or the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Wang Zunyan's interpretation: "On the whole, the Japanese and Korean governments did not intend to let the South Korean visit of Kishida be too obviously targeted at China.

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin announced on Monday (8th) that Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang was invited to visit Germany, France, and Norway from May 8th to 12th. During the visit, Qin Gang will meet with the foreign ministers of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>According to the British "Financial Times" report, the European Union is planning to sanction 7 Chinese companies on the grounds of supporting Russian war machines. These Chinese enterprises are accused, and the equipment sold may be used on weapons. They have been included in a new list of sanctions, and EU member states will discuss the list this week. This is also the first time since the outbreak of Russia and Ukraine's conflict, the EU proposed sanctions on Chinese companies that support Russia's war machines for the first time.</p>
<p>Wang Wenbin responded to this: "If the report is true, the European side will seriously destroy China -Europe mutual trust and cooperation, exacerbate world division and confrontation, which is very dangerous." He also said that China urged the European side to "not take the wrong path", otherwise China will firmly safeguard its reasonable and legitimate rights and interests.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping conducted his first call since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War on April 26 on April 26. This is considered to appease Europe. Earlier, the Chinese ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, had no "effective status" of the former Soviet Union's joining republic, which caused a stir in Europe.</p>

This is the first offline large -scale trade activity since China epidemic. During the exhibition, the organizer continued to release the exhibition area and the number of exhibitors with a record high and unprecedented prosperity, but the transcripts handed in the results showed that the export turnover of the Canton Fair this year decreased by about 15%compared with 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/jw-04172023135317.html"><strong> China Canton Fair encounters cold experts: export dividends are exhausted </strong></a>The spring exhibition period of the Canton Fair is from April 15th to May 5th, which is the first time in the three years of the Chinese epidemic. The official claims that the number of participating companies in the Canton Fair has reached 35,000, and more than 2.9 million people have entered the museum, all of which have reached a record high. However, the film uploaded by the exhibitors is a completely different scene: "None of us here, this organizer is the situation? Come and see, everyone is there, everyone is counting mosquitoes."</p>

The online export transactions have a total of US $ 25.11 billion, but this is reduced by about 15 from 29.73 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, a reduction of about 15 %. He said, "Because the cost of funds in Europe and the United States has risen sharply, it has cracked down on its demand for products made in China."</p>
<p>The Canton Fair is the longest, largest, largest, and largest comprehensive international trade event in China. It is known as the "China's First Exhibition" and is also regarded as a barometer to observe China's import and export trade situation.</p>

"Trade risks are still rising and operating pressures have increased."</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>"To attract the world to invest in the Chinese market, it is necessary to enhance consumption confidence." Lai Rongwei, assistant professor of the General Education Center of Longhua University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, accepted the analysis of this station. "Reverse consumption", but most of them are short -term and less consumer behavior. At present, the local government debt crisis, coupled with real estate, has not improved, and the Chinese people are still inclined to focus on savings.</p>
<p>Lai Rongwei: "At present, the (China) market is lack of confidence. On the one hand, the US and European economic exchanges with China are cautious. Although some of them advocate that they should continue to interact with China There are too many risks of non -economical and economics. "</p>

<p>"Hualang.com", which specializes in providing information in the chemical industry, reports that the number of people entering the Canton Fair throughout the day is 370,000, of which 67,000 foreigners; "The foreigners they expect only account for about 18%of the people's flow." People said, "Most of the people who came to the scene were customers from developing countries. They would not purchase consumer goods and light industrial products in large numbers, and they were only interested in equipment that improved labor productivity. "" ".</p>
<p>The commander of the financial scholar believes that on the surface, the European and American markets do not favor Chinese products as in the past, but behind it, it reflects that China is losing the status of the world's factories, and allows Vietnam, Indonesia, India and other neighboring countries. He believes that China has dynamically cleared the zero prevention and control over the past few years, and the chicken flying dog jump has allowed markets and European and American importers to perform whether the Chinese government can fulfill the World Trade Organization(WTO)At the time, the commitment to the degree of freedom of trade loses confidence.</p>
<p>"Even after the epidemic is liberalized, the (China) foreign trade policy has no looseness expected by the outside world." The commander further said, "To do foreign trade, the private economy occupies half of the rivers and mountains. The bankruptcy of the bankruptcy and bankruptcy, few private economies can rely on foreign trade to support China. This will lead to China's long -term relying on foreign trade exports to maintain its economic operation.</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, Li Daokui, Dean of the Chinese Institute of Economic Thought and Practice of Tsinghua University, pointed out at the "2023 Tsinghua Wudaokou Chief Economist Forum" that China plans to reach the level of medium -developed countries in 2035. The growth rate remained above 4.6%; but from 2009 to 2019, China's economic growth rate decreased by an average of 0.43 percentage points per year. According to this trend, China ’s economic growth will fall to less than 4.6%within three years. "Economy and stable growth are the norm of future work," he said.Lai Rongwei said that at present the United States and Europe carry out economic prevention and enclosure of China, and strive to clean the independent supply chain. Foreign and Taiwanese businessmen have left China based on diverse investment layouts. This trend has not changed. China's economic driving, small consumption, and decline in exports, the economy will inevitably maintain a high growth rate, and it will continue to be repaired.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-08T11-49-10-04-00/000000.png" />The former Political Commissar of the National Liberation Army National Defense University and the rank of Liu Yaia with the rank of general air force/CCTV <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/fushenqi/fsq-05082023114813.html/@@stream"></a>It has long been rumored: the Red Dynasty horses, senior generals, and famous military writer Liu Asia were rectified, but did not be confirmed. After the 2952 people's blew people's cream named the people's representative, the puppet puppet of the emperor of the party power, after completing the last link of the emperor's legalization, the authorities released the exact news of Liu Asia being reached. Top tens of millions of "political contribution" such as serious economic corruption may be severely sentenced to death.</p>
<p>"Red Culture Network" published He Lanfeng's article "Who should Liu Ya" "martyrs"? 》 Liu Yaia is a 'fifth column' hidden in the army ', ‘a typical ambitionist and conspirator’ and so on. This is just a shameless villain who figured out the sanctuary and the stigma of the stones under the well. It is not worth the details. But what is the root cause of Liu Asia in the Holy Holy Putting?</p>
<p>Liu Asia does have the world's perspective, with enlightened and bold remarks. In 2010, Liu stated that "within ten years, the transformation from authoritarian politics to democratic politics will inevitably occur." In 2010 With Contemporary History Research Network, an article entitled "The greater the leaders, the greater the people, the smaller the people, the less the people," and the author signed by the author is Liu's handwriting. There are many texts in the text. For example, "the cruel historical experience proves that the greater the leader, the smaller the people, the greater the leader, the more invalid the legal system." Not to do whatever means holding yourself up to heaven. This is the fundamental difference between the modern revolutionary leader and the individual ambitionist. " In 2010, Liu Asia was non -targeted, but Xi Jinping in 2016 was the listener.</p>
<p>However, it was not these remarks that stole Xi Huang's murder. Writers and celebrities who had such remarks in those years could not count. After all, Liu Asia is also one of the vested stakeholders. It is deeply immersed by the party culture. The democracy he yearn for is not to abandon the CCP. At best, it only needs to "improve" the CCP.</p>
<p>The key is that there is no Xi Emperor who has no resume and foundation in the military. He is not assured of the second generation of the red generation in the military in the army. And Liu Asia, who has the foundation in the military and international influence, is eligible to challenge the authority of Xi Huang, although when Emperor Emperor's first position, when the three headquarters of the three headquarters, the board of Xu Caihou, Guo Boxiong, Zhang Yang, Fang Fenghui, etc. On the front line; although Liu Asia, then the political commissar of the National Defense University, planned and introduced the huge anti -American promotional film "Silent" and submitted the name to Xi; although Liu Asia retired early in 17 years, Xi would be retired in 17 years, but Xi Xi retired in 17 years, but Xi Xi was retired in 17 years, but Xi retired in 17 years. The emperor is still uneasy, not restless. Therefore, the fundamental reason for Liu Ya's rectification is that the emperor has a common problem with all dictators, that is, the fear of any actual and possible challengers.</p>
<p>But Emperor Xi thought that except for threatening generals, and the army with a head -to -head was able to live in the throne. It was a wishful self -consolation. Contemporary history is obvious: the dictators who rely on violence have not ended.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-08T11-55-23-04-00/000000.png" />On May 1, 1989, Wang Dan, the leader of the first 64 student Wang Dan (in the picture), delivered a speech on the foreign media on the Tiananmen Square. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-05082023115442.html/@@images/image"></a>Agence France -Presse Pictures</p>
<p>Dear audience friends, the annual "June 4th" anniversary is coming. In the past few days, I have received some issues related to the 1989 democratic movement and the "June 4th" suppression related to the 1989 democratic movement. I am willing to make an open answer here for your reference.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked: I have a 30 -year problem here. At that time, I watched a student leader to talk to Li Peng and TV broadcast. My feeling at the time was that the student representatives were very aggressive, especially Uyo Kaixi, and often interrupted Li Peng. My feeling at the time was that the student representatives did not talk about strategies, and did not play some so -called political games. It was too direct and there was no compromise. Of course, now I think that for the CCP, Li Peng, I feel that they can't respect them, they are not worth it. They were scolded well. But my question is: the live broadcast of that live broadcast is not easy. If you do it again now, what will be different?</p>
<p>My answer: First of all, I don't feel too aggressive, there are no polite questions. At that time, the situation was so tense and the government's practices were so bad, and there was no basis for respect. Moreover, the government is the public servant of the people or the authorities have been hanging on their mouth all day long. Is the owner who wants to be humbled to the servant? I think we now say that students are too aggressive, indicating that some of our friends still think that the government is the master. I think the break of such a mentality is originally one of the goals of the democratic movement. At that time, we really intended to use equality, rather than the bottom -up gesture, or to do "enlightenment of action" and tell everyone what the relationship between the people and the government should be. Secondly, regardless of whether the students are polite, they will not affect the final decision of the CCP. It is impossible to say that the government's suppression is because the Uyra Kaixi is not polite. Finally, if I want me to come again, I will say who depends on who the other party is. If it is Zhao Ziyang and Kaiming, you should still talk; but if it is a conservative faction like Li Peng, I will not talk to them at all, because they will not really talk to us, and they will not tell the truth. Essence At that time, we couldn't know this, but now I won't believe them anymore.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked: What are the worst plans for you when in June 4th? Can students feel the differences between Zhao Ziyang and Deng Xiaoping? Do you think classmates have been used by Zhao Ziyang? After June 4th, have anyone thought about the armed struggle, the armed uprising overthrowing the reactionary regime or something?</p>
<p>My answer is: the worst plan is to go to jail. In early 1989, I was prepared for this idea, and I also asked Ren Town, who had been in jail. At that time, students should know that Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng had contradictions, but at that time, students had a strong self -restraint, that is, not to put the party struggle into the framework of thinking, and not be used by the party's struggle. This seems to be relatively naive now, but it is understandable to think like this at that time. Even today's social movement, many people will want to stay away from the influence of other political factors, not to mention our students. This is understandable. As for being used by Zhao Ziyang, this is absolutely thought of. The whole sports, Zhao Ziyang is passive. How can there be a use of students like this? As for the armed struggle, after the suppression, as far as I knew, many people had such an idea. However, the idea is the idea. In fact, the feasibility is not great, so it gradually gone.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked: What do you think that the CCP did not collapse after the June 4th suppression, but entered the WTO to make a fortune. Does this set an error example for other dictators? Do you think there is no acquiescence or even encouragement of politicians, will the tide of eighty -nine schools happen? Is it possible to occur as Tocowville said, as Tocowville said, it is possible to happen only when the authoritarian regime is loose. Is it difficult to occur in the environment like North Korea or China today?</p>
<p>My answer is: After the June 4th suppression, the Chinese Communist Party has not collapsed. It is a very complicated problem. I cannot comprehensively discuss it in detail. There must be many reasons. However, I think at least the following points are included: first, although the society at that time was against the suppression, there was still hope for the CCP system and did not intend to overthrow the regime. Third, Deng Xiaoping quickly opened the opportunity of economic development through the southern tour, and shifted contradictions and attention. Fourth, the international community actually forgive the CCP's massacre. Of course, they should now know that the judgment of the year is wrong. But the sanctions of that year were just doing it, and did not really shake the foundation of the CCP's rule. I think it makes sense for the theory of Tocqueville, but it is not absolute. Here is a "degree" problem. If the control is too tight, when you go to extremes, the people are rabbits, and they will still resist. This is the white paper revolution.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked: Do you admit that from the evening of June 3rd to June 4th, some citizens have made violence against the army's violent suppression? Do you recognize violence against violence?</p>
<p>My answer is: First of all, such a question- "Do you recognize" --- There is a problem in itself, because this is not a question that you do not recognize, and this should be a problem. And my answer is, of course. When the people lose all legitimate means, at the same time facing unreasonable violence suppression, why not resist violent resistance? Is it slaughtering on the ground to be lying on the ground? No one wants to solve the problem with violence, but in my opinion, things are simple. When the other party only uses violence to deal with you, you can only respond with violence. So what to figure out is, who uses violence first? In this regard, of course, the government shot first before the people resisted. At that time, the greatest consensus of students and citizens was not to provoke the government, so there would be no students who took the initiative to use the problem of violence of the army first. In fact, Professor Peking University, Aunt Beijing, all blocked the tank with the body without any violence. It is the government who faces peaceful and rational people, and first takes violence. In this case, of course, the people will resist and have the right to resist.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked: How did the Northern High -ranking Chairman (Zhou Yongjun, Wuer Kaishi, Feng Congde, Yang Tao) all happened? Why not consider the general election? Or does not have conditions?</p>
<p>My answer is: Of course, after a certain degree of elections, representatives of each school are elected. The general election did not have conditions at the time, because the exercise was still in progress. But the greatest efforts have been done to carry out democracy. Graduate Students of Peking University will conduct elections based on the charter driven by Li Jinjin. The Peking University Preparatory Committee was also campaign. Both Kong Qingdong and I published a campaign speech, and then they were elected after voting. It is the final retreat decision, and it is determined by voting by sound.</p>

<p>The Japanese and Korean summit talks were very satisfied. Kishida closer to the future that the future "wants to further strengthen the trust relationship between the two parties and open up a new era together." It symbolizes that the relationship between the two countries has farewell to the past mud.</p>
<p>From mid -March, first of all, South Korean President Yin Xiyue explained the goodwill, and proposed a solution to compromise on the previous collection of workers and other issues.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/有意放弃历史恩怨-韩总统时隔4年首度访日/a-65007845)Essence In the early May of May less than two months, this time it was Kishida Wenxiong's invitation. It also achieved the prime minister's visit to South Korea for 12 years. Essence</p>
<h3>ingenuity of the two countries in the dinner</h3>
<p>In addition to the official interaction, the diet of the leaders of Japan and South Korea at the dinner also has its own ingenuity. Kishida Wenxiong has previously prepared wine in Hiroshima Hiroshima and arranged for Yin Xiyue's favorite Japanese egg bag rice as a "second stall" supper. It shows that the two parties attach great importance to the diplomatic guest.</p>
<p>After restarting the "shuttle diplomacy" over the past 12 years, Yin Xiyue will visit Hiroshima in mid -the end, and he will invite the seven major industrial states (G7) summit as a VIP country. The two sides will go to Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park with the original victims of the Koreans to condolence to the monument. In this visit to South Korea, Kishida Wenxiong also went to Xianzhongyuan, Seoul to give flowers. While the official interaction between the two countries is hot, the folk has different positive waves.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T13-13-00Z/65540773_401.jpg" />Kishida Wenxiong on May 7 and his wife to Xianzhongyuan, Seoul, to give flowers to pay for flowers</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>"Opposite Kishida Venus Visit South Korea", near Seoul Guanghua Gate Square, dozens of Korean people held up signpost to oppose Kishida Wenxiong to South Korea. Some people said that "Japan should continue to apologize for the past colonial rule in the past." It was believed that Kishida did not really apologize to the South Korean people.</p>
<p>However, on the other side, there are also many Korean people holding the "Welcome Kishida" brand. On both sides of the schedule, the South Korean people said that "the defense cooperation between South Korea and the United States and Japan should be strengthened to defeat Russia, in order to defeat Russia. China and North Korea's dictatorship military threats ".</p>
<p>Compared with the period during the period of Wen Zaiyin's political power, the anti -Japanese emotions on the streets of Korea are relatively faded a lot. Including Japanese brands of beer, etc., etc., etc., they are reopened to obvious positions.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Korean Customs Department, the Japanese beer input amount from January to March 2023 has reached US $ 6.626,000, which is 148.4%of the same period of the previous year, showing that Japanese beer buying is gradually warming up. Others such as UNIQLO, MUJI, Artisei and other brands have appeared in large rows of long -term scenes.</p>
<p>In Japan, when Yin Xiyue visited, many Japanese have already felt that Japan and South Korea relations are gradually improving. Some people said that when they accepted TBS TV interviews, "in fact, the general public of Japan and South Korea is easy to become friends, but it often becomes very stiff when rising to the national level." It is a pity. Speaking of goodwill. "</p>
<p>The signs of the rise and back of Japan and South Korea can also be seen from the "Golden Week" holiday from the end of Japan to May 7th from the end of April. According to the passenger appointment data released by the Japanese travel industry HIS Holdings Group, Seoul, South Korea is still the first holiday tourist place in the hearts of the Japanese, the second in Taipei in Taiwan, and the fifth in Busan, South Korea.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Japan Tourism Bureau, South Korea has been the largest number of tourists in Japan since Japan ’s re -opening border last October.</p>
<h3>Show the importance of the United States, Japan and South Korea Alliance</h3>
<p>According to the results released by the NPO organization "Japan and South Korea Common Public Opinion Survey" in September 2022, 81.1%of the people of the Japanese and Korean among the Japanese and Koreans must improve Japan and South Korea relations. In just over half a year, Japan and South Korea re -joined hands with rapid pace, which surprised many diplomats.</p>
<p>Former South Korean Ambassador to Japan, Shen Yixiu, said in an interview with the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" that Japan and South Korea can visit each other twice in a short period of time. In the past, the old case showed a step forward with the international case, and that this signal may be the main factor. "</p>
<p>Shen Yixiu also said that the response to the relationship between Japan and South Korea should also have a mediation of the United States behind it. The core is that strengthening Japan, the United States and South Korea at this stage is more important for them. "</p>
<p>Miya Hya, director of the Institute of Global Strategy of Japan, told the Merchants News that although the performance of Kishida could be well evaluated, he believed that the relationship between Japan and South Korea had not yet been successfully resolved. He said that "90%of Japan -South Korea relations are all internal affairs, especially in South Korea's domestic left -school forces concentrated in the 50 -year -old generation, and then the 20 -year -old generation. In the future, it is still likely that the next Wen Zaiyin political power is born." The possibility of a sharp turn of policy will still be staged.</p>
<p>"Don't continue to ask each other on the past historical issues." Yin Xiyue reiterated this point at the joint press conference on the 7th. Kishida Wenxiong also said that it will continue to inherit the historical reflection discussions of the cabinet in the past 1965 agreements and agreements in the past 1965, and it means that it means "heartache." However, Japan and South Korea's relations that have been improved in a short period of time may also suddenly change their hexagrams in a short period of time. In the past, how can the two countries have a good look at each other in the future, so that each family is highly looking forward to it.</p>

Based on the protection of national security and protection of smart property rights, many top Canadian universities have announced the termination of research cooperation with China Telecom giant Huawei. Some experts said that this is a correct step. The research results of Canada should not be easily harvested in other countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/lf-05202022125655.html"><strong> Based on the protection of Guoan Canada for the launch of the ban on Huawei and ZTE </strong></a>*<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/wul-05202022074550.html"><strong> Canada blocked Huawei and China Construction 5G "strong dissatisfaction" </strong></a>The well -known University of Canada's University of Waterloo first announced that it would terminate all research partnership with Huawei Company last week. The University of Waterloo has confirmed that "through various legal mechanisms, exit clauses, and various programs to completely get rid of the relationship with Huawei."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-08T13-32-00-04-00/000001.png" />The University of Waterloo was the first to announce the termination of cooperation with Huawei, which triggered a bone effect.(Waterloo University website)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/lf-05082023131849.html/university.jpg"></a>Several top universities in Canada, including McGill University, University of Toronto, and University of Montreal, have announced that they will not have a new research agreement with Huawei.</p>
<p>The professor of the University of Ottawa Magarit McCuai, Professor Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, who has worked as a government department and has actively assisted China and Canada's science and technology cooperation. Partial ways.</p>
<p>She said that in the past, universities would always be worried that they lost their financial support when they lost Huawei. Under the new international situation, everything had new opportunities and seemed to lose, but it was not. "We are in the world's leading position in artificial intelligence, quantum computers, and aerospace technology. Therefore, the end of cooperation with Huawei does not affect our research and development capabilities. The funding gap will be supplemented by the federal government and other enterprises."</p>
<p>As early as the Meng Wanzhou incident, some Canadian experts had warned that Huawei made large -scale investment in Canada and became a big winner in harvesting Canadian R &amp; D technology.</p>
<p>Although the Meng Wanzhou incident occurred at the end of 2018, the Canadian government did not announce the prohibition of Huawei from participating in 5G construction until May last year, and the university was not allowed to continue to cooperate with Huawei at the time.</p>
<p>In February of this year, the Canadian government tightened the policy and announced that the Federal Research Assistance Committee would refuse to provide funds for institutional projects that contacted foreign governments and risked national security.</p>
<p>Because the United States has a high alertness to scientific research, Huawei has aimed at Canada at more than ten years ago. In addition to allocating large funds to various research universities each year, 8 private research institutions in Canada have also been set up.</p>
<p>Last year, when Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei accepted the media interview, he praised "Canadian University is very good. The three artificial intelligence in the world in the world are in Canada, and Canada will become the next Silicon Valley."</p>
<p>Chrisdop Parsons, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto(Christopher Parsons)Said that maybe Huawei is not really doing things for the Chinese government, but China is an arbitrary and casual country, and no one can ensure what will happen. "That is a risk management strategy, a strategy related to national security. The United States has begun to protect its sensitive scientific and technological research very early. It does not share with China. Of course, we need to take cautious steps to protect ourselves."</p>
<p>Canadian Industry Minister Shang Pengfei(François-Philippe Champagne)Expressing the actions of universities, he said in tweet: "Research security is the responsibility of all related partners."</p>

<p>According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, the reusable test spacecraft launched by China at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center returned to the scheduled landing field on Monday after 276 days of flight. According to official media, the successful trial marks that China has achieved "important breakthroughs" for the research on spacecraft technology, and can provide a "more convenient and cheap" round -trip method for future space tasks.</p>
<p>However, according to Reuters, the official media did not explain in detail what the spacecraft was, which technologies were tested, how high it was, and its rail operation position since its launch in early August 2022. The image of the spacecraft has not been released to the public.</p>
<p>In 2021, a similar Chinese spacecraft flew to the edge of space and returned to Earth on the same day, and the task of execution was basically confidential. According to China's major aerospace contractors at that time, the "level" of the spacecraft landed on the earth.</p>

<p>Description: Bloomberg analysis pointed out that due to the rise in prices and interest rates, high inventory rates, and the braking role of the U.S. -Europe market consumption demand on the U.S. and European markets, it is expected that China's exports will decline this year after a record last year. This is reflected in the transaction volume of the Canton Fair this spring. At the same time, some views believe that China's economic rebound is less than expected.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65553644/61191964"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T14-11-00Z/61191964_303.jpg" /></a>On April 13 this year, data released by the General Administration of Customs of China showed that the total value of China's import and export in the first quarter of this year was 1.44 trillion US dollars, a year -on -year decrease of 2.9%.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) According to the China Daily, the largest trade conference Canton Fair, China, which ended last week, was superimposed on the spot and online. The top 90 % of the epidemic in the fall of 2019.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the new crown epidemic broke out in China at the end of 2019, the Canton Fair has been fully restored offline. During the held in the spring of this year, Chinese officials were also trying to attract foreign investment to return to China.</p>
<p>However, Bloomberg wrote that the total transaction volume this spring was far lower than the peak of 38 billion US dollars in 2008, and it was also lower than the level of US $ 30 billion in the outbreak of the epidemic in 2019.</p>
<p>On April 13 this year, the China Customs General Administration released <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国一季度与俄进出口大增与欧美日贸易下降/a-65305566"></a>In the first quarter of this year, China's total import and export value was US $ 1.44 trillion, a year -on -year decrease of 2.9%. However, in March, China exported 31.559 billion US dollars, an increase of 14.8%year -on -year, far exceeding the estimated negative growth.</p>
<p>Bloomberg analysis pointed out that due to the rise in prices and interest rates, high inventory rates, and the braking role of the U.S. -Europe market consumption demand on the U.S. and European markets, it is expected that China's exports will decline this year after a record last year.</p>
<p>The sales representative of the company's sales representatives for Walmart Inc. and Costco WHOLESALECORATION said that in an interview with Bloomberg News Agency at the Canton Fair that the demand for the US market is very weak. This is the earlier time this year. The exhibition of home supplies held in Chicago, USA has been revealed. "Our big customers have not placed new orders because they say they are still digesting for inventory," he said.</p>
<p>The sales representative of a paper towel box and a hand -washing bottle factory in Dongguan also said to Bloomberg: "No one places orders, they are just looking at the price."</p>
<p>At the end of April this year, China's official purchasing manager index PMI showed that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/出人意料中国经济指数四月出现滑坡/a-65475440"></a>Essence The purchasing manager index dropped from 51.9 to 49.2. Experts generally believe that the atmosphere of the downturn in China's industrial field is mainly due to weakness with global demand.</p>
<p>But even if the demand has picked up, some sellers are still worried that buyers may still choose to purchase from markets outside China. Because the extremely strict epidemic prevention measures implemented in China last year suppressed the industrial chain and increased the difficulty of production and delivery. In this case, many companies have diversified purchases.</p>
<p>In addition, in the case of intensified geopolitical tensions, such as many American and Canadian buyers are more inclined to place new orders in regions outside China.</p>
<h3>2023 Two Sessions New Prime Minister Li Qiang completed the first show</h3>
<p>At the same time, some European and American companies said they may overestimate the speed of rebounding from the Chinese economy from the epidemic blockade.</p>
<p>The British "Financial Times" reported that Qualcomm President and CEO Cristianoamon told analysts last week: "The overall expectation of the outside world is that after re -opening, the Chinese market will rebound. But we have not seen these signs yet. ","</p>
<p>Chris Nassetta, CEO of Hilton, also said: "China's profit contribution this year will not be as expected as I look forward to."</p>
<p>Air Finland also said that economic recovery is "slower than many people."</p>
<p>But there are also some companies' evaluations are very optimistic. For example, the world's largest luxury group LVMH in the first quarter of this year <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/imf中国重新开放推动亚太经济增长/a-65501225"></a>Essence Chief Financial Officer said that he was "very optimistic" in the restoration of the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Budweiser beer also stated at the recent financial report conference calling "the Chinese market is back."</p>
<p>Daviddonabedian, chief investor of the Private Wealth Management of the Empire Commercial Bank of Canada, told the Financial Times that the differences in this judgment reflect that some observers predict the "large -scale rebound" of economic activities, and Other observers hope to promote growth through more loose monetary policy.</p>
<p>He said: "There is an expectation that economic recovery is like a spring ... (but actually) is just a good improvement and no explosive growth."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65553856/55883243"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T14-15-00Z/55883243_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The bad economic data followed: After the news of exports and decreased orders came, in March this year's industrial output in Germany also the largest decline in the past year. According to data released by the Federal Department of Statistics on Monday, the output of industrial, construction and energy supply industries decreased by 3.4%compared with the previous month. Although analysts had previously made an estimated production reduction in industrial production in March, it is expected that the decrease is only 1.5%. However, in view of the significant growth in January, the output of factory production in the first quarter of this year still increased by 2.5%over the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Elmarvölker, an economist of Babu State Bank, said: "This is another bad news from the German industry. The data released today proves that the risk of economic recession has not disappeared." As the largest economy in Europe in Europe, In the first quarter of this year, Germany passed by the economic recession: Following the economic decline last year, the GDP of Germany in the first quarter of this year was stagnant. If the national economy has declined for two consecutive quarters, it is considered an economic recession.</p>
<p>On Monday, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs still positively evaluated the economic development of the next few months. Relevant experts said: "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/imf预测今年全球增长28-英德呈负增长/a-65289504"></a>Clamer, Chief Economist of Commercial Bank(Jörging creams)Said: "Unlike most economists, we believe that economic recovery will not occur in the second half of this year, and it is more likely that the total national product has shrunk." He said that many areas in the world are raising interest rates This will affect the demand for "manufacturing" products in Germany.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T14-15-00Z/59602078_401.jpg" />After the car output rose briefly, March began to fall. The picture shows the production line of the BMW i4 model.</p>
<h3>Auto manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, and high -energy consumption industries are "reducing production"</h3>
<p>In March of this year, the output in the industrial field decreased by 3.3%month -on -month. The German Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the decline in the total output value of the industry was mainly caused by the automotive industry. In March of this year, the production volume of the German automotive industry decreased by 6.5%month -on -month, while mechanical manufacturing decreased by 3.4%. The output of high -energy consumption industries has also declined significantly, of which the output of the chemical industry has decreased by 2.0%.</p>
<p>Claimer of Commercial Bank said: "The decline in industrial production is also a adjustment after the rapid growth of the previous period, such as the automotive industry. However, in terms of trend, production may continue to maintain a decline in the next few months."</p>
<p>The decline in the construction industry was 4.6%. High interest and rising material prices have caused the construction industry to be troubled, and a series of construction projects have been stopped. However, the output of the energy supply industry increased by 0.8%.</p>
<h3>supply shortage no longer constitutes a serious problem</h3>
<p>The German industry will face severe tests this year. Alexander Krüger, chief economist of HAUCK AUFHkUser Lampe private bank, said: "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/坚持遏制通胀战略-欧洲央行再次加息/a-65028733"></a>"He said that the decline in the new business volume in March this year was comparable to the peak period of the new crown epidemic: the number of signing orders decreased by 10.7%compared with the previous month.</p>
<p>News that is beneficial to industrial production is the situation where raw materials and early product supply are in short supply. In April, the complaint of industrial enterprises on supply bottlenecks declined for seventh consecutive month. Only about 39%of the company said that the supply problem still exists, which is the lowest figure in the past two years.(Germany, Agence France -Presse, Reuters)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-08T14-52-29-04-00/000000.png" />In 1949, he participated in the Battle of Kinmen Guning, and the soldiers who were defeated by the soldiers were taken care of at the beach. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05082023141759.html/@@images/image"></a>Web image  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05082023141759.html/@@stream"></a>Recently, a number of media reported that Wang Dan's attention to Liu Ya's "may be sentenced to death" said that it was "one of the reasons for Liu Asia to be reinforced, which is likely to be because Liu is against the force of force."</p>
<p>Wang Dan believes: "There are various opinions on the outside world about Liu Ya's being rectified. But I think that the possibility has ignored the possibility: Liu Asia is the most powerful of the Chinese Communist Party's senior generals who have clearly opposed the military attack on Taiwan."</p>
<p>Wang Dan said that during his time when he was a visiting scholar at Stanford University, he saw a collection of Liu Asia in the East Asia Library. Among them, there was a lot of space for his view of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Wang Dan analyzed: "First, Xi Jinping's all -time Liu Asia may be related to Liu Asia's position on the Taiwan issue. If so, this is the evidence of Xi Jinping's preparation for military attacks. There is a voice against force attacking Taiwan, Liu Ya is one, but it is likely not only Liu Asia. "</p>
<p>In fact, before Wang Dan spoke, there were already many outside comments articles with Mao Zuo in mainland China on the issue of Liu Asia's "opposition to the Taiwan" issue. For example, a more representative "Golden Gate Battle Review&gt; Anti -Dragon Scale" "Liu Asia" Liu Asia "concluded: The most important reason for Xi Jinping's anger is Liu Yaia's article:" Golden Gate Campaign Review ". As a general of the Chinese Air Force, which is studying the military, it should be said to be the highest authority in the military research of the Communist Party. Hope that the timetable for martial arts to attack Taiwan is almost jumping in paper, the importance of this military research article is self -evident. This was originally the best military reference for Xi Jinping to attack Taiwan, but his research results exactly unified China to Xi Jinping, and splashed a pot of cold water with his head and faced with his head.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the author, the first mistake made by the author who made the above analysis was that he did not understand the time and the background of the "Golden Gate Campaign" and the background of the representative work of "Kinmen Battle" in Asia.</p>
<p>In fact, do a little more homework on the Internet to confirm that Liu Asia's "Golden Gate Battle Review -Commemorating my dear dad, East China Field Army Twenty -first Army Liu Jiande" started 22 years ago, which was 22 years ago, which was also 22 years ago. 2001.</p>
<p>In July 2004, "Sina Military" in Mainland China reprinted the article "China Youth Daily" published in the article "The Air Force will review the losses of the golden gate and the new war method to come out", which is said to be the "Strategic Air Force" plan of the mainland military, 15 generals such as generals promoted a series of major actions, and the Xinai Strait was already tight. Since April 2004), the article "Review of the Golden Gate Campaign" by Lieutenant General Liu Asia, deputy political commissar of the Mainland China Air Force, has been circulated on dozens of Chinese websites in mainland China. In response to this article, the Taiwan military held an official discussion and regarded this as a turning point of the PLA's strategy of Taiwan. In view of Liu Asia's identity and background, as soon as this article comes out, it shakes both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Professor Xu Yan, director of the Strategic Research Office of the National Defense University, told reporters that the PLA was not the same as before. The mainland military suddenly reviewed the Battle of the Golden Gate, which may show that in order to prevent Taiwan's leaders from breaking through the Taiwan independence bottom line, the mainland struggle against Taiwan has entered the final stage of military preparation.</p>
<p>This article published in July 2004 reminded: Liu Asia's "Golden Gate Campaign Review" has more than 28,000 words. According to the tips in the article, it can be seen that the article was written in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2001, Liu Asia was only the rank of major general, and the specific position was the director of the Political Department of the Beijing Military Region. At this time, Xi Jinping was only the governor of Fujian Province and a member of the 15th Central Committee. At that time, Wang Huning was only the deputy director of the Central Policy Research Office. At that time, Zhang Youxia was only the commander of the Army's Thirteenth Army.</p>
<p>In other words, Liu Asia's time to publish the "Kinmen Battle Review" was more time than Xi Jinping's "rejuvenation dream" that he "realized the motherland fully unified", and he said that it was more than ten years earlier for the purpose of using any means.</p>
<p>As early as 1995, the author was already in Taiwan <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=inpublisher:%22%E5%91%A8%E7%9F%A5%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%8B%E6%A5%AD%E8%82%A1%E4%BB%BD%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8%22&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ1fHK9-X-AhULEVkFHdu5DcEQmxMoAHoECCEQAg&amp;sxsrf=APwXEddiDj6aVhgcrmiXOqmQM6V_kj2DnQ:1683556201959"></a>He has published a book "New Century Prophecy from" August "from" August "to" Eight of the River ". This is why Liu Asia's "Golden Gate Campaign Review" was released, and the cross -strait experts from Taiwan recommended to the author soon, saying that "General Liu confirmed that your" Strait has no war ".</p>
<p>After the author read this masterpiece of Liu Asia at that time, the most impressed was the one of them: Chairman Jiang said: "There will be a battle in the Taiwan Strait."</p>
<p>Recently, after Liu Asia's rumor of "might be sentenced to death" was fired, I read this masterpiece of Liu Asia again. Reuse Liu Asia.</p>
<p>The opening of the "Golden Gate Battle Campaign" of Liu Yaia was: On October 24, 1949, the 24th day of the founding of New China, more than 9,000 regiments under the 28th Army of the People's Liberation Army crossed the sea to attack Kinmen and launched the Kinmen battle. Three days and nights on the island, because the support of the back, the entire army was destroyed, was the only thorough defeat since the PLA army became the army. Although our army had a heavy loss of the Xiangjiang Battle, the Blood Blood of the West Road Army, the Hexi Corridor, and the South Anhui Incident, they were not destroyed by the entire army ... The island battle, the victory wins, and the defeat is not. This combat characteristic has not been broken to this day.</p>
<p>According to the author's opinion, Liu Ya's "Golden Gate Campaign Review" first expressed the biggest regret of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party regime. Because "although the Kinmen Battle is in a storm, it affects the overall situation. This impact still exists today."Liu Yaia wrote in the article: Jiang Jingguo believes that the battle of Kinmen is the turning point of the Kuomintang. Kinmen campaign is like a stitched heart, injected into the dying body of the Kuomintang. This party has survived again. In the past 50 years, the Kuomintang has seriously learned the lessons of losing the mainland and inspired to govern. Taiwan has undergone tremendous changes. Today's Taiwan, the economy shows the forest of the world alone. Military depends on the United States, and there is no shortage of housekeeping. Politics is westernized. It has become my confidant.</p>
<p>Liu Asia said: The strategic position of Kinmen is too important. It is located on the edge of the mainland, north and Matsulian, forming an amphibious edge. Kinmen is a bridgehead in Taiwan. Chiang Kai -shek said: "There is no Taiwan gate without a Taiwan gate, there is no Taiwan or Peng; there are Taiwan and the mainland." In history, Zheng Chenggong and Shi Lang attacked Taiwan. They all set off in Jin and Xiamen. In the enemy, Kinmen enters the inland, and the retreat can barrier. If Kinmen is in my hands, the traffic line of the Taiwan Strait is facing a great threat. Taiwan lost his former enemy. The army crossed the sea and made a night. To this day, if you want to solve the problem of Taiwan, you must first solve the Golden Gate problem.</p>
<p>After reading this paragraph, the author's impression was not exactly that Liu Asia opposed the force to solve the Taiwan problem. On the contrary, what he said here "to solve the problem of Taiwan must first solve the Golden Gate problem", of course, discuss from the perspective of force attacking Taiwan.</p>
<p>In the book, Liu Yaia particularly emphasized the meaning of "the significance of studying the Battle of Golden Gate."</p>
<p>According to Liu Asia: "Golden Gate Battle, our army traveled to a strait based on land, and landed in an island. At that time, our army general only saw that this was a water movement from shore to shore. The sports operation on the other side is just like attacking the river from the river and the river. In fact, the battle of Kinmen is an amphibious landing and anti -landing operation, which is the same as my future war. Taiwan is a magnifying Jinmen. The Eight Army is a narrowing of our army. The battle of Kinmen is a mirror that can be crowned and you can talk about gains and losses. Many problems exposed in the Battle of Kinmen still exist to varying degrees today. Although time cannot flow backwards, history can be repeated. In order to take the lessons of the blood of Kinmen, in order to stabilize the left coupon in the future battle of the Taiwan Strait. "</p>
<p>You are the officials and audiences, please note that Liu Yaia particularly emphasized that the battle of Kinmen was an amphibious landing and anti -landing battle, which is the same as the war model of liberating Taiwan in the future ... Only by taking the lessons of the blood of Kinmen, can we stabilize the left coupon in the future battle of the Taiwan Strait. "</p>
<p>After reading or listening to this article, don't you think it was too wronged to say that Liu Yaia opposed to force attacking Taiwan was too wrong?</p>
<p>As for why the CCP ’s PLA“ strengthens the study of defeat ”through the“ review ”of the Battle of Kinmen, Liu Ya is alerting to say:" There are a hundred father in victory, and failure is an orphan. . In this regard, we need the spirit of the U.S. military. U.S. military is still studying the Vietnam War today, but it is not attentive to the Gulf War and the Kosovo War. In the year, the U.S. military continued to read, which spent a lot of manpower and financial resources in this regard. Failure is alarm bell. Why is victory? We are begging. We are the opposite: the victory is strong and colorful, and the failure is gently brought. Studying the history of the war is also the history of the governance, and the Donghu pen is needed. We must avoid the tendency of the age of the "age in the age of the age, the age of the age; ","</p>
<p>As we all know, as early as the period of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, a group of brain disabled experts represented by Jin Canrong and Zhang Zhaozhong appeared within the CCP, but they were actually mistaken for the country. Liu Ya, who was worried about this, reminded: "Today, the Taiwan army is no longer Jiang Jun, and Taiwan is not Kinmen. Besides, the Taiwan Strait operation will be tens of times more difficult than the Golden Gate operation. Taiwan. Since the self -preparation of the self -preparation, a smell that has been seen in the battle of Kinmen has gradually attacked. The previous year, the relevant departments demonstrated whether Taiwan can be beaten, ambitious, and strong. Faidi to!'Some said:' The Taiwan army is vulnerable, our army has stabilized vouchers. 'There is a newspaper and wrote it with a big title:' The missiles of our army can accurately hit Lee Teng -hui's desk Up. 'Last year, this department demonstrated how to fight, I went to participate, and I saw a mess. The heart floated into the air. I have a question: "Now raising my head is a satellite, my head is a radar, how to be in the eyes of the public. Below to Fujian to transport troops? "One person replied: 'That's not easy!Have you seen these seven -day long holidays? So many people in the country move on the train. We can choose a long vacation. Fujian. God does n’t know, I do n’t know!’I have a bitter smile. The organizer asked me to speak at the end. I only said one sentence:’ The biggest enemy is myself ’.”</p>
<p>It is this content that it will become the handle of the Maozuo in the Mainland of China in the future. It is believed that Liu Asia is "the ambition to grow an enemy and destroy his own prestige." As everyone knows, Liu Ya's painstaking is really a comment article as "Military News Network". The</p>
<p>In this article, Liu Ya also wrote passionately: "Fifty -two years ago, for the reunification of the motherland, my heroic people's PLA nine thousand healthy children crossed the sea without hesitation, and the blood was sprinkled with the sea. I heard their hateful shouts. Due to the coach of the coach, the commander lost, and the strong men were gone. Nine thousand unyielding hearts, in the thousands of years, who heeded with? History tells us that the general direction is wrong, there is even more, there are, there are, there are, there are, there are, there are, there are any directions, and there are even more directions. Thousands of loyal and brave people can only throw their heads empty and ask the sky. The battle of Kinmen is a valuable heritage of our army. Forgetting the past means losing again. "</p>
<p>This text has been expressed so much. However, the purpose of Liu Ya's "reviewing" the Battle of the Golden Gate is not just to promote the "defeat of attacks." fail!</p>
<p>In this article, Liu Ya also introduced: The Taiwan military textbooks wrote: ‘Before the battle of Guning’ s head, our military defensive island adopted a defensive battle. In the battle of Gu Ning's head, the Twenty -two Corps did not stop but attacked, laying the victory. Golden Gate, Matsu, and Taiwan are all islands, with different sizes. The combat of the defenders, Peng, Jin, and Maki are all anti -landing works</p>
<p>war. The anti -landing war is essentially defensive, but the offensive is necessary in combat operations. Because only by attacking means, it can destroy the enemy of landing and achieve the purpose of defense. This Guning head combat valuable experience also. ‘This shows that in the future, our army will attack Taiwan. Even if it is the island battle, the Taiwan army will also get offensive. Our army must be prepared to attack with the Taiwan army. "</p>
<p>On this basis, Liu Yaia also reminded that "I will fight against Taiwan in the future, be sure to do a good job in the future in the future."</p>
<p>Liu Asia said: This third force may be Japan, mainly the United States. I can assert that once the Taiwan Strait War broke out, the United States will inevitably participate in the war. There are four reasons: ① The United States has regarded the rise of China as the preferred goal in the 21st century. ② Taiwan has the geographical and political conditions of the United States and Japan. ③ The United States' commitment to Taiwan's security. ④ The value concept of Americans. It is not the United States if it does not interfere with other countries. Yesterday, we learned the principle of "the power out of the gun" from Chiang Kai -shek. Today, we should learn the principle of "sovereignty in the gun" from the Americans. Sovereignty cannot be defended with mouth, and can only use force. We must be prepared to fight against the U.S. military ... "</p>

Therefore, it has enhanced the information review and cuts off the authority of overseas visits of Chinese databases. Some scholars believe that China ’s move not only affects its own technology and economic development, but also harms its international reputation.</p>

Essence</p>
<p>The report quoted sources revealed that China ’s alert reports include the Georgetown University Safety and Emerging Technology Center. I wrote about the Chinese issue analysis report. Several reports of these reports quoted open source data from China, involving sensitive issues such as the "military -civilian integration" strategy, and the Chinese military's acquisition of advanced foreign chips.</p>
<p>The report also revealed that the National Internet Information Office of China notified many Chinese data providers in March this year, including Zhiwang and Wan De, and required restrictions on overseas access to related databases. Zhiwang then confirmed that this move has taken effect from April 1.</p>
<p>Timothyheath, an expert in China, China, said in writing that China may further damage international research on Chinese issues, including security issues related to security.</p>
<p>"Restricting access to academic databases in China will force scholars from all over the world to rely on other sources, including hostile Chinese foreign language sources. Therefore, restricting foreign scholars' decision to access Chinese academic databases may have a counterproductive effect and worsen the world's understanding of China. "He said," This will also cause the world to doubt. Because people think that there are many concealment in Beijing, so they dare not let the world observe their scholars' remarks, which will further damage the trust of China and the reputation of China. "</p>
<p>Many think tanks in Washington, USA have been committed to investigating and analyzing and issuing reports for many years. In recent years, it has been focused on Chinese issues. Scholars who work in these think tanks will also attend the U.S. Congress hearing to provide policy suggestions to American legislators and administrative authorities. The Wall Street Journal specifically pointed out that a senior researcher at the New American Security Center provided by the US -China Economic and Security Review Committee (USCC) in 2019 involves the assessment of China's national security and trade risks, as well as the Chinese army The operation of Fang in artificial intelligence has triggered the anxiety of the CCP's seniors.</p>
<p>The above reports also pointed out that the Chinese data platform is being reviewed at the negotiation stage and the upcoming contract, and related actions have affected cooperation with the Strategy and International Issues Research Center (CSIS) of Washington Think Tank. Not only that, Wan De has also cut off overseas access permissions involving specific databases such as company registration information.</p>
<p>Xia Ming, a professor of political science at New York University, told this station that Beijing's biggest concern is that the outside world uses these data to deconstruct the CCP's narrative. He believes that restricting overseas visiting Chinese databases is undoubtedly a "decourse" behavior, which will lead to the western equal restrictions, which will affect the progress of Chinese technology and economy.</p>

After all, the United States and allies are now the leading countries of global technology. They are open. If they have similar conflicts of the Cold War, they will be in China. There will be fatal damage. "</p>
<p>He believes that in order to restrict the opening of the United States' tough China policy to restrict its own database opening, the Chinese government's move to cover up the real information is "covering the ears and stealing bells." The blockade information will not only lose international trust at the diplomatic level, but also cannot persuade the public to accept the CCP's narrative.</p>
<p>As of press time, the above three think tanks and academic institutions have not responded to the station's inquiry on the subsequent measures to respond to Chinese measures.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly expanded the review of information on the grounds of national security. Related measures are not limited to the academic field. According to the China Media Finance News Agency on the 8th, the Suzhou National Security Bureau has recently searched the Suzhou Branch of Kaisheng Rongying Information Technology Company in the name of hazarding national security. Related actions are also one of the measures that the authorities have adopted by the authorities' consulting and auditing industry since the scope of the Anti -Spy Law expanded to the case, which has caused the industry to fluctuate. The report pointed out that some of the Chinese consulting and investigation agencies in the development of party and government agencies and secret units with secret units provide customers with sensitive information consulting, which endangers national security and development interests.</p>

<p>According to the content of the letter issued by Zhou Shifeng, the case has serious trampled on the constitutional law during the trial stage, and the core evidence is intentionally recorded without recording the defendant's opinions on the core evidence. According to people familiar with the case, Zhou Shifeng stated that "everything is based on the original recording", but the relevant content has not been written in the judgment and obviously violated the legal procedure.</p>
<p>Zhou Shifeng also said in the letter that at the time he was deprived of the right to state and appeal. The authorities not only forced him to sign on the final statement that had been written in advance, and did not ask him if he appealed when he was delivered. Not only that, Zhou Shifeng also accused the judges who threatened him to plead guilty before the trial, instead of judging in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>"These are the criminal procedure laws that are seriously violated in China," said the person familiar with the matter. "The letter was to say about these situations. In addition, Zhang Jun, Dean of the Supreme Court, at that time, everyone saw Zhou Shifeng's cases that did not see the cases of Zhou Shifeng.

At the level of the legal constitution, at the level of the Communist Party, the (court) must be replied; standing on the basic principles and human nature, and give a reply. Therefore, Zhou Shifeng wrote to them to see if they responded not to reply and how to reply. "</p>

The case is also called "709 arrest".</p>
<p>Zhou Shifeng pointed out in the letter that the "709 case" puts the lawyer's normal acting cases, the correct implementation of the law, and the legal rights and interests of the parties, and accused these lawyers constitute a crime. irrefutable evidence.</p>

Participants discussed the concept of the "unification of the big unification" in Chinese history and in reality, and discussed the impact of this concept on reality politics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/sc-02212023103754.html"><strong> Seminar of "Deng Xiaoping's Death and East Asian Democracy" in the United States group </strong></a><em><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm1-02232023073045.html"><strong> Russian and Ukraine's anniversary China "Peace Agreement" What is the abacus? </strong></a></em><em> Daily life, history and future </em><em> </em><em> "unification" problem </em>*</p>
<p>Wang Dan, the leader of the 89th Academic Games and the head of the "Dialogue China" think tank, spoke at the meeting and described the issue of the concept of "the unification of the big unity" with the title of "The Thought of the Unification of the Unification Everywhere". It is believed that the seriousness of the "unified unification" problem is increasingly prominent, and the erosion of the political system and civilization in daily life deeply penetrates into the bone marrow. He said: "In the discussion of our daily life, for example, on Twitter, on some community media, we also see that in most cases, everyone is not able to accept different opinions. Become a opposition between individuals, we will never learn anything to seek the same differences. I think it is also affected by the poisoning of the "unification of unification". "</p>
<p>He also believes that normal speculative order should be a equal discussion under each other's respect.</p>

It was a theory that advocated the unity of politics, economy, and ideological and culture. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has been respected by the ancient dynasty. In contemporary China, the concept of "unification" is also regarded by many people as the theoretical basis against Taiwan's independence and national self -determination.</p>
<p>Hu Ping, editor -in -chief of "Spring of Beijing", analyzed the three forms of the concept of "unification" in Chinese history and reality at the meeting. He said that the first form is the unification of Qin and Han -style, and it still adopts a special control policy for the frontier regions. The second form is the unification of the Qing Empire, which adopts different systems for Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet and other areas. The third is the unification of the Communist Party of China. Although the territory is similar to the Qing Dynasty, it takes a unified rule in the territory.</p>
<p>He further analyzed the three gaming forces that will occur in China's future evolution. He believes that including the forces that both advocate democracy and the national self -determination, the forces that advocate democracy and tend to be unified, and the unified power of the autocracy. If China will change in the future, the first two forces will join forces to overwhelm the third force. In the face of the claims of supporting national self -determination, it may also lead to some unified support of democratic forces to turn with autocracy. Therefore, he believes that "at the beginning of (transition), since all factions are pursuing freedom and democracy, they first (should) implement the realization of free and democracy in China. There is a transition period. The question is raised. "</p>
<p>Wu Guoguang, a senior researcher at the China Economic and Institutional Research Center of Stanford University, spoke at the meeting, saying that since the history of China, the time of unification and division accounts for about half, and only 25%of the time in the state of "unification" is only 25%. Being able to say that "the unification of the big" is the tradition of Chinese history. He concluded that Chinese civilization did not originate in a state of unification, and the earliest peak of ideological peaks appeared in the state of the pre -Qin Dynasty, and economic prosperity and diplomatic achievements often appeared in the non -unified state. He said: "Generally speaking, we must not taboo a‘ division ’word, we do n’t necessarily emphasize a‘ combination ’.”</p>

<p>Wang Juntao, chairman of the National Committee of the China Democratic Party, said in his speech that the ethnic state in the world needs to be eliminated in the future. At present, multinational organizations are restricting sovereign countries, and multinational civic society is also developing. He called on people to act: "The fundamental to eliminating the unification of the unification is to protect the safety and benefits of people through the way of sovereign nations. ","</p>
<p>He Anquan, the founder of the Shanghai National Party, introduced the situation of the Shanghai localist movement at the meeting and the concept of "Shanghai Man Manageing Shanghai". He also made a speech based on the "Political Transformation of the Chinese Democracy Movement", saying that the Chinese democratic movement once had a successful movement of the Chinese democratic movement. The transformation of improvementism to advocating overthrowing the Communist Party, and he speculated that it is currently facing another transformation: "The second transition is transformed, what is the transformation? It can be unified (accepted China) unification, and splitting can be."</p>

He said: "National construction does not require you to obtain the enlightenment of democracy and freedom, and then abstractly abstract for a large ideal service, or ask you to abandon the country, dedicate it for Chinese selflessness, and pursue the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Ask you to understand yourself again, understand your origin, family, and country, and then change step by step from yourself. "</p>

He believes that this system continues to suppress the courageous resistance and hurt civilization. The ethnic way to dissolve the "unified" system. He proposed: "There is a way to rebuild civilization, that is, people who have courage to recover."</p>
<p>Mr. Fan, the founder of Dongchuan Doudou, spoke at the meeting that in the historical construction of China, the May 4th Movement was amplified, and the joint provincial autonomy movement of anti -University's unification and advocating autonomy in various places was ignored at the same time. He also said that in the future, it is likely that with the end of the CCP's rule, the political situation in the Far East will have a more chaotic sub -stable than the Soviet Union. In this case, what we can do is: "Reconstruction of the ethnic identity across the East, and rebuilding the community at the level of the community, so that the entire change process can be smoother and less detours."</p>

Four days later, she announced the deportation.</p>

<p>Earlier, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly (also translated Zhao Meilan) announced on May 8th <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/加拿大召見中國大使-考慮驅逐外交官/a-65509675"></a>Zhao Wei.</p>
<p>Canada announced in a statement that Zhao Wei was "unpopular". He was accused of trying to intimidate Michaelchong and Zhuang's relatives in Hong Kong, because Zhuang Wenhao has always criticized Beijing's Xinjiang Victoria policy in February 2012, and puts forward the behavior of Beijing in February 2012, calling Beijing's behavior " Race extinction.</p>
<p>"We will not tolerate foreign countries in any form of interference in our internal affairs." And said, "Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they are engaged in this type of behavior, they will be sent back to China."</p>
<p>Zhuang Wenhao said that it should have been dealt with this way. He said, "I hope this not only shows to the People's Republic of China, but also shows to other autocratic countries in Canada. The threat activity is completely unacceptable. "</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy subsequently issued a statement, accusing Canada of violating international law, "catering to the hype of anti -China forces", and said that this move destroyed Sino -Canadian relations.</p>
<p>The Canadian government spent a lot of time to decide whether to expel Chinese diplomats. Julie and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had warned Beijing that there would be a rebound in this.</p>

This is an unspeakable decision. The Foreign Minister is dealing with this problem very, very cautiously."</p>

After the report was exposed, the Canadian government confirmed that it was expelled from Zhao Wei. Zhuang Wenhao also criticized the Canadian government to see Beijing's intervention in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Juli said last week that expelction may cause Beijing revenge, threatening the security of Canadians and the prosperity of the country, but it should be done. She wrote: "This decision was made after carefully considering all relevant factors ... We still firmly believe that defending our democracy is the most important."</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Zhuang Wenhao's incident was the latest attempt for the Chinese government to interfere in the Canadian internal affairs in recent years.

<p>(Voice of Germany) "There is no other way to describe it, this is a game <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/狀告中國新疆罪刑-維族代表律師親赴阿根廷申訴/a-62844000"></a>, I really believe it is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/究竟什么是种族灭绝/a-61504267"></a>As a former United Nations official, I also understand <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/维吾尔族法庭北京犯有种族灭绝罪/a-60072382"></a>I will not use it easily, and we should not use it easily. "</p>
<p>The newly elected Uyghur Japanese member Arfiya ERI emphasized in an exclusive interview with the US media in 2022 that she has studied Uighurs and has the United Nations background to observe [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/海外维吾尔人在被泄露的新疆被关押者名单中寻找亲人/a-61787911"></a>After the development of 2016, she used "racial extinction" to describe this "most serious atrocities".</p>
<p>In Japan's local elections on April 23 and 5 seats of members of the Parliament (4 House of Representatives and 1 Senate), the Liberal Democratic Party won 4 victory. Among them, Yingli Alfia's election attracts many people's attention.</p>
<p>Her parents are from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, and many local human rights issues are still the focus of world concern. In the elected voting itinerary, at the same time, Yingli replied: "I always think I am a Japanese."</p>
<p>But when talking about her foreign ancestry, she also believes that she should create a diverse society that allows all people who have taken root in Japan. She said: "As a member of the parliament, I will take Japanese human rights diplomacy as a shaft and work hard on the Uyghur issue."</p>
<p>After entering the Congress for the first time, Yingli Arfia walked into his office. After a long stare, I told the media: "In fact, my mood is heavy and responsible. The center of the center.</p>
<p>Yingli was not favored in this election campaign. The main reason was that the constituency was originally the site of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kentarousonoura. Take it down, but the local conservative class is still strong. In the end, he won the opponent with a 3 % vote rate and successfully entered the parliament.</p>
<p>The original popularity of Yingli was not high, including Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong, Deputy Prime Minister Aso Taro, and several ministers Kono Kono Kono, etc., came to assist in votes many times. In the end, he continued to lift the momentum to make Yingli stand out. Looking at Yingli's career, she is also a very good diplomacy and financial elite before politics.</p>
<h3>Volkswagen President said that the Xinjiang plant has no forced labor and Victoria scholars: there is a problem with the statement</h3>
<h3>Northern Kyushu Childhood</h3>
<p>The 34 -year -old Yingli Arfia was born in 1988 in the Kitakyushu District of Kitakyus City, Fukuoka Prefecture. Both parents are from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. His father is Uyghur and his mother is Uzbek.</p>
<p>When I was a child, Illia grew up in Kitakyuska, and still spoke fluent in Japanese in Kyushu. His father was harsh to her and told her: "You are a girl, but you can do everything." After coming to Japan, the mother continued to study hard as international students and integrated into Japan. Parents' diligent figure in Japan has greatly influenced Yingli Alfia.</p>
<p>When I read the fourth grade of elementary school in Kitak Kyushu, the Yingli family moved to Shanghai, China, and Yingli also moved to local international schools because of her father's transfer. However, when I was a kid, I only spent Japanese Lyrics, and she also faced cultural obstacles, so she strengthened learning English and Chinese during this period. In 1999 after going to Shanghai, the Yingli family was officially attributed to Japanese nationality.</p>
<p>After being promoted to middle school, Yingli, who lived in Shanghai, began to care about the problem of the gap between the rich and the poor. Walking in the high -rise buildings in Shanghai, a corner is a very poor area, which surprised her. Later, on her personal website, she also wrote "Why is humans be humans, just because of the differences in the place of birth and circumstances, will the living environment change so much?" During middle school, Yingli showed her care for society. Essence</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-09T06-47-00Z/65544828_401.jpg" />Yingli inherited the route of the former Prime Minister of Japan, Abe's route to the Democratic Party, and publicly stated that "there is something in Taiwan in Japan."</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>In 2006, Yingli entered the international school in Guangzhou to study in high school because of his father's transfer, which was very helpful to the international view of Yingli for many years. In addition to English well, she is also good at discussing international issues with students from various countries and even Japanese historical issues. She was finally elected as the president of the Japanese Student Union.</p>
<p>She once described it: "I am quite conscious and understanding of the Japanese consciousness and position. While adhering to this point, I hope to do things that can be connected to each other with the world." The study experience in China during adolescence allowed Yingli to have a wealth of experience in cultural conflicts, gaps between the rich and the poor, and international exchanges.</p>
<p>After going to college, Yingli went to the Georgetown University of Washington, USA to study, specializing in foreign policy science. The university is also the world's first -class political and foreign research institution. In addition to receiving high -knowledge baptism in the local area, Yingli also showed his strength in student organizations. He successively served as the president of the International Student Association, the president of the Central Asian Association, and the head of the dormitory.</p>
<p>At this time, Yingli also focused on the focus of his parents' hometown -Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. When she was in college, she wrote the paper based on "Urumqi's consumer culture and modern Uyghur identity", and was published after being highly appreciated. Then she entered the university research institute to study for a master's degree until she graduated in 2012.</p>
<p>In March 2011, Japan's worst earthquake in history occurred in history. At that time, the people who saw a severe disaster in foreign abroad found that she could not help to help Japan's tragedy, and made her decide to return to Japan to contribute. In July 2012, Yingli was admitted to the Bank of Japan, which was admitted to the National Central Bank, hoping to help the Japanese economic recovery and stable financial system.</p>

<h3>Return from the United Nations to participate in politics</h3>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Yingli began to think about whether he could return to his hometown of Japan. On her website, she said on her own website that "Although Japan is unique as one of the minority of peaceful democratic countries, the substantial diversity and national voice have not yet received feedback in politics, becoming a crisis." At this point, Yingli began to have the idea of participating in the election.</p>

In the Senate election in July 2022, Yingli was named the list of the Liberal Democratic Party's ranking ratio, but it was not elected in the end. After Yingli became the party minister of the local Liberal Democratic Party's election area in 2023, he met the resignation of Kentaro Kentaro, and Yingli immediately stated that he would participate in the Congress of Congress to make up for the election, and finally successfully joined the parliament.</p>
<p>Although it has become the representative of the parliamentary hall, Yingli still has to face many problems. This includes many online rumors, attacks on her parents from China, and even slander and injuries to her "Chinese spy".</p>
<p>In an interview with Japanese media, Yingli also stated that "the election of people's elections in the background of diversity is actually a threat to democraticism and cannot be placed."</p>
<p>She also said, "Once the fake information flowing out, it is difficult to correct some people even if it is corrected. While we are free to protect the speech, we also hope to respond to fake information in the preparation of the law." In recent years, "Internet right" has been raised in countries around the world to promote extra -conspiracy theory, etc., especially during the election period. The space for the issue again.</p>

<p>The target of this wave of drones includes the Kremlin. The Russian government believes that it is Ukraine, but it is denied by Ukraine.</p>

<p>US Treasury Minister Yellen said that if Congress does not increase a legal debt limit of US $ 3.1.4 trillion (approximately $ 41.7 trillion), it will cause a huge blow to the US economy and weaken the US dollar as the status of the world reserve currency.</p>
<p>Yellen Monday (May 8th) was interviewed by the US Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC), and was asked if the US Treasury Department could pay for bond holders when breach of contract. She replied that if the debt limit was not raised, President Biden would be forced to make a decision on how to deal with the resources of the Ministry of Finance, but she refused to discuss or sort these options.</p>
<p>She said: "There are various options, but there is no good choice. Each option is a bad option. The only option that can really put our economic and financial system in a good state is to increase the debt limit."</p>
<p>Yellen said that Biden wanted to establish a procedure to discuss and compromise with the Republicans of Congress on fiscal policy issues and his budget proposal, but he would not "point the head of the American people with a gun."</p>
<p>Biden has long asked Congress to increase the debt limit unconditionally. The Republican House of Representatives passed a bill that raised debt limit last month, but attached the conditions for comprehensively cut expenses in the next 10 years; this was opposed by Biden and the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Biden will meet with the President of the Republican House of Republican House on Tuesday (9th) McCarthy, the minority party leader McConnell, and senior executives of the Democratic Party of Congress to try to break the deadlock.</p>

Truman also said that the world has since been liberated from the dictator Hitler.</p>
<p>Although the post -war Federal Germany began to embark on the road of freedom and democracy, in the historical discussion of the following decades, there was a problem that it was difficult to solve: Does Germany really liberated on May 8, 1945? Or for the Germans, this day means that the defeat of Germany and the longevity of German spirit and goals are ended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/纪念二战结束-为何有不同日子/a-54794548"></a></p>
<h3>Different things</h3>
<p>The Second World War was completely destroyed by Germany. The lives of more than 9 million Germans were taken away in World War II, of which more than 3 million were civilians. 12 million people were forced to leave their homes. The 6 million Jews who lived in Europe were murdered and became a shame that Germany could not wash. Germany lost some of the east land and was divided into two parts.</p>
<p>Even so, in the early days of the war, most Germans would not expect to celebrate the days of May 8 as liberation. On May 8, 1949, the Liberal Democratic Party, who served as the President of the West Germany, described his feelings as a description: "Fundamental, May 8, 1945 The most tragic and most doubtful historical paradox. Because we were liberated on this day and also destroyed. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-09T08-57-00Z/48637627_401.jpg" />Monument to Liberation of the Soviet Army in East Berlin</p>
<p>At the same time, East Germany regime will [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/前苏联战争纪场馆在德国不再受欢迎/a-61749856"></a>Come here. During the tenure of Walterul Bricht, the leader of the Society of Social Party, the "Liberation Day" of Democratic Germany gradually became the "Liberation Day" of Democratic Germany on May 8. In the official narrative during the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the liberator, and East Germany was a part of the "anti -fascist" camp who advocated peace and democracy. As for the responsibility of German society for Nazi crimes, East Germany has no systemic reflection, as if it has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>In 1975, Walterscheel, President of West Germany, said in his speech on May 8 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the final battle: "We were liberated from a terrible shackle and were liberated from war, murder, slavery, and barbaric." But he reminded people: "But we must not forget that this liberation comes from the outside, but our Germans are unable to get rid of the shackles by themselves."</p>
<h3>Saying "liberation" is not easy</h3>
<p>Ten years later, in 1985, then federal president Richard Vonweizsäcker made a profound speech on the same occasion. In his speech at the Federal Parliament, he was convinced that for the Germans, "May 8, 1945 was the day of liberation." The German president said, "It will be from all of us from contempt for human nature. Theism of violence was liberated. "In the same year, German Chancellor Cole also called this day as" the day of liberation "twice in public speeches.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-09T08-57-00Z/60381867_401.jpg" />On the 8th of 1985, Federal German President Weitzzer delivered a famous "Liberation Day" speech</p>
<p>Witzzer's speech is generally considered to have index significance in the discussion of this historical topic. Weitzzer also believes that although it has gradually been used as [] on May 8, 1945(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德总统我们今天必须自我解放/a-53373828)Look at it, but it is still not a celebration for the Germans. Because the tragedy of defeat and destruction is caused by the Germans themselves. "We can't divide the May 8, 1945 with January 30, 1933." (Hitler was appointed Prime Minister of the Empire on January 30, 1933)</p>
<p>Ten years after this speech, the philosopher Hermannlübbe also said that on this day, the Germans are better to be open. He said that although some countries in Germany and the original victory over the country have gradually formed partnerships or have become partners in the European Community, which makes the Germans feel the impulse to celebrate on this day, but people are Britain is the victory of World War II, defeating Germany, and the Netherlands to commemorate the liberation of German tyranny.</p>
<h3>There is no "zero point" in history</h3>
<p>Wolfgang Wippermann, a historian at the University of Berlin, said all countries have unanimously agreed the great significance of this day. "A new era began on May 8, 1945, and at the same time, it ended a very terrible fascist era." But Wei Peman emphasized that it does not mean "zero" for Germans. The centers of the elite figures of many third empire were not affected after the war.

<p>The Chinese authorities have recently launched a large -scale search for foreign consulting companies, and official media cooperate with publicity reports. At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on May 9, some media reported a detailed report on CCTV News on the evening of the 8th. A spokesman Wang Wenbin responded that this is based on the "normal law enforcement behavior" carried out by Chinese law, which aims to promote "standardized healthy development" and "maintain national security and development interests."</p>
<p>On the evening of the 8th, CCTV's "Focus Interview" program reported on the topic of "Do not have attentive consultation" and reported on the Suzhou National Security Bureau of Jiangsu Province, together with the local Market Supervision and Administration Bureau and the Statistics Bureau to carry out the "joint joint Law enforcement "action. Earlier, other Chinese media and other Chinese media have also widely reported this incident.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Chinese law enforcement agencies have raided the Beijing Office and Bain &amp; Company Shanghai Office, Mintz Group, in the United States. A Japanese Pharmaceutical Company An Stellas Pharma was arrested by a Japanese employee who was charged with "engaging in spy activities".</p>
<p>The US Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the interests of many large companies in the United States issued a statement on April 28 saying that "the official review of the official service and due diligence company in China is closely paying attention to the official review of American professional services and due diligence." The land increases the uncertainty and risk of doing business in China.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to China Burns also pointed out last week that the United States was very concerned about the "punishment actions" adopted by the Chinese companies in China and the Beijing authorities recently, and expressed their concerns of the United States.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T11-08-00-04-00/000000.png" />The General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping was re -elected in the 20th National Congress <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-05092023110713.html/@@images/image"></a>Associated Press picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-05092023110713.html/@@stream"></a>In May 4th of this year, the Chinese Youth Festival set up by the Communist Party of China, and the party media issued Xi Jinping's two replies, one returned to the school students who returned to the school to agricultural University, and encouraged them to "deeply penetrate the fields and village farmers." "Classroom learning and rural practice Combining closely, we have to love farmers and feelings, and you can practice the agricultural ability, and build your career on the big stage of rural rejuvenation. " The other is the letter of replied to the "Wang Jie Ban" soldier of the PLA "Wang Jie Ban" in 2019, emphasizing: "Implement the thinking of the strong army, practice hardships, and strive to be a good warrior in the new era. Fighting and preparing to sacrifice.</p>
<p>The younger generation in China, or the fate of the post -00s, seems to be "big -handed" by Xi Jinping, or go to the countryside, or go to the battlefield. It is no stranger to the Chinese, but it is Mao Zedong's "going up the mountains and going to the countryside" and "ready to fight". It is said that the Xi era is the Cultural Revolution of version 2.0 and the Mao era of version 2.0. This time it proves that these claims are not false.</p>
<p>In fact, in addition to going up the mountain and going to the countryside and preparing to fight, the party leads all the party's leadership, political commander, personal worship, learning a certain idea, class struggle, provoking the masses of the masses, proclaiming the culture, anti -American anti -West, retreating country, planning economy, party management economy, party management economy , Guojin and the people retreat, retire from forests to farm, use food as the outline, and cozy ... What is the product of the Cultural Revolution and the product of the Mao era?</p>
<p>Throughout the countries around the world, history often shows the clock effect. In normal countries such as democratic countries, the effect of this clock is reflected in the rotation of political parties, such as the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan. In the autocratic country, this clock effect is reflected in the cycle of enlightened dictatorship and dark autocracy, such as Mingjun and tyrant in the dynasties.</p>
<p>Communist China, this clock effect still exists. In October 1976, Huairentang's coup, Hua Guofeng arrested the "Gang of Four" headed by Jiang Qing, laid the foundation for a era of reform and opening up. This is an important round for the enlightened faction to defeat the stubborn faction. The subsequent Deng era was a subversion to the Mao era.</p>
<p>Forty -six years later, in October 2022, the Communist Party of China was 20th. Xi Jinping obtained over -term re -election by struggle with his national power and crowded out all the groups. It is amazing that it is still a coup. It's just that this coup is relatively invisible and is a flexible coup. Hu Jintao, the ancestor of the group and the former supreme leader, was forcibly separated from the scene, which was the proof of the coup. This round, the enlightened faction failed and stubbornly wins. Xi Wang and others returned to the Cultural Revolution and Mao era in this rude way, which was a subversion of reform and opening up. Its historical significance was to report an arrow for Jiang Qing, the Gang of Four, and the Gang of the Party.</p>
<p>In modern and contemporary history, after getting rid of autocracy and establishing democracy, most countries can stabilize under the framework of constitutional government, but several countries present the tragedy of the beginning of democracy and the autocratic restoration. During the period of fragility and instability. Even the repeated contests and reincarnation of democratic progress and autocratic restoration. The most typical is modern France. In the 150s, five republics have been established. The fifth Republic of France established after the end of World War II was finally settled and became a stable democracy and constitutional country.</p>
<p>In contemporary, Myanmar and Egypt have achieved democratization, but they were later overthrown and restored military dictatorships by the military coup. Russia had already realized democracy, but when KGB's Putin came to power, due to the power of love stacks, the long -term governance and life governance, it also substantially restored the autocracy and let Russia go backwards.</p>
<p>Looking back at China, reform and opening up were carried out in the framework of one -party dictatorship. Therefore, before going to democracy, another pendulum effect occurred: from enlightened autocracy to dark autocracy, and returned from reform and opening up to the Cultural Revolution. It is understood that the pendulum effect of history is not necessary to make a lot of fuss about Xi Wang's path and open history.</p>
<p>This is a current!History is much better. Xi Wang and others returned to the Cultural Revolution and restored the era of Mao, but they could not be separated from their ancestors. It moves against the trend of the times, which is the reaction. It is both a countercurrent, that is, a temporary phenomenon, and it is impossible to last long. For years, or decades, they are temporary in history.</p>
<p>Xi Pai claims: "Two Establishment of Establishment" (establishing the core of Xi and Xi) is the "biggest certainty" (Chinese politics). In fact, as long as those who have a little political science and historical common sense know that this is the greatest uncertainty. Rejecting to the rule of law and superstitious governance, one -party dictatorship superimposed one -person dictatorship is far from inevitability and floating in the accident, that is, the loss of uncertainty to losing certainty. History has repeatedly proved that this is the way to defeat. If Wang Wang does not change the string, it is not far away.</p>

Lindona originally scheduled that the talks held by China Treasury Secretary Liu Kun on Wednesday were also allowed to make soups. According to sources from the German Ministry of Finance, the Chinese side arranged a conflict on a schedule and demanded that the Sino -German Finance Secretary of the Sino -German Finance Secretary scheduled to be held on May 10th was required.</p>
<p>During Lindner's visit to China, it was planned to prepare for the German -Chinese government consultation and high -level fiscal dialogue with the upcoming German -China government in the future. Linden also plans to go to Japan to participate in the Western Group Finance Minister Conference after visiting China. China said that the German Treasury Secretary can go to China when he ended the Japanese itinerary. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国财长访华为何被取消/a-65553450"></a></p>
<h3>Human rights or Taiwan issues have caused China to postpone the schedule?</h3>
<p>The problem now is that Lindner's temporary cancellation of the visit by China this time is related to the policy of China and its Liberal Democratic Party? In March of this year, Bettinastark-Watzinger, a Liberal Democratic Party politician and German Education Minister, visited Taiwan, causing strong dissatisfaction in China. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访德国自民党主席应增加对北京施压/a-54096559"></a>After the trip to China was temporarily canceled, Lindona emphasized the necessity of re -balanced relations with China. Lindona said to the news website "Thepioneer": "It should be dealt with China in a self -confidence and pragmatic way, not as cautious as the previous government." He said that only paying attention to economic relations, he will lose some civilized mission. "Compared with the stance over the past, we need to get more balanced now."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-09T11-18-00Z/65310418_401.jpg" />In April this year, the Dedicated and Foreign Minister attended the press conference.</p>
<h3>government consultation is not affected</h3>
<p>The German -China government consultation will be held on June 20. The German government also regularly hold government -level consultations with some close allies or important strategic countries, such as France, Japan, India, Brazil, and Israel. In order to prepare for government consultations, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang suddenly announced that he would visit Berlin.</p>
<p>In April of this year, when German Foreign Minister Belbak visited Beijing first, he expressed concern about the upgrading of the Taiwan Strait and the status of Chinese human rights. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang responded with "refusing to preach".</p>

Among them, China exported US $ 33.686 billion in Russia, an increase of 67.2%; China imported 39.462 billion US dollars from Russia, an increase of 24.8%.</p>
<p>** Russia's battle has been sanctioned by Western sanctions in China.</p>
<p>Nobel, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was embarked down and sanctioned by Western countries. Many things in Russia wanted to buy with China. China became the biggest beneficiary. "White gloves".</p>
<p>The China Customs General Administration also pointed out that China import and export 461 trillion yuan in imports and exports to countries along the “Belt and Road”, an increase of 16%year -on -year. Among them, the five Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, and the import and export of Western Asia and North Africa countries such as Saudi Arabia increased by 37.4%and 9.6%, respectively.</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu pointed out that how much the number of numbers released in China cannot be confirmed. Many countries have not announced data in March and April. If the authenticity is to be proved, it is correct to compare it.</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said that the significant increase in the amount of imports and exports in China and Russia was the reason for the increase in the number of "Belt and Road" countries. The data released by China are particularly highlighting the improvement of import and export trade with countries along the “Belt and Road”, which has the purpose of propaganda.</p>
<p><strong> China emphasizes that the import and export of import and export of the “Belt and Road” countries: Publicity role </strong></p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said: "It mainly expresses it. Although Western countries, the United States, Japan, and South Korea sanction high -tech and embargo have little impact on China, because China has in the 'Belt and Road' and other countries such as Asia, Africa Europe, and other countries. The amount of import and export is also very large. It does not need to rely on the United States, Japan, and Europe to maintain its ability to import and export. (Chinese data) is mainly used for publicity, which is very obvious. "</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu mentioned that for more than a year after the Russian and Ukraine War, Russia announced that the national GDP has not fallen too much, indicating that Western sanctions are invalid, and it is normal to decline during the epidemic. Some people want to replace those countries that were originally imported and exported to Russia, then China is of course equal to replacing their roles. Therefore, there are many imports and exports to Russia and Eurasia. Volkswagen products, consumption luxury goods, high -tech industries, etc.</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said that the rebound after the unblocking of China was not surprising. With the development of the Russian and Ukraine War, what would change and whether it could continue to grow is the focus of observation. As for the decline caused by decoupling, it is foreseeable whether China wants to work hard for a few years.</p>
<p>According to Chinese customs data, China ’s imports and exports to ASEAN were 2.09 trillion yuan, an increase of 13.9%year -on -year, accounting for 15.7%of China's total foreign trade. In the first four months of China, exports to the United States fell 14.3%year -on -year and imports fell 2%. According to data, Reuters has a trade surplus of US $ 98.58 billion in the first four months of the United States.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T11-22-00-04-00/000001.png" />Shandong Gangkou Qingdao Gangqianwan Container Terminal (Reuters) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hx2-05092023071241.html/image.jpeg"></a>Shi Jianyu said: "High -tech imports have declined in recent months, which is the result of the United States' policy on China -high -tech departure policies. China cannot buy high -tech products and raw materials such as chips and materials. Amount. "</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: The increase in China's export is the order of the rushing outbound epidemic control order </strong></p>
<p>Taiwan's Cross -Strait Policy Association researcher Wu Sezhi was interviewed and analyzed by Radio Free Asia. China's exports this year will inevitably grow much compared to last year, mainly because of the seal control measures in the past two years, which has caused many factories to stop production and stop work. Many Chinese companies are completing and digesting for international orders in the past.</p>
<p>Wu Si Zhi said: "On the other hand, many foreign companies look at the changes in the Chinese market, and the export of related production machines and funds from China will also drive China's export growth. By the end of the year and next year, whether the growth trend of this export can be maintained, it can be maintained, and it can be maintained. As a whole, whether the foreign trade relations can restore the past stable growth trend in the past. "</p>
<p><strong> The United States prohibits exports of key components in China, Taiwan's import and export to China will also decline </strong></p>
<p>Wu Sizhi mentioned that the demand for processing and industrial upgrading will drive the connection of import and export. Many key components and machine tools in China need to be imported from foreign countries. In the past two or three years, the United States has continuously blocked China on technology and has prohibited from exporting to China in the semiconductor industry, especially high -end chips. Technical restrictions, and many countries such as the United States, have doubts about Chinese stealing technical stealing in China, leading to a decline in China's imports.</p>
<p>For example, Wu Si Zhi: "It is obviously visible from the cross -strait economic and trade relations. In the first quarter of this year, the amount of imports from Taiwan to China has declined, and the decline is as high as two digits, which means that the economic and trade structure of cross -strait trade has changed."Wu Sizhi emphasized that the internal economic development of Chinese countries has not moved in the direction of industrial upgrading or is limited to a certain degree, and the demand for imports will decline. Furthermore, many foreign companies have lost confidence in China's operating market, and the external movement of foreign companies will also affect the overall needs of China's import.</p>

<p>"A unit of the Ministry of National Defense's next unit escaped from our side wing position today ... exposed the front in the danger."</p>
<p>Porigjin has threatened that if he failed to obtain the urgent needed ammunition, the Wagner soldiers responsible for the first array will withdraw from Bakhmut on May 10.</p>
<p>Porigjin also said that the soldiers escaped because of the Russian military commanders very "stupid" and issued a "criminal order". "The soldiers should not be sacrificed by the absolute stupidity of the leadership."</p>
<p>At the time of Porigin's release of the above film, Russia's "Victory Day", that is, Moscow celebrated the days when the Soviet Union won the Nazi Germany in World War II.</p>
<p>Porigjin launched an unprecedented bombardment against the Russian army, accusing Moscow's high -level generals in an attempt to "deceive" President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine.</p>
<p>He said that if all tasks are performed by deceiving the chief commander Pu Ting, then the Russian people who are dissatisfied with the losses will eventually punish these people.</p>
<p>While the Ukraine was about to launch a spring counterattack, Pritjin, 61, also questioned the ability of Ke Palace to defend the country today, and said that Ukraine "successfully" attacked the Russian border area. He criticized in the film: "Why is this government's ability to defend the country?"</p>
<p>While Porigzin announced the film, Moscow was holding a grand military parade in Red Square and was broadcast across the country through TV.</p>
<p>Porigjin is counterproductive, the offensive in Ukraine's preparation is "on the ground rather than on TV", "so far in my country, everyone thinks that everything must be done on TV."</p>
<p>The Russian media reported the Russian army's attacks almost all over the weather, and would also beautify the performance of the Russian army from a absolute perspective.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Despite the lifting measures of zero -zero epidemic prevention, China's imports have shrunk sharply in April, and the growth rate of exports slows down, which exacerbates signs of weak domestic demand. In the case of global economic growth, the Chinese economy, which has been struggling, has endured increasing pressure.</p>
<p>Due to strong service consumption, China's economic growth in the first quarter was better than expected. However, the factory output is lagging, and the latest trade data shows that it takes time to restore the level before the restoration of the epidemic.</p>
<p>The customs data released on Tuesday (May 9) shows that after the decline in March 1.4%, China's second largest economy in April in China decreased by 7.9%year -on -year, and exports increased by 8.5%, lower than 3, less than 3 14.8% of the month.</p>
<p>Economists interviewed by Reuters have previously estimated that China's imports will not grow, and exports will increase by 8.0%.</p>
<p>Xu Tianchen, an economic analyst of the Economist Think Tank (EIU), said: "Earlier this year, people will assume that re -opening will be easily imported by more than 2022, but this is not the case."</p>
<p>He said: "Although China's rebound after the epidemic is rapid and fierce, it is basically self -sufficient, and the rest of the world has not felt it."</p>
<p>With the increasing economic recession of many major trading partners, Chinese government officials have repeatedly warned that the external environment is "severe" and "complex".</p>
<p>Last month, the sharp deterioration of trade flows once again triggered concerns about external demand and risks of the domestic economy, especially considering that it did not have a strong recovery from the recession of the same period last year. At that time, China's zero -epidemic prevention measures severely disrupted in and out of the country.</p>
<p>Huang Zichun, an analyst of Kaitou macro, pointed out in a report: "In view of the bleak outlook for external demand, we believe that exports will further decline before the bottom of this year."</p>
<p>Although the stock market is also affected by other global factors, the data released on Tuesday seem to be "contributed" to the decline of Hong Kong and mainland China. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index fell 1.11%earlier in the afternoon, while the Chinese Blue Chip CSI 300 Index rose 0.5%before lunch break 0.26%.</p>
<h3>How does the German industry rely on China?</h3>
<p><strong> The impact of China's import decline on the global economy </strong></p>
<p>The decline in imports indicates that the world economy will not be able to count on China's domestic growth, and as China has transferred some imported goods to export, the weakness of some major trading partners has intensified.</p>
<p>China's semiconductor imports fell by 15.3%, indicating that the demand for the re -export market of such components has fallen sharply.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the rapid tightening of global monetary policy in the past 12 to 18 months and the pressure on the recent Western banking industry have also been shadowed on the prospects of recovery in China and the world.</p>
<p>Data in April showed that China's shipments in ASEAN slowed down from 35.4% last month to 4.5%. The region is China's largest export partner.</p>
<p>Other recent data also shows that the exports of South Korea, as the leading indicators of China's imports, declined for 10 consecutive months, and fell by 26.5%in April.</p>
<p>China ’s coal imports in April fell from a high level of 15 months. The imports of copper and natural gas as the global growth indicators have also declined during the same period.</p>
<p>Recently announced in April of China ’s official manufacturing purchase manager index, showing that the new export orders have shrunk sharply, highlighting the challenges faced by Chinese decision makers and companies that expect the epidemic to achieve a strong economic recovery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國上季gdp加速成長-達一年來最高/a-65354900"></a>However, due to the weak real estate market, slowing prices, and survival of bank savings, people also doubt their demand prospects.</p>
<p>After the goal of 2022 is far, the Chinese government has strengthened a series of policy support measures. This year's GDP growth target is set at about 5%.</p>
<p>"The global economy is deteriorating, and this will weaken China's manufacturing industry."(Iris pang)Said, "A response, the government is more likely to intervene in the labor market that supports the manufacturing industry through financial stimulus measures."</p>

<p>北京被控利用这2人进行「人质外交」，以迫使渥太华释放孟晚舟。</p>
<p>在与美国检方达成协议后，孟晚舟于2021年9月获准返回中国。</p>
<p>上述协议宣布数小时后，被拘留了1000多天的康明凯和史佩弗被也被送上回家的飞机。</p>
<p>2022年12月，美国司法部撤销对孟晚舟的所有指控。</p>
<p>●维吾尔人种族灭绝指控</p>
<p>针对中国涉嫌侵犯人权的行为，加国的批评越来越直言不讳，这也导致两国关系持续恶化。</p>
<p>2021年2月，加拿大国会议员以压倒性票数支持谴责北京对待新疆维吾尔人之举构成「种族灭绝」的动议。</p>
<p>由于加国保守党国会议员庄文浩(Michael Chong)领头发起上述动议，据称中国情报机构计划制裁他和他在香港的亲戚。</p>
<p>今年2月，加拿大国会又一致通过一项不具约束力的提案，以接纳1万名逃离中国、但如今面临遣返压力的维族难民。</p>
<p>●科技战</p>
<p>两国也在科技领域贸易上针锋相对，加国采取行动，限制中国公司进入其通讯基础设施相关产业。</p>
<p>去年5月，渥太华表示，基于对国家安全的担忧，将禁止华为参与加国的5G网路建设，中国电信公司中兴通讯(ZTE)也被纳入黑名单。</p>
<p>北京则批评，上述限制是「以毫无根据的安全风险为理由，没有任何确凿证据」。</p>
<p>今年2月，加国效仿美国和欧盟执行委员会(European Commission)，禁止在所有政府设备上使用中国影片分享应用程式TikTok。</p>
<p>●习近平公开训斥杜鲁道</p>
<p>去年11月，在印尼�Q里岛的20国集团(G20)峰会上，双方的敌意再度充分展示。</p>
<p>当时中国国家主席习近平在镜头前训斥加国总理杜鲁道(JustinTrudeau)，对杜鲁道将两人稍早前的私下谈话内容向加国媒体透露表达不满，指此举「不合适」。</p>
<p>杜鲁道虽以「加拿大信奉自由、公开和坦诚的对话」回应，但习近平却面露不耐，并强调要「创造条件」，随即离去。</p>
<p>不久后，这段画面迅速在推特(Twitter)上流传，并被全球各大媒体广为报导。</p>
<p>此前，杜鲁道向习近平提出中国「干涉」加国公民行为以及北京涉嫌干预加国民主和司法事务的问题。 ●北京遭控干预加国选举</p>
<p>今年3月，杜鲁道任命前总督强斯敦(David Johnston)出任特别调查员，以调查中国涉嫌干预近两次联邦选举的指控；北京则否认上述指控。</p>
<p>加国「环球邮报」(Globe and Mail)2月援引消息人士说法报导，中国努力击败被认为对北京不友善的保守派政客。</p>
<p>该报后来还称，渥太华对中国干涉加国事务之举视而不见。</p>
<p>该报援引机密文件和一位匿名安全消息人士说法称，中国情报部门计划以庄文浩议员和他在香港的家人为目标，以达到「杀鸡儆猴」的效果。</p>
<p>昨天，因中国领事官员赵巍参与威胁庄文浩及其亲人，加国宣布驱逐赵巍。中方今天决定采取对等反制措施，将加拿大驻上海总领馆领事甄逸慧列为「不受欢迎的人」，并要求其5月13日前离境。</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T14-07-00-04-00/000000.png" />Xinjiang is a heavy place in cotton in cotton in China, and snow -white cotton flocculent human rights exploitation and environmental harm. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-05092023140456.html/@@images/image"></a>Associated Press Picture</p>
<p>The International Academic Journal "Research on Communism and Post -Communism" published on May 9 the senior researcher and Chinese research director Zheng Guoen, a senior researcher and Chinese research director of the United States. <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/B92UYJ"></a>Among them, the important new evidence and status quo of the forced labor policy of Xinjiang's cotton industry in detail, and proved why the European government governments need to adopt American -style imports to ensure compliance with international labor norms. The report also created a new indicator framework to solve the serious defects in the forced labor indicators of international labor organizations because it is not enough to reflect the forced labor situation supported by the state supported by Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The report is titled "The Comparison Analysis of the Comparison of Comparison Labor in the Harbor of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Uzbekistan cotton.</p>
<p>The report found that despite the promotion of mechanized operations, Xinjiang Uighurs were sent to pick cotton in 2021 and 2022, and they were sent to pick cotton through coercive labor transfer employment. This seasonal labor transfer was still the five -year plan of Xinjiang from 2021 to 2025 to 2025 Part of the part. The high -quality long cotton cotton produced in the southern region of the Uighur has still been unable to harvest with machines.</p>
<p>The new country's internal documents show that Xinjiang's labor transfer employment has become particularly stressful since 2019. Those who "internal (work) insufficient power" are repeatedly "ideological education". Local instructions also showed that even elderly people over 60 were sent to pick cotton. All localities have prepared a list of "lazy people" identified by the government as inadequate power, and some of them are as high as 77 years old. Some of them are also sent to pick cotton.</p>
<p>Xinjiang now produces 90%of China's cotton, exceeding 85%of 2020. This expansion is usually achieved through large -scale land transfer arrangements. Uighurs and other ethnic minority farmers have exchanged land use rights to large private or state -led entities (these farmers subsequently accepted the labor transfer of labor arranged by the state). This shows that even in a mechanized harvest, cotton production is achieved by exploiting the rights of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that although the labor camp system was abolished in 2013, the prison farm in Xinjiang is still operating a cotton mill.</p>
<p>The report found that the state -supported forced labor operated through five key aspects. Based on these findings, the report created the first indicator framework for compulsory labor supported by the country's support on the basis of the six -stage model of forced labor. The framework compares the country's support for comparison with the country's relevant international labor organization indicators at each stage, pointing out that international labor organization indicators have failed to capture the key dimensions of the country's support for compulsory labor.</p>

The Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with his lips, saying that China does not need to come from "Western Teachers". Within a month, the Chinese foreign minister came to Berlin. The comments entitled "Qin Gang's visit" Teacher "" wrote:</p>
<p>"In mid -April this year, although Dedica and Foreign Minister had a fierce tongue in front of the camera, this at least did not affect China's chief diplomat to visit the" female teacher 'in Berlin. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国外长秦刚本周出访德法挪三国/a-65549318"></a>German Foreign Ministry spokesman Christoferburger emphasized: 'Germany and Europe have great interest in any steps and measures that benefit from ending the war of aggression. '</p>
<p>For a period of time, although Beijing is trying to play the role of a mediation person and a peaceful messenger, it is difficult to hide their close relationships with Russia. Although Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping had a phone call for the first time with the Ukrainian President Zelei, he was obviously more willing to stand on the side of Russian Putin. Like Moscow, Xi Jinping also believes that NATO and the United States are responsible for the war against the war.</p>
<p>The European Union is currently considering sanctions on Chinese companies that export to Russia that can be used for military destinations, while Beijing has strong condemnation.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the government's statement of German Chancellor Salz made a clear appeal to Chinese leaders: 'My message to Beijing is very clear: giving play to your influence and urging Russia to withdraw troops as soon as possible. Don't provide arms to Russian invaders. 'Beijing has influence on Moscow, which is beyond doubt. But as for whether Beijing will use Germany and Europe, it is unknown to exert their influence. "</p>
<p>"Daily News" comments pointed out that how to deal with China is a controversial topic whether it is within the European Union or the German ruling alliance. Not long ago, the conservative forces in the Social Democratic Party have accused Belbak and Habeck's "anti -China policy".</p>
<p>"But on the" risk "issue, that is, reducing dependence on autocratic countries in terms of sensitive infrastructure, all parties seem to have a consensus. After all, Belbak has repeatedly emphasized that it must not be repeated on the issue of China. mistake.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-09T14-17-00Z/65561331_401.jpg" />On May 9, Foreign Minister of Germany and China held a press conference in Berlin.</p>
<p>However, how to deal with China at the practical level, the differences within the ruling alliance are obvious. When China emphasizes that China is an institutional opponent ', it often forgets China's' partner' identity. It was time for a long time when the "China Strategy 'was introduced. "</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Report commented that Beijing did not have time to take over the German Treasury Secretary, but had time to send foreign ministers to visit Germany. Germany must be sued Beijing not to play with the governing alliance. The comments entitled "Beijing's Diplomacy" wrote:</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国财长遭遇中国闭门羹/a-65560282"></a>It is the obligation of German Foreign Minister Berbak to accuse this provocative behavior in person.</p>
<p>Not long ago, when a talk with Chinese politicians in Beijing, Belbak showed her courage to dare to speak for righteousness. Now she should clearly tell the Chinese side that even if there are differences within the federal government, they will never tolerate external provocation and separation.</p>
<p>Lindner's visit to China was suddenly canceled, and of course, it should not be a reason for the major crisis in Germany and China. However, Germany must send such a signal that Germany is a sovereign state with self -decision -making power, and even if it involves Taiwan issues, it is no exception. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-09T14-32-11-00-00/000000.png" />Volodymyr ZELENSKYY today said a press conference with the European Union President Ursula Von Derleyen, "All restrictions on my country's export products are completely unacceptable. They will only strengthen them. The abilities of the invaders. "</p>
<p>Zerrenceky described the measures sacrificed during the war "serious or even cruel" and "disappointing", "we are waiting for the European Union to end all restrictions as soon as possible."</p>
<p>EU member states such as Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, etc. have argued with Ukraine due to grain problems.</p>
<p>Russia's full invasion of Ukraine last year caused Ukraine to force Ukraine to export through land neighbors through the traditional pipeline export of Black SEA.</p>
<p>EU member states agreed to allow unlimited imports of unlimited imports of Ukraine products without being inspected by customs and official inspections. However, after the price of crops plummeted, farmers in some EU countries protested, prompting Ukraine's grain exports to face a series of restrictions and ban.</p>
<p>The European authorities described that when Kiev fought with Russia, the imports of imports of Ukraine and other foods were prohibited. This approach was "unacceptable."</p>
<p>The European Executive Committee reached a consensus with the relevant parties last month to ensure that Ukraine grains can transit the EU countries when they are limited.</p>
<p>Van Dan Dyen's description of grain problems today is "difficult" to describe the problem of grain.</p>
<p>She said that the priority is to seamlessly proceed the transit of the grain. "This requires different interests to cooperate very closely. Therefore, we will join forces to set up a coordination platform."</p>
<p>Zeroski also emphasized at a press conference that the EU is needed to accelerate the delivery of shells. He said: "We discussed an important issue: the speed of purchasing and delivery of these ammunition.</p>
<p>Zeroski also mentioned that the European Union should decide to formally start the negotiations of Ukraine to join the European Union. Ukraine has officially won the status of the EU candidate last year.</p>
<p>He said at a press conference: "It's time to eliminate human uncertainty in the relationship between Ukraine's relations with the European Union, and make positive decisions, and start consulting Ukraine to join the European Union."</p>

For the first time in the United Kingdom, the Minister of State, who was responsible for commerce for the first time to visit Hong Kong. British officials stated that they wanted to do business with Hong Kong, while stating that they would not ignore human rights issues. Behind the "talk about business and draw red lines", what kind of realistic dilemma is the British government facing?</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-05022023142743.html"></a> </em>*  * </strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/7-02282023162154.html"> </a>**</p>
<hr />
<p>Within two days of visiting Hong Kong, Dominicjohnson (Dominicjohnson (also translated Zhuang Dunwen), the Minister of Commerce and Trade State, continued to "brush the itinerary" on Twitter, and posted that he visited the Hong Kong Science and Technology Enterprise Base Digital Port, and Hong Kong. Li Zeju, the son of the richest man Li Ka -shing, talked about investment, as well as a photo with Xu Zhengyu, the director of the Hong Kong Finance and Economic Affairs and the Director of the Treasury Bureau.</p>
<p><strong> In the past five years, the first British officials visited Hong Kong </strong> <strong><em>* </em>* Luo Guancong: It is equivalent to agreeing with the CCP's atrocities </strong></p>
<p>The last time a British Minister of State visited Hong Kong, it was 2018. During these five years, Beijing Iron Holders suppressed Hong Kong to counter the Sino -Sports and pushed the "National Security Law of the Hong Kong District", which was severely torn by the British government to tear the "Sino -British Joint Statement", which further deteriorated British Hong Kong and British -China relations.</p>
<p>Regarding Johnson's visit, Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao said that officials from any country came to Hong Kong, but he also intended to add some measures to make some measures to meet the "own political interests" and urge all parties to urge all parties Seek truth from facts to make the economic and people's exchanges in the two places.</p>
<p>When Rogers, the founder of the Human Rights Organization of London, was interviewed by the "Hong Kong Supervision", and criticized this was not a good time for British officials to visit Hong Kong: "I think this visit, especially the timing of the visit is a wrong judgment and misfortune. When the Beijing regime completely destroys and tears the "Sino -British Joint Statement" and destroys the freedom of Hong Kong, I think this is not a good time for the Minister of State of Hong Kong to visit the Minister of State and promote trade. "</p>
<p>Former Hong Kong Legislative Council member Luo Guancong, a former Hong Kong Legislative Council, also criticized the British government to refuse to speak for the imprisoned British citizen Li Zhiying, but sent officials to seek cooperation with the Hong Kong Government to criticize Johnson's visit, which is equivalent to agreed with the CCP's atrocities.</p>
<p><strong> The predicament of the British government </strong></p>
<p>Johnson published a comment article on the South China Morning Post on Tuesday (9th), indicating that Britain wanted to do business with Hong Kong, and reiterated that the British government had set a one -time policy of China. "Steady and constructive" contact. However, he also emphasized that when Beijing violated its international commitment or infringement of human rights, Britain will adhere to value and clearly take action.</p>
<p>Johnson's argument implemented a speech on China by British Foreign Minister JamesCleverly, emphasizing that Britain should have a "stable and constructive" contact with China, but at the same time facing China's authoritarianism.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T14-46-00-04-00/000001.png" />Dominic Johnson (also translated Zhuang Dunwen) to visit the Hong Kong Science and Technology Enterprise Base Digital Port.(Johnson Twitter Screenshot)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/al-05092023123343.html/fvna-9mwwampab.jpg"></a>From the perspective of Huang Weiguo, a Hong Kong international relations scholar who moved to the UK, the British government is eager to "talk about business and draw red lines". Actually, look at the number of foreign trade in the UK, China is still an important partner of Britain's foreign trade. With the economic and global influence of the United States, he has the ability to decompose with China and even form a opposition between the new cold war period with China, but It seems that Britain does not have this courage, conditions or ability to do it. "</p>
<p>He enumerated the example, the huge amount of funds brought by Chinese students alone have become an important source of income from British universities. The Britain has not yet closed the Confucius Institute in the country. Even local governments in cities such as Nottingham have rejected the call of Hong Kong people and cut off the relationship between sister cities in Chinese cities. You can only continue to follow the discipline.</p>
<p>However, Huang Weiguo added that even if the United Kingdom still wants to continue economic and trade relations with Hong Kong and China, it is impossible for Britain and China to return to the "Golden Age". It is impossible for the United Kingdom to intervene in its cutting -edge science and technology field, or to acquire the key to the British National Security. enterprise.</p>
<p><strong> Human Rights Organization: Do not oppose dialogue with China </strong> <strong>** </strong> What is the key to talk about?</p>
<p>Rogers welcomes Johnson's "red line" for British -China cooperation. He confirmed that he never opposed contact with China. He also agreed that Britain should talk to China. The question is how to contact? What should I talk to China?</p>
<p>He believes that Johnson, as a business official, should express his attention to businessmen Li Zhiying, not simply talking about business with businessmen Li Zhiying. However, the recent measures of the British government will only make the outside world think that the United Kingdom is too weak, not only failing to maintain the same consistent with allies in the United States, but even more backward than Canada, which dares to expel Chinese diplomats, and the European Union planned to sanction Chinese companies.</p>

<p>An important background of the mutual visits of British and Hong Kong officials is that Han Zheng, vice chairman of China, was invited to attend the crown ceremony of King Charles III in the UK. Chinese President Xi Jinping also issued a congratulatory message saying that China is willing to work with the British side, "enhance people's friendship, expand mutual benefit cooperation", and establish a stable and reciprocal Sino -British relations.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Rio de Janeiro, 8th) Ben Gortzel, authoritative artificial intelligence (AI), said artificial intelligence may replace 80%of human work in the next few years, but he thinks this is not a bad thing.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-09T15-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />Agence France -Presse reported that Gezer, who was 56 years old and was born in Brazil, is a mathematician, cognitive scientist, and a well -known robot creator. He is currently the founder and CEO of SingularityNet. Its team specializes in the artificial wisdom with human cognitive ability.</p>
<p>He was interviewed by Agence France -Presse at the world's largest annual science and technology conference and Rio de Janeiro last week, Rio de Janeiro. Gezer, who has long hair and wearing a leopard denim hat, told AFP that he expected that AGI would come out in a few years, and he also opposed his recent expression of the sound of artificial intelligence research.</p>
<p>When asked how far from AGI, Gatele answered, if we want the machine to be as smart as humans, and when facing the same flexibility when facing unknown conditions, we must make significant Leap forward.</p>
<p>"We haven't achieved this goal yet, but I think there is reason to believe that we have only a few years left for this goal, instead of decades."</p>
<p>As for the controversy and risks caused by artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT, Gatele does not think that related research should be suspended for this. "These AI systems are very interesting, but they do not have the ability of AGI like humans. Period reasoning, it is impossible to create new things beyond the scope of learning materials. "</p>
<p>Gatele said, "People are advised to suspend the development of AI because they may spread the error message. I think this statement is very strange." If this logic is based on this logic, "Why can't it be prohibited from the Internet? On the one hand, it provides huge amounts of information, on the other hand, spread nonsense and error messages. "</p>
<p>Gatele emphasized, "I think we should have a free society. Just like the Internet should not be prohibited, we should not prohibit AI."</p>
<p>In response to AI's threat to replace human work, Gatele said, "According to my speculation, about 80 % of human work will be replaced without AGI." He mentioned that he did not refer to products like ChatGPT. Instead, it refers to a similar system that will appear in the next few years.</p>
<p>Gatele pointed out, "I don't think this will pose a threat, but this is a good thing. In addition to working for a living, people can find more meaningful things to do." He also believes that almost all documents should be automated.</p>
<p>According to Gezerel, the transition period is a problem, and he does not know how to solve all social problems when AI is eliminated one after another.</p>
<p>Regarding the contribution of robots to today's society, Gatele took the robotic nurse Grace (Grace), who had just appeared at the Rio Summit as an example. In the environment of medical care, food and big screen TV, their health is not bad, but they lack emotional and social support. "</p>
<p>He said that if the robot is introduced into these institutions, the robot will be able to answer questions, listen to stories, assist the elderly and children to call, or shop online. This can improve people's lives. "After progressing to AGI, they will be better partners. ","</p>
<p>"In this way, the job shortage of human work will not be replaced, because there are basically no enough people to engage in nursing -related work." He believes that robots have a market in education and housekeeping services.</p>
<p>As for what specifications are required, to ensure a positive impact of AI. Gatele pointed out that "the society needs to develop the positive use of AI, and related management also requires people to participate." He believes that the main problem is that companies funding AI research do not care if they want " "Doing good", they only care about how to maximize the value of shareholders.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T15-05-00-04-00/000000.png" />On March 21, 2023, in a newspaper stall in Beijing, the newspaper published Xi Jinping's meeting with Putin as the front page. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05092023120047.html/@@images/image"></a>Agencence France -Presse <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05092023120047.html/@@stream"></a>After the epidemic, China strived to restore economic revitalization of international influence. However, the outside world noticed that a series of diplomatic and internal affairs measures in Beijing caused alert to various countries. Some scholars have pointed out that Xi Jinping's national strategy is "security overwhelming everything", which has seriously affected the improvement of China's diplomatic image and economic recovery.</p>

This may damage China's efforts to re -contact with the world after the control of the epidemic, thereby transforming into a "new era" that isolated from the international community. Essence</p>
<p>The outside world has noticed that in recent months, Beijing has adopted a series of seemingly contradictory diplomatic and business measures, including trying to mediate the Russian and Ukraine War, but close to Russia; invite multiple national politics to visit Beijing, but upgrade the tension of the Taiwan Strait; Foreign capital has expanded the scope of the "Anti -Spy Law" while strengthening information review.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T15-05-00-04-00/000001.png" />On March 21, 2023, Putin and Xi Jinping ended Russia -China talks in Moscow. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05092023120047.html/2023-03-21t194822z_165383605_rc2jyz9krr40_rtrmadp_3_china-russia-diplomacy-xi-putin.jpg"></a>Wang Juntao, a Chinese political scholar in the United States, told this station that since Xi Jinping came to power, all his measures are against the world trend. If you do not adhere to "safely overwhelming everything", or even sacrificing diplomatic and economy as a price, Xi Jinping's dominance will be able Posted by: "When Xi Jinping must protect his dictatorship, it is necessary to overwhelm security rules. If this normal communication is allowed, it is really difficult to maintain his dictatorship, and his governance status will be threatened. Because (China) Without a sound legitimate rights and interests of the rule of law to protect citizens, the security department abuses its own power to do something. "</p>
<p>Wang Juntao also pointed out that although countries around the world have their own national security strategies, the biggest problem in China is the concept of generalization of "security", which qualitatively affects normal communication behaviors to threaten national security and abuse law enforcement power.</p>
<p>At the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year, Xi Jinping, who successfully obtained the "three re -election" of the President of the State, publicly emphasized that it is necessary to unswervingly implement the overall national security outlook and the entire process of maintaining the national security throughout the party and the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, with the scope of the Chinese legislature expanding the anti -spy law, the optimism of the outside world's political pattern and economic prospects has gradually declined. Analysts told Reuters that China's diplomatic efforts to mediate the Russia -Ukraine War were for the purpose of competing with the United States. Researcher CharlesPatton, a researcher at the British Think Tank Geopoly Strategy Committee, even more straightforwardly pointed out: "Beijing does not care whether its mediation works ... importantly, this is an opportunity to describe the United States negatively."</p>
<p>Michaelbutler, a political scholar at Clarks University, also believes that China tries to test the Ukraine's determination to test the United States in Taiwan through the Ukrainian issue: "Xi Jinping pays special attention to measuring whether the United States will, and to how much, determined to defend Ukraine's Ukrainian. The sovereignty is exempted from Russian aggression. At the same time, it is publicly positioned in a sober rational voice, and the United States is positioned as an invader who loves leisure. "</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tommer University, analyzed in an interview with this station that since China chose to refuse to stand in the mainstream position to condemn Russia, its diplomatic status was questioned by the international community: "China said to mediate For the Western European countries, they are actually watching the Western European countries, and they will not feel that China is really doing this. "Ye Yaoyuan analyzed that China's diplomatic operations are actually competing with a large country in the United States. However, due to the close relationship between the two countries and trade, it cannot be completely decoupled in the short term. Action: "(Decompiled economic and trade) This needs a long time, which is a form of slowly moving forward. As long as it does not become a hot war, in the next ten years, we see that the more likely possibility is that the United States and China have approached 1950. Cold War situation. "</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan also pointed out that the CCP's decades of rule in China largely came from the positive results of its reform and opening up to receive the support of the middle and above classes. Once the strategy of "overwhelming everything" has hit the Chinese economic recovery, then the original group mentality of the CCP will quickly change, which will endanger its internal affairs stability.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that China ’s recent moves to promote economic recovery are also one of the efforts of Beijing's upgrading of competition in the United States. But what is the effect? Xi Jinping met with French President Macron in Beijing last month. The surface seemed to be calm. However, the subsequent large -scale Taiwan military exercises attracted the EU countries to express their stance and call for a strong stance to China.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-09T15-28-00-04-00/000000.png" />After Argentina, after Brazil, it is announced that it will stop using the US dollar to pay goods imported from China and use RMB settlement. Reuters information picture</p>
<p>Chinese media recently reported frequently that Brazil, ASEAN and other countries have shifted to the use of RMB settlement in trade and financial transactions, reducing their dependence on the US dollar, reflecting the decline of the US dollar hegemony and confidence in China's economic development. Argentina has also launched a exchange transaction with China recently to pay directly imported from China by RMB. However, Argentina's folk financial sources pointed out that this is to allow Argentina to maintain the ability to import and export and export, not to the US dollar.</p>
<p>According to the Argentine Business Chronicle, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lulid Dasilva proposed in March to trade with the local currency to reduce the impact of the US dollar on the overall economy. Driven by this decision, in order to maintain the US dollar foreign exchange, Argentina launched RMB exchange transactions (SWAP, also known as swap transactions) in April, and has reduced half of the US dollar expenditure in April, equivalent to $ 187 million.</p>
<p>Argentine Economic Minister of Economic Minister Sergiomassa said the use of RMB can accelerate the rhythm of Chinese commodities in Argentina in the next few months, and the efficiency of related authorization will be higher. This also avoids excessive triangle trade, which has led to the US dollar out of Argentina.</p>
<p>At present, Argentina's currency derogatory and debt expires. Nunihecht, Argentina Heterodoxia Consultant, believes that the importance of the US dollar cannot be denied because Argentina's debt still needs to be repaid with the US dollar. China provided RMB settlement only facilitates the trade that imports Chinese goods in Argentina, and also allows the U.S. dollar base in the Argentine Central Bank to temporarily resolve it.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-09T15-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />International researchers issued by the report also estimated that about 1/4 of the global newborn facing premature birth or lack of weight at birth. Researchers said that there are almost no progress in such problems.</p>
<p>The research team calls for the care of the government and various organizations to increase the care of local pregnant women and infants during pregnancy and childbirth during 81 low -income countries.</p>
<p>According to a series of papers published in the British medical journal "Lancet", if 8 measures to obtain medical certificates and easy implementation in these countries can prevent more than 560,000 deaths.</p>
<p>These measures include providing micro -nutrients, protein or energy supply products for pregnant women, providing low -dose Aspirin or lutein receptor, education on smoking harm, and treatment of malaria, syphilis and urinary tract infections.</p>
<p>Studies have also found that if pregnant women can provide steroids and allow doctors to cut the baby's umbilical cord immediately when they are born, they can prevent more than 475,000 newborn deaths.</p>
<p>Researchers said that the implementation of these changes is expected to cost $ 1.1 billion (about NT $ 33.8 billion). Per Ashorn, the first author of the study and Professor of TampereUniversity, Finland, said that this is "insignificant compared to other sanitary planning funds."</p>
<p>Another author of the study and the University of London's London School of Hygiene and Tropicalmedicine, Joy Lawn, explained to the AFP that they used new definitions on premature birth or lack of weight newborns. Essence</p>
<p>Landan pointed out that it was traditionally judged whether the newborn was too light for the newborn, but this threshold was arbitrarily ordered in 1919. Today, the researchers have developed how to define the baby's birth "too early or too small" by analyzing 16,000 live production data from 2000 to 2020.</p>
<p>Researchers estimate that 35.3 million or 1/4 of babies born in 2020 are premature or too light, and they are classified as newly known as "Small Vulnerablenewborn".</p>
<p>Although most of these babies were born in South Asia and Sahara Desert southern Africa, Lange emphasized that each country is affected by such problems.</p>

<p>A new American study found that deep sleep can prevent Altzheimer's disease -related protein damage to the brain and may help relieve the loss of memory caused by the condition.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported that deep sleep, also known as non -rapid eyesight and slow wave sleep. Earlier studies have shown that deep sleep is beneficial to the learning and memory ability of healthy adults. For patients with the same pathological indicators of Alzheimer's disease, the degree of cognitive ability can be very different, and deep sleep may be one of the mechanisms of brain anti -injury. Researchers at the University of California Berkeley published a paper in the new British "BMC Medicine" magazine that their new experiments provided evidence for the above theory.</p>
<p>Researchers said in the paper that a total of 62 healthy elderly people participated in the study. They had no dementia symptoms, but some of them had obvious β amyloid -like deposits in the brain. This deposition is considered to be the key factor in Alzheimer's disease, which can cause a series of abnormal reactions in the brain and cause neuron to be damaged.</p>
<p>The researchers monitored the brain waves during the sleeping process and performed memory tests after they woke up. It was found that for people with β amyloid -like protein deposits in the brain, people with a longer deep sleep time have better test results; if the brain does not have this protein deposition, the deep sleep time will not affect the results.</p>
<p>The "cognitive reserve" accumulated by education, exercise, and social channels can help the brain fight against damage and maintain cognitive ability. However, for Alzheimer's patients, most cognitive reserves are difficult to change and lack room for intervention. Researchers believe that deep sleep is a relatively easy to intervention factor, and new discovery means that improving sleep may relieve the condition.</p>

<p>Description: The Chinese authorities have recently decided to ban foreign institutions from access to China's main databases. The Wall Street Journal stated that the decision of the Chinese authorities may be related to reports that some overseas think tanks expressed by some overseas think tanks to a certain extent. Some scholars believe that this will force overseas scholars to understand China through foreign language databases, which may deepen foreign misunderstandings about China. However, some analysts believe that China's database contains many false data and cannot reflect the real situation, so its actual impact may not be as large as the outside world.</p>
