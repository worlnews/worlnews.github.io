Many human rights groups have condemned Hunson, who has ruled Cambodia for nearly 40 years, and use the legal system to suppress anyone who is against the Hundong regime.

Cambodia Parliament has passed the amendment bill today. All the Cambodian Pe conveged members of the Cambodian People's Party led by Hun Sen held.

Sar Kheng, the Minister of the Interior, said that anyone "has no voting without appropriate reasons ... will not be able to run for public office for four consecutive times." But he did not describe the reason for the "appropriate reason".

He also pointed out: "The amendment will also be fined and punished for personal sacrifice and penalties that disturb and hinder voters' registration procedures (and) elections."

This amendment will seriously affect many Cambodian opposition leaders who have escaped overseas, and they claim to be persecuted by prosecution for political motivation. Cambodia holds a general election every 5 years without overseas voting mechanism.

### Ukrainian war: From the discussion of Russia to discuss Putin's nuclear military round gambling game

* Steve Rosenberg * BBC Russian affairs editor from Moscow

Image adding text,

At the beginning of Putin's offensive, Russian nuclear weapons had been in a "high alert" state.

** Since the Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the full invasion of Ukraine, this issue will always be mentioned: Will the Kremlin choose nuclear weapons in this war? **

US President Joe Biden has never ruled out this possibility.

He said this week, "I am worried that Putin will use strategic nuclear weapons." He believed that this was a "real" crisis.

I don't know if President Biden has read the Russian "Profile; профиль). If he reads, you can understand why he is worried.

In short, he is familiar with the wealth here.

He is theory: In order to "defeat the west", Russia "has to make nuclear deterrence a convincing argument again by reducing the threshold of the use of nuclear weapons."

"The enemy must realize that we are ready to develop a pre -to -make, retaliate against the current and past aggression, thereby preventing the globalized thermal nuclear war."

"But what if they refuse to yield? Then we have to attack a bunch of goals of many countries and let those stupid people restore their sense."

President Putin confirmed that Russia has deployed its first strategic nuclear weapons to Belarus (White Ross). The Russian leader said that the move aims to drink all the people who "want to cause our strategic failure".

However, the benefits of discussing the nuclear blow to the Western premium? This topic has been upgraded to a new level.

Obviously, not all Russians agree with this idea.

The "Kommersant; коммерсантъ) published today (June 21) published an article entitled [" Nuclear War is a bad way to solve problems "](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6055340)Article.

Should the debate of Ukraine's use of nuclear weapons have entered the public domain of Russia.

Perhaps this is an unprecedented light description, but this article is fascinating, it is that it shows that Russia's discussion about when and whether the nuclear weapons should be used in the Ukrainian war have entered the public domain, and the hawks are not good.

The article of "Industry and Commerce Daily" came from another group of diplomatic and national defense policy experts in Moscow. It explained why they believed that Karaginov was wrong and was dangerous."There are many examples of military operations that lead to unexpected consequences in contemporary history, but these do not involve the use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear strikes will raise the unpredictable conflict to a new level and increase the risk of confrontation at multiple."

"The radioactive consequences caused by the" nuclear wheel disk "are probably to lay the worst foundation for the bright future. Those people who have sensational thoughts and dangerous gambling are best to keep this in mind."

Ukraine began to counterattack the Russian occupation area, BBC reporter Queentin Sommerville and photographer Darrenconway visited the 68th hunter brigade.

This has brought us on another question that we have repeatedly raised since the Kai -war of Russia: What happened?

Perhaps Karaganov's proposal for the first -fledged nuclear strike was too shocking, making Russian scholars feel unable to sit still.

If this is the case, this shows that even if Russia's media landscape is more and more controlled by the country, even under the limit of existing existing, there are still some platforms to have space to accommodate the limited discussion of certain questions, especially like like like like like The topic of life and death in nuclear weapons.

It may also be that the entire debate was carefully designed in order to attract Western attention and make President Putin a white face under the black face of Karaginov.

In the final analysis, the chief of the Kremlin himself has not asked to take a nuclear blow to the West. Therefore, as it proposes this debate -it is best to sit down and try to talk to him, so as not to scramble for the length of a day and press the nuclear button.

There is one thing that is clear: As the Russian internal anti -Western argument rises, as the Ukrainian army began to counterattack, the nuclear military issue may not linger.

### Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

### Blinger to complete the main goal of this trip

According to usual, the US Secretary of State visits China, and Chinese leaders will meet with it. However, there are exceptions, such as when Plingken's former Pompeo visited China in October 2018, Xi Jinping did not see him. At that time, the Sino -US trade war had debuted, and US Vice President Pence had just delivered a tough speech on China. The relationship between the two sides was very tense. Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China.

Li Qiang met with German political and business people.

One week before Li Qiang's visit to Europe, Germany published the first national security strategy (Die NATIONALESICHERTSSTRATEGIE), defining China as "partners, competitors, and systemic opponents". Order, threatening global security and ignoring human rights.

The document believes that Germany needs to reduce its dependence on goods to other countries, but it means that China is still "partners" and "solving many international challenges and crisis are indispensable."

After the release of this contradictory document accused, Li Qiang emphasized that when he met with German Chancellor Shulz, China and Germany were the credible and reliable partners on the road of modernization, and Schildez was "opposed to decoupling" and "de -riskization". (DE-RISK) response is not de-China. French President Macron also said that he attaches great importance to French -China relations and adheres to a Chinese policy. The law should adhere to effective polymerization.

"This is a very important diplomacy process throughout the first half of the year." Dr. Chen Weixin, an international relations scholar of European politics, and Dr. ORientis Research Director Chen Weixin said to BBC Chinese. "In the first half of the year, China -Europe and Sino -US relations were a bit cold and warm. Western Songkou no longer talks about decontle, but is risky. Therefore, Beijing also tried to understand the actual meaning of this word."

The term "de -risk" was first proposed by the EU Commission Chairman Feng Delin in March. After that, German diplomats adopted this statement, and Washington also followed. The strategy of China to China is written into a joint bulletin.

"Completely decoupled does not conform to everyone's interests. For the United States, the Democratic Party must please Wall Street and corporate interests before the 2024 election. In Europe, Chinese funds and markets are still very important, especially Germany and France have great interests in China. "Chen Weixin said.

Li Qiang's second stop was France. Here he was warmly received by President Macron, and the latter just visited China in April this year.

Li Qiang shouted to the business community during his visit. When he met in Germany, he met the heads of Siemens, Volkswagen, Pingzhi, BMW and other companies that there were me and me among the world economy. "Dependence", even the simplicity of interdependence and unsafe, "not cooperation is the biggest risk, and not development is the biggest insecurity."

Li Qiang mentioned at the dinner of the China -French business community in Paris that the good political mutual trusts of China and France saw stability, certainty and common development opportunities in mutual dependence, not risks. He praised the French government's opposition to camp confrontation and the "decaptering chain", calling on Sino -French entrepreneurs to firmly support economic globalization and jointly maintain the stability and toughness of the China -French and China -Europe industry chain.

"Li Qiang was forced to respond to the risk -because everyone knows that this vague concept can be used for China." Chen Jialuo, an associate professor of the Department of Political and International Relations at the Hong Kong Baptist University, told BBC.

He explained that in the past three decades, Beijing successfully "decoupled" human rights and trade, allowing the West to share technology and technical secrets (Know-How) for the West, and put human rights issues aside. The two are re -connected, this is the most dissatisfied place in China. "

The EU published a document of the "European Economic SecurityStrategy" on June 20, and proposed a number of actions, including the establishment , Review foreign direct investment screening regulations, and jointly study the safety risks that may generate export investment with member states. The document does not name China, but emphasizes that "cooperation with the country on the road to risk" is emphasized."When it involves trade, Brussels has great influence because it has legal and regulatory power to 27 EU member states. The business world knows this, so they must be careful when they cooperate with China It is punished by legal sanctions and may be punished. "

Russia invaded Ukraine, and China refused to condemn Putin, becoming a watershed in China -Europe relations.

Two months ago, French President Macron and the Chairman of the European Commission via Beijing. The former was received by Xi Jinping's ultra -high specifications, but the latter was called "disappearing access" by the media. Two months later, Li Qiang's trip to Europe only reached Germany and France, and did not visit Brussels, reflecting the thinking of Beijing's diplomatic traditions "focusing on Germany and light EU".

Former European Parliament political consultant Zsuzsa Annaferenczy pointed out to BBC in Chinese that Beijing has always been "laid a faction" and adopted the strategy of differentiation of the European Union and attracting some countries.

"Europe has entered the new situation, and 27 member states have become more united. Xi Jinping supports Putin and refuses to condemn Russia to invade Ukraine, becoming a watershed in China -Europe relations, which exacerbates the doubts of EU countries. Therefore, China and China and China and China and China and China Whether German and French economic and trade cooperation can fundamentally cultivate the relationship with Europe, I am afraid it is still doubtful. "

Chen Weixin, a scholar of international relations, also pointed out that after experiencing the epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War, Beijing must be aware that Europe is not Europe three years ago, and China -Europe relations are no longer only Germany and France.

"Nordic, which attaches importance to human rights equivalent, and Central and Eastern European countries that borders Russia and Ukraine, have now become the biggest resistance to China. Beijing does not take the European Union as one thing. Sino -European relations return to the previous set. This old thinking cannot be realized under the new system and geopolitics. "

Description: Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang's visit to Berlin this time, the high reception specifications of the German side are unusual: the presidential meeting, the Prime Minister set up a banquet, review the honor guards of the three armed forces, meet the elites of the industrial and commercial circles, especially the Prime Minister of the two countries after the German and Chinese government consultation, but the reporter is not allowed to be a reporter.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T13-05-00Z/65975159_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66014213/65975159)(Voice of Germany Chinese) The "Daily News" website commented that it is a good thing to communicate with China, but it is a mistake to carry out government consultations with China. Because German partners who have carried out government -level consultations have always been other democratic countries, and the diplomatic courtesy to Beijing is very uncomfortable. [This consultation in 2011 is a mistake, and it is wrong to continue government consultations. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与中国压力山大的伙伴关系/a-65941273)This article entitled "Not to Give China":

"First of all, compared with 12 years ago, China has changed greatly. Whether it is internal affairs, diplomacy, or the economic field, the CCP's leadership has become more and more aggressive and more and more nationalism. The Chinese government will promote the process of liberalization or opening to the outside world.

Secondly, the Chinese leadership provides at least indirectly supporting Putin and its invasive Ukraine War. During his visit to Germany, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang closed his mouth and did not mention the word of aggression, and he did not make any condemnation. In his statement, he only brought it through the "complicated international situation". "

The comments pointed out that in the face of preaching nationalism, the Beijing authorities, which continuously issued force on Taiwan's force and promoted unfair economic policy, the European Union is trying to make common responses to the above challenges, but Germany has the "institutional opponent" in China to carry out the government. Consultation, this is undoubtedly a very wrong signal.

"Berlin paved a red carpet for the Chinese Prime Minister and its government delegation. These seemingly harmonious pictures sent a signal to AIA in Germany: China plays a special role in Germany. Wrong, this error should not continue. "

The "Business Daily" also commented that the German -Chinese government consultation that had just ended in Berlin was an inconsistent government consultation for Germany, but for China, it was a major victory of diplomacy and publicity.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T13-05-00Z/65975012_401.jpg)"Business Daily": The German -China government's consultation did not even issue a joint statement. After all, the differences between Beijing and Berlin have been too large.

"For China, this time government consultation is obviously very successful. The picture from Berlin is unmatched by Beijing: German Prime Minister led eight ministers to hold talks with Chinese representatives and laugh everywhere. Chinese media conducted negotiations on the German and Chinese government consultations. It has been reported in a row to prove that Germany and China relations have developed very well. This is also in line with Beijing's anti -American speech: the United States has made turbulence everywhere, while China is a defender of cooperation and free trade.

For the German government, the results of government consultation are not so ideal. From the perspective of Germany, the essential content of consultation is more important, and as expected beforehand, the German -China government's consultation involves very few substances. [German Prime Minister Shulz actually obeyed the wishes of Chinese leadership and canceled the questioning link of reporters at a joint press conference on Tuesday. During Merkel's while serving as the Prime Minister, although he encountered China's resistance, the reporter asked the link that always had to be retained. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567)The German -China government's consultation has not even issued a joint statement, after all, the differences between Beijing and Berlin are too large. Dialogue with Beijing is crucial, but the increasingly imbalance between Germany and China also shows that it is out of time to carry out government consultations with a country like China. "

By investing in Europe, Huida will join the ranks of other semiconductor giants such as Intel. These companies also seek new businesses in the European Union (EU) with the help of government subsidies.

Huang Renxun said, "I would say that the possibility is very high, because Huida wants to be a global international enterprise; another, who can think of a better place of investment?"

Huida's last quarter revenue was far higher than expected. For a few weeks, the market value was around 1 trillion dollars. This American company specializes in the chip that everyone is raised in the artificial intelligence boom.

Huang Renxun issued the above conversation after seeing the EU's internal market commissioner Thierry Breton at the Huida headquarters in Silicon Valley.

After the meeting, Buller Dong said: "Artificial intelligence is closely related to data, algorithms and computing power ... The computing power must be attributed to enterprises such as Huida."

Blintin said with Xi Jin that Washington knew "the challenges brought by China."

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday (June 19) in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. He is the highest -level American official who visited China after taking office in 2021 in Joebiden.

In the two -day visits of Brinken, both China and the United States proposed to have a stable relationship, but the United States seemed to be able to restart military communication channels. China emphasizes that the United States should "reflect" for the stalemate of the current bilateral relations, and there are nothing more important among the issues of Sino -US relations.

After Brinken left China, US President Joebiden first described US -China relations on the "correct track", and then publicly criticized Xi Jinping as a "dictator" after one day, which once again attracted strong criticism in Beijing.

Some media quoted the Chinese Embassy in the United States that the ambassador Xie Feng proposed to the White House with relevant officials of the United States State Department of "strictly negotiating and strong protests." A statement issued on Thursday (22nd) stated: "China urges the United States to take practical action immediately, eliminate negative impacts, and abide by its own commitments, otherwise all consequences will be borne by the United States."

Biden responded to reporters: "I don't think this will bring any real consequences."

Although it is generally commented that Brinken's visit to China has taken an important step in restoring the healthy development of bilateral relations, many observers pointed out to the BBC that whether it can truly return to normal is still to be carefully observed.

In the audio published on social networking sites Telegram, Porigjin condemned the rocket explosion and his casualties caused to the Wagner forces.

"A large number of our soldiers and our comrades were killed." He also said, "It is necessary to stop the sin of the country's military leadership. They ignore the lives of soldiers. They forget the word justice."

Porigjin estimates that 2,000 people in his soldiers were killed in the explosion, but he failed to provide evidence of the number of deaths. His audio information also includes calling for action, and the Russian government has since interpreted it as a call for rebellion.

"We have 25,000 people, and we have to figure out why this country has such confusion." He also said that he has more support for reserve troops and military members. "Welcome everyone to join us. We must end this shame."

The long -term confrontation with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Ministry of Defense has been significantly upgraded. In response, the Russian Ministry of National Defense issued a statement saying that the allegations of Porigjin "are not true and are provocative information."

Pricigo said that his actions did not constitute a military coup, but "protest of justice."

####  Criminal cases for Criminal Cases for Poriger

However, the Tas Society quoted the Russian National Anti -Terrorism Commission on Friday that the Russian Federal Security Agency had filed a criminal lawsuit against Porigo, and the crime was to incite the armed rebellion.

In a statement, the Russian Federal Security Agency pointed out that "Poriger's remarks and actions are actually calling for the launch of an armed civil war on the Russian federal territory. Stranger. "

The Russian security department also called on Wagner's armed personnel to "take measures to detain" their leaders. Surovinkin, deputy commander of the Russian Theater in Ukraine, also called on the troops to obey Moscow's command.

"I urged you to stop", and Saro Weijin said in a video released on the social platform Telegram. In the video, he was wearing military uniforms and put his hands on the rifle. "You must do this before the time before. Obief the will of the Federal President of the Russian Federal Federal President. Back to the base and the resident site."

The Kremlin also said that President Putin "kept" informed the incident and "taking necessary measures." The safety measures of the capital Moscow and Rostov on the banks of the river have been strengthened overnight.

A reporter from Peninsula reported from Moscow that the Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement saying that Ukraine is using the "provocations" issued by the leaders of Wagner, and the Ukraine army has launched an offensive in the direction of Bachomut.

The reporter pointed out, "In addition, the armored vehicles of military personnel can be seen everywhere on the streets of Moscow. However, people generally report that the capital is currently quite calm. This may be because the capital has strengthened safety measures, and all the most important facilities have been protected by protection. ","

Several senior Russian generals also posted video information to Porigo, claiming that this was a time for Russia's unity. The background was Russia's enemy in Ukraine and the West "now he was dancing." The reporter added that the military generals believed that Wagner's statement was "a knife behind the country and the president", and the Russian Federal Security Agency also called on Wagner for armed personnel to detain their leaders.

The United States said it was paying close attention to the development of the situation, and the spokesman of the National Security Council Adam Horch told reporters that the United States allies also negotiated the issue.

 Many details of this deadlock are unclear before, and this seems to be the largest domestic crisis that Putin sent thousands of soldiers to Ukraine in February last year to carry out the so -called "special military operations".

A reporter from the Peninsula TV station in Donetsk reported that "in the past few months, the Wagner Group played a vital role in Russia's attack on Bach Murut and Soledal. This conflict has been brewing for a long time. "" What happened now is just the corner of the iceberg. "

Porigin often publishes a long story on social media to cover up his limited role in the war as the head of the Wagner Mercenary Group. For a few months, Porigin has been publicly accused of having incompetence in Shaygou and the top general of Russia, Glacimov, and accusing the two of them accused the two of their troops with ammunition and support."But he did take a considerable step in this regard."

Glink called Russia's war in Ukraine the "money -making activities" of the National Defense Department -In his opinion, Pleigo and Shaygu are competing for resources and control. But Grindini added that it is not clear what Pleigo's strategy is.

"Honestly, it is difficult for me to understand the considerations of Pricigin here," Green added, "This is indeed a very important challenge. He must completely win it, otherwise it is difficult to imagine how he will be in this system in this system. Survive inside. "

Incidents may develop in several ways. For Ukraine, Russia is not good at the time of trouble.

Just when Kiev is adapting to its long -term commitment counterattack, it is unlikely that when it is unlikely to expel the Russian army this year and next year, a lifeline appears.

As the Kremlin and Wagner are now focusing on the internal fighting, this has led some of the most powerful Russian combat forces to withdraw from the battlefield.

More importantly, this challenge to Moscow may seriously weaken the morale of all solid -line Russian troops stationed in Ukraine.

In the ideal world, all this will end with Russia's war and end from Ukraine. But things cannot be so simple.Another possible result is that the challenges of Porigjin's challenge to the Kremlin will be short -lived, and his army will be forced to surrender.

But no matter what happened, the elves have come out of the bottle.

In the past few months of Bakhmut, Russia's only major victory told the Russian people that the entire excuse for invading was lies, and the threat from Ukraine was fabricated.

Once the richest oligarchy in Russia, Hodolkovsky said: "We need help now, if necessary, we will fight."

After Ten years after Ho Dorkovsky and Putin turned over, he recently called for more severe sanctions on Russian presidents.

He said that if he decides to fight the Kremlin, it is important to "even support the devil."

He said, "Yes, this is just the beginning."

###  Expert: The severe challenge to Putin

** BBC Reporter ** ** Baby Bernede De Besman ** ** (Bern Debusmann JR) ** **, ** ** ** Helenahumphrey from Washington ** **

The world is closely paying close attention to the sharp upgrade of Russia, including former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and officials of the Central Intelligence Agency Mick Mulroy.

Malroe told the BBC that the head of the Wagner Group Priegojin now proposes a severe challenge to President Putin.

Without provocation, the Russian people were deceived. "

He told me that if Wagner's army can indeed threaten Putin's control over Russia, Russia may have to "re -adjust its military forces in order to protect themselves, rather than prevent Ukraine's counterattack."

He also said, "Even if the coup attempts, it also shows that the closest to this war knows that this is a terrible mistake."

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Billtaylor, told BBC that Porigerz called the rebellion this time, "It is almost definitely a coup to an attempt." "This is serious for Putin. This matter.

Taylor was in Ukraine last month, and he judged that Wagner was unlikely to succeed this time. "The Ministry of National Defense has equipment, aircraft, and tanks. They have a large number of military equipment to defeat the troops of Pleigin."

But he believes that Russia's internal crickets may help Ukraine to repel the invasion of the Russian army. "If the Russian army is now worried about their internal command chains, then the Russian soldiers who should fight Ukraine may be distracted or even escape."

###  瓦 What do you say?

On Friday, Porigin released a series of angry recording on the Internet. He accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered a rocket attack on Wagner's camp in Ukraine on Friday.

He said: "Today they conducted a rocket attack on our rear camps, and a large number of comrades in our arms were killed."

"They deceived us scams," he added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense denied a rocket attack against the Wagner forces.

Porigabin then stated that his troops would expel Shoshugu and called on the Russian army to flash aside.Image source, EPA

Porigin publicly criticized the Russian Defense Minister, Shiyugu.

"This is not a military coup, but the march of justice," he said.

Porigin also claimed that Sho Gulu personally commanded the so -called attack and escaped.

"It is necessary to stop the evil actions shown by the country's military leadership," he shouted.

Since then, Pricigo also claims that his troops have entered Russia from Ukraine, but did not provide evidence.

Earlier, he posted a video saying that Russia had no reason to invade Ukraine. This war was a disaster.

###  What is the Wagner Group?

Wagner Group St. Petersburg Office.

The Wagner Group was first discovered in 2014. At that time, it was a secret organization that supported the pro -Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and assisted Russia to annex Crimea.

The organization is also active in Africa and the Middle East. It is understood that only about 5,000 soldiers were at first, most of which were veterans of the Russian Elite Corps and special forces.

To this day, the organization has grown. According to the British Department of Defense in January, Wagner currently command 50,000 combatants in Ukraine, and has become a key part of the Ukrainian battle. Due to the shortage of Russia's regular army's manpower, the organization began to recruit a lot in 2022.

The National Security Council said earlier this year that about 80%of Wagner's troops in Ukraine came from prison.

Although the mercenaries were illegal in Russia, the Wagner Group registered as a company in 2022 and opened a new headquarters in St. Petersburg.

Dr. Samuel Ramani of the Royal Institute of National Defense Security said: "It is a public recruitment personnel in Russia's cities, advertising on billboards, and called patriotic organizations on the Russian media."

A few weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, people believed that the Wagner Group implemented a "fake flag" attack, giving the Kremlin an invasive excuse.

One of the most famous photos of Pricigin is that he is serving Putin (November 11, 2011, a restaurant outside Moscow). He then won the nickname "Putin".

Vagna participated in Russia to occupy the city of Udon Bach Murd. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not mention Wagner's role at first, but later praised its mercenaries to play the role of "bravery and selflessness".

The current leader of the organization, Pleigo, is a wealthy businessman and provides catering services for the Kremlin.

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Li Zhiying, the founder of the Apple Daily, who has been detained in Hong Kong since 2020, has been charged with four charges including the issuance of inciting publications and colluding foreign forces. The trial was postponed to September this year.

Li Zhiying is a British citizen holding a British passport. His son Sebastien Lai recently shouted to the British government and asked the country to use the Li Zhiying case as a "political priority" when dealing with the Hong Kong authorities.

In an interview with Agence France -Presse, Li Chongen said: "If they (the British government) do not resolutely protect their citizens in a place where they have business exchanges with them, what is the meaning of having their passports? What is the meaning of its citizen? "

### Prime Minister vowed to defend Hong Kong freedom

[Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Sunak Sunak vowed to defend Hong Kong freedom](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/黎智英案引发中英隔空互呛/a-64354777), But Li Chongen believes that London needs to do more.

Experts believe that although the Hong Kong authorities guarantee justice independence in mainland China, this decision shows that Beijing has the ability to influence Hong Kong's justice.

### Interview with Li Zhiying: I will work together with Hong Kong

### EU request to release Li Zhiying

On the other hand, the European Union Parliament passed a resolution involved in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month, asking the Hong Kong government to release Li Zhiying and revoke the allegations of it.

Li Zhiying believes that the police have no right to apply for inspection of news materials in the mobile phone based on the implementation rules of the National Security Law, and Hong Kong judicial units believe that news materials do not mean that the news can be exempted from investigating and inspection related to investigations related to criminal crimes.

Since Hong Kong's implementation of the National Security Law, Hong Kong's media environment has been greatly limited. Among the non -governmental organization "No Borders", of the press freedom ranking of 180 countries, Hong Kong ranked 140th this year, down 122 in 20 years.

### Data analysis: Infected death will reach the peak on January 23

According to British Health Information Analysis Company Airfinity in late December estimates that thousands of people in China currently die every day, and millions of people may die in the new crown (the picture shows a crematorium on December 18). The company also predicts that the death of Chinese infection will reach its peak on January 23, 2023, and the single -day death case will rise to about 25,000. And January 23 is the second day of the Chinese New Year of the Chinese Lunar New Year.

### China announced that "0+0" countries have begun to quarantine China

Chinese officials announced on December 26 that from January 8, 2023, the detection and centralized isolation of nucleic acid testing and centralized infected infected people in the country will no longer be isolated. At the same time, after the entry restrictions are relaxed, it will further optimize foreign people to come to China to arrange in China, and "orderly restore" Chinese citizens' outbound travel in the future. This has caused some countries to worry about the input of viruses from China and possible virus mutation. Japan, the United States, France (pictured) and other countries have first announced that they have implemented entry restrictions such as isolation or nucleic acid detection from entryrs from China.

###  U.S. National Intelligence Director Office: There is no information to support the recent statement

Today, the Office of the National Intelligence Director (ODNI) said they did not have information to support the recent statement, that is, the three scientists in the laboratory were the first batch of infected people of the new crown virus and may create this virus by themselves. [The report reiterates the conclusion that the relevant US agencies have reached in March](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新研究新冠病毒来自武汉华南海鲜市场/a-60987262)The ODNI report pointed out that "almost all" member institutions (including NSA, CIA, and FBI) all believe that COVID-19 was not made by genetic engineering, and most institutions also believed that it was not changed in the laboratory.

Since Wuhan's first report on human infection at the end of 2019, the origin of the new crown virus has almost caused fierce debate in the United States. U.S. President Bayeng signed an information decryption bill related to the origin of great popularity in March this year.

The latest report from the National Intelligence Director's Office stated that the research of the Wuhan Institute of Virus before the popularity did not include the SARS-COV-2 virus or its close relatives. There is no direct evidence that the incident related to personnel involving the personnel involved in the Wuhan Virus Research Institute had occurred before the popularity.

According to a report released by the Wall Street Journal in February this year, [the US Department of Energy was evaluated in an intelligence report as a "low trust" in the United States](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美能源部fbi指疫情源自中国实验室泄漏-白宫称尚无结论/a-64828455)This big epidemic is most likely to originate from the leakage of the Chinese laboratory. This evaluation was denied by Beijing, saying that this statement was "no credibility."

As of March 20, the other four US agencies still believed that COVID-19 may be the result of natural communication, and the two institutions have not made a decision.

### The crown of stabbing

The 10 -year -old Andrej imagined by Russia's new crown virus is like this. Its popularity has made the whole world unable to settle for nearly two years. Its name comes from Latin Corona, which means the crown. For the first time in 1968, someone used the coronary virus, because the virus surface had spines on the surface of the virus.

####  virus under the electronic microscope

### Photo Picture

This is its true appearance. The new coronary virus (SARS-COV-2) has a diameter of about 80 nanometers, and the virus has a virus ribosic acid-that is, gene code, and the outer layer of spiny protein play a protective role. Like SARS and MERS, they belong to the coronary virus.

### In the air, spread in the air

New crown virus spreads through the form of droplets and gas solution. Sneezing or speaking in the infected person will exhale virus particles. Therefore, wearing a mask can play a role in preventing virus diffusion and becoming an indispensable epidemic prevention tool. However, the virus may also spread through the surface of the object, so please wash your hands frequently!

### How to invade the cells

The spiny protein of the new coronary virus is combined with the protein on the surface of the host cells (green in the figure). The chemical changes caused by the virus entered the cells and forced the cells to copy its ribonic acid. Only one cell can copy tens of thousands of new virus particles (purple), which will further invade other cells in the body.

### Humans have no immune forces

This is a cell (blue) infected by the new crown virus particles (red) under the electronic microscope. The new coronal virus is very similar to the virus that causes influenza and the cold. But until 2019, the human immune system was completely unfamiliar with it, so no one had immunity to it.

### MERS-COV: Another kind of coronary virus

In 2012 researchers discovered a new coronary virus MERS-COV(yellow)Essence Infected people have symptoms similar to influenza, and are later called "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome" because of their earliest foundations. MERS virus's infectious power is not as strong as new coronal virus, and more spreads among family members and hospitalization patients.

### HIV: Another century plague

HIV (HIV)(yellow)T cells that attack the immune system(blue)Essence Like the new coronal virus, it is also a virus based on ribonucleic acid. If not treated, the virus will continue to weaken the immune system until it cannot resist any infection. HIV spreads through body fluids such as semen and blood. There is no vaccine for this virus so far, but some drugs can reduce the number of viruses in the body, thereby preventing the infected people from becoming the disease.

###  does not rule out any possibility

The report of ODNI, the Office of the National Intelligence Director, did not exclude the possibility of Wuhan Laboratory being studying COVID-19 and may leak due to negligence when the epidemic broke out.

ODNI said that the intelligence community still occurs naturally by the virus -for example, maybe it may be different from animals, such as bats, or problems caused by laboratory leaks.

The report pointed out that Wuhan Lab has conducted pathogenic research and vaccine development with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to "meet public health needs."

However, the report said that the coronary virus used in these studies is too alienated with SARS-COV-2, which cannot lead to the appearance of SARS-COV-2. "

The report resolutely refuted that Covid-19 was the allegations of the development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a biological weapon development. "The intelligence community continues to evaluate. Because the symptoms of relevant researchers may be caused by a variety of diseases, this information neither supports nor refute any assumptions of the origin of great epidemic." The report said.

Description: U.S. Secretary of State Brills reiterated a Chinese policy in Beijing this week and emphasized that Washington's long -term policy has not changed. The core of a Chinese policy is "tampering" in China's political commitments in the three joint communiqués of the United States and China. Experts say that the Beijing authorities say that it is based on the "false premise". The United States has never "recognized" Taiwan in three joint communiqués. Taiwan is part of China. It is even more wrong to define the China Union's Bulletin.

And the Kremlin accused him of inciting the rebellion

(Voice of Germany), the leader of the Russian mercenaries "Wagner Group", Yevgenyprigozhin, said that the Russian army attacked his armed team on Friday. The Kremlin accused him of inciting the rebellion. How much influence is the influence of Pricigin and its Vagna Group?

The Wagner Group is notorious due to brutal killing and barbaric tactics on the battlefield. In a video of armed elements that are said to be defeated to Ukraine, the organization also showed its ruthless ruthlessness outside the battlefield.

According to reports, Wagner held a defector with a big hammer last year. Subsequently, it incorporated the big iron hammer icon into its logo.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T10-49-00Z/60524633_401.jpg)Wagner incorporates the big iron hammer icon into its logo

The senior researcher of the Carnegie International Peace Foundation Andrei Kolesnikov once said in the independent media "Noveyagazeta" that "exaggerated cruelty" is the characteristic of Poriger.

### From prison to hot dogs, to "Putin’s chef"

Born in 1961 in Leningrad, the current St. Petersburg. According to reports, in his 20s, Porigin served a prison in the Soviet prison for 9 years in his 20s in his 20s. When he was released from prison, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and Perigo was on the road to entrepreneurship. He started making hot dog food cars in his hometown, and later turned to larger projects, such as opening a luxury restaurant in St. Petersburg. The restaurant became a gathering center of Russian elite, including the then Vice Mayor Putin, the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg.

Thanks to the close connection with the political elites, Poigerjin's business further expanded after Putin took office. His catering company, Concord, was founded in the 1990s and obtained an exclusive and profitable national banquet contract, including Putin's inauguration catering and US President Bush's visit to St. Petersburg. These contracts won the title of "Putin Chef".

However, Poriger's ambition is not limited to the catering industry.

### Interference in the US election and provide "gray services" for Putin

On February 14, 2023, Pleigo acknowledged that he was behind the scenes of an Internet research institution. The agency was a well -known giant devil factory network. According to the FBI, the agency organized the Internet Water Army to launch a wide range of false information dissemination activities to influence the results of the US presidential election in 2016. Porigin and his lawyer have previously strongly denied these allegations and also filed a legal lawsuit to reporters reporting his relationship with the Russian Giant Factory.

In 2014, Porigo established a private military company Wagner Group. Like the Giant Demon Factory, he has long denied any relationship with the organization until September 2022 he publicly acknowledged the matter.

Russian independent analyst Alexandraprokopenko told the Voice of Germany that the mercenaries of Prigjin provided Putin with "gray services". "He let his boss extremely with the party in regional politics they did not want to make public and officially involved." Proveredko said, "For example, in the Donedsk and Lugusk region in Ukraine, as well as Africa and Syria, Wagner hired mercenaries not only participated in the combat operation, but also guarded some oil facilities. "

### The contradiction between the Wagner Group and the Russian army

[Wagner Mercenary](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳集团在非洲远远不只是雇佣兵/a-64856380)In 2014, the Ukrainian war was first involved in the Ukrainian war. After Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the fighting power of the Wagner Corps became an important military asset of the Kremlin in the fierce battle in eastern Ukraine. In January 2023, the Wagner Legion claimed that it had controlled the Ukrainian city of Solidal, which was regarded as one of the rare victories after the war in Moscow.

The efficiency of the Wagner Group and its increasingly important position on the battlefield have enlisted Pleigo's qualifications [launched an offensive against senior Russian officers. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳集团称遭俄军方背叛-莫斯科驳斥/a-64788325)In a strong protest of the public's lack of ammunition against Russian soldiers, he accused military leaders of incompetence. On February 20, 2023, in a 7 -minute audio, Pritjin accused Russia of the highest military commander of Russia to deprive his troops of ammunition and committed "the crime of betrayal."

He complained: "Although I have a lot of relationships and connections, I can't solve this problem." He also said that he was asked to "apologize and obey" to ensure that he provided ammunition for his soldiers. The Russian Ministry of Defense denied the allegations of Pricigjin, saying that his remarks were "absolutely not true."

One day later, Porigabin released another audio message as a response, claiming that the behavior of military officials was "tantamount to spitting into Wagner."

Porigin also came forward to attack the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and ValeryGrasimov, the highest general in Russia, who was responsible for the modernization of the army. In the May criticism, he accused Russia's military bureaucrats that failed to successfully occupy Bach Murd. [For a few months, Bach Mutter has been the center of conflict](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为什么巴赫穆特之战对乌俄两国都如此重要/a-65690776)Both Russia and Ukraine are seriously casualties.

Porigjin told Russia's official media: "Without our terrible military bureaucratic agency ... Bach Murut will win before the New Year."

Coriezkov believes that under the Russian autocratic system, only Putin has the right to criticize military officials.

"Putin needs Pricigo to keep the military generals be vigilant." He said, "Putin balances the" weight "of various characters, allowing them to oppose each other and supervise each other to avoid excessive expansion."

Despite the severe rebuilding military officials, Putin still promoted Gracimov in January, making him commander -in -chief of the Ukrainian war. Analysts believe that this move shows that Pleigon's remarks have limited impact on Putin's decision -making.

### "Everyone who will make the Kremlin feel a headache" "

The Kremlin hopes to strengthen the control of Porigin, reflected in the cancellation of his right to recruit prisoners before. According to the US National Security Council, 80%of the Wagner forces are prisoners. In an interview with the Russian military blog and official media, Perigo acknowledged that the role of the Wagner Group in the Russian war after the shrinking will be even more limited.Earlier, Tatianastanovaya had predicted in an article in the Carnegie International Peace Foundation that Porigin's ambition on the political stage may damage his relationship with the Kremlin. "Domestic policy supervisors do not like his political incitement. His attack on official institutions and his tried to control Putin's staff by threatening to form a political party will make everyone in the Kremlin feel a headache."

Last night I talked with the commanders in various directions. I also have to appeal to those who are deceived or threatened and involved in this sinful adventure, and those who have been pushed to the most serious armed rebellion.

Today, Russia is fighting a hard battle for its future to repel the aggression of the new Nazis and its manipulator. The entire Western military, economic and information machines are almost targeted at us.

We are fighting for the lives and security of the people, fighting for our sovereignty and independence, and fighting for the rights of Russia, a country with a history of thousands of years.

This battle related to the fate of the people of our country requires us to unite all forces and need to unite, consolidate and take responsibility. All things that weaken our strength and discord in any form must be prevented to prevent us from being used by our enemies and destroying us from the inside.

Therefore, the split action of our unity is essentially the betrayal of our people and comrades who are still fighting in the front line. This is a knife behind our country and people.

When Russia participated in the First World War in 1917, it was hit by such a blow. We won, but it was stolen.

The conspiracy, quarrels and political activities behind the army and the people have caused the biggest disaster. The army was destroyed, the country disintegrated, the large territory was lost, and it caused tragedy and civil war.

The Russians are killing each other, and the brothers are killing each other. Various political adventurers and foreign forces are differentiation of our country, tearing our country, and obtaining generous profits.

We will not allow this situation to happen again. We will protect our people and our country so as not to threaten all. What we face is a betrayal.

Excessive ambitions and vested interests have led to a traitor. Not only betrayed his country and the people, but also betrayed Wagner's soldiers to fight and sacrifice the business with our soldiers. The heroes of the town and villages of the liberation of Soledal and Altoohvsk, and Donbas, fighting for the reunification of the Russian world and presented their lives. Their names and glory were also betrayed by those who tried to organize rebellion, pushed the country to an anarchy state and the state of killing, and eventually failed and succumbed.

Let me say it again, any internal turmoil is a fatal threat to our country's status and our nation. This is a blow to Russia and our people. And we to defend the motherland to avoid this threat will be very difficult.

Anyone who deliberately embarked on the road of betrayal, those who are preparing to armed rebellion, and people who adopt ransom and terrorist methods will inevitably be punished. They are responsible for the law and our people.

Armed forces and other government agencies have received necessary orders. Moscow, Moscow, and other regions are taking additional counter -terrorism measures. We will also take decisive actions to stabilize the situation of Rostov on the banks of the river -the local situation is still complicated, and the work of civil and military authorities is substantially hindered.

As a Russian president and commander -in -chief of the military, as a citizen of Russia, I will do my best to defend the country, protect the constitutional order, and protect the life, safety and freedom of citizens.

Those who organize and prepare for military rebellion, those who raise their weapons to deal with comrades, have betrayed Russia. They will be held accountable for this.

As for those who are involved in this crime, I urge you not to commit this fatal, tragic, irreversible mistake.

To make the only correct choice -stop participating in criminal actions.

I believe that we will defend and maintain the sacred things we cherish. With our motherland, we will overcome all challenges and become more powerful. "

Author: None (Language: zh)

Time: 2023-06-24T13:55:00Z

Description: Whether it is the "two China" policies or the two "China Policy", the Chinese government is unwilling to see from the German political circles. German media observed that in Germany, this is related to the wrestling of the Prime Minister's Palace and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Although the political circles called for "risks" to China during the period, German companies seemed to have no choice.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T13-55-00Z/65978455_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66021434/65978455)The German United Government's attitude towards China is actually very different.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The German media "Ming Mirror Weekly" posted a comment on the German policy level at this [Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Germany](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国总理李强到访柏林-德中政府磋商周二开启/a-65958188)Attending the performance of the German -China Government's consultation meeting. The article pointed out that the differences between the Prime Minister's Palace and the Green Party's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are becoming more and more serious.

The report wrote in the introduction: Officially, the federal government is formulating a common Chinese strategy. However, in fact, the reconciliation policy of the Prime Minister conflicts with the economic policy of Deputy Prime Minister Habeck.

The article wrote at the beginning: "The Prime Minister is not good at excessive praise, but at the German Economic Forum last Tuesday, Shulz found a word of praise. He praised the German -China trade relationship in front of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang."

"Both parties benefit from each other's trade and investment," said the German Prime Minister. He praised Germany's direct investment of more than 100 billion euros in China, "remarkable".

The author pointed out: "This does not show a new tough attitude towards China. Even if it is a joint appearance before the Prime Minister's office, only guests from Beijing may be satisfied: [Reporters are not allowed to ask questions, Chinese media representatives obediently applauded obediently obediently . Make you in Berlin, it feels like in Beijing. "]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567)However, not everyone in the government treats things like the Prime Minister. Especially the Economic Minister of the Green Party Habeck. The article wrote: "For a while, Habeck has adopted another more stricter policy on China. This can be confirmed by the data obtained by" Ming Mirror ". It is reported that since he took office, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs has given it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs The guarantee amount of German companies invested in China has decreased by about 5 billion euros. "

Therefore, the article clearly states: "Officially, the federal government is formulating a common Chinese strategy, but in fact, it seems that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are not just pursuing one Chinese policy -but two types."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T13-55-00Z/65978445_401.jpg)The press conference of Li Qiang and Shulz does not allow reporters to ask questions

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Prime Minister's Palace in Germany

For example, the author said: "During the preparations for the discussion of the Chinese government last week, there have been differences in opinion. Forming a long -awaited document about Chinese strategy. However, the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not been able to reach an agreement on a common draft. The negotiations mainly revolved around the policy documents and how sharp attitude towards Beijing authorities should be. ","

Therefore, the German government's highly anticipated Chinese strategy document eventually failed to come out before the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Germany. "Mirror Weekly" revealed in the article: Now the participating departments no longer expect this document to complete this document before this summer. Habeck and Bell Berk defended Beijing and Taiwan's threatening behaviors to pursue more severe policy routes in Beijing and Taiwan. They always pointed out how the Communist Party oppressed ethnic minorities. The Social Democratic Party's attitude towards this is more relaxed, and it pays more attention to listening to the voices of the German industry and trade unions.

The article then carefully introduced how the German Ministry of Economic Affairs greatly reduced the efforts to issue government economic guarantees to German companies investing in China. At the end, he wrote: "The Minister of Economy is concerned about [economic policy guidance](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国外交政策-要价值观还是要利益/a-65529553)Essence The Prime Minister's office is suspicious of this. Although the Prime Minister has also talked about the "de -risk" of China, which reduces risk. But in actual operation, what does this mean, the German ruling alliance may erupt the next conflict -then, the league is actually in the center of the conflict. "

### Bavaria "Kings" met with Chinese Prime Minister

### Risk? Ready!

The "South Germany" also focuses on the "de -risk" in German Prime Minister Shulz's mouth in the latest reports on Germany and China. In an article entitled "Risk? Prepare!", The author asked in an inouting: "The relationship between the German economy and China is deep. Many companies have not tried their best to reduce their risks and are expanding its business scale. Why is this? "

At the beginning, the article introduced the "ice cream incident" that German car dealers recently encountered at the Shanghai Auto Show. Several Chinese staff on its small car brand MINI booth caused anger because they refused to distribute free ice cream to Chinese audiences. The author pointed out that this incident also made "BMW Automotive Manufacturers experience the boundaries between the opportunity and risk in China."

The article then asked: "This time it is ice cream, what will it be next time? For example, just take an example. If Beijing decides to attack Taiwan, it will trigger a huge sanctions and counter -tank chain reactions. What will happen? Relatively speaking, people's consensus at this point is that Western companies have only seen small wions from Russia. In China, hundreds of millions of euro assets in Western companies are in danger. Companies such as manufacturer Yingfei, or BMW, without the Chinese market, the scale will be reduced by one -third. It can be said that [For the German economy, China has the importance of relationships.](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国在哪方面依赖中国脱钩是否可行/a-65492863)"

The article pays attention to the "deductive risk" of "decoupled" statement to some extent. It is pointed out: "The" minimum risk 'can contain a lot of meaning, and the scope can be from 140 million euros to 10 billion euros. According to a survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, only 16%of companies have formulated plans for the situation. One People familiar with the matter said: In fact, there are almost no design plans for China to attack Taiwan. Few companies are preparing for this reason because of "unable to prepare for this'. But it may also be because people don't want to do it for this. Preparation. Because, just thinking of losing one -third of the business is enough to make people feel heavy. "

(Voice of Germany) The German Federal House finally passed a new draft of the reform of immigration law on Friday (June 23) to encourage more people outside the EU to work in Germany.

The left -winged Socialist Party (SPD) Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Friday morning to introduce government plans to the parliament that "this draft law will ensure the prosperity of Germany." However, she added that [only when the bureaucratic obstacles were demolished during the execution process, the plan would play a role](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国官僚体制让外国医师难执业/a-52993197)Essence She said: "If you must fill in 17 different application forms to allow new nursing staff to enter Germany, this is unacceptable."

The biggest opposition party -conservative CDU and CSU Alliance welcomed some of the government's ideas, although they criticized the plan to reduce the threshold of foreign workers. Andrea Lindholz from the Case of the Capitalism said that the plan to reduce the necessary German level will only attract low -tech workers.

Lyocz also believes that the new law does not help solve the main problems she said: bottleneck bottlenecks, such as the processing procedures for foreign consulates are too long.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T14-27-00Z/66010605_401.jpg)The Minister of the Interior Ferser said that the New Law will help ensure the prosperity of Germany

Norbertkleinwächter, the German Options Party (AFD), a member of the extremely right -wing populism, fiercely refutes the draft law, arguing that the government's plan will turn Germany into a "garbage country". "The content of this draft of this 100 -page legal can be summarized in one sentence," he said, "That is: everyone can go in, but no one can be driven away."

Lamyakaddor, the Green Party, refuted the criticism of the German Options Party, saying that it would not be the most important prerequisite for German work. She ironically asked the right -wing people of the House of Representatives: "When you have to speak German at work, your integration effect is the best -you noticed?". She said: "For this country, finally and finally have a real good news. In competition with other successful immigrant countries such as the United States or Canada, we have made some key progress."

The Liberal Democratic Party (FDP), which represents the new liberalist part of the German Government Three Party Alliance, emphasized the economic benefits they believe in the new law. "The ridiculous is that now in Germany, it is easier to enter the refugee asylum system than entering the employment market." Liberal Democratic Party Council Konstantin Kuhle said, "We are reversing this situation through this law."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T14-27-00Z/17647870_401.jpg)In the field of medical care, Germany is quite dependent on foreign immigrants

### New "Opportunity Card"

A major innovation of the law is to launch the "opportunity card" and its related points systems, allowing foreigners who have not found a job to find jobs for one year to find job opportunities. The prerequisite for obtaining the card is to have vocational qualifications or university degrees.

These cards will be issued to those who meet certain conditions, and they will get points: it may be German/English language skills, existing connections with Germany, and potential partners or spouses in German workers. The opportunity card also allows to engage in temporary work per week during the finding work and trial period.

### The job opportunity for refugees and tourists

Those who are waiting for asylum approval and submitting the application before March 29, 2023 will also be allowed to join the labor market if they have appropriate qualifications and job opportunities, which will also allow them to receive vocational training.

For those holding a tourist visa, there are similar changes: before they meet the employment requirements, they do not need to leave Germany first.

### New "Green Card", do you want to apply?

### changes in degree recognition

For a long time, one of the main obstacles to immigration is to have a degree in Germany. But in the future, if technical immigrants can prove that they have at least two years of professional experience and a degree recognized by the original state, their degree will no longer need to be recognized in Germany. Those who have obtained job opportunities can come to Germany in the process of obtaining their degree and start work.

### Naturalization method will also be reformed

In Parliament debate, Martin Rosemann, a member of the Social Democratic Party, looked forward to the future: "High -quality young people around the world have not actively came to work in Germany." He said, "We must attract them, we must give them a prospect. Why will we also reform the citizenship law. "

The technical immigration law is part of the Schilderz government's measure for non -German to stay in Germany to relax. At present, [the newly -citizenship law drafting will also make it easier for people from non -EU countries to obtain dual nationality -this is considerable Welcome to Germany's huge Turkish community](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国将大幅简化和加快外国人入籍程序/a-65676241) 。

The 61 -year -old YevGeny Prigozhin had served in the Soviet prison for nine years in prison for robbery and fraud, and then started to open a restaurant from a stall selling hot dogs, and developed into a food tycoon.

In the mid -1990s, Pritigen opened a high -end restaurant in St. Petersburg. The customer group included his fellow and then Vice Mayor Putin, then Saint Petersburg. Poligon also served meals for the Kremlin, so he was known as the "Putin chef".

![](Images/zaobao world/2023-06-24T15-36/000000.png)Putin (first from left) and the cello master MSTISLavrostropovich attended the dinner, Porigon (first from right) stood behind them. (the Internet)

In recent years, Pricig has made a lot of money in Africa's military forces in Africa, and has made a lot of money. The Financial Times reported in February that in the four years before the outbreak of the Russia and Ukraine War, Pricigo Ren alone earned 250 million US dollars in revenue through natural resources such as oil and gas, diamonds and gold in Africa and the Middle East.

In the Last year, Pricigen admitted that the mercenary Wagner Group was established after the war of Russia. The Wagner Group also became a well -known "patriotic" organization from the underground military regiment. Fnow and image.

However, the Wagner Group and Pryigor also became the nails of the military at the same time, and the struggle between the two sides was fierce.

After Russia controlled the town of Wudong Solidar in January this year, Pricigen said it was the credit of the Wagner Group and emphasized that no other troops participated.

The Russian Ministry of Defense did not mention the Wagner Group in the relevant announcement, and later admitted that Wagner had settled here. Porigen even blatantly criticized senior military officials such as the National Defense Minister, Hagu, and other senior military officials.

His style is also different from Russian generals. Russia's general was criticized to escape the battlefield, but Porigon often took a high -profile photo with the mercenaries of the Wagner Group on the front line.

In February of this year, he posted a video through social media. In the video, he sat in the cockpit of a Su-24 fighter, and invited Zeelianzki to "air duel" to the Ukrainian President Zelezki. Essence

![](Images/zaobao world/2023-06-24T15-36/000001.png)In February this year, Porigon sent a video in social media. In the video, he sat in the cockpit of a Su-24 fighter aircraft and invited Ukrainian President Zelezki to "air duel" with him. (Video screenshot)

He told Zerrenzki in the video: "We have landed. We bombed Bakhmut. Tomorrow, I will drive a MiG-29 fighter. If you want, let us see it in the sky. If you win, you win. If you win. You can get Bachurut. Otherwise, we will move to Dieber City. "

The US Institute of Non -profit Think Tank (ISW) believes that the Russian Ministry of Defense may be using the Wudong Bach Murut Campaign to consume Wagner's strength, weaken this organization, and prevent Pletig's influence from expanding its influence in the Kremlin.

Some analysts believe that the opposition to the military with the military may be one of Putin's strategies for all parties to check and balance all parties in China. Without Putin's acquiescence, Pricig may not dare to blame the military.

The relationship between Pricig's appointment with the Russian military and Putin was paid attention to the outside world before his mutiny. How does Purgon think of Pryigon, then reuse or abandon this chess piece. Essence

#### Movie Beauty Choosing Back to Western Emotions

It is generally believed that the Wagner Group, which was established by Perigo, was named from Hitler's favorite 19th -century German composer Richardwagner. It is said that "Wagner" is also Radio Call Sign, the first warfare commander of this organization, Dmitri Utkin.

In Russia, PRIVATE MilitiesCompany (PMC) is actually not recognized by law. Before the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, Perigo had repeatedly clarified the relationship with it, and it was not until last year that the organization was established. The Internet Water Army Organization, which was accused of intervention in the United States, was founded by the "Internet Research Agency".

At the end of last year, the Wagner Group opened a new headquarters and technology center in St. Petersburg. The Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported at the time that a joint -stock company called "PMC Wagner Center" was also registered in St. Petersburg, and Russia had not previously registered a legal entity registered in the name "Wagner".

Wagner has developed from a simple private military contractor to a group with complex business alliances and relationships, as well as many related companies. In addition to providing security and military services, it also involves mining, logging, protecting the team, monitoring customs, brewing, etc. Each can make money.

#### Passionate information in Africa to slander the democratic system to advocate the Russian authoritarian mode

It is also accused of collecting information and launching information for the Kremlin. Based on the survey of "ALL EYES Onwagner", Wagner has a team of political scientists who specialize in African issues.

Djibrilfofana, a consultant at the Blair Global Change Institute, said that the Wagner Group spreads false information in Africa through various methods such as showing publicity videos, cosmetic contests, and manufacturing fake videos. The system improves the attractiveness of the Russian authority model to African leaders.

The Wagner Group also made a movie. The "Best Inhell" released last year tells the Ukrainian war.

Politico survey shows that in the past few years, the Wagner Group has also tried to launch false information and political influence activities in EUBia and other EU countries to provoke anti -NATO and anti -Western emotions.

#### Vagna Group's rapid expansion in Africa is worrying

Some Western officials and experts believe that the rapid expansion of the Wagner Group in Africa is even more worrying compared to participating in the war in Ukraine. If it is not curbed, the organization may become a severe global threat in the future.

Russian President Putin delivered a TV speech to the country on Saturday (June 24).(https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230624-1407349)It is a traveler's behavior that warns that all those participating in the tradition will be regarded as traitors and severely punished.

Putin called for "unity" to say that the country would not have erupted the civil war and promised to protect the lives and security of the Russian people.

He emphasized that all the "necessary orders have been issued" in response to the crisis, and the capital Moscow and several other regions are now [Anti -terrorism mechanism](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230624-1407386)Essence

A senior consultant of Ukraine President Zelezi said, "" Everything happened in Russia has just begun "](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230624-1407390)Essence

The British Ministry of Defense said that the struggle with the head of the Wagner Group Pryigan has evolved into a direct confrontation and is the biggest challenge facing the Russian government in recent years.

The United States, Germany, France, and Poland are also paying close attention to the development of the situation.

The Russian satellite news agency recounted the full text of Putin's speech:

I now speak to the Russian citizens, to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and special organizations, and delivered a speech to fighters and commanders who are fighting for positions and repelled the enemy. The commander talked. I am now talking to those who are involved in crime adventures because of being deceived or threatened, and have been pushed into a felony (armed rebellion) road.

Russia is fighting for their future, and the aggression of new Nazis and its owners is repelled. In fact, it is against us the entire military, economic and information machines in the West. We are fighting for the lives and security of our people, the sovereignty and independence of our country, and to continue to be the rights of Russia to continue to be Russia, a country with a history of thousands of years.

This battle determines the fate of the people of our country. It needs to unite all forces. Everything that can weaken us, may be used and is being used by foreign enemies to disintegrate all disputes between us from the inside, and should be left aside.

Therefore, the splitting our unity is actually a betrayal of comrades -in -arms who are fighting at the front line. This is a knife behind our country and the people.

In 1917, Russia suffered such a blow. At that time, he was experiencing the First World War, but the victory was stolen. Conspiracy, quarrels, and playing rights behind the army and the people have evolved into a violent turbulence, the army is paralyzed, the state is divided, and the large territory is lost, which eventually leads to a tragedy of civil war.

The Russians killed the Russians, and the brothers killed their brothers, while various political adventurers and foreign forces seek private interest through splitting the country.

We will not let this situation repeat again. We will protect our people and our country's status without any threats, including internal betrayal.

What we encounter is exactly betrayal. Excessive ambitions and personal interests have caused betrayal, betrayed their country, their people, and fighting side by side with other troops in my country. The liberation of Soledal and Altoohvsk, the heroes of the city of Baths and the villages and towns, fighting for the new Russia, fighting for the unity of the Russian world, and presented life. Their reputation and glory were also betrayed by those people who tried to organize rebellion and pushed the country to an anarchy state, and the people who failed to fail and eventually surrendered.

I repeat it again. Any civil strife is a fatal threat to our country and a fatal threat to our nation. This is a blow to Russia and our people. We defend the motherland to avoid this threat. All those who deliberately embarked on the road of betrayal, all those who are preparing to armed rebellion, the road of extortion and terrorist means, will be punished, assumed legal responsibilities, and responsibilities to the people of our country.

Armed forces and other government agencies have received necessary orders. Moscow, Moscow and other places are taking additional counter -terrorism measures. It will also take decisive actions to stabilize the situation on Rostov on the banks of the river. The situation in the area is still difficult, and the work of administrative and military organs has almost been blocked.

As the Russian citizen and the highest commander, the most Russian citizen, I will do my best to defend the country, maintain the constitutional system, and defend the life, safety and freedom of citizens.

Those who organized and planned for armed rebellions, raised their weapons to comrades -in -arms, betrayed Russia, and they would pay for it. And they tried to get involved in the crime, I called on these people not to commit deadly, miserable, and non -repeated mistakes, and make the only correct choice -stop participating in criminal actions. I believe that we will be able to protect and defend the valuable and sacred things for us, and to overcome all the tests with the motherland and become more powerful.
