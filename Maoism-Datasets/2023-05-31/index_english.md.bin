### Who supports "Wu Tong" Taiwan? What do you say about a poll for interviewees in mainland China?

May 30, 2023![] [](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-30T02-45-10.000Z/_129898538_whatsubject.jpg)** In May of this year, the well -known English journal "Journal of Contemporarychina" published a relevant poll for more than 1,800 Chinese citizens against "martial arts" Taiwan. The research survey showed that the respondents expressed only 55%of the "Wu Tong" Taiwanese in Beijing, and 33%of the respondents did not agree to unify Taiwan by force. The results of polls caused public opinion discussion. **

In fact, the Chinese people's views on cross -strait issues have always been rare because of sensitivity. Therefore, the research on academic polls published in recent years has caused continuous attention. The two authors of the latest research were ADAMY (ADAMY. Li) Assistant Professor of Singapore National University and Li Xiaoyan, an associate professor of Shanghai Branch of New York University.

[Poll report](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2023.2209524)Liu Yao, one of the author, told BBC in Chinese, "The most important discovery is that the mainland people have a relatively large tolerance for solving the Taiwan problems, not as much as expected. In other words, the research results show that the research results show that the results show that the research results show that Wu Tong did not receive overwhelming support among the interviewees.

At the moment when cross -strait situations are tight and US -China relations, related investigations have attracted attention from all parties. The two authors also mentioned the results of the study at the end of the thesis or that the U.S. decision makers can realize that for most Chinese respondents, there is no clock that immediately send troops to martial arts.

"Self -work five" refers to the rise of patriotic bloggers posing volunteer on the Internet. In Chinese social media, the rise of the "self -employed five" group is closely related to China's nationalist wave in recent years.

Wang Hongen, assistant professor of the Department of Political Science at Las Vegas, University of Nevada University in the United States, told BBC in Chinese when analyzing the results of the polls that one of the conclusions of this article is that Chinese citizens with a high degree of education are more supported by martial arts. In the past, the research of other scholars was the same **, and the Chinese people, which are the top of the social class, will be consistent with the official publicity caliber in polls.

Wang Hongen, who has long been engaged in political and polical investigations and research, added, "But there are some hidden concerns. After all, 55%are still more than half numbers, which means that even if China is suddenly democratized, Taiwan may still be under threat."

Liu Yao also emphasized to other media that the survey conveyed the only choice that most interviewees believed by the "unity of force" to Beijing Zhongnanhai. The gentle cross -strait policy can also be accepted.

### "Wu Tong" polls

The research survey of Liu Yao was conducted through online options. The sampling interviewees are all over China, from different ages, income and gender interviewees. The survey is conducted from the end of 2020 to the beginning analyze. Interviewees do not include Chinese citizens living overseas.

However, like all political polls, because of the number of samples, problem orientation or analysis methods, etc., will affect the final statistical data analysis results. Generally speaking, small -scale sampling research does not represent everyone, but it is necessary to achieve accurate statistics and analysis, and provide accurate numbers from the sample to the outside world.

The CCP celebrates the Centennial Conference of the Party.

For example, Liu Yao explained to the BBC in Chinese, and the questionnaire problem particularly emphasized that Taiwan has not announced "Taiwan independence", and "without a major 'Taiwan independence" incident, "the interviewees did not think that" martial arts "was imminent. Even if the Chinese government chooses to maintain the status quo, it does not necessarily lose points. "

"We did not design some special situations in the questionnaire, such as the Taiwan authorities touched the" Anti -split State Law "in the mainland." He added.

In response to why the questionnaire results "only" 55%of people support "martial arts", Wang Hongen told BBC in Chinese that this may be related to the questionnaire design. He said that because the question volume asked, "Whether it is to be in martial arts in 2024", and the time point for issuing a questionnaire was when the new crown pneumonia was raged in 2021. "At that time, many Chinese people might feel that there was no time to be free or 2024 2024. The year is too close. I think if you ask -whether you will always abandon the force to attack Taiwan, the numbers may be different. "

This questionnaire designed five different "unified Taiwan" methods, including force attacking Taiwan or economic coercion. The results showed that only 55%of the respondents supported a comprehensive war against Taiwan, but only 1%of the most extreme options, that is, directly war. Other options, including 58%of the "Military Operations launched in Taiwan"; "Implementing economic sanctions on Taiwan" has a 57%support rate. "Maintain the status quo, strengthen the economy and military strength until the unity" is 57%.What do between China and the United States start a problem about the people of Taiwan and Taipei?

In addition, 22%of the interviewees said "acceptance", 71%said "acceptance", 7%of the respondents were "accepted", 7%indicated "uncertainty". The Hong Kong media "South China Morning Post" pointed out that 22 % of the respondents who are highly sensitive in China have said that "the two sides of the strait do not have to be unified", which is surprising.

### The higher the education level, the more supported the "Wu Tong"?

Liu Yao also told the BBC Chinese that the survey also found that the high -age, men and education levels highly supported Zhongnanhai to use intense means to deal with Taiwan issues, including "martial arts".

One of the explanations estimated by the survey is that the older Chinese people have gradually disappeared, and they hope to see the Taiwan problem in a lifetime in a lifetime, rather than continue to wait. However, in any case, the researchers believe that the results of the survey challenged the mainstream discussions of Beijing to some extent, that is, "recovering Taiwan is almost every Chinese collective will."

Wang Hongen told BBC Chinese. In fact, in recent years, in China ’s research on the frontier journal" Contemporary China ", the research on" Wu Tong Public Opinion "published by different scholars has similar research results.

For example, in 2022, the research group of South China University of Science and Technology in China, in 2019, visited Chinese citizens in 1729 coastal cities through mobile phones, and found that 58%of respondents supported military forces to attack Taiwan. Moreover, men, income and education are high, have contact with Taiwanese, believe that the Chinese economy is better than Taiwan, and supports "Wu Tong Taiwan".

Wang Hongen believes that [this study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2022.2107390?fbclid=IwAR1An28wn3aSUvt-2bvPeEIBdXINrD5fPLbVDY9tYLPnw-8oK6FSGRVcnvA&journalCode=cjcc20)It also shows that Beijing has the public opinion of Wu Tong Taiwan. There is a top -down process, which appears to the level of education: "And war wolf diplomacy also echo the opinion of group people with resources in China."

Taiwan has 23 million people.

In addition, in 2017, three Taiwanese scholars published a [Research] in cooperation with the Peking University Contemporary China Research Center.(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2017.1274835?journalCode=cjcc20)It shows that 51.6%of the Chinese people interviewed by the people supported "the faster the unity, the better", and 28.8%of the respondents accepted the unification of "slowly." However, only 6%of the respondents chose "Wu Tong", and 82.1%supported negotiation.

The study also claims that the interviewees think that the cities they live in Taipei are more advanced than Taipei, or the more they feel that the backward group in Taipei wants to be unified as soon as possible and martial arts in Taiwan.

The study was collected in 2013 to use a computer -assisted telephone survey system. In 10 cities including Beijing, Chongqing, Harbin, Shenzhen, and Shanghai, the sample mobile phone number visited 2,000 Chinese urban residents who were over 18 years old.

Professor Wang Hongen said that although the survey sample could not represent all the Chinese people, it was a small number of people who could do across provinces and were large -scale public opinion surveys, and the interviewees had diverse backgrounds.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-30T03-55-01-00-00/000181982_piclink.jpg)The China-Central Asian Summit held in Xi'an this month was the first home conference in China this year. Because the meeting was the same as the G7 meeting held in Hiroshima, Japan, many Western media interpreted it as China to use the Central Asian Summit to confront the G7. In fact, this is just a coincidence. From the perspective of the status and role of the place, it cannot be compared with the six other western powers other than the United States, so it is impossible to talk about China to fight with the G7. But you can't underestimate this meeting.

There are actually two contents of this summit held by China and Central Asia. One is to talk about the leaders of the four countries in China and the five countries. The two sides issued a joint statement or declaration respectively to enhance bilateral relations. The "China -Central Asian Summit Xi'an Declaration" was published, and China also released a list of results of the summit separately to take stock of the specific results achieved by the summit.

** Pita Limjaroenrat is not a typical Thai politician. **

The average age of Thai Cabinet Ministers is 65 years old, and respect for the elders is still a precious tradition, and Pitta Linjialla is very young (it looks much younger than the actual 42 -year -old) and does not conceal my confidence. Essence

The "MoveForward" led by his leadership leader has led other political parties in the recent election, which is shocking. He will become the youngest prime minister in 1978, which shocked conservative political institutions that ruled Thailand most of the time.

The Thai party has won every election in Thailand since 2001 and is expected to win the election on May 14.

Both the Thai party and the Qianjin Party believe that they are progressive political parties, and oppose military intervention in politics like a coup in 2014. The coup overthered the Thai government.

However, the young activist of the APPC, Zhisheng Old Party, and defeated many candidates of the party. With imaginative, social media -based campaigns, they provided voters with the opportunity to completely break in the past and different in the past. Political leadership.

"I'm different," Peita told me. "We formed the joint government to seek a measure of power or to make me a prime minister. I serve the people in the government. The world has changed.

"I don't need to be a strong man. With a poisonous man, to ensure that‘ people must listen to me, I must always be the person in the spotlight ’.

"I don't need to keep perfect. I can ride motorcycles like ordinary people in Thailand and eat on the street like others."

Pitta was born in a wealthy Thai family.

He was in New Zealand when he was in his teens. He later studied graduate students in the United States. After graduating, he went to work in family rice bran companies, and as an executive in a car company Grab. These experiences all affected his character.

He appreciated the down -to -earth leaders, such as Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand and Josjos Mujica, Josjos "Pepe".

The Ahead of the Communist Party has the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Thai elections.

The party announced 300 policies, including promoting an equal marriage of the Thai LGBTQ population, ending the recruitment, solving business monopoly issues, and reforming education systems to adapt to the 21st century economy.

The party plans to abolish the constitution drafted by the military and put many commercial interests under the Ministry of Finance.

Pitta said: "It's time to end the military coup loop, and it is time to end political corruption that opened the door to the coup."

However, the party's most controversial proposal is to modify the "lèse Majesté Law" and began to discuss the relationship between the monarchy and the Thai people. The law was imprisoned for a long -term person who was sentenced to insulted royal family.

Among the 250 senators, many people said that they would prevent the "advanced party" candidate as the Prime Minister because of this problem. These senators are appointed by the former military government. According to regulations, they must participate in parliament voting to select the next Prime Minister.

"The emotions of that era have changed," Pita said.

"I think we can now be able to mature and tolerate the monarchy. Even conservatives understand what role should the constitutional monarchy in the 21st century."

"We won 14 million votes. They understood that this was clear and transparent. This is one of the agenda we want to promote."

The leader of the advanced party believes that his alliance currently has 312 seats in the 500 seats in the lower courtyard of the parliament, and will receive the support of 64 senators, so that they can get the absolute majority of they need.

However, internal sources inside the Senate said that as long as the advanced party is committed to modifying the "monarchy", this will be difficult to achieve; but at least some senators, their non -election term is only one year, and one of them is opposed to one of the elections in the election. The obvious alliance feels uneasy.

Pita also promised to adopt new foreign policies.

In the past 10 years, under the leadership of the military government, Thailand has been generally believed that it has not played its due role in international affairs. Prime Minus Chan-OCHA is not interested in foreign policy.

"Of course, we need more contact with the international community," Pita said.

"We must re -balance. We must shout loudly that we must stand on the side of the world order based on rules. Without speaking, there is no weight in foreign policy."

"Many of our problems, whether it is economic problems, air pollution, or the price of chemical fertilizers, from other parts of the world."

这位年轻的候任总理面临着令人生畏的挑战。

一方面是持怀疑态度的参议院，另一方面是需要与为泰党达成协议。为泰党只比进步党少赢得10个席位，而且其团队中有更多经验丰富的谈判代表。

为泰党一直要求获得最高职位，以及有权力的国会议长的职位。皮塔认为，要想让他的许多新法案获得通过，这个职位是优先考虑的。

他的政党主要由首次当选的议员组成，其中一些人年龄太小，达不到担任部长的35岁门槛，还有一些人因过去的政治活动仍面临严重的刑事指控。

为泰党在意识形态上更加灵活，对君主制采取不干涉的态度，可以选择加入另一个联盟，该联盟包括即将离任的政府中的政党。

前进党排除了这种妥协，该党通过承诺不与将军们做交易赢得了许多选票。

皮塔认为，两党都不能放弃他所称的梦想和希望联盟，因为这会损害他们的声誉。

他轻松地承担着这些责任，仍然抽出时间与家人在一起，对事情会解决持轻松乐观的态度。

他告诉我：“我不想像其他泰国政客一样，七八十岁还在为职位而战。”

“我想再干十年，然后就该干点别的了。”

Essence This decision has not yet been implemented.

In addition, sources said that the two ministries and commissions may also recommend the Indian Commodity and Service Taxation Committee to reduce the commodity and service tax (GST) of photovoltaic boards, from 12%to 5%in 2021.

These measures will help Indian photovoltaic energy giants such as TATA POWER, Adani Green, and Vikramsola. Despite the contract for photovoltaic energy supply, they are facing the situation of local equipment shortage.

### Inhibit China's import strengthening renewable energy autonomy

In April 2022, India levied 40%of tariffs on imported photovoltaic boards, imposed 25%tariffs on photovoltaic batteries, thereby suppressing imports from China. Indian Prime Minister Modi hopes to strengthen its own renewable energy.

However, a source said that the production capacity of India is lagging behind and needs to be imported to fill the gap.

### European dependence on China's solar industry is about to end?

Modi hopes to achieve the goal of installing 365 MW optical power energy from 2031-2032. India is advancing a series of green energy movements from electric vehicles to sustainable aviation fuel.

At present, India's annual photovoltaic capacity is 32 MW, but with the rise in business and industrial demand, the demand for green low -cost energy is 52 MW.

A government official said that the "expected to be nearly 8-10 MW per year" in the next two years of the team's photovoltaic board.

### Jiucheng Photovoltaic Board once came from China

Government data shows that from 2021 to 2022, India imported a photovoltaic board worth $ 3 billion, of which 92%came from China. Sources said that tax reduction measures are expected to reduce the cost of imported photovoltaic boards by one -fifth, which is close to the price of products produced in India.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-30T13-51-00-04-00/000000.png)On May 17, 2023, the signs of the laughing fruit talk show outside a theater in Shanghai. Agence France-France-France-France-France-France-France-France-France-A-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/Tengbiao/TB 05302313339.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/tengbiao/tb-05302023132339.html/@@stream)A talk show actor was banned indefinitely because of a joke and was investigated by the police. This is a joke in the endless jokes of the Chinese Communist Party every day.

Li Haoshi(House)To describe wild dogs with "excellent style and can win the battle", it is quite humorous in the contemporary Chinese context. On this magical land in China, the actors were completely absent and did not dare to laugh at the army. However, they were reported and launched into the "insulting" people's Liberation Army. The huge fines were suspended and performed. Netizens said, "A diplomat does not represent the country to speak to the French media, and the Chinese government is not responsible for; but an actor tells a joke, but the company has to take responsibility."

When I left China in the second year of Qingfeng, China has not yet talk about things like a talk show. It is similar to a single cross talk, but it is not the same thing. What is called a talk show in China is not Talk Show, but StandupComedy. It is more accurate to call a single comedy or standing comedy. This stuff has not come early or late, and it is unexpected when a government regime wants to come serious. From the Jianghu era, which China has entered the new era of Xi Jinping's thought of "entering the mind into the soul", Zeitgeist is different from the time. ?

It can be an oversized producer of a joke. In today's world where AI and AV are so developed, autocracy itself is a joke. In order to maintain the excuses for their own rule without election, in order to maintain a great, glorious, and correct image, they must tamper with history and decorate reality. Therefore, it is impossible not to make a joke. "People's Daily" reported in 1966 that Mao Zedong traveled to the Yangtze River, deducting Shunliu help, and the 73 -year -old Mao Demon's speed was far beyond the world record. According to the official report of Lei Feng's picking up dung, there are bad netizens from the time of picking up the feces, the weight of each feces, the time of shovel and the basket, and the time to find the next dung is 2.8 seconds; Lei Feng, who is not good at his own specialty, must be in the pit!Huang Jiguang blocked the gun eye, put the pot, pans into a small blast furnace and large steel, produced 10,000 pounds per mu, broken four old, fierce words, and reported to report late -which laugh star can make such a big stalk? The Red Guards came to the Baiwei Bing. The urban management did not come to the agricultural management, and returned farmland to the forest to get back to the forest to return to the forest. It is not ridiculous enough to call for three babies to give birth to three babies, and the real -name system of kitchen knives went to Thailand to abduct Swedish citizens? Dr. Xi Jinping, who loves the name of the book, reads "commonly speaking farmers" as "uniforms in business", changed the name of King Gesar to King Sagel, hung his photos into the temple church, and closed the bears Viban , Also go to the masses to lift the lid at home, can you hold back and laugh? President Xi carried two hundred pounds of wheat without changing his shoulders. Chairman Kim Il Sung throwing a stone casually shot down a US satellite -the autocratic regime was the king of burst stalks in the four lights. Please raise your hand if you disagree?

Joke to eliminate autocracy. Comedy and authoritarian are born with a pair ... Nonjin. The autocracy must be pretended to be a great, serious, and truthfulness, and the power is in hand, the sacred and inviolability. The instincts of comedy are mixed. Regardless of what gods, emperors, wealth, truth, historical laws, authoritative science, traditional customs, all of you have become a material for irony, ridicule, spoofing, and elimination. In various types of comedy forms, monocular comedy (talk show) is also described as "offensive art". Under totalitarian, it can be called "the art of death." Comrade George Orwell, who saw the bottom pants of the power system for many years in advance, said: "What annoyed the existing order is funny. Every joke is a miniature revolution." Liu Xiaobo, who was buried without burial, also wrote Over, "the politics that is popular in the folk in private, it means that most of the conscience of silence is not unsatisfactory, and it also highlights the rotten of the foundation of the totalitarian system in public opinion." When the emperor shook his buttocks on the street, the audience There is a laughes and even the child who tells the truth. It's not a good paragraph without any provocation.

The review and reconstruction of a joke for autocracy have never stopped. The crosstalk, sketches, comedies and emerging talk shows under the autocracy of the Communist Party of China have almost completely lost their political critical function, and social criticism is often trembling, because social problems are also easy to be launched as political issues. Most comedies simply avoid political and social criticism. They can only find jokes in terms of marriage, family, gender, stars and other aspects. What's more common is to point the irony who is ridiculous to the weak. According to my long -term observation of Chinese comedy, there are very few comedy works that do not dig and discriminate against the weak. The most common is discrimination against poor people, rural people, physical workers, and disabled people. It is also common for those who have poor appearance, ethnic minorities, women, elderly people, and black people. What's more, there are a large number of comedy "art" that is not critical and praised, such as the Acura, the main melody comedy, and the touting crosstalk. In a normal society, the taunt of talk shows is often a senior official, star, rich, and powerful; it is an existing political system, social structure, religious belief and ideology. However, under the autocracy, the consequences are serious. "Don't look at you are so happy today, be careful to pull the list in the future." The thought police always smell sensitive, excellent style, and can win the battle.

The best application for global manuscript fees. One month after the Constitution of the Emperor Xi of Xi, the "connotation paragraph" of the short video and joke paragraph application that the people liked to see, and was permanently shut down by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television because of "infertility and vulgarity". In 2019, the young cartoonist Zhang Dongning was sentenced to one year for "crime of provoking trouble" because of the human comics of pig heads. In 2020, the genius Uyghur talk show star Cam was arrested and was banned after being released. In 2020, the American handsome guy, rapper and comedian Lele Fulipin played the Bear Pooh, and Xi Jinping, who missed the party and the leader of the country, seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and was immediately blocked by the entire network. In 2023, Meng Chuan was closed due to supporting white paper movements on Weibo. "Uncle Roger" was blocked by the Chinese government for a period of ridicule of the Chinese government and the Chinese government's performance in Taiwan. Chi Zi was blocked by China ’s entire network after his tour in North America. "Never allow the Communist Party's meals and smash the Communist Pot." In fact, no matter who you eat, you have to dare to smash the Communist pot, and the Communist Party will let you taste the power of Xi Jinping's new era of socialist iron fist. Everyone is serious!The General Secretary is going to be funny. The highest instructions: can only be told, not to smash the pot.

The totalitarian language is tasteless, the black and white upside down of totalitarian thought, the pretentiousness of the art of totalitarian art, the rudeness and false emptiness of the totalitarian culture, making it difficult for anyone who has independent thinking and aesthetic ability. When I was in the wall of the wall, I wrote a lot of articles, one of which was called "Change China by Chinese", which made extremely vicious attacks on the "Party News Society" and "News Broadcasting". "The governance of writing and speaking is achieved through the physical and spiritual governance of language users. In order to transform memory, instill ideas, and prevent independent writing, a comprehensive governance project of a strong cleaning language is required: the unit system of intellectuals, the unit system of intellectuals, Entry censorship, model literature, main theme, Chinese textbooks, political examinations, associations, text prisons, and writers and speakers. People can only speak wrong, want to speak, and point out, pointing in Sang Huai, turning corners, and ambiguous ... "But I guessed that the beginning, but did not guess the ending: When the party's ideal refers to the deer, who says" turning corners, finger mulberry scolding "? Not to mention that Sang scolded Huai, do you try a piece of white paper on the square? (Do you think I don't know what you want to write?)

I dare to bet on 8966 yuan, and Li Haoshi did not mean to insult the People's Liberation Army at all. But this is not important. If you have it, you have it, there is no. The key is that a serious vocabulary is used on the wrong things. This commonly used humor will inevitably conflict with the pretending of a serious system. By creatively using language, it can be used to imitate, spoof, collage, graffiti, deformation, exaggeration, and reversal on the tall things. This can be said to be the instinct of comedians and even all writers and artists. The talk show is inevitable, because no matter how you review yourself, your instincts can't hide it. The Communist Party's heart is that "it is important not to me." Data show that from 2020-2022, the talk show industry with a dancing of footsteps, the ticket warehouse increased from 20 million to 480 million, turning 24 times. The topic of "talk show" on Douyin exceeded 34.6 billion, and the topic of the fast -handed "talk show" played over 3.1 billion. Free eggs: One of the rules of Chinese totalitarian politics is probably that it is more popular than news webcasts and cannot be on the news network. It is not far from the iron fist that has suffered from the people's democratic dictatorship.

I want to comfort Li Haoshi, who was caught: "The breeze is not literate, so why not flip the book" is a harmless and interesting poem of humans and animals. However, in the eight years of Yongzheng, the author Xu Jun was reported to have a rebellious heart. Dare to ridicule the rulers of the Qing Dynasty? Cut your head!Chinese talk show actors think about it. Should you thank Huang En in the mighty?

Behind the ban on the talk show, it is not so much the madness of the authoritarian system, it is better to be the fear of the autocratic system. They are afraid of paragraphs, they are afraid of punk rock, they are afraid of tank -shaped cakes, they are afraid of Vini Bear, they are afraid of 8 multiplication 8. They are afraid of Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Chair, they are afraid of dinner, they are afraid of making soy sauce, so what else do we have?

The recent issue of feminism in New York was open wheat, and Li Haoshi's wild dogs were invited to the stage. It first complained that "all the wild dogs are not surnamed Zhao". , Wild Dogs finally stood up: Covering the mouth with a talk show, isn't that "Divine Show"? Then I jumped up the hot striptea dance, European cake, this can be available!The Central Propaganda Department looked at this paragraph, is it going to be angry, or do you have to laugh? I guess, I want to laugh and dare not laugh. Now you understand how much they want to open the police to Manhattan. ___

According to a press release issued by the Public Affairs Department of the U.S. Indo -Pacific Command on May 30, the U.S. Indo -Pacific Command issued a statement on the US military aircraft in the South China Sea unprofessional interception of US military aircraft.

The statement stated that on May 26, a People's Republic of China J-16 fighter pilots performed unnecessary radical actions while intercepting the US Air Force RC-135 aircraft in the South China Sea. The Chinese pilot flew directly to the RC-135's head, forcing American planes to fly through its tail turbulence. According to international law, RC-135 is flying safe and routine in the South China Sea International Airship.

The statement said that the United States will continue to fly, navigate, and move safely within the scope permitted by international law. The United States India -Pacific Union will continue to fly in the international airspace, and at the same time consider the safety laws of all ships and aircraft stipulated in international law.

This reporter sent an email to the Chinese Embassy in the United States for a review. The relevant personnel of the Embassy News and the Public Foreign Division transferred to the Chinese Embassy in the United States to praise and the embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu.

"It is recommended that you know from the competent authorities. I want to point out that for a long time, the United States has frequently traveled to China to close the reconnaissance of China, which has a serious threat to China's national security. U.S. provocations and dangerous actions are the root causes of maritime security issues. China urges the United States to stop such dangerous provocations and stop shaking the pot. China will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and security, one country in the same region, and firmly maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.

Hello, I am a middle school student. I have been in contact with the Internet earlier. In my fifth grade of my elementary school, I learned to turn over the wall for the first time and saw the world of freedom outside the wall. At that time, Google, Wikipedia and YouTube were a must -see website for me to turn over the wall. Gradually, I gradually saw the objectiveness and two -sided nature of many high -quality creators on these platforms. And learned about the unknown June 4th movement of peers. Since then, I have begun to publicize the bad crimes of China and the Communist Party, and led them to gradually understand the truth about China.

========

After I was 00, when I was in junior high school, a friend joked that he went to Tiananmen to take the tank and pressed you. He did not say that he said, and I just remember this sentence. Later, every June martial law, and then the QQ group talked often bombarded the group, and probably learned about this from the vague description of the group.

Of course, the most dramatic is how I took the initiative to search for information. I watched the live broadcast at station B. Generally, the anchor opened the live broadcast mode to prevent the bombers from. The live broadcast mode will turn the opponent's nickname into a character name+a series of numbers. That day, the killing information in the upper right corner suddenly showed the power boy#8964. As a result, the live broadcast room was immediately blocked. I felt absurd and had a curiosity, and I checked on the relevant historical knowledge.

============

After I was born in the Inner Mongolia area of the mainland, I knew that the 64 incident was told by junior high school classmates. He said that his grandfather classmate had participated in the 64 days of the Annmen incident before. The Communist Party killed many people. Surprising, tell you when you come back. At the beginning, I did not believe that the "Great Communist Party" would do such a thing. Later, because playing games, I needed to register the Google account, learned to turn over the wall after various online surfing, and knew that youTube and other software were searched for the first time. The 64th day incident, and knew that Falun Gong was persecuted. The Communist Party said better than singing. It is the real Nazi party. I hope the Communist Party will fall down soon.

============

I am a student studying in China International School. I never know that our government will make such anti -human atrocities, but there are no windy walls in the world. Even if there are firewalls, history and facts will never be covered. Essence

The historical books of Chinese international textbooks will be controlled, and even some cities do not allow academic history (AP, A Level, or IB course) Our history books will be collected as soon as it starts, and it will be returned to us after a month. Our book is affixed with a variety of seals. Driven by curiosity, I and my classmates carefully torn out the seal in the book. When I saw the content about China, I saw a picture: A man stood in front of the tank to block the tank. My classmates and I were shocked. Under our understanding, we started to read the content, and we found that we have been drumped by our government. We have never written such anti -human rights atrocities in history. After we talked about this content in the classroom and held the book with a torn seal in our hands, our teacher walked into the classroom. He saw the book in our hands torn out the seal. He was very angry at the time. I sent the principal's room with my classmates and gave us punishment and let us write a review.

I finally downloaded VPN to see the news and documentaries of BBC and RFA completely understood the truth of the matter. I do n’t understand why I go to understand the truth of history, but I have to be punished? Why does our government cover the facts? I am really disappointed with my government now, and I hate their hypocrisy.

==========

Everyone of Liberty Asia, hello, I am a post -05, born in 2006, can be said to be quite young. For the first time, I learned that the matter of June 4 was in 2020. At that time, Wuhan pneumonia was raging, and my new year in my hometown ended in advance. In the early days of the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, I had doubts about the government. What was completely changed is the Red Cross. I completely lost trust in the Chinese government and the CCP. About February day, I communicated with a netizen's view of the CCP government. He accidentally mentioned the Tiananmen incident. At that time, he was more vague. I remembered that my mother and I talked about the student parade of Tiananmen Square. Google searched the June 4th incident. After watching Wikipedia, I felt unhappy, and listened to the VOA and the BBC documentary. They studied the June 4th and told my classmates at the school. It is estimated that there are hundreds of people who know from me.

========

I am a college student in 2003. The rumors of "Deng Xiaoping tanks crushed students". This incident was widely circulated in our hometown, but no one can tell a complete story, that is, everyone knows that they don't know. When I was a kid, I heard that my family and relatives talked together. At that time, I was curious. From a young age, the CCP has instilled in our children and adolescents. The June 4th shocked me very much, and indirectly made me interested in politics. When I was 18 years old, there was a classmate who had a good relationship. He studied stock trading. When he studied the economy, he would turn over the wall more or less. Under his influence, I also turned over the wall. I can't help but feel nauseous in Wikipedia, oil pipes, and Twitter. Destroy the Chinese Communist Party, June 4th Yinghun Soul is immortal!Intersection Intersection

====================

First of all, I want to invite you to see a link in front of the screen: [https://yibaochina.com/?p=250376](https://yibaochina.com/?p=250376)(Back of the world).

This link is an article that I voted for the online journal "Report" and was published by the editorial department.

In fact, like the two -year -old Yue Ying (Yue Jinan) in the story, I also received a money -saving can with a password on the 8th birthday of "198964". Although I didn't know what it meant at that time, after experiencing the baptism of time, this number of numbers had been deeply engraved in my cerebral cortex. This is the initial memory of June 4th.

At the age of 16, I converted to Christ. Later, the yin and yang was wrong. After more than a year, I heard the June 4th experienceder in a WeChat public account, the evidence of Rev. Zhang Bozhen (Zhang Bozhen, a one of the 21 students who was wanted at the time. , Ranked 17th).

At this time, I only learned that there was a real thing that happened, which had been erased by my motherland from the history books ... (Selected)

============

Originally, I knew nothing about this, and the elders at home have never mentioned it. Until the year of the Chief Executive's Q & A Conference, Chang Mao Liang Guoxiong asked how Zeng Yinquan evaluated the June 4th incident. It was strange that the radio and television examiner at that time had forgotten to cover this picture. I remember that Zeng Yinquan only just said that the economy has made great development in the past years. It is from this inadvertent "mistake". I started to understand this historical event. Since then, my position has begun to change and move closer to liberals.

==========

In a foreign language high school student, when he was on the first year, he learned to turn over the wall game and download some international games. He did not understand political things. After a while, Twitter was Twitter. For the first time, it was 6.3. Because of the well -known political education in the wall, I joined the Pink Army without deep understanding, and started a year of fighting with*Mida*. With the deepening of cognition, the epidemic, unreasonable policies, and the reading of books, I gradually learned about June 4th from many aspects. Although students are objective, the government is indeed full of dumplings and devils. I realize the darkness of the CCP government. About the third grade, I introduced and discussed the June 4th of the people around me. More students did not know. I can say that there is no subjective instilling. Just putting on an objective fact is enough to make the students realize the dark side of the CCP. I have played BBC videos and had mark in school. The high school entrance examination was smooth. I still insisted on high school and found that there were more friends with the same cognition in the province's top high school. We talked about politics in English corners and read the books of thinkers and philosophers in the library. There are traces of commemorative June 4th. I helped many people to understand the country objectively and rationally, and also witnessed the changes of my classmates during the epidemic. I was moved by my classmates' confidence in the future of light.

========

I am not a post -00s, I am from the 90s and 91st years. I know that my history teacher told me when I was in junior high school. She said that the Communist Party was not what the news network said at all, and the hands of the Communist Party were covered with the blood of the people. At the beginning of the two thousand years, China's ideological control was not so strict. Junior high school textbooks also mentioned in June 4th. I clearly remembered that "a serious political storm occurred in my country in 1989", which was such a sentence.

After school, I went home and asked my dad, what was the situation in June 4th. My dad told me that in the 1980s, the Renaissance of the Renaissance in China. At that time, everyone loved literature and music, and the free thoughts rose unprecedentedly until the June 4th. My parents have participated in work in 89 years (non -Beijing). My mother was a teacher. She told me that when she was in June 4th, some people came to school to encourage teachers to let primary and secondary students get up.

At that time, Internet control was not as crazy now. You can go to YouTube in China, but some keywords are blocked. But I still saw a lot of videos about June 4th on YouTube. I also knew Liu Xiaobo, Worth Kaixi, Wang Dan and others.

This incident had a great impact on me at the time. I discovered that the Communist Party's lies and spared no effort to maintain my rule. At the same time, I felt sad for the students of the year. It was my first life that I felt like a living life disappeared.

Now that Xi Jinping's governance, China can easily return to that horror era, because Xi Jinping is a dictator, and there are only two types of dictators in the world -one is the old death, and the other is to be killed. I believe Xi Jinping does not want to be killed, so he will use his exhaustion to consolidate his dominant position. He will definitely allocate interests to his political allies to ensure that his party's status.

========

My cognitive transformation comes from the ban on various foreign software in 2018. Because professional learning needs must be turned over the wall to use a certain software, at the time, I learned to learn the wall seriously after class. From a young age, it has become an anti -Communist. This period of time was in the first half of 2019, but at that time, our understanding of CCP was not in -depth, because some things seemed to be particularly exaggerated and I couldn't believe it. We did not do too much. think. Until June, friends of our club told me that Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan international students had to concentrate on June 4th to organize movies and snacks (compulsory). I was very puzzled at the time? So I went to the outer network to search for relevant information to understand the real history, and then the CCP pushed the National Security Law and the Hong Kong people's parade in Hong Kong. I started to pay attention to the news of Hong Kong every day since June. Come on, Hong Kong people are more worried, because I know that CCP has no bottom line. I watched Hong Kong people fight for democracy and freedom every day for more than a month. I felt uncomfortable when I saw it. The kind of uncomfortable was that the internal organs felt that the five internal organs were stirred together, especially some friends who were close to the truth also cursed Hong Kong people without knowing the truth. Crazy overlap, including my girlfriend. (Election)

========

I knew in junior high school. At that time, a roommate of my room, he was a top fat house plus a wave of waves. He had already turned over the wall to browse the net, so he knew about June 4th and followed We simply and vaguely talked about June 4th. He talked about the PLA's opening of tanks to suppress students, suppressed the people, and said that the people at that time used flesh and blood to stop the tank, and then crushed by tanks. But at that time, including me, most of the roommates did not believe it, because how could we believe that this happened by the Chinese Communist Party's brainwashing.====

Unlike many people, I heard about the June 4th incident after the Great Wall of Fire, and searched the relevant content through Chinese Wikipedia. Since then, I opened the door to the new world. Although my dissatisfaction with the Beijing authorities had emerged before turning over the Great Wall of Fire, I only stayed at the stage of "opposing some Communists rather than the entire Communist Party", and even some worship of Mao Zedong. However, through information dissemination of the free world, I gradually abandoned those naive thoughts, and the desire for freedom is also increasing. (Election)

=========

I was born in 2004. In the ordinary villages in a province in the east, like the factory settings of many Chinese people, I have been in contact with various military propaganda and film and television channels since I was a child, which makes me a pink.

In the middle school, I became a lot of understanding. I felt that there were many corrupt officials and bad officials in the society, and the country could not help but think for the country. At that time, my thoughts seemed to be closer to the young school of the militarism in Japan. I felt that the central government was blinded, and now I feel funny when I think of it.

In high school, when I first came into contact with 64, the teacher asked us if we knew the tide of eight or nine academic tide. The class was naturally silent. Later, I learned to turn over the wall. After seeing Wikipedia and many photo materials, I learned that the 64 incident, that is, I became the current me.

========

I was born in Urumqi, born in 2005, and knew it over the wall a few years ago, but I never happened to have no chance because I did not happen to (know June 4th). I went to school at the beginning of this year and found VPN in a group: I saw someone talking about the June 4th incident when watching YouTube or Twitter, but when I saw this incident People said; after searching on Chrome, I knew this incident, and then I asked my parents and found that they all knew about it. It is just that the Great Leap Forward can now be public, and the June 4th incident can never let us know. From the beginning of this incident, it has even strengthened my determination to anti -communist anti -China and moist.

=========

After 05, primary schools like to play games because they want to play games. When they want to play out of the game, they came into contact with VPN. At that time, only VPN played games. In junior high school, I liked to watch VTuber, and I came into contact with the oil pipe Twitter, and one day I suddenly discovered the BBC documentary. After watching it, I was shocked. I thought about why the history books and the network in the wall did not have this history. There are more establishment of the government, awakening and seeing the truth of CCP. Such a country is not worthy of my patriotism.

============

For the first time, I knew that this incident was in the historical class of high school. The historical teacher accidentally talked about this. At that time, I knew nothing about this matter. The teacher only said that Deng Xiaoping slaughtered the students in Tiananmen Square. The students were used. Deng Xiaoping had to take extreme means. At that time, the history teacher was in middle school. He taught his teacher to participate in June 4th, and later returned to the village to teach. I have always been interested in history and politics. I was very surprised after listening. I went home and searched on my mobile phone. I didn't find anything. Later, I asked my father. My father said that at that time he was in junior high school. Students from all over the country went to Tiananmen to march. Students lying on the railway did not leave the train. On the TV, the video of Tiananmen Square every day, many students threw a burning bottle to confront the army. My father said that it was because the students were young and vigorous. Later, I didn't investigate this matter. After I went to college, I had a very clear understanding of the social appearance, doubted the ruling party, and began to understand the history of western politics and the history of the Communist Party. Then I collected the history of the June 4th incident with strong curiosity with strong curiosity, learned about the whole picture of the matter, and clearly realized that students were not used, and they were just sacrificed for the ideal of freedom and democracy. After many zero in the wall, I knew that there was such a matter, but most of them accepted that students were used by the West by the West, which caused many people to not care about this matter, and thought that it was just a turmoil that the Communist Party governed occasionally occasionally.

I am a post -00s. My father and many relatives at home are local government officials. I did not care about Chinese politics at first. I remember it faintly. When I grew up, when I dinner, these elders would have these elders. Tell me what happened in 1989 and tells their personal experience. At that time The parade, pursuing democracy and freedom, and the grievance of the late state chairman Hu Yaobang.

They said that when the student movement was suppressed, the local governments issued a notice asking those who participated in the parade to register their names at the time and guaranteed that they would not "account for accounts after autumn." At that time, the students were naive, and they registered with the mentality of believing in the government. As a result, each student who registered identities was not reused after working, and there was no chance of promotion at all. No matter how talented that person was. The elders told me that it was very dangerous to shake the Communist Party's ruling foundation. They would use everything to destroy all the forces that oppose them, and tell me not to be this "head bird."

After learning to break the restrictions on the GFW of China's Internet firewall, I saw relevant documentary and news reports on YouTube before I learned that most of the historical facts.

=======

For the first time, I knew that June Fourth was in the first year of high school. In a class in high school, the teacher vaguely talked about June 4th. She said that she had a demonstration in Beijing in 1989, but was suppressed, and the tank was opened to Tiananmen Square. I was very shocked, not connected, and fear, and instantly believed that this was real, because there were too many things that happened from small to large from small to large. Lie, all kinds of corporal punishment and abuse when the Education Bureau came to check. When I went home and asked my mother, she denied it. She told me that Beijing did have a demonstration, but college students were used by ulterior motives. She also said that it was impossible to shoot and tanks, and there was no large -scale death. The reason was that if many students were killed that year, these students also had parents and family members. To their existence.

Then this incident was put on hold, and I did not further explore. By the third year of high school, I found an image entrance to the Wikipedia on the Internet (you can access it without turning the wall). I read the six four entries on it and learned about the process of June 4th. After the college entrance examination, I learned to turn over the wall, so that I can complete the information of June 4th. The two resources are more useful for me. Academic research books on June 4th and Chinese modern history.

==========The 64th day of the Anmen incident was shocked to the teenager. I couldn't imagine that the Communist Party with a great and bright Communist in the textbook did such a good thing. Because of this, I know the existence of the network firewall, which is also one of my opportunities to wake up. Learn to turn over the wall.

After knowing June 4th, I asked my junior high school historical teacher about this matter. I can't forget it so far. The expression she was stunned and the later answers. "The students in the June 4th miles were good, but Some people in the party's party used "; in high school, I asked the teacher who had a good relationship with me in a high school. He told me more details at the time and instructed me to say it outside. He will lose the rice bowl.

After that, the legendary objections programmed with Ruan Xiaohuan's review of the June 4th series, telling me more about the cause and consequences of the June 4th. For example, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and Deng Xiaoping Chen Yun and others, the four -six -six social editorial, anti -officials, etc. It can be said that the blog of programming and the imagination has made me complete the last step, that is, why our society needs freedom to rule with the rule of law, what is what we need to be in the rule of law. Life is the life that a person should live.

Knowing that the 64 incident was in 2006, when I watched the movie "Golden Armor" with my parents at the time. At the end of the film, there was a plot that described the rebellion of Prince Jie. The eunuch's palace girl in the palace washed the blood stains of the rebels and placed the scene of chrysanthemum. Then my mother said, this is not the same as 64. I was particularly curious and wanted to continue to ask, but my dad was very nervous and motioned my mother not to say it anymore. At that time, I was still young, and my parents' nervous look made me particularly curious. I never saw their expressions. , But there is no content at all. Then I learned to use Wikipedia to know that there were many things that happened after the founding of the People's Republic of China.

========

I am a middle school student in mainland China. I was born in a four -generation red environment and grew up in the late period of President Hu Jintao and the Xi Jinping era.

My first understanding of the "June 4th" was in the historical class of the second grade of junior high school. The historical teacher in my junior high school was young and lively, and was almost loved by all students. It was his talk in the classroom that caused our interests -the first time is the second semester of the second year. Once "hunger strike", "demonstration", "clear field", as for the details, how to "clear the field" was not mentioned. After almost a year, the classroom came to a close topic. He once again mentioned the "eight or nine academic tide", which triggered the curiosity of our "find out". Cute -quietly tell us not to talk about it, close the classroom door, and pull the curtains. Now, if you want to come, the atmosphere is also very suitable. It is more satisfied that when it comes to the use of tanks such as tanks, it is said that Tiananmen cleans up. But I am still not satisfied, but there is no more way to understand, until I went to high school. With the way to break through the "wall", I register for Twitter account. At that time, I will still be a "pink". I will scold the CCP when I see the bad remarks of the CCP. The evil things that I never knew were presented in front of me, including "June 4th". That's all of our top talents. They are full of hope in their hearts. They are hope that they have thought that this regime will have such great hostility to themselves. Not only students, it is difficult for intellectuals, and ordinary citizens to accept it. Not only are Beijing, how sad Chinese people at home and abroad are? For soldiers, those who have conscience are sins that make them feel ashamed for a lifetime. For those who have no conscience, killing and blood are the beginning of their youth. Like Mr. Liu Xiaobo's poems:

"Those young soldiers

Maybe just put on military uniforms

Haven't experienced it yet

The drunkenness of being kissed by the girl

In the moment

Experience the pleasure of bloodthirsty

Killing is the beginning of their youth. "It is even as a capital of showing off and proud of their pride. It is really ashamed. Only so late can I know such a tragedy and so few people know such a tragedy. According to Mr. Lu Xun's definition, tragedy is something valuable thing. The destruction shows that the young life of the students, the hope of realizing democracy and freedom in China, etc., the CCP was destroyed that day!

That's right, I have completely transformed into a "anti -thief", not only seen on the Internet, I have encountered a lot in real life, although only ten years, especially the new crowns for three years. Before the CCP's fantasy, I also eagerly wanted to join it. I can do not do much, only to spread as many things as possible, tell the "June 4th" to classmates, or friends who are younger than me, as much as possible to describe the facts as much as possible. The concept just let the facts of bad deeds impacked their ideas. Obviously, the effect is good, and friends will not follow the CCP blindly.

In the past year, I have learned more about the deeds and literary works of "June 4th" in detail. I know the persecuted Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. He is a hero, my role model; So many of my favorite Hong Kong and Taiwan artists all care about China ’s democracy and freedom, which makes me love even more. This year, I also collected our generation of students' understanding of the "June 4th" and what I wanted to say to the students of the year. I tried to pay tribute to the students of the "June 4th": "Your actions and desires failed, but successful left a wound in history, people will only be blinded, and they will not forget. Starting germination, we will work hard, you will not be forgotten, I will pick up the torch, no matter whether anyone follows, maybe I will fall, but there will be more people to continue. Democracy will not kill. immortal!"

=============

Simply, when I started to learn Chinese modern history in the second grade of junior high school, I changed a teacher who was very grateful to all of them. The teacher's professionalism is excellent. The most important thing is that among the teachers who are unwilling to tell the truth of history are the only historical truth that this generation is erased with conscience.

When the teacher spent a lesson time to tell us about everything that happened that year, the belief formed from childhood to large from childhood to large. "Serving the people" has become a joke. When I went back that day, I found the older generation of family members asking what happened in 1989, and the older generation said that their memory was expressed. In fact, the older generation knew that they all knew, but in the face of the bloody cleaning of that year, they chose to be silent and chose to close their mouths!Choose the younger generation in the "prosperity" of lies in the drums.

With the increase of age and experience, with me, I started to turn over the wall to learn more about the truth. My cognition is constantly reshaping. I know that I have completed the narrative of lies from China and this ideological instillment. But in high school, I found that almost all of my classmates and friends around me were "little pink", "little war wolf", and "little red guards" output from small to large irrigation. They firmly believed in this lie. Narrative. As a student, I feel helpless and confused. After I aware of the reshaping, I was incompatible among a group of "wolves" classmates, and they were regarded as "reactionary". I want to change their cognition, or in other words, I want to let them see more the truths of being banned, so that they can also recognize to reshape.

I started to download and print documents, Tiananmen incidents, cultural revolutions, etc. from Wikipedia. These print documents were widely circulated in our liberal arts class unknowingly. Although it has been experienced for nearly a year, this is effective. Later, our class has formed a "consensus" in politics. Whenever the political teacher talks about what our socialist democracy, what people's congress, what everything is for the people's congress, what is everything for the people's congress, what is for everything for the people's congress, what is everything for the people's congress, what is everything for the people's congress, what is everything for the people's congress, and what is for everything for the people's congress. When the people such such lies are narrative, our classmates will be sneered or questioned under the podium. Of course, the political teacher is also in the hearts of Qing'er, and occasionally laughs with us.

I think, as a post -00 group, it has been instilled in red since childhood. When I start to contact the Internet, there is already a firewall. The elders avoid history. It is difficult to understand the truth to reshape the cognition. I hope that every post -00s can see the truth and stay sober and reasonable. Under this totalitarian, in this troubled world, protect yourself and his family.

=========

Hello, I am a 2003 college student. Regarding June 4th, I was in the historical class of the seventh grade. The teacher went to the period of the 1960s, and then mentioned to us that on June 4, 1989, the people's uprising went on the streets of the street, the color revolution, the Communist Party used the Communist Party, and the Communist Party used it. Gun and tank suppression. After returning home, I asked my dad, and my dad also asked me how to know in surprise, and said about it. In the eighth semester in the eighth grade, in the 18th year, I first came into contact with VPN, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology had not strictly seized the private VPN. I went to Google and YouTube to check the June 4th. Some negatives of the Communist Party have never heard of what they have heard in China.

=========

I am a native of Henan, a native mainland, and I am glad to share with you how I understand the true face of 8964 and the CCP.

When I was young, I heard such two stories. 1: There is an electrician in our village. He has no hukou or land. The reason is that he worked as a soldier in Beijing in 1989. Once he was drunk, he spit bitter water on the wine table. When he talked about his own soldiers, it was not easy, and he also said the secrets that had been hiding in his heart for many years. That is, he personally participated in the 64 massacre, fearing that he would be destroyed by the CCP afterwards. Their company commander did not return to the team at the time, but took them back to his hometown overnight.

2:(我一个亲戚)他们村有这样一位老者，穿着非常讲究，人也很高大英俊，不过他一辈子没有成亲。老者年少时家里也给他介绍了一门很不错的亲事，因为他是在北京当兵，那时候在老家还是很受欢迎的。有一天不知道什么原因跑回了老家，没有户口，没有土地。后来才知道他原来是周恩来的卫兵，一直在周恩来身边工作，在调走前夕，他从周恩来办公桌上拿走一支钢笔想留做纪念，后来被周恩来知道，就给他一句冰冷的话：限你24小时离开北京。为了性命他连夜逃回了老家。

可能很多人都听过类似的故事，或者或多或少都听说过64大屠杀以及中共的黑历史，可惜的是他们并不在意。我可能是个例外吧，除了对历史有着特别的热情，还有就是举一反三，闻一想知其十。就像第二个小故事一样，这打破了当时我对周总理可爱可敬形象的认知，以至于后来我才知道原来周也是一个杀人不眨眼的恶魔。

If you set up a firewall, I will explore it!

I was born in 00 -year Hu Jintao. Everything in the Olympic Games is full of vitality and spring!Everything is booming. I thought China was the most perfect country in the world after the United States.

When it comes to 8964, I have to mention that over the wall because there are too many vulnerabilities in our historical textbooks, it is obviously castrated and "disappeared". I am a person who likes to study history. So short after the year?

I went out of the wall and went out to play the game. I needed to register a ID. At that time, the webpage loading was very slowly realized that there was a kind of power to deliberately control the Internet

Later, I learned through the game forum that there was a "firewall" electronic Great Wall. I couldn't wait to cross the Great Wall, but just wondered what it looked like outside? At that time, my classmates used some means (should be VPN) to bring me to a unpredictable laptop to find my classmates.

I came into contact with Youtube BBC Voice of America.

I know that Mr. Liu Xiaobo also admired his courage because of his conviction and to understand his courage, so look at the wall!

At that time, Baidu (about 14-19 as far as I learned) was a search and related Baidu Encyclopedia (the Chinese version of Wikipedia) called the "political storm" in the spring and summer of 1989. Search for the results of the use of the Xiaomi mobile phone with the browser. The current page is not or display according to laws and regulations (Baidu Search June 4th Incident)

I believe you will ask me what to think of this?

After understanding the incident, I started to be attracted to the Eastern European drama into the Berlin Wall after understanding the incident.Summary because the firewall is to register the game ID — overturning the wall -Liu Xiaobo — Charter 08 — BBC — 8964 — Looking forward to the development of democracy and rule of law

I firmly believe that not only the white paper revolution in China will also have a day when the Berlin Wall collapses

Read for the CCP!Fight to the end for democratic constitutional government!

============

I learned that on the one hand, the June 4th incident was because of the large -scale tightening review mechanism of the Internet in early June each year, and on the other hand, because of the high level of penetration of the Chinese folk penetration rate, we could comprehensively understand the eighth or nine academic tide.

As part of the democratization movement in the 1980s, the June 4th incident was repeatedly instilled into the minds of the Chinese people over 30 years in a vacant manner. Officials acknowledge that this is a scandal and adopt an online review to try to cover up history. However, in the fragmented June 4th incident that see the official information, the government itself admits that this is a "storm" together, but believes that violence clears the field and afterwards and afterwards Persecution is a necessary means to maintain national security.

At the same time that the two treatment methods are parallel, the attitude of Chinese officials and the people is contradictory in treating the June 4th incident. We must admit that we lack serious politics in this regard. This part is due to speech control, but the more reason is that we subconsciously use the June 4th as a high cabinet. This attitude of dealing with history has disappeared into a historic symbol of the tank people and martial arts troops, and then either simply believes that June 4th is the consequences of "subversion of overseas forces". The four incidents are the consequences of authoritarian politics (liberal perspective). The moral division that simply regards June Fourth as "good" or "evil" is not conducive to the true responsibility of history.

Now we must think about many problems in the sense of political philosophy: democracy, authoritarianism, or the political system itself. Just using a complaint and joke attitude will only refuse the retrospective, thereby rejecting the historical movement. The end of the history of Koyev and the post -Cold War era still has obvious conflicts. Of course, free and democracy has its inevitable limit. The end of the new answer. The June 4th incident has become the iconic incident of modern Chinese history (which can be opposed to the Gwangju incident in South Korea), but in the final analysis, it is only called on a symbolic level that it cannot go out of the authoritarian model at all. For each generation after the June 4th, what we really lack is political enlightenment and corresponding training, as well as true participation in politics.

============

During the epidemic in 2020, junior high school students were at home. I like photography, I often watch videos at station B. Some time I saw a video that introduced the camera. When it comes to Leica, the blogger inserted a phrase "Leica recently made an advertisement to humiliate China". The barrage is very vague. I was curious, so I went to search, but Baidu couldn't find anything. There was only one post, but it was all mystery. It didn't take long for a friend to send a ladder, and finally had a chance to go out and watch, and began to understand these things.

Later, I went to watch the video of the B station and found that the sentence inserted in the middle was deleted.

When I first knew, I didn't understand any conceptual theory, I just felt really bad. There are too many such videos outside. Later, I learned to understand myself and started reading. The biography of Deng of Fu Gaoyi made me learn to consider this problem in multiple aspects. I used to have great confidence in such a whole set of System, thinking that it was not wrong. But a lot of things happened last year, and everyone was a little annoyed. I often look at the past memories of public space display to people, and there is always a difference from my own feelings. This is like being caused by tampering by memory. So I got into the private space, my past photos, other people's books, Liu Yu, Liang Wendao, Chen Danqing, and public intellectuals who wrote their memory and feelings, but could resonate with me. I also started to read Fushan, Muller, and I want to know what SO-Called thinks.

Sooner or later, they are determined, but are they stable? As Fushan said, the powerful national capabilities can make them complete the huge projects such as the Three Gorges, but do many people really benefit from this, it is not easy to evaluate.

I still believe that the current confrontation is conscious confrontation. We always adhere to our current approach through the principle of "tolerance and diverse", reject some of the value of the west, as if they are not suitable for us. But finally found that the pursuit of human nature is the same. Who does not want equality and liberty?

==========

How to say, if there is no song "East East of the Queen" suddenly disappeared in the summer of 19 years, I may not know what happened in Hong Kong at that time, and I did not know that such a big thing happened in 1989 Essence

Well, it seems that the logic is a bit unclear, but that's it. When I saw foreign media reports about Hong Kong's anti -repair routine storm, sometimes I mentioned a mouthful of June 4th, and all this can be used by books or people around me. It has never been mentioned, so with his strong curiosity, he began to understand something about June 4th.

Now ... I feel that everyone knows the existence of this matter: My grandfather mentioned that Tiananmen was flowing into the river at that time (although I said that because I believed in the documentary "Tiananmen", I had such exaggerated performance. I suspect); my dad and friends who usually drink tea and chat together firmly believe that all this is the ghost of overseas forces; my classmates think that this is a patriotic movement (?) Good handling.

As for me, with the occurrence of a series of events (such as the new crown prevention and control, AO3 being blocked, Xuzhou's "eight -child mother", the summer festival is resisted, white paper movement ...) How do you know how to say, I don’t know how to do. Look at my motherland. On the one hand, I enjoy the achievements brought about by China's high -speed development, and I am proud of it. On the other hand, I saw the Chinese authorities ’s suppression or persecution of different sounds -even if it is only a very gentle, it is just a person's art of art. Creation ... Obviously there were not so many things that Xi Jinping had before the stage (although there were bad things at other times, most of me did not impress it). At that time It is as smoke like now, but now ... can only say that it is tears when you say too much.

Now ... days are still living as usual, or go to school, eat, and sleep. I don't watch Douyin, but I will look at what I am interested in in Bilibili. However, thanks to the efforts made by June 4th -after all, I was ignorant at that time, I do n’t know many things outside the wall, and even the wall turning tools had to try it several times. Finally, I was stable in a stable one. Under the tool, I have developed the habit of using software that cannot be used in China such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc., depending on this, and knowing many people, contacting many new knowledge and perspectives. Everything you have.

After all, I don't want to forget everything I have experienced.==========

For me personally, from the understanding of June 4th to understanding to being familiar with it to personal experience is a relatively long process. It is divided into three stages.

In 2013, when I was ten years old, I went to Taiwan with my mother. Because I was traveling with a group, a group of tourists from mainland China went together. There were many Falun Gong practitioners outside the gate of the attractions or other people placed exhibition boards and banners on the street. Promote to mainland tourists. At that time, I was a primary school student. I only remember that I was waiting for my mother to go to the bathroom. A wife came to tell me, "You have to withdraw from the young pioneer, retire from the team to keep the team safely, and then refer to the exhibition board in her hand. There are many very bloody pictures on it (only when I grew up, I knew it was some photos of June 4th. It was really bloody that it made me remember today), and I told me that it was terrible not to retreat. After the mother came out of the bathroom, she immediately drove away my wife and pulled me away. The group of people were talking about it. It probably mean that they deliberately slandered the mainland and let you ignore these Falun Gong (the pronouns of cults in China). After that, you will travel abroad every year, which is commonplace.

Slowly, after going abroad to travel abroad, we realized that a firewall wasolated us from the world. In the third grade, I do n’t know which classmates found that the public computers in the school used Bingbuki browsers to go to Wikipedia. Out of curiosity, they searched various entries on Wikipedia, just coincide with learning history, and conduct some information search for some information search. When I found a lot of information that was completely different from the textbook, we began to realize that our history was clue. As the number of travels abroad increases, what is VPN gradually explored. After going to high school, I installed VPN on my mobile phone and started my career over the wall.

Starting from high school in 2018, I gradually obsessed with the study of historical and political disciplines, and I also love learning modern Chinese history. From the original Wikipedia browse, I gradually downloaded Twitter, followed all kinds of political columns, and heard foreign information. After reading many Hong Kong and Taiwan books, we knew that we had been separated by a sad barrier. The history of June 4 in China was finally revealed by me.

I learned in the chat with my family since then that my father was a pro -calendar at that time. In 1989, he was attending the university in Beijing. He was in the square in the middle of the night. transportation. In school, many students of the same age are curious about this hidden history. It is probably not because the June 4th is much miserable, but the official sensitivity to this matter has aroused their curiosity. It seems that our father has more or less personally involved or indirectly participated in the June 4th (mostly from the late 1960s to the early 1970s to grow up in Beijing). After hearing the brothers, this incident became even more flesh and blood. Grandpa and grandma told the tightness and anxiety in various hospitals after the Qing Dynasty inquired about the news of my father. When my father told the crowd's siege of the soldiers, the scene was tragic, and these scenes had a deep mark on my heart.

Soon after, the epidemic came and various events in the society were frequent. At that time, through Twitter, I could understand various types of Chinese current affairs. Out of their indignation of June 4th and a series of tragedy in today's society, I was sad and angry, and tormented. Extremely. I hate the series of practices for the young people at the time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the darkness of society seemed to combine two things together.

On April 4, 2020, it coincided with the National Public Ceremony Day to mourn the people who sacrificed for epidemic prevention. I went to the scene with two classmates. We entered the square with the statue of candles and Li Wenliang (I do n’t know why I passed a strict security check). It was also this experience. Personal experience of the degree is also unforgettable.

China Listening: Compared with the Central Asian Summit, the G7 summit has no powsing, which is to discuss issues together. However, the Central Asian Summit in China is very luxurious.

The one -size -fits -cut approach was rebounded strongly. The people are still concerned about the controversial land in northern China.

Lin Biao made a speech on "coup" **

Hello everyone, welcome everyone to listen to "History of the Great", I am the host Sun Cheng. Today, we will continue to conduct a series of historical revolution history.

In the previous lecture, we finished the cause and consequence of the launching sign of the Cultural Revolution. We mentioned that at the expansion meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from May 4th to 26th, 1966, the May 16th Notice was adopted by 76 senior people at the meeting. In other words, they are actually the same as Mao Zedong, and they both have an unshirkable blame for the launch of this political storm. However, it is worth noting that at this time, Mao Zedong, the number one responsible person who launched the Cultural Revolution, was not in Beijing, but instead observed the development of the situation in the south. At that time, Beijing directly represents Mao Zedong's will was a member of the "Central Document Drafting Team" basically composed of hardcore Mao factions.

It is particularly noteworthy that the two days after the "May 16th Notice" passed, that is, on the morning of May 18, 1966, Mao Zedong's political allies Lin Biao gave a murderous speech at the meeting, pushing the situation to more tense tension Degree. The theme of this speech is about coup.

Reading this speech carefully, you will find that its content can be said to be very complicated. In his speech, Lin Biao gave a lot of examples of coup. First of all, he talked about "the world coup", and then talked about the Zhou Dynasty, saying that "after the founding of the past, the ten years, twenty years, 30 years,,,,,,,,,, Fifty years, a coup has occurred in a short period of time, and there are many examples of throwing away the regime ", which listed various coup from Zhou Dynasty to the Republic of China. After talking about a lot of coup, Lin Biao said:

"Any essence is manifested by the phenomenon. Recently, there are many ghosts, ghost phenomena, to attract attention. A counter -revolutionary coup may occur, to kill people, to usurp the regime, to reconcile the bourgeoisie. Try. There are a lot of phenomena, many materials, I won't go into details here. You can smell a little taste and gunpowder after anti -Luo Ruiqing, anti -Peng Zhen, anti -Lu Dingyi, and his wife, and against Yang Shangkun. The class representatives of the class are mixed in our party, mixed to the party's leadership, became the power of power, mastered the state machines, grasped the power, grasped military power, and mastered the headquarters of the ideological front. Big chaos. "

This paragraph of Lin Biao can be said to be a very fierce interpretation of the May 16th Notice. In the previous lecture, we once said that the May 16th Notice stated that it is necessary Cleaning, and mentioning that if these people "do the work of leading the cultural revolution", they will be "extremely dangerous." Lin Biao's words can be said to talk about how serious this "abnormal danger" is and how "unusually dangerous" method is. In his speech, Lin Biao also said the more sensational content:

"Now Chairman Mao Jianzheng, we are good at the big tree. Chairman Mao is in his 70s, and he is healthy and can live in his 100s.

"Because of the good situation, we cannot be paralyzed. We need to take measures to prevent the incident. Some people may be engaged in ghosts. They are now ghosts. The ambitionist, there are many people. They are the representatives of the bourgeoisie. Let them succeed. There is a group of bastard, they want to take risks, they stand by. If they want to kill us, we must suppress them!They are fake revolution, they are fake Marxism, they are fake Mao Zedong thought, they are betrayalists, they are betrayal , Chairman Mao is still alive, they betrayed, they are in vain, they are ambitious, they are ghosts, they want to kill people now, killing people with various methods. Lu Dingyi is one, Lu Dingyi's wife is one. Knowing his wife's affairs!How can you not know? Luo Ruiqing is one. Peng Zhen's means is more hidden and cunning than them, making it difficult for others to see it. "

Here, Lin Biao first put a high hat for Mao Zedong, saying that Mao Zedong could live in more than a hundred years -this is of course not a fact, because only ten years later, Mao Zedong was 83 years old. died. Next, Lin Biao talked about what the so -called "representative of the bourgeoisie" wanted to do, saying that these people were not only "fake revolution", "fake Marxism", "fake Mao Zedong thought", and "betrayal", and they said they " I want to kill people now, and they are "killing people with various methods", and said that these people include Lu Dingyi, Yan Xiebing, Luo Ruiqing, and Peng Zhen. It is worth noting that Lin Biao first mentioned Lu Dingyi and Yan Xiebing, which shows that Lin Biao, who had previously suffered from Lu Dingyi's wife Yan Xiebing's anonymous letter harassment, hates Lu Dingyi's couple.

In addition, there is a very black humor. Just after five years, Lin Biao fled by plane and died in Wenduer Khan, Mongolia. After his death, the Chinese Communist Party officially stated that he tried to assassinate Mao Zedong with a coup and did not get a "turning case" until now. When speaking the above -mentioned big paragraphs, Lin Biao probably couldn't think of him to usher in such an ending.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-30T19-21-00-04-00/000002.png)A set of Mao Zedong and Lin Biao commemorative stamps during the Cultural Revolution period(APPhoto/Vincent Yu)  [ ![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-30T19-21-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-05302023190852.html/ap10012701737.jpg)** Second, the new peak of fart: Lin Biao's "Counterfeit" Crazy "Create" ** **According to Marxism -Leninism's theory, the country is actually the so -called "tool for exploiting the oppressed class". Here, Lin Biao further deduced this theory, saying that "the regime is a tool for one class to oppress another" and simplify this view to a theory of "the power of suppression". Under such presets, political cleaning must be carried out in the society and the Communist Party of China. , By "removal" and other fate. And these people who have been suppressed, that is, the people who are called "reactionaries in society" and "representatives of the exploitation class in the party", if they are not suppressed, according to Lin Biao, the Chinese Communist Party "will lose the loss Registration is confused. "

In his speech, Lin Biao also touted Mao Zedong's great exaggeration and showed the kung fu that to a new peak. He said: "What day Chairman Mao lived, 90 years old and more than a hundred years old is the highest leader of our party. His words are the rules of our actions. Behind him, if anyone is a secret report like Khrushchev, it must be an ambitionist, it must be a big bad guy, the whole party shares it, and the whole country will discuss it. "

In fact, this paragraph is quite famous. Lin Biao's proposal to oppose Mao Zedong, it is necessary to "the whole party and discuss the whole country." Later, it became a famous "stalk". It was widely circulated afterwards. Although after the Cultural Revolution, many people no longer understand the context of this statement, they can still blurt out of the ten words of "the whole party and the national discussion". It can be seen how wide this passage spreads. Next, Lin Biao touted again "on the next level": "Mao Zedong's thoughts are always general truths, will always be our guidelines for action, the common wealth of the people of the Chinese people and the revolutionary world, and the PLA forever. Chairman Mao's work, as a textbook for the whole army cadre soldier, is not my clever, but must do so. Use Mao Zedong's thought to unify the whole army and the whole party. Thousands of sentences. For Chairman Mao's work, I have not fully understood it, and I have to learn it in the future. "

Of course, this paragraph is also quite famous. The so -called: "Chairman Mao's words, the sentence is the truth, one sentence exceeds 10,000 sentences", and it is also one of the very famous "Lin Biao quotations", which is extremely wide. We no longer need to make more analysis on such a tattooing touting. As long as it is directly displayed, everyone can feel the ridiculous and crazy atmosphere.

Lin Biao's speech on May 18, 1966 can be said to be extremely famous in the history of the Cultural Revolution. It has a very "powerful" "stubborn ability", creating many so -called "popular" "classic quotes". After Lin Biao fell, people vividly called Lin Biao's speech as a "coup", showing the degree of brainwashing and "magic" of this passage.

** III.

So, what kind of instructions did the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the time of such an extremely brainwashing and "magic" speech?

This section of the instructions to the county and regiment levels are said:

"Comrade Lin Biao's speech on the Political Bureau of the Central Politburo on May 18, 1966 was a very important document of Marxist Leninism. The serious reality of the struggle of the route, according to the historical lessons of the international dictatorship, especially the lessons of the Soviet Khrushchev amended the party, the adults, and the tampering of the army. The problem made a systematic and precise explanation. "

Not only that, the instructions also repeated Lin Biao's "famous saying" like a repeat machine, saying:

"Comrade Lin Biao sharply raised the problem that the proletariat obtained the regime may still lose its power. He pointed out that no matter what kind of thing is, don't forget the power. Forgot the power, to forget the fundamental point of Marxism. That is confused, his head dropped, and he didn't know how to drop it.

"Comrade Lin Biao raised Mao Zedong's red flag the highest. In this speech, he made a comprehensive, correct and scientific evaluation of Mao Zedong's thoughts. Unity and Mao Zedong Thought as the center of solidarity. He called on the mass movements that use the works of Comrade Mao Zedong among the people across the country. He pointed out that this is to ensure that my country prevents correctionism, avoid capitalist restoration, strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The most fundamental key issue.

"Comrade Lin Biao said that Chairman Mao is the highest leader of our party, and Mao Zedong's thought is forever. Learning to use the model of Mao Zedong's thoughts is an important document to guide the proletarian cultural revolution. The whole party and the whole army should study carefully, discuss it carefully, and take it seriously, and apply it to the Cultural Revolution and all actions. "

From the above content, it can be seen that in the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, Lin Biao's so -called "famous sayings", that is, "the whole party shared it, and the national discussion" was cited. Moreover, this instructions put Lin Biao's speech in a very high position, and rated Lin Biao into the so -called "the highest red flag for Mao Zedong thought". It can be seen from these situations that Lin Biao's crazy views are not just his personal point of view, but the view of the entire Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Lin Biao can say that like that, it is more than just that he has a problem.

In this way, the May 16th Notice symbolizing the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution and Lin Biao's "coup" have been launched, and the Cultural Revolution has actually launched. On May 23, 1966, at the end of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee of the Cultural Revolution, Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, and Yang Shangkun were all stopped and revoked. The work of "sacrifice flag" has been completed. Subsequently, the first wave of reactions began to set off in the society. May 29, 1966 is a week. That night, a group of senior students from a group of Beijing Tsinghua University Affiliated Middle School came to the relics of Yuanmingyuan, secretly discussing a "big event" that looked vital to them. The secret set of such a group of middle school students has affected the process of history. They will set up an organization, and such organizations will appear in all corners of the CCP regime in the following months. With the emergence of this organization, large -scale violence, homicide, robbery, and destruction behavior appeared like a tsunami. The first wave of massacre in the Cultural Revolution began.

The name of this organization is actually repeatedly mentioned today, that is -Red Guards.

Thank you everyone, this is here this week. We see you next week.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-30T22-56-05-00-00/000168802_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

Since the 1990s, the "Washington Consensus" was once becoming an important support for the United States to maintain global economic governance. The concept of "large markets and small governments", "privatization" and "trade and financial liberalization" concepts claimed to be. It became the most successful policy framework for the output after World War II. But the United States, which is now promoting a free market economy around the world, is subverting the concept of "Washington Consensus". US National Security Assistant Jack Shalvin recently delivered a speech on "Revitalizing the US Economic Leadership" and acknowledged that the American industry and sustainable innovation capabilities have been really hit. Economic rational and political concepts are undergoing major changes. With this transformation, how will the world economic structure evolve and what challenges China will face?

****

1. Under the "Washington Consensus", the negative effect continues to appear

In 1989, the three major institutions of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the US government proposed a series of policy claims. The main theory of neo -liberal academics was the main theory. Red, attach importance to culture and education and infrastructure, reduce marginal tax rates, implement interest rate marketization, adopt a floating exchange rate system, implement trade liberalization, relax the restrictions on foreign capital, implement the privatization of state -owned enterprises, relax government control, and protect private property rights This is called "Washington Consensus". It emphasizes "minimizing the role of the government, privatization, and liberalization." In the environment of the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the changes in Eastern European drama, governments from all over the world have begun to give priority to the Western economy model. The currency fund organization uses loan assistance and huge investment as a exchange condition. This model can be implemented. Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Poland, and Southeast Asian countries have begun to implement the "Washington Consensus".

Under the "Washington Consensus", the concept of order -oriented order with the free market economy once promoted the expansion of trade globalization, financial internationalization, and international cooperation. According to data released by the World Bank, global trade accounted for GDP from 36.7%in 1985 to 56.5%in 2021. During the 20 years of 1980 to 2000, the US economy has developed rapidly. The average annual growth of Name GDP has increased by more than 6%, and its global influence has continued to increase.

But at the same time as globalization, the "Washington Consensus" also brings some serious economic and political issues. Under the free market economy, while the United States has forty years of prosperity, the industrial foundation is gradually emptied and the vacuumization of manufacturing has gradually intensified. From 1952 to 2022, the US manufacturing industry accounted for 16.2%of GDP. The author mentioned in "The Change and Dechat's Decline of the US Manufacturing Industry after World War II" that from the list of US Fortune 500 companies, from 1955 to 1980, the proportion of the traditional US production industry in the Fortune 500 is still 70%. above. In the 1980s, the US finance and regulatory relaxation greatly promoted the growth of banks and insurance companies. In the 1990s, the financial mixed business reforms entered the expressway. The proportion of traditional manufacturing fell to less than 50%in 1995.

Regarding the Asian economic market in the 1990s, the complete release of foreign investment actually opened the window for speculative "hot money". In 1997, the Asian financial crisis swept Thailand. Soon after, countries in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and other exterior economy were affected. The currencies of various countries had depreciated sharply. The major Asian stock markets fell sharply, breaking the scene of Asian economy.

The 2008 subprime crisis also became the iconic incident in the "Washington Consensus" process. Under the conditions of liberalization, the proportion of the US banking system in the financial system is too high, and the poor supervision of the capital market in the allocation of financial resources not only leads to the crushing American real estate bubble, but directly trigger the global economic depression.

****

2. Under the "Beijing Consensus", China's development is unique

Different from the "Washington Consensus", Chinese -style modernization has opened up unique models. Compared with the "Washington Consensus", "Beijing Consensus" is a view formed by international public opinion. In 2004, the senior editor of the American "Times" Weekly, Goldman Sachs's senior consultant, Qiao Shuya Curober, published an investigation paper at the London Foreign Policy Center in London, UK, pointing out that China ’s combination of the country has become his own development model. The pattern is called "Beijing Consensus". This model emphasizes "active innovation and bold tests", pointing out that innovation is a means of economic development and continuous progress in China, and emphasizing that the problem solving should vary from trouble, and do not seek unified standards. Emphasizing modern development not only requires the efficient allocation of resources in the market, but also requires the government to play the role of sufficient regulation, emphasizes the director of the public economy and the private economy exhibition, and emphasizes that the market and the government role coordinate with each other. "Give full play to the basic role of the market in the allocation of resource allocation, and better play the role of the government" is a concentrated manifestation of "Beijing Consensus".

Compared with the negative effects brought about by the consensus of Washington, China's economic policy follows the "Beijing Consensus", which has promoted the continuous and rapid growth of China's economy. According to the data released by the World Bank, China's GDP accounted for a global economy from 1.6%in 1990 to 18.5%in 2021. In addition, according to the consensus of Beijing, China has better responded to the 1998 Southeast Asian crisis and the 2008 international financial crisis. The author mentioned in this column article "Fighting from the" Great China "Industrial Policy" that in the 2008 "4 trillion" stimulus plan, Chinese steel and photovoltaic are listed in the top ten revitalization industries. In the following two or three years, it has become a hardest hit area for overcapacity, which has been widely criticized for a while. In the context of the major adjustment of global steel and photovoltaic industries from 2011 to 2015, most overseas companies have suffered serious losses and closely closed down. It also enhances international competitiveness.****

3. "Washington Consensus" steering accelerates

In recent years, the impact of factors such as the popularity of the new crown epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War has also exposed the limitations of the "Washington Consensus" policy: the excessive "free market economy" drives the industrial chain outsourcing of strategic materials production. The fragile scars of the production supply chain, and geopolitical factors such as Russia and Ukraine conflict reflect the risk of excessive relying on excessive dependence. The global commodity supply has received a significant impact, and global inflation has exacerbated uncertainty. In this environment, the "Washington Consensus" seems to be difficult to maintain, and the US government is also reflecting on free trade and market economy, and advocating the government's intervention in the market.

Judging from the recent statement of the US high -level statement and the policies of the introduction, the "Washington Consensus" is fading. In April of this year, Jack Shalvan, a US President's National Security Consultant, proposed the new domestic and foreign economic policies. Restore trade protectionism. Shalvin pointed out that in the past few decades, over -emphasized the efficiency of the market, the cancellation of taxation, relaxation control, and privatization have been placed in the position of preferred public interest, causing some important departments such as semiconductors and infrastructure to shrink. It damages the industrial capacity of the United States. He proposed that through public investment, it is necessary to support the basic role of economic growth and have national security and strategic industrial development, especially medical equipment, semiconductors and key mineral resources.

Prior to this, the "2021 American Innovation and Competition Act", "Chip and Science Act", and the "Inflation Weakened Act" issued by the Biden government, and the "Britness Iakened Act", are typical government intervention in the market. They can be regarded as "Washington Consensus". The product after steering. In January 2021, the Bayeng government issued the administrative order of "Ensuring Made by American Workers in the United States in the future", emphasizing that the government preferentially selects domestic suppliers in the signing of the federal contract and maximize the use of American services and goods. At the same time, the Biden government launched the "2021 American Innovation and Competition Act", which aims to promote the development of technologies such as semiconductor and artificial intelligence in the United States and reduce the degree of dependence of the semiconductor industry. In August 2022, the Bayeng government continuously released the "Chip and Science Act" and "Inflation Act", trying to accelerate the localization process of the key industrial chain and block China's semiconductor development. Among them, the "Chip and Science Act" proposed to take out 52.7 billion US dollars of funds to support the development of the US semiconductor industry. At the same time, through industrial subsidies, export control lists, physical sanctions, foreign security review, and "Chinese guardrails" clauses and other means to adopt the Chinese chip industry blockade. In May of this year, US Secretary of State Broskyi delivered a speech and conveyed the Bayeng government's policy against China, claiming that he would start a fierce competition with China, defining the policy framework of China with "investment, collaboration, and competition". Strategic advantage in "critical areas". This shows that in the future, the United States will be more normalized in domestic industrial policy intervention and sanctions on Chinese technology.

4. How will China deal with?

Facing the turning of the "Washington Consensus" in the United States, the Chinese economy accelerates the construction of a new development pattern of the development of a large domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promoted. In the next step, China's economic policy needs to be accelerated in the following four aspects.

The first is to take advantage of China's huge market size and complete industrial chain, and actively implement the strategy of expanding the domestic demand while deepening the reform of the supply side. Macro policies can also further make efforts to consolidate the foundation of stabilization of economic stability. Fiscal policies, especially the central government, also have a space for positive and vigorously. In view of the heavy burden of social security and provident funds in Chinese enterprises and residents, companies that actively pay social security with positive and compliance to further reduce social security and provident fund fees, which can not only increase residents' current disposable income in current current current income The improvement of enterprise operating conditions will also drive their consumer expenditure; at the same time, supplemented by issuing cash subsidies or consumer vouchers to low -income groups, promoting green smart home appliances to the countryside, replacement of old and new, and issuing procurement vouchers to small and medium -sized enterprises, etc., which helps to mention small and medium -sized enterprises. Vibrate the confidence of the micro -subject.

The second is to increase its efforts to promote the technology innovation -driven strategy and solve the problem of technology card neck. On May 28th, C919 domestic large -scale passenger aircraft successfully completed the first commercial flight, revealing the new chapter of the domestic civil aircraft cause, which means that China has achieved new breakthroughs in the industrial manufacturing industry. In response to international scientific and technological competition and external curb suppression, the policy level regards scientific and technological innovation as an important support for high -quality development.

The characteristic of digital art is that it can be copied infinitely, so it is difficult to use the genuine genuine collection, and the value cannot be high. Due to blockchain technology, the non -homogeneous tokens (NFT) have become the only means to prove the original work of art and store it, so the holding of digital collections has produced important economic significance.

****

NFT birth

In 2017, NFT first appeared in the world's first blockchain game "Cryptokitties" developed by Dapperlabs, Canada. At present, there are two main types of targets traded in the NFT market: one is artistic property rights and dissemination of art works, game cartoon images, tickets, preferential services, idols and other fans. The other is derivatives. The right to use, display, replicate, commercialization and other rights. However, most of the current activities through the NFT trading platform are only the transfer of content use rights, and rarely involve the identification and transaction of intellectual property rights.

In 2020, explosive growth in the NFT market, the transaction scale increased by 299%compared with the previous year, and the transaction amount reached 338 million US dollars. In particular, the work of digital artist Bippier's work "Everyday -5000 Days" was successfully auctioned in Christie's in March 2021 for a $ 69.35 million sky -high price, making NFT attract global attention. In this context, China held the world's first blockchain and encrypted art theme exhibition in April 2021. NFT China, UMX, Vision China, and the only encrypted art platforms have also sprung up from all over the place. Most of the non -homogeneous tokens in China are published on the public chain such as Ethereum based on standard ERC21, which can be purchased and circulated through digital currency. Most of the digital collections are published in the alliance chain. There are secondary markets. For specific examples, you can cite the customized digital collections launched by Tmall 618, the NFT digital collection trading platform established by Hangzhou Aiju Technology Co., Ltd., Metafi (METAFI) proposed by Beijing Youhuan Technology Co., Ltd., and Smart Finance Visualization Solutions. etc.

The typical typical "Sandbox" (Sandbox "(founded in 2011)," DECENTRALAND "(founded) and other blockchain drives were typical. Essence For example, in the 3D game of the "sandbox" multiplayer network, players can use sand coins to purchase digital real estate, cultural derivatives, characters, games, services, and services that exist in non -existentialized tokens. Construction, operation, and transactions form an inner economic circle in the universe. According to the data of the co -founder of this game, Sebastienborget's data disclosed in Twitter, the results of the second season of Alpha test held from March to April 2022 show that the game shows the monthly The scale of active users reaches 350,000. He even proposed a new concept of the sandbox Yuan universe.

The "de -central country" is the first batch of virtual game platforms that adopt the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model for community governance. There is always a fixed total total between the homogeneous token MANA and the non -homogeneous token LAND Corresponding relationships enable the financial markets in the game to maintain stability. Soto, the most famous auction house in the world, entered this platform in 2021 and opened the first virtual gallery in history. China's well -known Chinese singer Lin Junjie also purchased three virtual land here. On November 24, 2021, tokenscom spent 618,000MANA coins (equivalent to $ 2.43 million at the time), a Feng Shui treasure of "decentralized country" was purchased. This was the world's most expensive virtual real estate at that time. However, a few days later, it was broken by a US $ 4.3 million in exchanges to buy virtual land by REPUBLICREALM.

The business model and token economy circle of "earning while playing while playing"

The characteristics of this type of meta -universe are that players will save assets in the game. They can earn token by buying and selling, and can convert tokens into the legal currency of the real world. In this way, a business model of "playing while playing while playing while playing (playing and making money". English expression is playto earn, brief language P2E). "

A group of countries in the world and emerging countries in Asia have appeared in addition to eating, excretion, bathing, cure, sleeping (in Japan and even VR sleeping enthusiasts, and even sleeping without leaving the Yuan universe) all day long. Users in virtual games. In addition to those old people who are not free to act and Shen Yan who cannot extricate themselves, there are also some players who make a living by earning a living in online games. South Korea's most representative online game company NCSOFT has taken the popular line since its establishment in 1997, forming a new gaming financial and cultural phenomenon. In November 2021, it was also clearly announced that it may be introduced in all games developed in the future. The model of "earning while playing" can ensure a complete Yuan cosmic life. Some parents in South Korea also send the internal currency or NFT of the game to the children during the Spring Festival. These facts indicate that the Yuan universe of the NFT method will flourish, but the above trends have also aroused questions from some users and experts.

In any case, the key to the Yuan universe that can attract widespread society is the success of the economy; once the crowd is attracted to the virtual space, it will bring business opportunities. At least the advertising effect is actually equivalent to creating another reality; so Many manufacturers will also try to enter the Yuan universe, which is the same as the prosperous area that has gathered in the real world. As a result, a token economic circle can be formed in the Yuan universe. Although the ownership expressed in the NFT is not the same as the legal ownership, it can prove that its uniqueness is scarcely value through blockchain technology. It can be traded by the legitimacy chain that can be tracked without relying on specific platforms. Therefore, in order to improve the use of digital assets, it is necessary to improve the level of server technology, promote the circulation of encrypted wealth between different platforms, and develop unified specifications and standards for different platforms.

The phenomenon of developing inclusive finance through NFT

In the context of global quantitative easing and accelerated digital transformation of epidemics, the current excess funds are surging towards the intangible asset markets such as NFT. Therefore, NFT has actually begun to play the function of inclusive finance. This also means that outside the bank -centered economic circle, another economic circle centered on NFT will be formed.In this sense, it can be said that NFT is the key to the development of game finance, decentralized finance, and renewable finance. It is also the hub running through the Internet 3.0 built through blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organizations. Online games, chain games, and even other competitions (such as football, basketball, volleyball, tennis and other sports projects) industries quickly increase the transaction amount after embedding NFT, and then through marketing models such as the copyright and brand sponsorship of the competition, the industry scale continues to snowball. NFT and encrypted assets, multiplayer online games and other e -sports integration, and expand new profit margins. On this occasion, inclusive financial methods such as the Axieinfinity scholarship, NFT leasing services, and pledged tokens have become an important channel for income to increase their income.

By the way, it has not yet acknowledged the digital currency issued by the Yuan universe so far. It only allows the use of digital RMB, and only one -way one -way exchanges were allowed -that is, to buy digital RMB with RMB and not withdrawn. China's Yuan cosmic economy is mainly driven by traffic, which is difficult to form a community with tokens as the medium, and it is difficult to develop activities that are decentralized autonomous organizations. So far, China's Yuan Universe Finance is mainly reflected in empowering business and improving services, such as the establishment of virtual banks that complement and interact with physical banks. Here, the storage households can use the digital avatars to access the virtual counter and virtual automatic ATM with the digital avatars through VR. Virtual employees can provide immersive companionship and help. Complete business processes in sensory interaction; you can even issue NFT and carry out digital collection wealth management business. The Financial Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region conducted a survey of local virtual banks in May 2020. The results showed that the Yuan cosmicization of the bank's business actually reduced the cost of financial transactions and improved operating efficiency. The goal of inclusive finance, the comprehensive regulatory framework of virtual banks also runs well. Under such institutional conditions, how to define non -homogenized tokens (NFT) will produce completely different effects.

Nvidia(Nvidia)It has become the first chip manufacturer with a market value of $ 1 trillion, leading the entire Wall Street to those who are considered to benefit from artificial intelligence(AI)The latest progress in the field has a high enthusiasm.

The stock climbed more than 4%during the early trading time of New York on Tuesday to reach $ 406.1. Earlier, his chief executive Huang Renxun(JensenHuang)A new super computer was released on Monday, and WPP and SoftBank(SoftBank)Wait for the company to form a new AI Alliance.

The Nvidi headquarters in Silicon Valley started aiming at the thirty market of 3D computer graphics 30 years ago. The company's chip drives today's AI applications, including OPENAI's breakthrough chat robot ChatGPT. At present, large technology companies and cloud computing providers race to upgrade their data center technology to welcome Huang Renxun's "turning point in a new era of computing" on Monday.

High -performance chips like Nvidia's H100 have become the construction of generating artificial intelligence(generativeAI)The key to the system, the texts and images created by these systems are exactly like human beings.

The stock price of other companies that benefits from the rise of AI has also surged this year, including Microsoft, Palantir and AMD.

However, experts expressed concern about the rise of artificial intelligence. A group of scientists warned on Tuesday that this new technology is so powerful that "reducing the risk of extinction of AI, which should be listed as a global priority with the risks of other social scale (such as large epidemic and nuclear war).

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-31T-19-32-08-00-00/000000.png)After the Sudan Civil War, after nearly 6 weeks of lane war, with the temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, many residents in the northern suburbs of Khartour in the capital of Khartour needed to drink water urgently.

On April 15 this year, the Sudan government forces and the quasi -military organization "Fast Support Force" (RSF) broke out, and the Water Supply Station in many regions in Beikoumou was damaged.

Since then, about 300,000 residents have never seen a drop of water from the faucet. Some people re -cut the well, or take the water from the Nile with a pot.

The local resident Adel Mohammed told AFP, "At the beginning of the war, we took water from the well in the industrial area factory, but a week later, the quasi -military organization seized the water source."

With the expansion of conflicts, the residential area and hospital also fought. Muhammad had to wait for many days to take risks to take out the water.

Now, after Muhammad and neighbors are waiting for the conflict for a temporary rest, bring a variety of pots, pots, and water cans to the Nile River on the suburbs to take water, and then load the trucks and transport them back. Ji Gong promoted.

But many people choose to leave. Rashedhussein and his family fled to Madani, about 200 kilometers south of Khamoum, he said: "The reason why I forced me to abandon my homeland is water shortage, not bombing and fighting."

The Sudan civil war led to more than one million people, and Hu Sheng was one of them. He said that he couldn't stand watching the child without clean water to drink or take a bath.

Even before the war, according to the United Nations Children's Foundation (UNICEF) information, 17.3 million people from Sudan could not get safe drinking water. The agency said that the difference between the poor and sanitary conditions of the aquarium is the main cause of the death of children under the age of 5.

The local informal community organizations have established field hospitals and food distribution stations, and distributed water supply. A member of a member who asked for anonymous because of concerns about government forces or resistance to the army said: "Since the beginning of the war, we have been providing water for residents."

He said that during a water picking, "our friend Yassine was killed by bullets" and "we were forced to bury him in the absence of the body."

The 59 -year -old Li De was interviewed by the Russian Satellite News Agency (Sputnik) and said in an interview with a streaming that she came to Russia as a vacationer.

She said, "When I got off the plane in Moscow, it was the first time I felt safe for so long for so long, and I was listened and respected."

Li De claimed in early 2020 that in August 1993, the then federal Senator Biden sexually assaulted at the age of 29 of the Congress Villa Corridor, which became the focus of the media.

When she proposed the above -mentioned allegations, Biden was full of horsepower to compete for the White House throne with former President Trump who was re -elected; Trump also faced sexual abuse and sexual assault charges.

Biden disappeared this statement and said, "This is not true. I said clearly that this matter has never been and never happened."

Li De said that she had filed a complaint, but could not find the relevant records.

However, the court document record in 1996 showed that Li Defu mentioned that she had complained about sexual harassment during her work in Biden's office.

It is unclear whether Li De's allegations have been formally investigated.

Li De, who claims to be geopolitical analysts, said in an interview with the Russian satellite news agency that she continued to be threatened after she publicly accused Bayeng's sexual assault in 2020. Some people threatened to let her jail, and some threatened her personal safety, and some people had someone, and there were people. Said she was a Russian agent.

Li De told reporters that she "always loves Russia."

Li De said, "I don't think Russia is an enemy, and many American compatriots don't think that."

She also said: "I want to seek the status of Russian citizenship from Russian President Vladimir Putin."

Li De said that she "guaranteed that she would become a good citizen, and she also said that she also wanted to retain American citizenship.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T00-42-00Z/65767943_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65761319/65767943)The picture shows Korean news on the 29th report that North Korea will launch satellites.

(Voice of German in Chinese) The South Korean military said that North Korea launched a rocket to the south on Wednesday (May 31) to try to send one "satellite" to the space track, and later landed abnormally on the West Coast in South Korea. The North Korean official media (KCNA) said that in the second stage of the rocket launch process, due to the unstable engineering system and the unstable rocket fuel, the Yellow Sea fell. North Korea stated that it would check this "serious" defect and will soon launch for the second time.

In response to the launch of the rocket in North Korea, Matsuna Koda Matsuna, the official house of Japanese cabinet, condemned that it had protested to North Korea through the diplomatic channels in Beijing, and will work closely with South Korea and the United States. South Korea also held a national security conference to condemn North Korea's provocative moves; the South Korean military has shot to salvage the wreckage of rockets falling into the sea and conduct further analysis.

Reuters reported that when North Korea launched a rocket on the 31st, South Korea issued an air strike alert at about 6:32 am to ask citizens to prepare for evacuation;

In the early morning of the same day, the Japanese government's J-Alert alarm system also issued an emergency warning to the residents of Okinawa, asking the people to stay indoors. The system then said that the missile would not fly to the Japanese territory and lifted the warning.

Leif-Ericeasley, an associate professor of International Research on Seoul, said: "Regardless of whether the current satellite mission of North Korea is successful or not, Pyongyang may carry out political propaganda on its space capabilities and express diplomatic remarks between Seoul and Tokyo."

### "Satellite" launch preview

North Korea ’s official media (KCNA) reported on Tuesday (30th) to quote a senior national defense official that North Korea will launch a military reconnaissance satellite in June.

Ri Pyongchol, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the North Korean Workers' Party, issued a statement through the North Korean Society, condemning the United States and South Korea's joint military exercises to show that the two countries "disregarded their ambitions." He pointed out that these exercises forced Pyongyang to have "the ability to collect information on enemy military behavior in real time."

In his statement, he said: "We will comprehensively consider the current and future threats, and will strengthen all the activities of all inclusive and practical warfare, and put it into practice more thoroughly."

When referring to the "recklessness" behavior of Washington and Seoul, Li Bingzhe said that North Korea felt that "it is necessary to expand reconnaissance and love search methods and improve various defensive and offensive weapons." Penins and its nearby regions carry out hostile aerial spy activities. "

Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kishida and the US State Department stated that even if North Korea claims to launch "satellites", the use of ballistic missile technology for launch is still a violation of many resolutions of the UN Security Council, which will threaten the safety of the people.

When a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning responded to the question at a regular press conference on the 29th, she said that "the situation of the situation in the Korean Peninsula has developed to today." I hope that all parties are looking at the crux of problems, adhere to the direction of political solution, and through meaningful dialogue through meaningful dialogue Balanced reasonable concern.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T00-42-00Z/65647908_401.jpg)North Korean official media released a video on May 16, showing that North Korean leader Kim Jong -un's father and daughter were watching the "Mars 18" solid -state fuel ballistic missile test firing.

### Japan: Threat territory Shoot down

The Japanese Ministry of Defense set the ballistic missile defense system as alert on Monday (29th), and warned that if any flying object threatens Japanese territory, it will shoot down.

Reuters pointed out that this is the first time that the Japanese Ministry of Defense has responded to North Korea's space launching operations since 2016. A spokesman for a defensive province said that Japan expects that this time, like 2016, the Rockets carrying satellites in North Korea will fly over the Southwest Island chain in Japan.

Earlier, the Japanese Broadcasting Association (NHK) and other Japanese media first pointed out that North Korea informed the Japan Maritime Security Agency that he would launch satellites between May 31 and June 11. The Reuters and Associated Press subsequently reported that Japan had confirmed the matter and said that the scope of influence included the waters in the waters of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the eastern part of Luzon Island, Philippines; the Japanese government had warned nearby ships.

Matsuno Kazaki Matsuna Kazakhstan, the official room of the Japanese cabinet, said at a press conference: "The government realized that the satellite may cross our territory."

According to the Japanese Prime Minister's Office, although North Korea is called "satellite", it is likely to include ballistic missiles during the launch. The Associated Press pointed out that launching satellites to space will use long -range missile technology banned by the United Nations Security Council. Matsno Kodi said that North Korea's move will violate UN resolutions and pose a threat to peace and security in Japan and regions.

### intention of North Korea

In April, North Korean official media said that [the country's first reconnaissance satellite is ready](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/金正恩朝鲜即将发射首枚间谍卫星/a-65373347), Leader Kim Jong -un went to inspection in mid -May and approved the next launch plan. Analysts say that this satellite is a part of the North Korean monitoring plan, which also contains drone technology, which is to improve its ability to strike the target when the war starts one day.

In response to North Korea's satellite launch, Japan has already begun to prepare. In April of this year, Japan sent a destroyer to the East China Sea with a standard 3-air defense missile (Standard Missile-3, SM-3), and the missile has the ability to hit the target of space; The deployment of the Patriot 3 air defense missile (PAC-3) in Okinawa can strike the goal closer to the ground.

Last week, South Korea launched the first commercial satellite to space, which may help South Korea to launch its first military satellite on track and create more powerful missiles. The Associated Press said that some experts believe that Kim Jong -un will hope to make the reconnaissance satellite go to space earlier than South Korea.

North Korea launched the satellite orbit on the Earth in 2012 and 2016; although the country showed the ability to launch satellites, the actual function of its satellite caused the outside world to question the outside. Judging from the published images, its equipment also looks too small and rough, and may not support high -resolution satellite images.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T00-42-00Z/65651395_401.jpg)North Korean official media released a video on May 17, showing that North Korean leader Kim Jong -un inspected the country's first reconnaissance satellite.

### New crown virus traceability: Top Chinese scientists said they should not exclude the leakage of the laboratory

** A former Chinese government senior scientist told BBC that the possibility of leaking the new coronary virus from the laboratory should not be ruled out. **

As the director of the China Disease Prevention and Control Center, Professor Gao Fu played an important role in the response and traceability of the epidemic.

The Chinese government has denied any statement that this disease may originate from Wuhan Laboratory.

But Professor Gao was not straightforward. **

In an interview with the BBC Broadcast Four Podcast "Heat: Finding the Origin of the New Crown Virus", Professor Gao said: "You can always doubt anything. This is science. Don't rule out any possibility."

Professor Gao is a world -class virusist and immunologist. After retiring from the China Disease Prevention and Control Center last year, he is currently the deputy director of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Professor Gao also told the BBC that the Chinese government conducted some formal investigation on the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which may show that the Chinese government's attention to the theory of laboratory leakage theory is higher than its official statement.

"The government organized some things," he said, but his own department of China CDC did not participate.

We asked him to clarify whether this means that another government's department officially searched the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. The Wuhan Virus Research Institute is one of the top national laboratories in China. The laboratory is said to have spent several years studying coronary virus.

"Yes," he replied, "That laboratory has been inspected by experts in this field."

This is the first time that the official recognition has conducted a certain form of investigation, but Professor Gao said that although he did not see the results of the investigation, he "heard" confirmed that the laboratory was innocent.

"I think they concluded that they followed all the agreement. They did not find any improper behavior."

Wuhan Virus Research Institute

It is almost certain that the virus of the new crown epidemic originated from bats.

But how it was uploaded from the bat to us a more controversial question, there were two main possibilities from the beginning.

One is that the virus spreads to humans from the naturally of the bat, and may pass through other animals. Many scientists say a large amount of evidence shows that this is the most likely situation.

However, other scientists say that there is no sufficient evidence to eliminate the main possibility: the virus infection with people participating in research is to better understand the threat of nature virus.

These two may be at the core of geopolitical politics, a bunch of conspiracy theories, and one of the most political and harmful scientific debates in our era.

We explained this difficult but very important issue through interviews with some top scientists from all parties in the debate and a highly secure laboratory report from the streets of Wuhan to a highly secure laboratory in the United States.

At the time of January 2020, Professor Wang Linfa, a scientist in Singapore, visited the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. At that time, he was the honorary professor of the institute.

He told the BBC that a colleague at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute has always worried about the possibility of the laboratory leak, but she can rule out this possibility.

Wang Linfa is a professor of infectious diseases professor of infectious diseases professors at the National University of Medicine, the National University of Singapore, and regularly cooperates with Professor Shi Zhengli, a professor of the same professional professor of Wuhan Virus Research Institute.

They are old friends and the top experts in the world studying Bat Crown Viruses. Therefore, they have won the nickname of Batman and Bat Girl.

Professor Wang said that Professor Shi told him that she was "insomnia for a day or two" because she was worried that "there was a sample she didn't know in her laboratory, but it contained viruses, polluted something, and then ran out" Essence

But he said that she checked her sample and found that they did not contain evidence that caused the virus that caused the new crown virus or any other virus sufficient to cause the epidemic.

He also said that Professor Shi or anyone in her team "could not" conceal the fact that they found the laboratory leak evidence, because they performed like nothing happened, including going out to eat and planned to sing karaoke.

The decrypted American intelligence now shows that several researchers at the Virus Institute are sick in the fall of 2019, and the symptoms are "consistent with the new crown virus and the common seasonal diseases."

But Professor Wang told us that he suggested that Professor Shi collected blood samples from her team in January 2020 to see if they have new crown virus antibodies. He said that she heard his suggestions that all the test results were negative.

Some scientists believe that the vast majority of evidence shows that the virus is spread to humans in a market in Wuhan. Professor Wang is one of them.

Wuhan China Seafood Market

There are far more things sold in Wuhan Wainan Seafood market than its name implies, including wild mammals. The market is related to many early cases, and these cases are people who work or shopping in the South China seafood market.

Although China's performance is obviously lacking transparency, these scientists have said that there are sufficient information, such as data from early cases and the environmental sampling of the Chinese market, which can exclude the possibility of laboratory leakage.

In fact, this definition claim exists from the beginning, the most obvious is in a paper in March 2020. This paper has become one of the largest reading and controversial scientific papers in the Internet era.

"Sars-Cov-2 (SARS-COV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome" is written by some of the most outstanding scientists in the field of virology and new diseases. The assumption is credible. "

It supports a view that this view is quickly popular in many media reports, that is, the laboratory leak is a conspiracy theory.

But an author of the paper stated in the podcast that he is now doubting the credibility of the previous conclusion.

Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, has tracked diseases around the world for a long time, including China, where he has established close connections.

He is also a scientific consultant of Hollywood blockbuster "Infectious Disease".Although he still believes that the market is still the most reasonable explanation of the source of the new crown virus, and does not believe that the virus is deliberately designed, he does not think that all laboratories or research possibilities can be ruled out.

Ian Lipin

He took the initiative to propose his theory, referring to another laboratory in Wuhan, which was managed by the Wuhan Disease Prevention and Control Center, which was only a few hundred meters away from the South China Seafood market.

According to Chinese news reports, the laboratory participated in the work of collecting thousands of blood and stool samples from wild bats. These studies are sometimes carried out without wearing appropriate protection equipment, which is obviously risk of infection.

"People who work there may be infected when collecting bats in the cave," said Professor Lipjin. When he participated in writing the paper in March 2020, he did not know the laboratory and his work.

Professor Lipjin pointed out that the South China Seafood Market is a further analysis of the origin of the virus -including the research on the evidence of raccoon dogs in the market recently -it cannot solve the origin of the origin.

He said that this virus may "originate from the market and is magnified in the market."

On the surface, Professor Gao's remarks about the leakage of the laboratory seem to be seriously inconsistent with China's public statement.

"The so -called 'laboratory leakness' is a lie composed of anti -China forces. This is due to political motivation and no scientific basis," said in a statement in a statement.

But from another perspective, the two sides may have more common points.

The Chinese government has been promoting a strange and unconfirmed third theory in propaganda.

It says that this virus does not come from the laboratory or market, but may be brought into the country through frozen food packaging.

The Chinese government said that it excluded the possibility of laboratory and the market, and Professor Gao's remarks could be simply regarded as a more scientific version of the position because he excluded these two possibilities. Both are based on lack of evidence.

"We really don't know where the virus comes from ... this problem is still not resolved," Professor Gao told BBC.

Scientists argue, sometimes the issue of fierce controversy is really no conclusion.

However, at least outside China, one thing is widely consistent: China does not do enough in searching for evidence or sharing evidence.

Although this seems to be a simple problem, it is by no means.

Where does the new crown virus come from?

The answer is very important to everyone who dies, to those who suffer from suffering, to those who continue to suffer.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The International Anesthesia Organization (AMNESTYINTERNATIONAL) recently pointed out that a Uyghur student lost contact after going to Hong Kong. Hongkong.

According to the International Terminal Organization on the 26th, on the 10th of this month, a Uyghur student immediately lost contact after flying from South Korea to Hong Kong, fearing that he was taken away by the Chinese police and illegally extradited to mainland China at the Hong Kong airport. Shortly after the Hong Kong Government denied, some Korean media quoted the student's guidance professor in Korea and reported that the student is still in South Korea.

On the 30th, the organization was renamed that the student had been contacted, and he did not go to Hong Kong, "contrary to the information received before." The International Telle Organization stated that they are glad to know the whereabouts of the birth, and they will continue to monitor the human rights conditions of China, overseas Uighurs, and Hong Kong, and "continue to work hard to provide us with human rights that they are invaded by human rights and to provide us with human rights. support."

The Hong Kong government expressed his indignation and contempt at the end of the night on the 30th. The Hong Kong Government stated that the International Amnesty Organization "not only refused to admit mistakes", but also claimed that he would "continue to monitor the human rights status of Hong Kong and the Mainland" as its "vilifying the poisonous remarks of Hong Kong and the Mainland". Solemnly apologize.

The International Terminal Organization did not provide more details on this matter, nor did they immediately reply to the Associated Press's comment request.

It emphasized that the student was "indeed in South Korea" and did not go to Hong Kong.

Zhao Xuyuan told Yonhaps through the phone that he did not know why the International Amnesty Organization pointed out that Abu Dudu Lehman disappeared in Hong Kong and planned to contact the International Amnesty Organization to correct the facts.

The Associated Press reported on the 30th that the International amnesty organization stated that it was trying to independently confirm the whereabouts and security of the student. If more information was obtained, it would be further responded.

The Associated Press tried to contact the student directly, but the South Korean school refused to provide detailed contact information on the grounds of privacy. The school said that Professor Zhao Xuyuan had communicated with the students to confirm that others were in South Korea, but Professor Zhao Xuyuan did not respond to the Associated Press' telephone inquiry.

When the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning was asked about the incident on the 29th, he only replied: "I don't have the relevant situation."

The Hong Kong government has denied the saying that the student has lost contact in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" reported that the Hong Kong Government spokesman responded on the 27th. The government records show that the student has never entered or refused to enter Hong Kong. The International Amnesty Organization has arbitrarily attacked the Hong Kong government and slandered Hong Kong's human rights situation without investigation. There is no basis for no basis, "the heart of poison is easy to see." A spokesman for the Hong Kong Government condemned and asked the organization to apologize to it and false speech.

A statement issued by the International Youlian Organization last week said that the student lost contact after going to Hong Kong. It has taken Cathay Pacific's flight from Seoul and landed at Hong Kong at 11 pm on the 10th. Cathay Pacific did not respond to whether he had boarded the plane.

Abu Dudu Reheiman's colleagues told AFP on the 27th that the student lost contact at the Hong Kong Airport on the 10th, and his whereabouts are unknown to this day. In his final newsletter, he claimed to be investigated and questioned by the Chinese police. It might take some time, asking friends not to wait for him to leave together.

Agence France -Presse reported that the friend said that because Abu Du Leichman had a record of being "detained and questioning", he did not think much at the time, but the next day, the friend contacted Hong Kong in Hong Kong the next day. Entry -exit management departments still cannot get more information. Based on concerns about the safety of the life, friends choose a public incident.

The friend said that he had a doubt about Abu Du Leihman's trip, but Abu Du Lehman still insisted on visiting Hong Kong: "He missed the calculation, he didn't know how serious the consequences would be."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T01-45-00-08-00/30AI-SAFETY-01-jbhq-master1050.jpg)A group of industry leaders warned on Tuesday that the artificial intelligence technology they are developing may pose a threat to human survival one day, and should be regarded as the same social risks as the major epidemic and nuclear war.

Non -profit organization artificial intelligence security center published a copy [only one sentence statement](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk)Writing: "The risk of reducing artificial intelligence should become a priority of the world, just like the risk of other social scale -such as a major epidemic and nuclear war." This open letter is more than 350 in artificial intelligence work Sign signed by executives, researchers and engineers.

Sign signeders include three leading executives of artificial intelligence companies: OPENAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Jimis Kazakhs, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amoda Yi.

Jeffrey Simon and Joshua Benjio are two of the three researchers who have won the Turing Award for their pioneering work in neural networks. They are usually regarded as the "godfather" of the modern artificial intelligence movement. They also signed the statement, and there were other outstanding researchers in this field.(As of Tuesday, Yang Lekun, the third Turing Prize winner and the head of the Meta artificial intelligence research project, has not signed.)advertise

The statement was issued when people's possibilities of artificial intelligence were increasingly worried. Recently, the so -called large -scale language model, that is, the progress made by the artificial intelligence system used by ChatGPT and other chat robots has caused people's concerns -artificial intelligence may soon be used to spread error information and publicity, or It may eliminate millions of white -collar jobs.

Some people believe that in the end, artificial intelligence may become strong enough. If no measures are taken to slow down its development, it may cause social scale destruction within a few years, although researchers sometimes do not explain how this happens.

These concerns have been recognized by many industry leaders, which has made them in an unusual situation. They claim that they are developing a technology -in many cases, they are desperately working to draw faster than competitors than competitors. ——The constitutional risk and stricter supervision should be subject to stricter.

This month, Altman, Kazakhs, and Amandi met with US President Biden and Vice President Harris to discuss artificial intelligence regulatory issues. In the [Senate Explanation after the Conference](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html)Among them, Altman warned that the risks of advanced artificial intelligence systems have been seriously enough to need government intervention and call for supervision of potential harm of artificial intelligence.

In an interview, Dan Hungrik, Executive Director of the Artificial Intelligence Safety Center that this open letter represents the "out of the counter" of some industry leaders, and they have expressed concern about the risks they are developing. Private.

"Even in the artificial intelligence industry, there are generally misunderstandings, thinking that only a few people are doctrines," said Hendrik. "But in fact, many people will worry about these things privately."

Some suspects believe that artificial intelligence technology is still too immature, which is not enough to constitute a threat of life and death. For today's artificial intelligence system, they are more worried about not long -term danger, but short -term issues, such as prejudice reactions and incorrect reactions.

However, some people believe that the progress of artificial intelligence is too fast, so that its performance in some areas has exceeded the level of human beings, and it will soon surpass humans in other fields. They said that this technology has shown signs of advanced ability and advanced understanding, which makes people worry that "general artificial intelligence"(AGI)——It artificial intelligence that can be achieved or exceeded in various tasks -may not be far from us.

In [a blog post last week](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence)Among them, two other executives of Ortman and Openai proposed several methods to manage powerful artificial intelligence systems responsible for managing powerful artificial intelligence systems. They call on leading artificial intelligence manufacturers to cooperate, conduct more technical research on large language models, and set up an international artificial intelligence security organization similar to international atomic energy agencies (designed to control the use of nuclear weapons).

Altman also stated that he supports the formulation of rules and requires a large -scale cutting -edge artificial intelligence model to register to obtain a permit issued by the government.

In March of this year, more than 1,000 technicians and researchers [signed another public letter](https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230330/ai-artificial-intelligence-musk-risks/)It is called to suspend the development of the largest artificial intelligence model for six months, because it is worried that "the competition for more powerful digital thinking is out of control".

This letter was led by another non -profit organization that focuses on artificial intelligence, the Life Future Institute, and Elon Musk signed with other well -known technology leaders, but there are not many signatures from the leading artificial intelligence laboratory.

Hendrix said the short new statement of the Artificial Intelligence Safety Center -only 22 English words in total -aimed at uniting artificial intelligence experts, which may have differences in the nature of specific risks or measures to prevent these risks from occurring these risks. , But they have common concerns about the powerful artificial intelligence system.

"We don't want to promote a large menu containing 30 potential intervention measures," he said. "This kind of thing will dilute the information."

The statement was originally shared with several well -known artificial intelligence experts, including Sington. Sington this month [resigned from the job in Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html)He said that he can talk about the potential harm of artificial intelligence more freely. After that, the statement entered several major artificial intelligence laboratories, and then some employees signed it.

As hundreds of millions of people use artificial intelligence chat robots to seek entertainment, companionship, and improve work efficiency, and the rapid progress of underlying technology, the urgency of warnings from the leaders in this field is also increasing.

"I think if there is a problem with this technology, there may be major problems," Altman told the Senate Group Committee. "We hope to cooperate with the government to prevent this situation."

US sanctions are also targeted at Asian New General Machinery and Asia New Electronic Technology in Shenzhen, China. According to it, Yaxin has collaborated with a pills headquarters headquarters in Mexico, which provides equipment to a person who is related to the Sinaoa drug trafficking group in Mexico.

"This person uses these machines to create a super laboratory in Mexico, which can produce millions of pills containing fentanyl every week," said the US Treasury Department.

U.S. prosecutor announced in April this year that members of the Sinaroa Drug Trafficking Group charged them, accusing them of producing and trafficking fentanyl. In recent years, synthetic opioid drugs are considered the culprit that causes tens of thousands of people in the United States each year.

The sanctions implemented by the Foreign Asset Control Office (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department have frozen the assets of these companies and individuals in the United States, and it also prohibits any US citizens and enterprises and a transaction with the object of sanctions.

This seems to be a strategic choice : "China believes that they are the most influential when they are responsible for economic issues. They therefore put these activities before Guoan -related activities."

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The United States India Command (INDOPACOM) issued a statement and video on Tuesday (May 30), accusing the Chinese PLA fighter aircraft in the South China Sea International Airship, "unprofessional interception" and "unprofessional interception" and " Unnecessary provocations. "

The statement wrote that when a Chinese J-16 fighter pilot was over May 26, when intercepting the US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft, "fly directly to the head of the RC-135 aircraft, forcing the US military aircraft to fly over The tail flow turbulence. "

The United States did not disclose the specific flight location of the RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft at the time of the incident.

A 30 -second film released by the Indo -Pacific Command showed that a fighter flew from the head of the US reconnaissance aircraft, and the cockpit of the US military aircraft was obviously shaking due to the turbulence of the tail flow. A spokesman for the US Department of Defense said that the PLA's military aircraft approached the US military reconnaissance aircraft, which was only 400 feet (about 122 meters) from the head of the aircraft.

The statement emphasizes that the RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft will operate safely and conventional operations over the international airspace of the South China Sea according to international law, and will continue to fly safely and responsible in the place allowed by international law. Use international airspace. "

On Wednesday (May 31), the Chinese media reproduced the response of Zhang Nandong, a spokesman for the southern theater of Jiejun and Fun Army. One RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft in the United States deliberately broke into the training area to implement reconnaissance interference. In Zhang Nandong's view, "the United States has severely damaged the regional peace and stability, and the relevant reports ignore the facts. It is completely the wicked first sue, reversing black and white, and a rake, trying to confuse international audiovisual."

Earlier, Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has stated that the United States has long been "frequently deployed aircraft and ships to conduct close -range reconnaissance against China, which has a serious threat to China's national security."

"China urges the United States to stop this dangerous provocative behavior and stop transferring responsibilities to China." Liu Pengyu said in a request to reply to Luyou Club that China will "continue to take necessary measures, resolutely defend its sovereignty and security, and and and also. Cooperate with regional countries and resolutely maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. "

### Near completion

The satellite images shot on June 28, 2016 show that China ’s 3,000 -meter -long aircraft runway built in the construction of the Fiery Crossriff that has sovereignty disputes has ended. Theoretically, the runway is enough to meet the take -off and landing of the Airbus A380 model. Compared with satellite images 7 months ago, China ’s construction speed in the South China Sea artificial island is amazing.

One of the first sea -building projects filled in in the controversial waters was carried out in the South Johnsonreef. Chigua Reef is actually controlled by China. This recent picture can be seen that the construction of a radar tower on the northern end of the island is nearing completion. The Asian Maritime Transparent Initiative (AMTI) of the Washington Strategy and International Research Center said that the island center's location may build a large multi -layer military base.

### How to make islands

The basic process of expanding islands and reefs is to dredge sand and gravel from the bottom of the sea. Pour on the shallow beach. The sand will gather above the high water level. The position of the shore bed or island reef was hidden. Then use tools such as bulldozers to flatten sand. After the area of the desired land is built, workers around the island should establish barriers to prevent erosion and storm tide. After that, various facilities began.##### "Micro Plastic Surgery" project in the South China Sea is clearly visible

### "The Great Wall of the Sand"

China put forward territorial requirements for about 90%of the regions of the South China Sea, and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and other countries have also put forward sovereignty requirements for this resource -rich waters. The South China Sea is an important World Trade Shipping Channel. Every year, goods worth about $ 5 trillion are transported to all over the world through the sea area. China's reclamation land is called the "Great Wall of the Great Wall" by the US military, and the United States has expressed serious concern for the intention of building artificial islands. Beijing believes that it has "historic rights" to the South China Sea.

Washington is worried that China ’s military efforts in the South China Sea will weaken the United States' navy and economic forces in the Pacific region. The United States considers the dispatch of US military aircraft and warships into the waters of 12 nautical miles of the China Sea New Island Reef. Washington has repeatedly ended the project to Beijing and other countries that reclamates in the controversial waters, but Beijing expressed rejection.

The "Shangri -La Dialogue" will appear in Singapore from June 2nd to 4th. Austin and Li Shangfu will attend and give a speech.

However, an anonymous US senior defense official clarified to Reuters that the timing of the announcement of the incident had nothing to do with Beijing's rejection of the two countries' defense ministers. He explained that the incident was announced that "it must go through the decryption procedures of the US military and the US diplomatic communication procedures."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T02-38-00Z/59244760_401.jpg)The US -China relations have deteriorated since the Chinese "spy balloon" incident in February this year.

The relationship between Beijing and Washington is at a historical low since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979.

The Pentagon believes that the similar actions adopted by the Chinese PLA in sea and air have a more dangerous trend.

The two sides were only 3 meters recently, forcing the US reconnaissance aircraft to avoid flying urgently to avoid crashing.

The senior US defense official told Reuters that since 2021, China has rejected or has not responded to more than 10 requests to talks with the Pentagon. The U.S. Department of Defense believes that maintaining the contact and exchanges between the two parties is important to avoid misunderstanding and wipe guns.

Russia and Ukraine use drones to attack each other's capital. This is also a new development that the two countries have appeared on the field at the field since the start of the war more than 15 months ago.

In the early morning of the 30th, the Russian capital Moscow was attacked by the drone, which caused "minor" damage to multiple buildings, and two were injured. Earlier, Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, was attacked by the third large -scale drone within 24 hours, causing 1 person to die and 4 injuries.

Russian President Putin emphasized that in the early morning of the 30th, the unprecedented -scale drone attack against Moscow was a revenge on the Russian attack of the Ukrainian military intelligence bureau.

Putin issued a TV statement a few hours after the attack, "We have previously mentioned the possibility of cracking down on decision -making centers, and the Ukrainian military intelligence headquarters, which was attacked two or three days ago, is one of the related actions. The Kiev regime chose a different path, that is, attack Moscow. "

Russia announced on the 30th that it has shot down eight Ukraine drones against Moscow and its surrounding areas, saying that it is an unusual attack. Russia believes that this is the recent recent against Russia for the country - Especially the air strikes of Capital Kiev, but Ukraine has denied responsibility for these attacks.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-31T02-45-17/image-1685500738.jpg)The two -way upgrade of the Russian and Ukraine 32 drones participated in the attack against Moscow(Peninsula TV Station)After the so -called "terrorist attack", Putin accused Ukrainian attempts to "intimidate" the Russians and praised the operating status of the air defense system in the capital Moscow "satisfactory".

Putin also said that on the 30th, the drone attack on Moscow hit the "civilian goal". He also said that the capital's air defense system in Moscow will be further strengthened.

On the other hand, the Russian military website reported that in the attack on Moscow, the "UJ-22" drone owned by the Ukrainian army appeared in Moscow.

The website added that the drone could fly 800 kilometers away, and this drone was monitored in the area near Moscow.

The Russian News Agency reported that the Russian Attorney General's Office is supervising the investigation of the Moscow attack.

Ukrainian presidential consultant Mikhaillo Podoliake denied that Kiev participated in the 30th drone attack against Moscow, but he also said that Ukraine is happy to see such a scene and it is expected that such attacks will increase further.

#### Reserved the right of response

In this context, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it will retain the right to take "the most powerful measures" to respond to drone attacks against the capital Moscow on the 30th.

In a statement, the ministry pointed out that "it turns out that NATO officials will not be realistic about the Kiev regime will not go deep into the Russian territory to launch an attack, which is completely unreal."

The statement pointed out that Russia reserved the right to respond to the "terrorist" attack from Kiev.

On February 28, the Second Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passed the "Reform Plan for Party and State Institution". On March 10, the 14th National People's Congress passed the "State Council Institutional Reform Plan". The two conferences of the country were closed, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council quickly issued the "Reform Plan for Party and State Institutions", requiring the reform of the central level institution to be completed by the end of this year, and the reform of the local level institution will be completed by the end of next year. On May 18, the State Financial Supervision and Administration Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration was unveiled on the basis of the CBRC.

Since the reform and opening up, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has implemented six rounds of institutional reforms, namely in 1982, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2018, and 2023; 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2023. Since 1988, the reform plan of the State Council has submitted the first plenary session of the new National People's Congress to review the personnel changes in the new team of the State Council. Since 2018, the reform of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council has considered the overall consideration of the institutional reforms, simultaneously implemented the top -level implementation, the party and government agency office, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has expanded significantly.

There are three cyclic strange circles in the long -term reform of Chinese institutions: the institution is "streamlined -expansion -re -reduced -re -expansion"; - Put again ". Even in 2018, the reform of institutional reforms and adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee of the Communist Party of China did not completely escape from these three strange circles. Specifically, there are ten major problems.

** 1. The concept is difficult to change. ** The ideas of "rights" and "official standards" are deeply rooted. A considerable number of officials still have the thoughts of father -in -law. Government characters have shifted from all -around type to efficiency, from unlimited type to limited type, from approval type to responsibility type, from controlling type to service type, from human governance to rule of law type, from closed type to open type, from closed type to open type, from closed type to open type, from closed type to open type, and open type Starting from departmental type to public types is still far away, and Chinese -style modernization is still on the way.

** Second, duties are difficult to divide. ** The instinct of administrative organizations is path dependence, high degree of centralization, and self -expansion. The problems of offside, missing positions, and dislocation of institutions and responsibilities are still outstanding. The efficiency is not high; the positioning of the public institutions is inaccurate, the functions are unclear, and the efficiency is not high; the coordination of the party committee and the government, the coordination between government departments, the coordination obstacles of the party committee and the government departments have long -term illness.

** Three, the cost is difficult to reduce. ** Some party and government agencies are bloated and overlapped. Some units are floating in and out of the masses. The main work is still in formal meetings, posts, and investigations. The budget budget is weak, the cost of public management continues to expand, and the local debt crisis has accumulated. Some central and western regions in the Midwest have worked hard to maintain "opening" and "eating". They need to transfer payment to operate barely. How can we talk about development?

** Four, the law is difficult to introduce. ** The scientific, standardized, and legalization of institutions and preparation is relatively lagging, and the restraint is weak. The "Regulations on the Establishment and Preparation and Management of Administrative Institutions of the State Council" issued on August 3, 1997 has been nearly 26 years. Some clauses have lagged behind the status quo. Strengthen the rigid constraints. However, the author has reserved the legislative proposal. The main reason is that China ’s changes are too fast and too fierce. In 45 years of reform and opening up, it has basically gone through the past 200 years in Western developed countries. Institutional reforms are also fast and fierce. There is a round of every five years. The previous round has not been digested, and a new round has come. For example, the most fierce institutional reform in 2018 not only settled the establishment of the National Supervision Commission, but also involved the adjustment of many administrative laws and regulations. It has not been completely adjusted. In 2023, a new round of institutional reforms have come again. It is too frequent to practice the law and immature. After the basic setting (the departments of the State Council are reduced to not more than 20 as an important sign), it is revised.

** 5. Performance is difficult to improve. ** Administrative performance and work performance are not necessarily positive with institutional reform. It only rely on moral encouragement and internal constraints, which is not enough to motivate public officials' work enthusiasm. Especially, the current personnel system of the cadre is mainly responsible and not responsible. There are not many public officials who really care about the masses, especially the disadvantaged people and the people's livelihood. They are more worried about the black hats on their heads. The hidden rules still turn around the leadership, perform their instructions, and the performance is reflected in the leadership assigned by the leaders, whether right or wrong. The cost of correction of the first leader of violations of laws and discipline is too high. Either retirement or after transferring to unveil the lid, but the loss has been caused, and the unit's atmosphere has been corrupted. China's "concentrated strength to do major events" has always been a double -edged sword. It can do good things (such as reform and opening up), or to do bad things (such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution).

** Six. It is difficult to coordinate. ** The relationship between the central and ground is intricate, and the interest game of interests is darker. The central government focuses on long -term interests, stability of regimes, mainstream public opinion, localities, locality, highlights of political achievements, and promotion of officials. The higher -level organs are business guidance, and the party committee and government at the same level are leadership relationships, but some strong superior agencies, such as development and reform, finance, public security, and other departments. Local financial institutions must not only develop the local economy and regulate financial work. Two targets are contradictory, and it is inevitable that supervision is located in development.

** Seven, the place is difficult to match. ** The functions of the central and local agencies are generally rough, the departments are generally rough, and the division of power and responsibilities is not reasonable. The setting and power configuration of grass -roots institutions need to be improved. Hubei Suizhou and Foshan, Guangdong have explored the major system reform earlier, but during the implementation process, it was difficult to intervene in the ability of the superior authorities and had to rebound. In 2023, the "Reform Plan for Party and State Institutions" gives more autonomy to provincial and below institutions, stipulates that the establishment of institutions and configuration functions should be set up by local conditions within the limit. The competent authorities intervene in the resistance of local institutional reform.

** Eighth, it is difficult to diverge by personnel. ** Public officials' own quality, ability, and knowledge update cannot keep up with the rapid development of society and technology. There are no legal reasons and cannot be dismissed. In 2023, the operation of institutional reform has personal emotions, that is, the county and township establishment is reduced. It is not difficult to compile fines by the central and provincial -level institutions. It is more of a posture. After diversion, you can borrow staff from the lower level or the institution of the affiliated institutions and rebound in the curve. Eating fiscal meals is more located in local, especially in public institutions. Many institutions are redundant and people are floating. They need to surgery for streamlined surgery. In order to reduce shocks and maintain a stable change, the treatment of the in -service staff of the institution can be implemented after the reform of the reform of the elderly and new methods for the elderly.** Ten, the benefits are difficult to balance. ** Touching benefits is more difficult than touching the soul. Some officials are good at saying one set, which is a typical hypocritical "two -sided person". The power operation restrictions and supervision mechanisms are not perfect, and the phenomenon of abuse of power, conspiracy, corruption, corruption, etc. have not been effectively curbed. If the water source is polluted and the name of the name is passed, it is difficult to bleach. Public interest departments, personalization of departments, and vulgarization of personal interests are human defects and institutional defects. They are also the nature of bureaucratic institutions. It is no exception in China, but in some regions and units, it is even more powerful.

The senior US diplomat said on Tuesday, May 30 with Swedish Prime Minister Ulff Kristeson that Sweden was eligible to join NATO from the first day, and has taken major measures to solve Turkey's proposal proposal. "Legal" security issues.

Blingken told reporters to reporters in the northern Swedish city, "From the perspective of the United States, it is now time for Sweden to join."

After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Sweden and neighboring Finland began to seek to join NATO. NATO, headed by the United States, has a collective defense agreement, that is, attack on a member is considered an attack on all members.

All members of NATO must be allowed to allow new countries to join the alliance. Finland officially joined NATO last month, but Sweden's application is still under trial.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-31T03-45-07/2-1685503234.jpg)What can President Erdogan look forward to?

Hungary and Turkey have not yet approved Sweden to join, and Ankara is considered a major obstacle. Turkey has accused Sweden with safety asylum for members of the Kurdish worker party. The party was considered a "terrorist" group by Turkey.

In June 2022, Turkey, Sweden and Finland signed a so -called three -sided memo to solve the dissatisfaction of Ankara's banned armed groups.

However, Turkey said that Sweden did not fulfill all its commitments in the agreement. In January, the protest of the Gullan Scripture in Stockholm burned the Burning of the Gulan Classic. The government condemned it. However, the matter further exacerbated the tension between the two countries.

Blingken said on Tuesday, "Turkey has proposed important and reasonable concerns. Both Sweden and Finland have solved these problems. Therefore, it is time to move forward. "It refers to the NATO meeting held in Lithuania in July.

Earlier this week, U.S. President Joe Bynden said that he and Turkish President Rejuep Tetiip Erdoan, who won the re -election on Sunday, discussed Sweden's joining NATO. They also talked about the issue of Turkey's promotion of the purchase of the US fighter F-16.

Bayeng told reporters on Monday, "I congratulate Erdogan. He still wants to cooperate on the F-16. I tell him that we have reached an agreement with Sweden, so let's complete this first."

On Tuesday, Brinken said that the Bayeon government did not think that the US $ 16 transaction with a $ 20 billion of US dollars was related to Sweden to join NATO, but he warned that some American legislators believed that it was associated.

He said, "Some members of Congress, which linked Sweden to NATO and the advancement of the F-16. Congress is a completely equal and independent government department. Of course, their right to speak and voting in any such decision is It's important. "

Congress can veto the government's approved arms transaction, although it has never successfully prevented the sale of weapons to foreign countries.

He said, "We and our allies are committed to and capable of helping Sweden to solve their safety needs, whether it will join tomorrow, two weeks or after a few weeks."

On the other hand, Swedish Prime Minister Criston said that his country is fulfilling his commitment to "Turkish friends" in accordance with the trilateral memo.

He pointed out, "We have always realized that every NATO must make its own decision. Only Turkey can make Turkey's decision. We fully respect this."

In view of Tehran's announcement of continuing to exchange indirect information with Washington and reaching a new agreement between Iran and international atomic energy agencies, experts have different views on the development of the Iranian nuclear agreement crisis.

Researcher Mohammed Salich Sajian, a researcher specializing in regional issues, is optimistic about the possibility of restoring the Iranian nuclear agreement. He also said that Iranian Foreign Minister Hussein Amir Abdullahian issued a statement on this issue Two information was sent to the West. First of all, Tehran hoped that the U.S. government, he claimed that the US government was unwilling to restore the Iran nuclear agreement -applied greater pressure. Second, Tehran confirmed that he insisted on restoring the agreement or benefited from his results.

Mohammed Salich Segian said in an interview with the Peninsula TV station that when Abdullahian issued a statement, it was at the time when Iran and Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Gulf countries were widespread.

Iranian Minister has said that Tehran continues to mediate people through the region and even exchange information with Washington with the European. EU foreign policy official, Hesep Berry, kept in touch.

In contrast to the optimistic position held by Muhammad Salich Sajian, Joseph Chilinjone, a member of the former Secretary of State of the United States, expressed the possibility of a breakthrough in the Iranian nuclear issue and emphasized that Tehran is in The signal was issued in this regard, but the signal was weak. He also said that Iran's talks with the reaching a new consensus with the international atomic energy agency is related to the meeting held by the Secretary of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the next two weeks.

American politicians believe that the restarted nuclear agreement depends on Iran's response to the following requirements: release some prisoners, reduce support for Russia in the Ukraine War, and stop his so -called persecution of Iranian protesters. Some of the symptoms of international atomic agencies are, but it does not do much in solving problems.

Regarding the expectations of the relationship between Tehran and the West under the new situation, Joseph Qilinqiao pointed out in an interview that the transformation between the two parties, especially the reports that the Korean Economic News quoted Seoul Foreign Foreign Affairs and government sources, saying that South Korea And the United States is discussing how to release US $ 7 billion in Iranian funds frozen in Seoul.

Chilinjo said that he is expected to maintain the status of months because "Iranians, Americans, and even Israel do not want to have a conflict."

#### The interests of Iran

Regarding the relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the former consultant of Saudi Arabia Salim Yami confirmed that a agreement he called by Lyad and Tehran. Terms, he also said that if Iran did not find interests in this agreement, it would not take this step because Iran was in trouble because of nuclear issues and the crisis of dislikes with international atomic energy institutions.

Salim Yami believes that Iran has a series of problems and tensions in international relations with Washington, Europe and regional countries, and pointed out that although countries in the region want to contribute to the Iranian nuclear issue, they will solve them. These problems are powerless.

On the other hand, Muhammad Salich Sejian emphasized that Iran specifically seek to restore relationships with Arab and Gulf countries, and believes that strengthening these relationships is conducive to the security and stability of the region.

It is worth noting that since April 2021, Iran and major powers have restarted talks with the Western nuclear agreement signed with the West in 2015. The United States has involved indirectly. Although these talks have made progress, they have not yet reached the understanding of the re -start -up agreement. stage.

With the coordination of the European Union and the indirect participation of the United States, Iran and the parties of the agreement began negotiations in April 2021 to restore the Iranian nuclear agreement. The negotiations in early September 2022 fell into a deadlock. The response is "no constructive."

Six netizens involved were punished by the police for "making rumors", and two of them were detained by administrative detention.

[** Harvest machine is blocked by the people dissatisfied with Henan dial 200 million yuan to save wheat **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/cm-05302023142328.html)*** [Shaanxi vegetable vendors were fined 60,000 for five pounds of celery. ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-08292022080819.html)**

According to Henan Daily, on May 25, the vibrato user "Li Xiang Newspaper Pig" posted a video. In the picture, the blogger pointed to the wheat land behind him and said, "This piece of wheat is yellow. It should be harvested. However, as long as the high -speed intersection is a harvester from other places, it will be detained. You need to show the cross -regional operating license and harvesting driver's license, and it will be fined ... ". It is reported that the video positioning Jiyuan City Chengshi Street, with false content and misleading public opinion. The video has a very high volume, the number of views of 3.645 million, likes 156,000, and 74,000 comments. It is reported that the same video content has also been released by Douyin users "Wang Pei", "Chang'e talked to pigs", "Zhang Han talks about pigs" and "pigle to raise pigs".

For the above cases, some netizens leave a message. It is a fact that the field wheat is soaked in the water in Henan. It is also a fact that a small part of the harvester is deducted on the road. It is only a fictional scene, and the video is basically true. Some netizens questioned, is there really something that needs to be concealed in the local area?

** Six -net civil involved "rumor" videos were detained by administrative detention **

Zhang Jianping, a commentator from Yixing, Jiangsu Yixing, said in an interview with this station on Wednesday that he saw that netizens issued a large number of agricultural harvesters on highway on Henan's highways from multiple self -media. (Inspection station) Tolls are required for vehicles that are suspected of transporting harvesters. According to the law, these agricultural machinery does not require charges, but traffic police and highway toll stations have clevern names, saying that the harvester does not have a certificate. It is for the meal to pull the hair. "

It is reported that after verification by the authorities, Zhao Mouyan (Douyin account "Li Xiang reported pig"), Zhang (Douyin account "Zhang Han talks about pigs"), Wang Moujuan (Douyin account "Wang Pei said pigs "), Meng Mouman (Douyin account" Pig Lele Raise Good Pig "), Li Moua (Douyin account" Chang'e Talking Pig ") and other five people, including Mai Di and Village in Chengliu Town Published. Police disrupted the public order for seven days of administrative detention in the public order with fictional facts, and had four days of administrative detention to Huang. Zhang Mou, Wang Moujuan, Meng Mouman, and Li Mouna were instructed to the four of them because of their light circumstances.

Since May 25, Henan Province has encountered the worst "rotten rain" weather in more than ten years, and the normal maturity harvest of wheat has been greatly affected. According to the Financial Network, there are network sources that a large number of harvesters are blocked at high -speed intersections, which cannot be driven out due to ultra -width and high high, delaying wheat harvest in some places in Henan, causing mature wheat to encounter rainfall and soak water to germinate. The news of "hundreds of harvester cannot be high and high because of high, high, and high speed" once rushed on the hot search.

On Tuesday, Henan Transportation Investment Group Nanyang Branch issued a notice saying that there were 159 carrier transport vehicles from the Tanghe toll station on May 22, during which there were 249 harvester transport vehicles. Slowly pass. Since May 22, 11 toll stations affiliated to Nanyang Branch have not reappeared, and the vehicles are re -retention and cannot be at high speeds.

However, a peasant Li, a farmer in Pingdingshan, told this station that the car that transported the harvester was blocked on the road, causing the mature wheat to soak in the water to germinate: "It is cooked in the ground, and it will germinate in this weather. In the past two days, the transmitting machine is not allowed to let the highway under the highway, and wheat harvesting has a certain period of time. Henan wheat mature starts from south to north. From Zhumadian, Nanyang Rain, the wheat is mature earlier by the Nanyang side, and they encountered (harvester) to prevent the highway from the highway, and it was delayed for a while. "

From May 25th to 30th, the southern Henan region rainfall. According to reports, a 79 -year -old man in Zhengzheng Town, Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou saw the four or five acres of wheat he planted in him.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T04-10-18-08-00/29andersen-image-master1050.jpg)Like most wonderful cable TV series, for me -many things in contemporary life, "Battle of Inheritance"(Succession)Sadness and joy, both entertaining and horrible. This drama with a total of four seasons ushered in a 90 -minute finale on Sunday evening, and "Black Road Family"(Thesopran), "Fire"(The Wire),"breaking Bad"(Breaking Bad)In the same way, it can be ranked among the dark, stimulating, and amazing excellent cable TV dramas, depicting an environment closely related to crime, and also has important and major inspiration for our greedy American reality. But "Battle of Inheritance" did something that had not been done before.

On the surface, this drama blurred fiction and reality in a vivid and interesting way. But its X -factor, that is, it can resonate with such a deep resonance, is that the blur of the fiction and reality in the world in the world is a direct comment on the fiction and reality in the world where our audience is in the world. No TV series can use its real -time approach to some characters and events in this way -and when life suddenly becomes so uncertain and unreal. "Battle of inheritance" lasted 41 hours, spanning for five years, bizarre and confused. In the last season, it led about 8 million viewers into its unique terror valley.

It is not flattering protagonist -a super -rich manipulator, and he has a huge media company with his respectable and cynical children -the outstanding model of social classes that everyone is hateful today. Quite a lot of Americans have begun to understand that in the past few decades, large enterprises and wealthy people have hijacked and corrupted our political economy. This drama resonated because during the same period, the integration of American television news (and politics) and the entertainment industry accelerated, and it played a vital role in the collapse of the country.

It was also in the 1980s and 1990s -at that time, a new consensus was formed in Washington. When the New Deal had passed, in New York, broadcast news only paid attention to ratings- "Time Spirit" became a cliché. Because authors like me started to use it too much. "Battle of inheritance" perfectly seized the spirit of the current era, as well as all of the confusion and contradictions. Of course, the people's anxiety for the elites, the manipulating system, and the inequality of the 1920s are also part of the second gold -plated era. At least 53 million people watched the "VOGUE" magazine in the rich and celebrities filmed in May 1st to attend Metgala [Video](https://www.adweek.com/media/vogue-met-gala-livestream-2023/)Essence The huge budget of HBO allows this drama to show a private aircraft that is dying at any time and the luxurious scenes that require hundreds of temporary actors.

"Film novels" based on well -known figures and real events(novel key)Since the 17th century, it has been very popular, especially in the past 100 years, from "Gentle Night"(Tender Is The Night)To "The Female Devil Wear Plada"(The Devil Wears Prada), And "Citizen Kane" in the meantime(CitizenKane)——The film is based on the establishment of a strong newspaper, magazine, and film company group, William Lundorph Hrst. Today, "Ji" has become the "Kane" in its own type and media, and is the grand film of our time. Logan Roy, his Westa-Royko Group and its "American TV Network"(ATN)Obviously, the current Herst -Rupert Murdoch, his news group, Fox and Fox News as the prototype.

The main theme of the past ten years is that real life is often so similar to the novel -the first black president is then a series of reality stars who have failed business, and then they are popular. Every month is amazing and terrible New miracle of artificial intelligence. "This kind of thing can't be edited," people said. But for the strange incidents that we have survived the endless incident by humor, a new cultural rhetoric is addictive: imagine all this is fictional, and any impossible news is TV series, movies or digitals. The plot turning in the simulation.

The creativity of the screenwriters has been exhausted (Donald Trump flew back to the White House after receiving the new crown hospitalization, and staged the Mussolini -style balcony time). This new drama is too "later" (Ukrainian comedian who plays an ordinary person who plays the president is really a president), which is too incredible (he prevented a shiny war of a supernatural tyrant). The last episode of that season was really playing randomly (one · 6 incident). Then the hearing of the 1st · 6th Incident Committee last year -the effect was amazing, because it was carefully produced by a former ABC News CEO, an unprecedented 10 episodes of multimedia TV series.

However, as far as the United States is concerned, the vagueness of reality and fantasy is not just as simple as it is fascinating. Confusion is a good show of Americans, and also where interests have become a fundamental national habit -from P. T. Banham to Hollywood, from TV gospel to reality shows, it is this habit that makes the United States the United States Become the center of the global entertainment industry. Our wise ancestors still built a wall between the important reality here and the entertainment and fiction there, and set up effective sectors to decide which side of a wall.

In the past half a century, these barriers have gradually gradually collapsed. Americans have changed from a chronic disease to a kind of acute and severe disease, and the spread of entertainment and spread to the entire real world. The most serious is the spread to our information and political system. For this phenomenon, The most responsible is the sources of inspiration of Logan Roy and ATN in reality. At the beginning of this season, Logan told his children: "I love you, but you are too unable to adjust." This can be said to the United States that people in this country now feel that they have the right to have their own facts Just like your own point of view.

The screenwriters and producers of "Battle of Inheritance" strictly insist on depicting the plot of large enterprises, pursuing power for the power itself, and the life appearance in the super rich bubble. Unfortunately, even deliberately stacked and exhausted their brains. Its understanding of senior capitalists is also in place. Most people are not real right -wing believers like Billionaire Charles Koch and Peter Terr, but more like Logan or Rurth Murdoch: Of course, they are the right wing, mainly for individuals, mainly because of individuals. The reason for "greedy is virtue". But for Murdoch and Logan, creating a series of worrying and misleading news propaganda for the issues they do not care about them are only seizing business opportunities and competing with similar programs of friends with their products.

advertiseThere are two opposite risks to write realistic personal and events: one is excessive performance, and "Battle of Inheritance" has never been excessive, and the other is too truthful. It should be pursuing extremely close but never truly touched the harsh reality, just like the magnetic suspension technology makes the high -speed train miraculously floating above the track a few centimeters.

The creator and executor of the play Jesse Armstrong made several major choices that seriously deviated from reality. Our big epidemic has not happened in the world of characters. They almost never mentioned real public figures or companies. The date is not mentioned at all. This is a drama about contemporary news media and politics, which avoids directly handling race and racism or awakening or other cultural wars. The presidential candidate of the main political parties is played by the 54 -year -old and 42 -year -old actor -it is extremely inconsistent with the current reality, but I have no opinion. The most strange thing is that the two words "Republican" and "Democrats" have never been mentioned, which may better complain about the entire system's cynic and corruption.

The setting of the Roy family seems to be compared with reality. Logan is indeed an elderly and powerful, legendary Anglo immigrant. The media empire he founded includes a TV channel that supplys right -wing comments and news. But his success was basically written by him. Murdoch did not decide to sell his entertainment assets to a startup startup of Netflix Fan Er -all of them were Rocky(Loki)Swedes like that. And he was not from scratch, it was the family business inherited from his father in the 1950s.

But like Logan, Murdoch had several wives; similarly, he also gave birth to two sons and a daughter with one of them, and these children have fiercely competed for the successor. Like KF's Roy, James Murdoch has also attended a high school of Hengyu Division and Harvard University (also participated in the work of the school magazine "Harvard Miaowen"), and also rap enthusiasts. But unlike KFC, James Merck is amazing, just as Mo Lin Dade wrote in 2020. People who know Murdoch's two sons say, "James is the wisdom of the two brothers' smart The 'that' is also the more interesting one, "this shows that Roman is at least similar to him. The most like James Murdoch is Hifa, who holds ATN's liberalist, but she is obviously very similar to Elizabeth Murdoch, who married a media planner and in the battle of inheritance. Early marginalized, according to the New York Times in 2019, she was denied [Report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html)She had urged "his father to fire James and let her replace it."

During the seven years of creation and broadcast, this drama has always jumped back and forth between fiction and reality. On November 8, 2016, all actors read the first episode of the first episode for the first time, and on the same day, the exaggerated plot in our real world surpassed the fiction. [It is reported](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/04/rupert-murdoch-cover-story)When Murdoch divorced the fourth wife, Jerry Hall, the agreement asked her not to provide the screenwriter with the story -this fact itself can already bring inspiration to the screenwriters of this play. At the end of the second season, KFC destroyed his relatives. After that, the production of the show was interrupted due to the epidemic, and real life completely performed the "Battle of inheritance"; in eight months, James Murdoch resigned. Trump tried to illegally illegal illegal The results of overthrowing the election, the companies that supplied the voting machine in the election have told Fox News to know the criminals and lied again and again.

James Murdoch told Dodd that he left the family business because Fox News confused what was false and what was true. "Conflict can exist," he said. "But you can't bring private goods. Conflict should not be an excuse for the legitimacy of false information." He also said, "I believe that for excellent news agencies, the mission should be to dispel doubts, rather than the seeds that spread suspicion. Cover the truth."

In the 39 episodes of the Battle of inheritance, I don't remember which Roy family member or other characters have published similar insights on the nature, news and free opinions markets of the truth, news, and free opinions. Sincerity. "Your principle? You have no principles."

The superb skills of the screenwriters make the fiction unlimited close to reality, but not fusion. In a play, the climax is too close to reality, allowing the audience to hear the harsh noise of the plot over the major truth: the election night plot broadcast two weeks ago, the scene was basically located in the ATN headquarters. From the beginning of this series of dramas, the choice of the producer's intuition (in my opinion is also correct) is to never show the content of ATN production or playback. A realistic plot episode describing TV production is almost impossible to call. If the characters in the play also report and comment on the recent real events (such as HBO's "News Editor Room"), the response is likely to be quite bad.

The general election night described in "Battle of Inheritance" is the combination of the past two reality elections. In 2016, a Republican candidate who was friendly to fascist attitude accidentally won, and in 2020, Fox News boldly and accurately concluded at midnight and accurately concluded The candidate lost Arizona, followed by the turbulence of the Swing State for several days until he finally acknowledged the defeat.

In the election night in the play, the children of the Roy family were busy in the news editor room, and in real time, they controlled the details of the report. (As far as we know, Murdoch has never done such a thing.) They announced regardless of the fictional Republican candidates who have a friendly attitude towards fascism. The reason why they did this was to exchange for the collaboration of a candidate for a business plan. As a result, a blatant and corrupt non -democratic election was caused by a coincidence that the former president who was friendly to fascist attitude in reality claimed that this was this that this was this is that this was this that this was this that this was it. What happened in himself in 2020.

For those who were scarlet with unexpected victory in 2016, and then tortured by the long waiting of the final result in 2020, they are now scared for Trump's prospects for Trump in 2024, "" The worst case of inheritance in the battle of inheritance is completely experienced the trauma and induced the inner fear. But I think the problem of this plot is not here.

advertise

The evidence we see now shows that Fox knows that the conspiracy theory that the election results promoted by the election in 2020 are wrong. The reason why it spreads this conspiracy theory is to cater to the preferences of the audience. As for the critical juncture that may determine its life and death in reality, "Battle of Inheritance" uses such a super realist method to depict an alternative fact of recent elections, so as to tease the audience's doubts and fear. It is irresponsible.

But this is the end of this drama. The follow -up plot was Logan's burial, and the contradictory mourning mourning profoundly summarized his most powerful and terrible quality. With the slogan of Fox News, it was really a fair and fair funeral. At the finale of the play, the board of directors voted whether the family business controlled by the inheritance of the inheritance of the inheritance people who sold the horizontal horn is the only important voting.The plot of the last episode once made us believe that the children of the Roy family matured a bit, at least they could feel the feelings of ordinary people, such as playing in the sea and playing in the kitchen of their mother late at night. However, on the cold working day, they were still so selfish. Roman escaped, and Hifa took out the means to deserve his name (SHIV [Shiv] also has a razor. -Translated), and KFC's ending shows that as long as the Prince Party is willing, a person's life is the most in life. The real and bitter facts can become bubbles. "Battle of inheritance" does not grow with redemption characters. It is a beautiful ugliness from beginning to end.

At the end of, the drama successfully made the details that inspired and urged it in the real world to clear the boundaries. It creates its own fictional world. But this world is strongly related to our real world. Over time, the rumors about the children of the Roy family (and Tom!) Will eventually calm down, and the debate with their luxurious and exquisite life or temptation or disgust will dissipate. What should be remembered is the truth about the corruption effect of power unrestrained in the play. People who are in high levels are unimaginable. The confusion, confusion, and fear brought.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T05-35-33-08-00/30Ukraine-Ledeall-czhk-master1050.jpg)On Tuesday, a large number of attack drones were shot down over Moscow. This is the first time that the Russian capital civilian living area was directly affected by the conflict of Ukraine. This shows that for ordinary Russians, this war is still very far away.

The attack of drones did not cause much loss, which only affected one high -end community. Some windows were broken, and some people suffered slight injuries. However, the psychology of citizens may have long been far from the far -reaching impact. Before that, they had lived a normal life and did not think about bleeding outside the border.

"If the goal is to put pressure on the people, the fact that the fact that drones appear drone above Moscow have contributed to this," [[Russian blogger who supports war](https://t.me/rybar/47765)Mikhail Zwinchuk wrote with a net name Rybar.

There were at least eight drones that appeared this time, and it appeared when Russia conducted a violent air attack on the Ukraine capital Kiev. Although President Putin blame Ukraine in Ukraine, no one was killed in Moscow on Tuesday. The situation of Kiev was different, and one was killed in Russia's attack.

Ukrainian President Zelelo's consultant Mihajilo Podolia said that Ukraine did not "directly participate" in the attack, but "very happy" saw the incident on the other side of the border. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman [Refusing to comment](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3716007-air-force-refuses-to-comment-on-drone-attack-in-moscow.html)The military usually has a blurring attitude of attacking Russian territory.

Russian officials and Ukrainian allies seem to be cautiously choosing a word when responding to the attack.

Since the beginning of the war in February 2022, the United States has transported a large number of military equipment to Ukraine, but U.S. officials have made it clear that they do not want these equipment to be used to attack the Russian territory to avoid conflict upgrades.

On Tuesday, they seemed to have a flash of words about this position.

The US State Department and the National Security Council both issued a statement saying that the United States "generally" does not support attacks in Russia, but pointed out that Tuesday is the 17th attack Kiev in Russia on Tuesday.

Another ally in Ukraine Britain went further.

British Foreign Minister James Cleverly said that Ukraine "has the right to project force to overseas to weaken Russia's attacks, and overseas military goals are" considered to be the legal component of national self -defense internationally. " Cleverly said that he did not master the details of the drone attack, but only spoke for the general situation.

In Moscow, the invasion of drones caused questioning to the Russian air defense system. Cremlin officials tried to deny the seriousness of the attack, although the incident would change the status quo.

"Obviously what needs to be done to increase the density of the capital's air defense system," Putin said. "And we will do this."

However, the ruling party member Andre Gurutov said that compared with the drone, the people in the center of Moscow are more likely to be hit by a battery car. "We do well today," he told the official news media.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed to shot down five drones and interfered with three signals.

Russia seized some Ukrainian territory in 2014 and invaded the country in full. It is expected that it will quickly and decisively win. Instead, the Ukrainian army made Russia difficult.

Now, after the Russian tank has entered Ukraine for more than a year, a series of embarrassing attacks in Russian territory show that Russians are vulnerable to damage even in China.

Earlier this month, drone [exploded over the Kremlin Palace](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/world/europe/kremlin-drone-attack-explained.html)U.S. officials said the attack was likely to be launched by a special forces or intelligence department of Kiev.

Just last week, the Anti -Cremlin militarium launched a two -day [Vietnamese attack] in southern Russia.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/world/europe/russia-belgorod-ukraine-attacks.html) ，可能引发一系列新的战场问题。周二报道了一起类似的袭击事件。

位于弗吉尼亚州的非营利性研究机构CNA的俄罗斯研究顾问萨姆·本德特表示，俄罗斯容易受到无人机攻击，部分原因是其幅员辽阔——与乌克兰的边界超过2200公里——但也因为其防空雷达旨在探测比无人机更大的飞机和导弹。

他说，除了在俄罗斯制造易受攻击的感觉外，乌克兰的无人机袭击还可能用于测试莫斯科的防空系统，并找出可其他攻击可以利用的潜在弱点。

俄罗斯面临的部分挑战是调整环绕莫斯科的复杂防空系统以应对新时代的威胁。

“以前，城市附近的防空系统会无视任何小于直升机的东西，”华盛顿智库战略与国际研究中心 [ 导弹防御项目](https://www.csis.org/programs/international-security-program/missile-defense-project)Ian Williams said. "The size of the small drone on the radar may be similar to a goose, so if you adjust your radar to find the enemy's drone, you will also see a lot of birds at the same time."

Nevertheless, it has not been confirmed that Ukraine launched a Tuesday attack behind the scenes, and people still have many important questions about Ukraine's drones.advertise

On Tuesday, U.S. defense officials said that the next round of weapons to Ukraine will include missiles for the Patriot air defense system and more rockets for HIMARS mobile systems. The $ 300 million military assistance plan may be announced on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Yefgen Perigo, the person in charge of the powerful Russian mercenary organization Wagner, said that the attack highlighted the backward technology of Russia in the drone war, and once again accused Russian military officials, he They have always accused them of incompetence.

"When the drone with explosives is broken into the window, what should ordinary people do?" A piece he posted on Telegram [audio message](https://t.me/Prigozhin_hat/3514)In the middle, he also said, "People have sufficient rights to ask them these problems."

Poligon pointed out that some drones crashed in the neighborhoods where Russia's military and political are living. "Let your homeland burn," he said. "You" here refers to those who want people.

Former quasi -military organization leader Igor Gilkin, who has been calling for upgrading the Ukrainian war for a long time, stated on Telegram that "the psychological strike caused by drones attack Moscow is not the scale of destruction, but lies in the promise of national leaders to us. It's not a war, but a special military operation. "

"What we get is not a honest dialogue with a country, but the vague comfort given by Napoleon after conquering Moscow: Don't worry, everything will be performed as planned," he said. "What is the real plan?"

Russian politician in Paris Tatiana Stanova said that the lack of war leadership ability under Putin's leadership is becoming more and more obvious.

"Everything is based on the concept of a 'hidden country' that he often expresses. This country understands everything and can tolerate everything," she was on Tuesday [on Telegram](https://t.me/stanovaya/1626)Written. "let us wait and see."

Some people are gloating to Moscow in the UAV and missile attacks.

During the Russian attack this week, the 32 -year -old Kiev's customer manager Samir Memedov had to take refuge at the subway station. He said, "They can feel our feelings here every day, which is really good."

Another Kiev resident Yulia Hongchalolova said she was in a complicated mood.

"I don't think we should bomb their residential area at night," she said. "But I really hope that they can feel what the alarm is living, just like people who live in Kiev, Halkov, Diebello, Diebello, Same."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T05-56-13-08-00/00CLI-STOVES-cover_resized-master1050.jpg)Every morning, when a million Americans lit the gas stove boiling water or make potato pancakes in the kitchen, it is not only the fragrance of breakfast across the home. The blue flame will also release harmful pollutants, such as nitric oxide, and gas that causes the earth to warmer.

Therefore, a group of scientists at Stanford University recently started a series of tests for New York City apartments to better understand the degree of pollution and how pollution flows from one room to another in a real family. This is part of the research of 10 cities. The research shows how pollutants quickly enter the living room and bedroom, sometimes far beyond the area where the stoves that produce pollution.

Because of the concerns of the impact of gas stoves on health and climate, some cities and states have begun to seek gradually in new buildings [eliminate](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/gas-stove-ban-ny.html)If natural gas access, the federal government has also begun to strengthen the energy efficiency standards of gas stoves.

On a refreshing Sunday morning, scientists from Stanford University came to their first stop in New York City: a public housing project in the morning highland of Shangcheng, Manhattan. Their first challenge was to move about 136 kg of equipment to the 18th floor. "I hope there can be an elevator," Rob Jackson, a professor and a team leader at the University of Stanford University, said worryingly.(There are indeed elevators.)

The three -bedroom apartment they visited was Tina Johnson's home, and she had three adult children. This apartment overlooks the elevated rails. The kitchen is full of vanilla and spices. She uses them to make her favorite dish -American -style vegetables. Johnson just made a breakfast including fried eggs and potatoes.

"I'm glad you can come," she told researchers. She said that her apartment had just installed a new stove, but she still "could not stand" the smell of gas in the stove. Johnson said she voluntarily participated in the study through a local climate organization because she and her children had asthma and other health problems; she wanted to know what their stoves had a impact on their breathing air.

** Tube with the height of Qi Nose **

The researchers began to start an analyzer and set up a tube at about the height of the nose to inhale air samples. After taking the background reading, the gas can be opened, and they will drive a stove to the fire.

The machine quickly detected changes: increased nitrogen dioxide concentration -this substance will [have various negative effects on health](https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution/basic-information-about-no2), Including stimulating the respiratory system, aggravating the symptoms of respiratory diseases, and leading to asthma. The concentration climbed to 500 % of 1 billion, which was set by the Environmental Protection Agency [Five times the one -hour exposure of safety benchmark](https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution/primary-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-nitrogen-dioxide)Essence (The concentration of benzene has also been doubled, which is a carcinogen that exists in cigarettes and car tail gas.)

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T05-56-13-08-00/00CLI-STOVES-TinaJohnson-tlbf-master1050.jpg)Johnson said that she chose to participate in a furnace test research because she and her children both had asthma. She wanted to know how the stove's gases influenced on their health. Calla Kessler Forthe New York Times

This is when the kitchen door is sealed and the windows are closed. Johnson's kitchen has not been installed in hoods that help ventilate.

Johnson opened the door and window of the kitchen. She said that when cooking, doors and windows are usually opened. This can reduce the concentration of nitrogen dioxide to about 200 billion points. But this also means that the smell of oil fume will float into other rooms.

One of the bedroom nitrogen dioxide concentrations reached about 70 %, which was lower than the threshold of the Environmental Protection Agency, but much higher than that of [the long -term exposure standard of the WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228)Essence

More and more scientific evidence has proven that the gas stove constitutes a health risk. [A paper] published at the end of last year(https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/75)It is found that nearly 13%of American asthma cases are related to gas furnaces. A previous study showed that the gas furnace can also cause the symptoms of asthma.

People can take some simple measures to reduce risks, such as opening window ventilation and purchasing air purifiers.

** "Dinner Party Scene" ** **

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T05-56-13-08-00/00CLI-STOVES-levels-gwbt-master1050.jpg)

The next day, the research team went to another place, this time it was a Airbnb apartment in Harbin. Their goal is to create a "big family or dinner party scene", and the research team member and Ph.D. in Stanford University Earth System Science Aeni Kashtan said.

In order to reduce their contact, the team members chose to stay on a balcony overlooking the upper Manhattan, and from time to time, they held their breath and rushed in to check the test index.

For about 40 minutes, the nitrogen dioxide level in the living room has a maximum of 200 billion, the bedroom reaches 300, and the kitchen reaches 400, which is twice, three times, and four times that of the one -hour exposure threshold of the Environmental Protection Bureau. The benzene concentration rose to three times after igniting the stove.

The gas stove here is equipped with a range hood. "But you feel here," Kashtan said, his hand reached out of the hot air from the edge of the machine without being drained by the range hood. This shows that the range hood "does not play a lot of role" on improving air quality, he said.

The team conducted a one -day test in eight apartments in New York City. Among them, a Brooklyn apartment had a strange feature of New York, which confused researchers: the windows were sealed by plastic film. Nina Domingo said it was to keep warm, and she and two roommates lived in the unit on this first floor. But this also means that the ventilation will not be smooth. Considering that there is no range hood in the kitchen, it cannot be discharged outdoors. This is a worrying situation.

In the area where the kitchen is located, the concentration of nitrogen dioxide quickly rose to about 2.5 times the threshold of the Environmental Protection Bureau.

The team obtained a preliminary result, but it is consistent with a series of scientific research that established a series of scientific research between the previously established scientific research between the discharge of the gas furnace and the harmful pollution that affects the climate change and the harmful pollution of public hygiene. Earlier research also showed that there are still emissions after the gas furnace is turned off, because the stove will leak natural gas. The main component of this gas is methane, a powerful greenhouse gase.

Change may be about to happen.

More than 60%of American families are already using electric furnaces. The Bayeng government has proposed to expand the scope of energy efficiency regulations of the gas furnace. In addition to climate and health benefits, it is expected to save people's $ 100 million in energy costs. The ban was issued.

I often ask about cryptocurrency seminars, once when I said that cryptocurrencies should not be used as currencies. I said at the time that the only reason to use it beyond speculation was to buy drugs on the Internet. The questioner retorted that the statement was too ridiculous, and the use of cryptocurrencies was far more than that.

Cryptocurrency pursuers believe that claiming it is wrong to help criminal acts, because this technology itself is "neutral", so no illegal activities can be blamed for it. But this is not a fact at all: cryptocurrencies are a payment mechanism designed to avoid censorship. Cryptocurrency transactions will not receive fraud detection, anti -money laundering or suspicious activities as traditional transactions. Operation outside the system is the reason for its existence. Just see how the cryptocurrency industry runs, it will know that being used for crime is not its loopholes, but its characteristics.

It is easy to understand. For example, he will say, "You are like his second aunt who are the second aunt, why let others like you for no reason."

Feng Tang's expression is very frank, which also gives me the opportunity to calm and dismiss charm. He himself said that he will only spend time with two types of people in the future: real, fun; really, good -looking.

At the end of last year, Feng Tang registered the company. For the first time in so many years, he started his business as a founder. He hopes to teach the training and mentality that he has experienced in the past, and he calls it "successful learning."

Feng Tang's first axiom of his success is defined like this: at any time, you must pursue the best utilization and maximization of resources.)Essence This seems to be the first criterion for his own years. From Xiehe Reading to starting a business this year, he has maintained the habit of doing things 80-100 hours a week. This habit has not changed for more than 30 years. The energy is used to the extreme.

The Air Travel APP began to record his flight journey since 2012. In addition to exceeding 99.9%of users a total of millions of kilometers of flight records, his right hand has an obvious hard cocoon above his hand. The luggage, dragging the traces of a tool box -like bag. In recent years, four personal calligraphy works exhibitions have been held. His right -handed thumb and middle finger have also begun to have cocoons.

In addition to hard work, he is indeed self -disciplined. The so -called self -discipline is to confront humanity, arrange your sleeping diet in life, and insist on running three times a week. Although there is often a wine bureau who loves drinking, he also knows what the amount he is. He must go home on time and complete the "manuscript debt" on time. This is the most basic in Feng Tang. Lightly say that professional players have to be like this. I think some people are born with this constitution, but people who can see him diligently and self -discipline can not see much.

From a secular perspective, Feng Tang started working from 2000 and left from CITIC Capital in 2021. It can be said that he has caught up with the golden golden golden age of social development. With the wind of the times, he became Feng Tang today. After three leading companies, each of which is a high position, the trading is over 100 billion -level projects, bringing over tens of thousands of people.

He has published nearly 20 publications, with only four books of "successful series", and the circulation is close to 3 million. In mid -April, the "Never Democratic" started to sell lessons. For private class classes with faster 20,000, the team and him had no confidence to fill the students. He still thought that he could not pull some friends in private to support the show. After the live broadcast is over, the trainees have been recruited for two periods.

Of course, if you only see Feng Tang's sunny achievements and his diligence and self -discipline, it is at most to see the cherry on a cream cake.

He has severe anxiety and obsessive -compulsive disorder. Doctors diagnose his schizophrenic tendency 155 times higher than ordinary people. In the early years, whether he had trained in the coordinated gynecological internship doctor, or was a devil -like training and a strategic adviser in McKinsey, "such as the abyss, like a thin ice" was engraved in his bones. He was afraid of making mistakes, obsessed with details, and people who worked with Feng Tang particularly could feel his anxiety and compulsory. In 2020, a brand found Feng Tang and hoped to cooperate with an official Chinese font. When I first started contact, facing such an opportunity, Feng Tang asked himself and the team: "Why find us?"

In the process of creative fonts, you need to let him write 8,000 handwriting on the grid paper, and you can install hundreds of words on one page of paper. Among them, the wrong writing can originally score in the next grid. Since 0. He couldn't stand scratches on his mobile phone, and he couldn't stand anything unsatisfactory on what he created.

He did not have his own life, and he would not use a microwave oven and washing machine. He summarized with him for seven years with him: "The boss is very bitter, anyway, he gives me a life, I can't."

During the three -hour dialogue, he always reflected contradictions, but did not conflict because he could make the two ends of the contradiction complement each other.

He was regarded as narcissistic by the outside world, but he was actually inferior. From my short observation, his unconfidential observation is mainly reflected in the beginning of talking to a stranger at the beginning. When the students who faced the online students were officially lived in the first game, they still seemed a little shy at first, and their eyes did not dare to facing the camera.

He is good at writing novels and poetry, and writing beautiful and moving girls in her mind. Spring breeze is not as good as you; but he also said that being a business management, he must have a public heart. Or is it the love novel, Feng Tang, who has swollen heart?

He is a rational strategic adviser, but he is a literati, and he recruits the traditional Chinese culture. When an example of the mall, he uses all the people and things in the history books. This has nothing to do with his professional literacy.

In the dialogue, our consensus is "Feng Tang cannot be copied." Among them, there is the luck of the times. If you come again, he may not be able to do this today. He is not all for everything. Some things that he cannot control will still make him have some unpleasant ambitions and unwilling heart. At that time, he left from the position of McKinsey's partner and went to China Resources half to become CEO of China Resources Medical. In the first two years, I was particularly hard to survive. If the medical reform continued to persist in the medical reform in that position at that time, there may not be Feng Tang's story and today's "success learning". He will not choose to be a one today Teacher who teaches people. But there is no if there is no life. After 50 years, Feng Tang said he was destined.

We talked about what "things are in front of others", and talked about the daily life of "ruthless people". What is the reason for him to make him "successful" when he is half a hundred years old The concept of successful learning is promoted.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-31T06-21-33-00-00/000182842_piclink.jpg)** 1. Talk about things **

** FT Chinese website: "Successful things, more things, continuing more things." When I heard this sentence at the beginning, I felt quite in line with the values of the current society, but would it be too tool for people? **

Feng Tang: In the past, many people understood the wrong understanding. We are a social organization, everyone is a social person. In a relatively narrow time, we are part of the organizational machine. You have your role. You have to do your due diligence to complete your work. Heavy is better than yourself.

I have read a lot of professional managers I have particularly respectful. I think they do not say that the grades are particularly good, or extremely clever, but the drama is greater than heaven, and things are greater than others. This is a type of person who I like to work together very much in the past.

** FT Chinese website: Have you ever experienced McKinsey and then went to the state -owned enterprise. Are these top -level people who see this? **With so many individuals, you can only take your goals and vision out of things. Putting things on your own emotions and even interests, so I dare to give him things to him. He has done things, a sense of honor, satisfaction, and being rewarded in some form, such as money and promotion. Then he will get more things on the next platform. Then this kind of virtuous cycle will make him last more, which is the so -called positive cycle.

Conversely, you can imagine this vicious cycle. Every time I think about it, I am a different fireworks. I am not happy about my little brother and sister. I look unhappy this person. We often hear such complaints, but one of them separated is-- —What do you have to do, what do you want to do, and what kind of purpose do you have to achieve. Everyone comes to work at work, not to make you happy, not let you achieve your own satisfaction. We are here to do things. You are an individual, and people are also an individual. manage?

** FT Chinese website: This is a state of "all -around narcissism" in psychology, and it is also normal humanity. **

Feng Tang: If you walk along this human nature, you always remember that when you were young, I was likely, and it was likely to become a joke.

This is also a certain degree of energy management. If you have a lot of energy always concentrated in maintaining how powerful I am, how strong I am, how can I make my emotions particularly comfortable. Compared to another situation, you use your energy more to control yourself, motivate teams, manage projects, and continue to achieve more and more resources. I think this is two directions. I agree The second direction. So from this perspective, they always say that I am a "dating madness", and I want to say that "the dating crazy" is a fool, I just seek truth from things.

Take a step back, even if I found a suitable post for you, the personnel match, you believe it or not, no 100%makes you comfortable. I have experienced so many jobs and I have not completely made people comfortable.

** FT Chinese Website: Did you not have it from McKinsey to China Resources to CITIC? **

Feng Tang: None of them. I will give you an example. In China Resources, I am the general manager of the strategic department of the entire group. Its business is scattered enough, enough for my brain burning, because it is a trillion -dollar asset, it is big enough, but is it comfortable? Intersection Whether it becomes a bureau -level cadre, will it suppress the part of my creation? Some books cannot be released, because after all, I am a person in the system. Secondly, my salary was halved by half, and at the beginning, I thought that the workload would be halved, then I recognized it, and found that the salary was really halved.

Besides, in the central enterprises, because many people have been doing it for more than ten years and twenty years. I just went to an outsider and had to spend a lot of time to build trust with others. So, do you like these these? Who doesn't like to make more money, and at the same time, if you don't need to be flattering, do you make money? But if you want to do things in this environment, a lot of things should be done.

** FT Chinese website: A word is popular now, providing emotional value, whether in work partners or intimate relationships. **

Feng Tang: Then you think about why you say that from a young age, others have to surround me, and you have to coax me. You have to do it in my way?

In addition, a similar misunderstanding is that many people ask me how to find a soul partner. I said that you find a mirror to take a picture. Do you see the soul inside? You just want others to take care of you and let others comfort you, that's all, but what do you give others? What did you do for your parents and brothers? What did you pay for this world?

Therefore, the youth of the arts and arts becomes a derogatory term, and the problem is here. He thought he was very unique. In fact, he was so ordinary that he couldn't be ordinary. It was useless to use it. You might as well be useful to this society first. Getting the benefits, you can meet some of your needs, and it will be difficult to do in turn.

** FT Chinese website: In front of people, the matter itself sounds very common, but it is very anti -commonplace. **

Feng Tang: This is anti -human. I have a nine -character mantra, not anxious, not afraid, shameless.

The so -called shamelessness, my official explanation before, just said that don't care about his comment, others praise you or degrade you, it is nothing more than that you are not good. I don't care about this thing, boast you into a flower, that is, it is a praise you, and you don't necessarily do it. Scolding you into a pile of shit, that is also others scolding you. You don't have to spend so much energy and time to justify him.

The other meaning of the shamelessness is to put things before your face vanity, and you can first achieve things. In fact, things become, and the overall well -being of everyone will become. But if you don't have it, can your face continue?

I have a very good investment brother. I saw all the dossiers. I didn't lose for 30 years. I asked him what the trick was. He said a public heart, what is the public heart? Is this the first consideration, right? Don't think about how many people do this, how many people do you, how powerful this is. Things are in front of people, things are in front of the face, you can avoid errors caused by individual limitations.

** FT Chinese website: What is the specific performance in your past work experience before people? **

Feng Tang: Actually, this has been subtle for many years. Every time my McKinsey mentor sees the first sentence I ask: "Is everything under control?" I never asked me unhappy.

We were the same as a doctor, but no one asked the doctor if you are happy, why do you make? Let you cure the disease and save people. Why do people pay you millions of consulting fees? Let you solve the complex management problems of others. This is such a set of outlook on life that has been formed for a long time.

** FT Chinese website: Is this the core professional spirit of professional managers? The so -called previous companies talk about "we only recruit adults." **

Feng Tang: Yes, it is a lot smooth as I just said, you are comfortable to the world, and the world is comfortable to you.

So I think that the real gentleman is not attached to what he wants to be, you can't say that I am water or I am a cup, and the others are not doing. He should keep pace with the times, just think about what he is going to do now, how to do this well, step by step, and continue to work. Slowly you find that the abundance of your life is far more than your perseverance at your own point. In the children's world.

** FT Chinese website: Maintaining the face is still very common by our side. How do you realize that "things" must be in the face and before vanity? Did you realize that he had fallen and made a mistake in the past? **

Feng Tang: I don't think it ’s. On the other hand, there is a“ consciousness ”first, that is, you first realize that you are not the center of the world. You need to give others a reason to like you. You need to recognize that you are a leader. You have to give others reasons for others. Because they are not your father, not your mother, right?

The thing that realizes this is through a lot of reading. This is why I read a lot of history. In fact, I think that in various texts in the world, Chinese has the longest and most complete written history. From the beginning of Spring and Autumn for 2500 years, this kind of humanity that spans the large scale time, I think it is easy to let me know what the most common nature of this human nature is; because there are many things that happened, and some cases are fierce. This is why China is China. People especially emphasize reading history books. I think the second one, I am a particularly introverted person, so I always think about why others give me this opportunity, why do others follow me, and why do others like me? I always feel that I need to give others some reasons.** 2. Talk about entrepreneurship **

** FT Chinese website: In 2021, you are just 50 years old. For example, many people will say that I start with the three characters, starting with the four characters. At a certain moment, you will feel that you can have some mental anxiety. ? **

Feng Tang: Actually, it is not anxious. I may look at the changes in these age more calmly, but changes in age must have an impact on the body and mental state. The epidemic made me very rarely pressed the pause key, making me think of a special core question -how do I spend my time for the next half of my life, and the remaining effective time is likely to be less than I think Essence

On the other hand, my own intuition feels that it may be more attenuated in more than ten years. I am now fifty years old, and my physical strength and energy are actually not much different when I am 30 or 40 years old; and you have to say experience, emotional management, and even some wisdom. It may now be the best time and the age of right.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-31T06-21-33-00-00/000182844_piclink.jpg)** FT Chinese website: Is 50 -year -old Feng Tang still in the right age? **

Feng Tang: For so many years, I have been pondering things, helping people officers, and my own officers. It has always been such a state. In fact, you say that you are tired or tired; but the person who really wants to do things, I also tell the team that it is first to put the so -called energy management first. Sleep well, eat good things, don't catch a cold for three days, and grab clothes in a cold place, right?

You are a bottle of red wine, it is best not to drink two bottles. Don't get yourself in a too complicated relationship, including you moderate exercise, don't say that in order to pursue the best yourself, then you can train it if you think of what you want to do. Energy output.

I don't think it ’s a professional manager. Any important thing that any professional player should have is that you have to have your mind as you can make it continue to open up; energy management is super important, or even It is more important and more basic than what you learn, how much it is to improve, and how much to do. Even if your car is so beautiful, no oil, and you can't drive it, is it equivalent to not right? You can't drive to the so -called place you want to drive. In fact, you can go for a lot of these basic things, and you can go for a long time.

** FT Chinese website: Over 50 years old, will Chinese people pay attention to retreat? **

Feng Tang: I think it is a matter of life. In other words, I know what kind of natural problems in my own mind, such as anxiety, such as paranoia, etc., I need to do things. If I have the opportunity to contribute, I want to use my strength. Otherwise, this energy can take you to do a very brilliant thing, and these energy will destroy you.

** FT Chinese website: This is a very interesting explanation. **

Feng Tang: Many things have two sides.

** FT Chinese website: Are you talking about energy, if this energy is not well arranged, it may also use a very dangerous place? **

Feng Tang: For example, I chose another way to live in the second half of my life, clean up the house at home, and eat it myself. It's all.

For example, I want to find such four or five people who eat, drink, and listen to my bragging, and then arrange a meal to feel that the problem of two or three years is not a big problem. Then I blinked in the blink of an eye in ten years and twenty years. Think about how to live for so many years before death. I think it ’s better to do something. You blow all day and blow for 10 years. The sense of satisfaction I give me a lot.

** FT Chinese website: Have you ever seen some strong winds and waves, and are unwilling and unwilling? **

Feng Tang: Actually, during the epidemic, I also had writing and painting, and I did n’t care much about it, but frankly, I am not particularly happy, especially I think I am now in the same age. Wandering me comfortably.

** FT Chinese website: Many people feel that they must suffer in work? **

Feng Tang: This bitterness is actually relative. Your suffering may be sugar for others, and my sugar may be bitter for others. Some people always say that I have not suffered. I said that I suffer from this suffering, and you may not be able to eat it.

In addition, you still have to have a correct mentality for people who like to work. Do n’t complain so much if you can work. What are too tired? In the face of uncertainty and anxiety, this is normal. This is a part of work. Don't be crooked all day, it is Guan Gong Wu Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Kukou, you can just do it.

** FT Chinese Website: So "Never" is one of the things you found after the age of 50? **

Feng Tang: I think it is management training. The so -called post -MBA management cultivation is the first suitable for me. I have all kinds of knowledge structure and various experiences. The second is that no one stopped me in this matter, and I could make my strength. Third, the so -called competitors are very limited, and they can't even talk about competition. We do a new thing. Structurally expressing this important thing. Without university teachings, we have filled a little blank; and this new thing can make the world a better People stop, and then make friends live a good life in the process. If you can find a suitable point that can make you force, it is already a very happy thing for people who love to work, I think you must cherish it, don't look forward to it. It is nothing more than continuing to manage your energy, or to maintain your long -term output state; then deal with huge pressure, tired of tiredness, and stress.

** FT Chinese website: What is the pressure of doing things? **

Feng Tang: The biggest pressure comes from we are talking about "success", but if I did not do this by myself, I couldn't even sell it.

** FT Chinese website: What are you mainly responsible for at this stage of entrepreneurship? **

Feng Tang: Responsible for three things: content creation, determining strategy, IP management.

** FT Chinese website: What is IP management? **

Feng Tang: IP management is not to collapse. I can't do something that violates public order and good customs.

** FT Chinese website: I feel that you have used Feng Tang's personal time and energy to the extreme now. I just want to say that this is a good business model? **

Feng Tang: This is a good question. I started to do it from the first day. I have wondered how this matter can be playing with me alone. You can also ask more direct, as a company's sustainability, how can you scalable.

You want to next Zhang Xiaoquan scissors and Wang Mazi kitchen knives, these are all around. After you have the core, you expand again. It is far more than you say that you are not doing big now, and then "Ding Dong" is not strong when you come out in the end, right? The brand still has to be erected first to let everyone recognize that this is a good thing. At this price, it is a particularly valuable thing, and then think of expansion. In fact, although we are doing a content output industry, I think there are scalability.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-31T06-21-33-00-00/000182845_piclink.jpg)

Feng Tang: This sounds a bit like a bragging component, the first business school in the universe; but from the paid user, we have passed 50,000, and now we are actually going to 100,000. For example, the business school I was studying was more than 100 students a year. If there were tens of thousands of students, this is already the largest business school in the universe.

** FT Chinese website: This sounds a bit like, you want to present your experience of Zhang Haipeng for more than two decades to everyone. **

Feng Tang: In the same sentence, I am in Xiehe's tutor gynecological academician Lang Jing and you tell you "girl, you are okay", and the uncle on the street tells you "girl, you're okay", can it be an energy level?

It is a coincidence that I see me a little. I have been in McKinsey for 7 years, and I am a global director of directors; I have been the leader of China Resources Group's strategy for 10 years, and I have been the leader of CITIC Capital responsible for medical investment. Now it is also the largest hospital group in China and even Asia. In addition, I started reading "Historical Records" since the age of 11 and two, and I started to read "Zi Zhi Tong Jian" at the age of 17 and eighteen. After reading 40 years of Chinese history books; I still have two years of Western MBA science education. If you combine these together, it is not easy to find four or five people in China.

** FT Chinese website: The key is that you think the "success" can be a church? **

Feng Tang: This is my pressure. I later told myself that I couldn't put so much pressure on myself. I would not be able to teach everyone. If people have trusted me, I try to meet their expectations as much as possible. Of course, I know this is difficult, it is difficult to tune, for example, some people want to say that he can become a good actor, which is difficult to read a book. Can you write it?

** FT Chinese website: Is it clear before this lesson? **

Feng Tang: I told myself so much now. What I can do is to ensure that this one in structured thinking and structured, I provided you with first -class. But if you are lazy or stupid, you are too lazy to use it in your own life. You ca n’t use it if you use it. I ca n’t do it. No one guarantees that you have been to Tsinghua University, and you become a learned person. The purpose of education is to wake up.

** 3. Chatting situation **

** FT Chinese website: But there is still a contradictory place here, that is, to be a person must have a part of self -confidence, which is equivalent to him still to have a certain self. **

Feng Tang: Yes, yes, what do you rely on? I think there are some real hard work. These real skills are not blown out, not God gives you, but based on the so -called talent given to you by God. Funbian. I used to have no confidence before, but then I was a little confident. This kind of self -confidence came from my stupid kung fu, that is, you really have any ability to grow on your body.

For example, the learning ability, McKinsey's team at that time was very small. You often need to connect with different industries and different functions. For example, what cash management and strategic organizations, how to rectify Telecom today, how to get that cargo terminal tomorrow, to be honest, I know ...

After I got it, the first week after I got it, I basically went to bed four or five hours a day. The rest of the time had to rush to see all kinds of things, and you can find one in so many information piles Insert the thread.

Until now I dare to say that no matter whether small and small Chinese and foreign companies, even the top managers, everyone is sitting on a table, and I will not think that I have a level with them. I am more familiar with another thing. I still have confidence in this confidence. These are all caused by learning accumulation. Like these, they are practicing slowly, there is in my heart, and my heart is bottomed.

** FT Chinese website: Do you often say that you will sell your resume? **

Feng Tang: Isn't this nonsense? I have lived for such a half life, and it is not someone else. There are a few things in total.

** FT Chinese website: To this day, will you feel that some of them are given to you in the times, it is a kind of luck? **

Feng Tang: I agree very much. It can be said that it is not part of it, it is given by 100%.

It can be more pirate. In 2000, the average house price in Beijing was 3,000 yuan. I just graduated in the first year of graduation. I earned 1 million yuan in Beijing. What does this feel? I could shake my shirts in Beijing. At that time, I bought a very good apartment by the Embassy area of the United States, 8,000 yuan a flat.

But do you think you do n’t say anything else today. Can you still have the opportunity to get in McKinsey when he graduated from the Emperor Qingbei and then entered McKinsey? What do you say to work with your personal efforts?

Many people are unwilling to admit this, thinking that they can copy and nonsense. You said Ma Yun, Ma Huateng, and Li Yanhong, let them repeat their success today. I feel embarrassed. I think it is impossible.

** FT Chinese website: So hard work is useless? **

Feng Tang: But what I want to say at the following level is that with a certain kind of concept and cultivation, he can always make something.

** FT Chinese website: No matter what situation? **

Feng Tang: Regardless of any situation. You, for example, me, to this day, I think there is a high probability event. I can still write two or three novels, and I can also write some poems. I can still be a literati.

Second, I think I can still be a qualified manager, a qualified professional manager, that is I think I am competent, and the basic ability judgment is there. As for whether it can become Feng Tang today, I can do things in the same way. I do n’t know.

So this is where I feel lucky and responsible, that is, it is really difficult to come up with such a person now.

** FT Chinese website: Whether it is young people who are very difficult for employment now, or people over the age of 35 in the Internet industry, how can they deal with the current situation and their own mentality? **

Feng Tang: The second axiom of the golden line I wrote is that there is no perfect solution, but there is always the best plan at the moment. The underlying logic is that there are always the best ways.

Although the opportunity for 20 years ago cannot be copied now, you can now have these two or three years. If you go carefully and combine your own characteristics, you will find that it is also the past 20 years or even 5 years ago and 10 years ago. You ca n’t imagine before, do n’t complain about the past, there is nothing now.

Don't say that it is harmful to others, don't wait, see what can be done, and combined with your own characteristics, this is the real goal, find a direction and cut it down.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-31T06-21-33-00-00/000182846_piclink.jpg)** FT Chinese website: Fifty and knowing destiny, don't talk about destiny first, do you believe in fate? **

Feng Tang: I believe in fate. I have always felt that my life, second luck, and three feng shui are the most important.

The other depends on how you define your life. I define this life, which is some of the impermanence of some small probability. When I happen when I was most critical, I realized it.

** FT Chinese website: Once the impermanence of small probability occurs, it will make people anxious or fearful, which is why everyone is insecure now. **I don't say that you have no room for your efforts after you believe in your life. Some small probability events patted you on the beach. This is possible. But you are photographed on the beach, it does not mean that you can do it yourself, you ca n’t do anything at all, you have room for hard work.

It is as if your body and mind may be born a lot. The native family decides a lot, but it does not mean that you have no way to do it yourself. You can still do something different.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-31T06-32-07-00-00/000000.png)(Agence France -Presse Kiev, 30th) Kiev is not the front line of the Russian and Ukraine War, but Russia has attacked almost every day with missiles and drones almost every day, not only in the early morning, but even during the day.

Ukraine said that the Russian offensive was roughly intercepted, and only two people died of the falling wreckage, but this tactic that crackled away from the hot city of war, causing people to question the motivation.

Officials and analysts pointed out that the extensive goal of this tactic is to hinder the counterattack in the Ukraine plan and exhaust its air defense forces.

Senior Ukraine officials said: "This is their reaction to Ukraine's counterattack."

The official who did not want to disclose his name said: "They try to limit our ability to respond: exhaust the air defense missiles and disperse the troops." The official also emphasized that compared with the missiles launched by Ukraine's air defense system, the "witness" used by Russia used (Shahed) The cost of drones is low.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T06-58-00Z/46884937_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65776528/46884937)Wang Quanzhang's wife, Li Wenzu, shared the video at the end of April, saying that the landlord who was looking for the power supply bureau to remove the electricity meter and immediately cut off the gas supply.

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Since more senior European officials visited China last month, [several rights protection lawyers and their families were arrested and detained by the Chinese government or forced by the landlord. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/左手歡迎歐盟右手抓捕律師-北京釋放什麼訊息/a-65367629)Among them, at the invitation of the European Union, Yu Wensheng, a rights protection lawyer, who had to meet with officials in the EU on April 13, was detained by the police halfway by the police with his wife Xu Yan. Crime was arrested for "provoking trouble".

On the other hand, in 2015, the "709 arrest" was arrested by the Chinese government and later released by the Chinese government, Wang Quanzhang, and Li Heping and his family, and his family, which were recently pressured by the landlord, requesting him to move away from the rental office immediately. Wang Quanzhang's wife, Li Wenzu, shared the video at the end of April, saying that the landlord who was looking for the power supply bureau to remove the electricity meter and immediately cut off the gas supply.

According to Wang Quanzhang's narrative, they paid the rent normally, but the landlord not only refused to receive the rent, but also asked them to move immediately on the grounds of arrears. One week afterwards, the Wang Quanzhang family tried many homestays or hotels, but they were all troubled or driven away. On May 2nd, Li Wenzu posted a video in Twitter that only 10 minutes in a hotel in Beijing, they were knocked down by the service staff to leave. After Wang Quanzhang returned to Beijing on May 3, he found that the original rental house was still in power off, so his wife and children stayed in the field temporarily.

At the same time, Li Heping, who was also arrested and detained by the Chinese authorities during the "709 Arrest" period, has successively brought the landlord with the "Biao -shaped Han" to the door since the end of April, asking them to move away within 2 weeks. Essence On May 14th, Li Heping's wife Wang Qiaoling posted a video in Twitter that the landlord brought more than 10 people into the small courtyard where their rental office, threatened that if the Li Heping family did not move away, the landlord would "kill" him.

Wang Qiaoling wrote that although the rent of the house was still for 5 years, their family had paid the rent until August 17, and the landlord still insisted on asking them to move away immediately. After Li Heping did not agree, Wang Qiaoling said that the landlord smashed a large hole in the glass window of the bedroom. They called the police, and the police arrived at the scene only that "the landlord has the power to unload the window of his house."

Wang Quanzhang said in an interview with DW that [the condition where the rights protection lawyer or disagreement person was forced to move in China has always existed](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/專訪北京想盡可能清除民間力量/a-65275117)In the past, because their family lived in a friend's house, the landlord still had a certain degree of pressure resistance, but in recent years, since they have no personal relationship with the landlord, when the police ask the landlord to force the rights protection persons, the landlord will be like "leading the leader "The imperial decree is average", which is very active to cater to and execute, which also makes the rental situation of the Wang Quanzhang family very difficult.

He said: "Why do the Chinese authorities do this? According to my understanding, the police in the local area have a stable pressure, which means that they have a sensitive person in their jurisdiction that they must control these people at a major sensitive time. For example [Foreign embassy staff or have important international people to visit China](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/馬克龍馮德萊恩4月5日將訪問中國/a-65223440), Or or other major activities in China, the police will arrange sensitive people in the hand management control area, which will affect their (landlord) normal work, and they will also bear the pressure of stability, so they do not want to let us live in the local area. This appeared to be forced to move. "

Wang Qiaoling told DW that although they faced the situation of being relocated from time to time since 2004, the severe means was not more serious until the end of April this year. She said: "In the past, the landlord moved, we would emphasize that the rental contract has not yet expired. If the landlord repeatedly urged, we will insist on the performance of the contract. Very angry, take violence. "

Wang Qiaoling believes that if the landlord does not support the police behind it, he should not take violence, because when they call the police, the police will only come out to "do it." Essence She said to DW: "This is nonsense and put one side of the law."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T06-58-00Z/46865820_401.jpg)In an interview with DW, Wang Quanzhang said that the situation where the rights defending lawyer or disagreement were forced to move in China.

### Beijing strengthening the suppression power is related to the visits to China for senior EU officials

After being forced to move away from the rental office by the landlord, the Wang Quanzhang family continued to be harassed by the police. Li Wenzu posted a video on Twitter on May 25 that she and her son temporarily resigned in the home of Royn Ringhong, but the police suddenly came to the door in the middle of the night, claiming that someone in the house was suspected of taking drugs, so she had to enter the house for examination. Li Wenzu wrote: "The child was so scared that I trembled with my body, crying while crying, and asked them what to do when they broke in? The police officers of the 5 Guang'anmen police station came to knock on the door and shouted.

Later, the police continued to knock on the door, and claimed that if Li Wen was not open, they "might break in." The next day, Li Wenzu shared a document in Twitter that his son asked the police whether he would come to the door to "check" tonight. She wrote: "Last night, the police at the Guangwai Police Station had to break the door to check drugs three times, which scared my children. The 709 incident caused our family to be separated for more than 4 years for more than 8 months. After a few years of reunion, we killed us. Is it necessary to force our mother and son to die if you move to get rid of drugs? "

As Wang Quanzhang's wife and children continued to be threatened by police harassment, the Li Heping family met the landlord again on May 28 that the landlord came to the door to demolish the iron door. Wang Qiaoling posted a video on Twitter on the 28th that the landlord took someone to remove the big iron door of the place with a panel and a pliers, and the police did not arrive until the iron door was moved away. When Li Heping took the police to the landlord's home theory, the police only said, "The landlord dismantle his door, it's okay!Go to the court to prosecute."

Wang Qiaoling told DW that although the civil contract disputes should be resolved through negotiation, when the landlord repeatedly adopted violence and the police ignored it, their family was very difficult. She said: "This official movement of the background has no power to resist us. What we can do is to send out the situation truthfully and tell everyone what the truth is."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T06-58-00Z/46864079_401.jpg)Li Wenzu posted a video on Twitter on May 25 that she and her son temporarily resigned in the home of Royn Ringhong, but the police suddenly came to the door in the middle of the night, claiming that someone in the house was suspected of taking drugs, so she had to enter the house for examination.

Wang Quanzhang believes that the Chinese government's recent increase in the strength and means of suppressing rights protection may be related to several major events that occur in April, including senior EU officials to visit China one after another. He said: "In April, several major events occurred in China, including [Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi were sentenced to severe punishment](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/廈門聚會案判決出爐-丁家喜許志永刑期逾十年/a-65269746)EU officials, including German Foreign Ministers, visited China, and Xu Yan and Yu Wensheng were arrested. These encounters are obviously directly related to the things that happened in China in April, but ordinary people may be difficult to understand. "

Pan Jiawei, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo, who has been paying attention to the situation of human rights in China for a long time, told DW that he was convinced that these forced relocation was related to the visit of senior European officials last month, because the embassies of these countries tried to arrange officials to meet with rights protection lawyers. He said: "There may be high -levels who ask police to drive these activists and human rights lawyers out of Beijing. I call on the international community to pay more attention to this trend, because seeing activists and human rights lawyers are punished for trying to meet foreign officials. Angry. "

Both Wang Qiaoling and Wang Quanzhang believe that the Chinese government's means to suppress rights protection is more severe than in the past, and Wang Quanzhang also said that he is still trying to solve the dilemma of being relocated. He told DW: "I don't have a very absolute way at present, I can only try."

美国国务院发言人说：「一般而言，我们不支持在俄罗斯境内发动袭击。我们一直把焦点放在提供乌克兰所需的设备和训练上，好让他们夺回自己的主权领土。」

这名发言人说，美国仍在评估发生在莫斯科的事。自俄罗斯去年2月入侵乌克兰以来，莫斯科的住宅大楼首次受到攻击，俄国总统蒲亭(VladimirPutin)认为是乌克兰所为。

但美国国务院发言人提到，俄罗斯今天再度空袭乌克兰首都基辅，这是本月第17次。

发言人说：「平白无故对乌克兰发动这场战争的是俄罗斯，俄国随时可以从乌克兰撤军并停止战争，而不是每天对乌克兰城市和人民发动残酷攻击。」

The mosque was listed as the county's cultural relics protection unit in 2018.

The Washington Post quoted local activists that the authorities suspected that the authorities had cut off the local mobile network services at one time, and the local phone on Monday was transferred to a message mailbox.

Tonghai County Police said in a report on Sunday that the incident caused "bad social impact", which will severely crack down, and "encourage and protect" the public to actively report.

### "Religious Sinicization"

In recent years, China has stepped up its political controls on religious groups and individuals, and listed "in -depth promotion of Chinese religion Sinicization" as a clear requirement for united front work.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized at the National Religious Conference in 2021 that it is necessary to guide and support Chinese religion with the core values of socialism as a leader to enhance the recognition of the Chinese nation and the Communist Party of China.

At the end of May, China launched an online information query system for Islam, Catholicism, and Christian faculty as certification management methods for religious faculty.

It is reported that the system has strengthened the monitoring of religious people in China.

In recent years, the official narrative of religious Chineseization has particularly emphasized the alert of "the danger of using religious penetration" and "religious demands with political intention".

After Xi Jinping came to power, he has always stated that he must "resolutely resist" that overseas forces use religion to infiltrate and prevent religious extreme ideological violations.

The most prominent and attracted international concern is the [processing method] for the Xinjiang Uyghur Muslims in the northwest(https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-48718848)Essence

The Chinese authorities have established a large number of "re -education camps" to "transform ideas" for Muslims, claiming to remove the penetration of extreme ideas of terrorism.

The UN Human Rights Report said that China ’s approach to Uighurs and other Muslim communities is“ serious violations of human rights ”.

AFP quoted DavidStroup, an expert at the University of Manchester, the University of Manchester, in the United Kingdom, saying that although these practices have a small impact on the community outside Xinjiang, many mosques have been "forced to be converted." In line with the official definition of Sinicization.

Radio Free Asia quoted a Chinese Christian Mr. King: "The Christian church cross is almost dismantled. The next step is to other religions. The mosques is demolished like a Christian church disassembling the cross. Now it is necessary to further rectify religion outside Christianity. "

The reader of Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" Sowe Ho left a message under the report: "Sinicization should be negotiated instead of request."

The Hui nationality is one of the 56 domestic nations recognized by the Chinese government, mainly Sunni Muslims. It is reported that there are about 10 million Hui Muslims in China, of which 700,000 live in Yunnan Province.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T07-22-43-08-00/van-gogh-promo-master1050.jpg)The starting price of the 17th auction is $ 23 million.

In the squeezed Manhattan Sotheby's auction house, the offer rose rapidly: $ 32 million, $ 42 million, and $ 48 million. Later, a potential new buyer who called from China to the auction turned the bidding into a contest of two people.

In November 2014, the "Impressionist and Modern Art" evening auction later became the most successful auction in history as of the history. A particularly noticeable painting at the auction was the static painting "Daisy and Poppy Flowers" completed by Vincent Van Gogh a few weeks ago.

The people who called from China to the shots will be raised to nearly 62 million US dollars (RMB 377 million). His bid is the highest price in the history of Van Gogh's static figures.

In the cautious high -end art world, buyers usually maintain anonymous. However, the famous film producers who won in that auction announced in the later interviews that he was the new owner of the painting.

The producer Wang Zhongjun was in the head of Hongyun at the time. His company has just helped send the "World War II" theme "Furitors" starring Brad Pitt into the Chinese cinema. He dreamed that he made his business as the Chinese version of Walt Disney.

According to Chinese media reports, the transaction "[sensation](http://finance.sina.com.cn/leadership/mroll/20141110/005920771372.shtml)"The whole country. It was another sign of China as the main force of the global art market. A [China Real Estate Tycoon](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20150428/c28wang/)I took a Picasso painting a year ago.

"How could I want to buy Van Gogh ten years ago?" Wang Zhongjun was accepted by Sotheby's auction house [Chinese interview](https://www.sothebys.com/zh-hant/文章/王中軍專訪-他將梵谷帶來中國?locale=zh-Hans)Saying. "After buying Van Gogh's works, I like it so much."

But Wang Zhongjun may not be the real owner of the painting at all. The other two men are related to the transaction: one is the unknown Shanghai middleman who has paid Sotheby's bills through one Caribbean shell company, and the other is the hundreds of millions of people who live in Hong Kong where this middleman work. Rich.

The billionaire was called Xiao Jianhua. He was one of the most influential tycies in the gold -plated era in China. He used the relationship with the CCP elite and a new super rich class to create a financial empire in decades. The company documents obtained by the New York Times show that Xiao Jianhua has also controlled a hidden offshore company network composed of more than 130 companies and a total asset of more than $ 5 billion. Sotheby's Dan Gogh's Painting Auction bill was issued to one of the companies.

In the few years after that transaction, with the authorities tried to crack down on criminal activities, the secrets and unrefined practices in the art market and art dealers (including Sotheby's international auction houses) have received close attention. The sky -high transactions in the art market are often performed through opaque intermediaries, and the review of these intermediaries is also lacking transparency. Sotheby's thoughts of confidentiality refused to comment on the transaction.

Today, Xiao Jianhua has fallen into the abyss. He was abducted from the luxury apartments of living and was currently detained in mainland China. The court judged that he had committed bribery and prosecutors called other improper behaviors that threaten national financial security. At the same time, Wang Zhongjun was also bleak. Due to losses every year, his production company was liquidating assets.

According to several art experts, that still -static paintings have been sold privately. In the century after Van Gogh's picked flowers and placed them in the pottery bottle, the source of this painting was easy to trace, and it was often exhibited in the museum and for viewing. Now this painting has disappeared from the public view and the whereabouts are unknown.

Doctor Jiashe encouraged Van Gogh to ignore his melancholy and concentrate on painting. Van Gogh completed nearly 80 oil paintings within two months, including "Portrait of Doctor Jiashe", which is considered a masterpiece.

It is expected that it can shoot prices between $ 12 million and $ 16 million, but this painting was not sold at the Christie's auction in November 1990. Soon after, a buyer who was unwilling to be named bought it at a lower bid.

In recent years, governments of various countries have been trying to curb this high -profile purchase that has always been secretly purchased through intermediaries and the final funding sources of funds.A Sotheby's spokesman said that all buyers were reviewed, and when necessary, the company's compliance department would "enhance due diligence" to buyers. Sotheby's globally follows a 2020 EU regulations that require auction house to verify the legitimacy of buyers' funds.

Although the financial documents related to the trading of Van Gogh's paintings did not show improper behavior, the transaction was far from the conventional approach. Shortly after the auction was sold, Sotheby's transfer of the ownership of the painting was transferred to a Shanghai. He had neither the reputation of a artistic agent nor a collector, but he paid the fee. But at a public ceremony, Sotheby's did not give the painting to the Shanghai people or hired him the billionaire, but to the producer Wang Zhongjun.

"This incident is related to a person who has been in prison," said Laila Amin Dorley, who was a lawyer in the art industry in New York. "There are some unusual things in it."

The owner of Van Gogh's painting in Sotheby's painting lives in an apartment building in Shanghai, with gray tiles and dirty mortar with a dilapidated door. A cushion in front of the door wrote in English and wrote the word "I am an artist" nine times in English.

The owner of this house, Liu Hailong, was listed as the only owner and director of an empty shell company in the British Virgin Islands.(Islandwide Holdings Limited)The company paid for this painting. Except for the date and place of birth, the outside world knows almost nothing about 46 -year -old Liu Hailong.

Recently, a reporter showed him Sotheby's invoice and a bank telegram document to ask him if he was his own. He said, "You go now." Then closed the door.

Zhao Tingting, who lived with him, also contacted Xiao Jianhua, the imprisoned billionaire Xiao Jianhua. She used to be a senior management of a company involved in Xiao Jianhua.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T07-22-43-08-00/00van-gogh-master1050.jpg)Liu Hailong's two transactions to Sotheby's two electricity are used to pay Van Gogh's painting costs.

Zhao Tingting, 43, no longer holds this position and is now teaching piano. When asked about the Van Gogh's work purchased by Liu Hailong, she replied, "Do you think the price of the house in our house is enough?"

She said that she and Liu Hailong were "just ordinary employees" and had nothing to do with the group group controlled by billionaires. "We do not have any right to dominate and know the right to know."

The couple seems to be "white gloves". The word is used to describe acting shareholders in China, in order to hide the real owner of the company. In the records of the number of "Tomorrow Group" details, one electronic watch lists dozens of people. At least four offshore companies are registered in the name of Liu Hailong.

These companies are part of Xiao Jianhua's huge enterprise. He showed a good look very early. At the age of 14, he entered Peking University, a famous university in China. During the Tiananmen protest in 1989, he was the chairman of the Student Union. At that time, he stood on the side of the government. This loyalty later helped him become one of the richest people in China. He obtained the control of banks, insurance companies and brokerage companies, as well as shares of coal, cement and real estate companies.

Unlike many arrogant billionaires who do business in his business, Xiao Jianhua, 51, prefers to operate in the dark and has some princes in China [establishment of relationships](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140604/c04elite/)Essence He lived a peaceful life at the Four Seasons Hotel, and a group of female bodyguards took care of him.

Why did he buy this Van Gogh's painting under his hands? The producer Wang Zhongjun was also one of the top rich in China, although his wealth was far less than Xiao Jianhua.

Xiao Jianhua can easily obtain funds overseas through his overseas network, which allows him to bypass China's strict monetary control; he may play the role of a certain banker for Wang Zhongjun. The document shows that the two started formulating art investment plans in the same month, but their joint venture in Seychelles was not established until one year later. At the same time, the two also established another overseas company to invest in North American movies and television projects.

There may be another explanation about this money: Xiao Jianhua may want to acquire an asset that can use private aircraft cross -border transportation, thereby avoiding the review of bank compliance officials and government regulatory agencies.

In 2015, with the collapse of the Chinese stock market, the fate of those related to Van Gogh's paintings began to change. Xi Jinping's government accuses the market with extensive connections to manipulate the market, and regulators have recaptured economic power from billionaires. After dozens of financialists disappeared, they appeared again in the police detention center.

The purchase of art is more cautious. In 2016, Oprah Winfrey gave a painting of Klinst at a price of $ 150 million [sold to](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/oprah-said-to-snag-150-million-selling-klimt-to-chinese-buyer?sref=36hylgrI)An anonymous Chinese buyer.

By early 2017, Xiao Jianhua's life was over as a free man. One night, about six men put him on a wheelchair -everyone knows that he does not need a wheelchair -blindfolding his face and take him away from the apartment in Hong Kong. He was taken to mainland China and was eventually sued. Prosecutors claim that his crimes can be traced back to the year when the Van Gogh painting was sold before 2014.

In August last year, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for manipulating the financial market and bribery government officials. The court said that Xiao Jianhua and his company used funds of 148.6 billion yuan without authorization.For a while, the producer Wang Zhongjun maintained a high -profile lifestyle. In 2017, a private art museum was opened in Beijing in 2017, showing the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso for several months.

But his film company Huayi Brothers lost market value for the box office of the film. Wang Zhongjun gave up most of the art collection and his home in Hong Kong. Last year, he was sold in Beijing's art museum and a luxury mansion in Billy Villa.

Wang Zhongjun and his company spokesman did not respond to reporters' repeated review requests. The reporter could not contact Xiao Jianhua in prison to comment, but a family representative said that Xiao Jianhua's wife did not know how the Van Gogh's works were auctioned and were not familiar with Liu Hailong.

This hand, one of the most praised artists in the world, and the lifelike flower and still paintings have not appeared publicly for many years. However, there are reports that this work may return to the market again.

Three Sotheby's former executives and a New York art consultant request anonymous said that the painting had been proposed to be sold privately. Last year, the consultant saw a written proposal to acquire the work about $ 70 million.

These art experts do not know if the painting has been sold, nor does it know if anyone will worry about the 2014 auction. At that time, the painting was purchased by a billionaire who is now famous for sweeping the floor, and the rich man contacted a difficult film producer, the latter claims that the painting belongs to himself.

"No one needs a $ 62 million Van Gogh work, and no one is willing to spend money to buy a lawsuit," said the art lawyer Thomas Danziger. "If you have any questions about the ownership of this painting, people will buy other artworks -or another plane."

But Modivie said after the game, "Every time I end, I am very happy."

This is Midivir, who participated in the French Open at 7 degrees, and was eliminated in the first round of the fifth time.

"I am full of red soil in the game, and I hate that in the game. I don't know who likes to eat red soil, or wants to make bags, shoes, and socks. Throw it all. "

Modivv added: "Someone may like it, but I really don't love it. I am very happy." Before the French Open started, Midivir won the first Red Earth event in the Italian Open last week to win my career. The championship is also his fifth champion of the 2023 season.

The 23 -year -old Wei De has a total of 69 winning balls in this game, which is the key. He should not throw two at the end of the wave in the second set, otherwise it may not take 4 hours and 15 minutes to win.

Wei De said, "I was cramping on the second set of ones, and there was no way to serve as I really wanted." He never won the game since February 2022, and it was not a breakthrough until today.

Modivor believes that Wei De can start with the victory of today's game and usher in the moment of glory.

"If he continues to hit this way, he will reach the top 30 in the world at the end of this year."

"I really hope that he can continue to perform in the future, otherwise I will be disappointed."

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T08-08-00Z/65740297_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65776612/65740297)There are differences in the attitude of Eastern and Western directions to AI.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) Public Intelligence (AI) When it is popular, the top AI experts, researchers, and corporate executives from the world issued a statement on Tuesday (May 30), asking all circles to review AI may cause human civilization to cause human civilization. The risk of extinction.

This statement was published by the Center For Aisafiety, which is headquartered in San Francisco, the main point, and clarifies that "the risk of reducing artificial intelligence extinction (human) should be as the risk of artificial intelligence (human). , Together to become a global priority. "

### Who signed this statement?

There are quite a lot of signs of this statement, and there are many important AI experts and high -level enterprises. For example, the 2018 Turing Award winner, Geoffreyhinton and Yoshua Bengio, who are called "AI Godfather".

The CEO of the R & D company of ChatGPT, Samaltman, and Search Engine Giant Google, the artificial intelligence company "DeepMind", DEMISHASSSBIS, also ranked later.

Various scholars, experts, and business people, including a large number of professionals working in companies such as Google and Microsoft, as well as well -known people in other fields, such as former Estonian President Kerstikaljulaid, American neurosciences and host Harris ( Sam Harris, as well as Canadian pop singers and songwriters Grimes.

Experts of nuclear science, epidemic and climate change, such as Billmckibbben, a writer, also signed a statement. Mike basically sounded global warming alarm with the 1989 book "The End of Nature" and warned artificial intelligence -related technologies in another book.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T08-08-00Z/65649270_401.jpg)OPENAI's CEO, Altman also signed the declaration, the picture shows that he went to the US Senate on May 16 this year to attend the hearing.

### Why are you worried about the safety of AI?

The preface of this statement mentioned that "more and more discussing the extensive, important and urgent risks brought by AI" in various circles, but this is still "difficult to express some of the most serious risks of AI." To overcome this risk obstacle to discuss, and "create common sense for more experts and public figures, so that they can also take the most serious risks of advanced AI."

The timing issued by the statement coincides with [the United States -EU Trade and Technology Council holds a meeting in Sweden](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欧经济高官会晤-协调经贸政策应对中国/a-65773297)Politicians and technology celebrities are expected to discuss in the near future [potential supervision of artificial intelligence](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/ai技术发展太快-各国监管部门发力狂追/a-65361642)Essence

Earlier this year, more than 1,000 research and technical personnel including Tesla and Twitter Elon Musk have signed a longer letter to call on all circles to suspend AI development for 6 months](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马斯克等呼吁给ai研发按下暂停键/a-65170173)Called AI "a far -reaching risk of society and humans."

The letter was a response to Openai's release of new artificial intelligence model GPT-4, but the leaders of OpenAI, its partners Microsoft and competitors Google did not sign the document at the time.

Dan Hendrycks, director of the AI Security Center, explained: "We are trying to solve them before these risks, rather than solve the disaster afterwards."

The Associated Press reported that with the rise of the new generation of high -performance AI chat robots (such as ChatGPT), people are increasingly worried that AI will surpass human beings and out of control, and prompt countries around the world to formulate regulations for technology in development. The European Union has taken the lead in formulating the AI Act and is expected to be approved this year.

In April this year, the National Internet Information Office of China also drafted the "[Measures for the Management of Genesis Artificial Intelligence Service]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國推ai管理法-人工智慧也要姓黨/a-65275966)"The draft, publicly soliciting feedback from the public.

### Robot love and sympathy

In order to make the robot like humans as much as possible, Hansen uses a nano -technology skin called Frubber during the manufacturing process, which can show human facial expressions with falsely. In the future, the company also hopes to give them the abilities of other human beings, such as love and sympathy.

###  East -west attitude towards AI?

The US "Foreign Affairs" magazine published this week's article stating that according to a survey by the market survey agency IPSOS in 2022, only 35%of Americans believe that the benefits of AI are greater than risks, making the United States a world's pair in the world. One of the most pessimistic countries in this technology.

In contrast, China is the most optimistic country in the world, and nearly four -fifths of Chinese people believe that the benefits of AI are better than risks.

Associate researcher of the New American Security Center (CNAS) Bill Drexel and research assistant Hannahkelley believe that in the United States, disasters often promote public awareness and strengthen security measures, because their consequences will expand to The entire media and society; but in China, disaster accidents can rarely cause response through the media because the government will block information in order to maintain stability.

Two experts pointed out that China has formed a "unforgettable culture", which is difficult for the public to ask for changes, and it is impossible to force the government to learn lessons from high costs. Few people are responsible for mistakes, which means that business owners often turn a blind eye to safety issues. The history of China's terrible industrial accidents is evidence.

In addition, if the United States recognizes the serious threat of AI, industry and governments can double the restrictions on the suspension of AI business research that is easy to be armed, including technology transfer strategies that use joint ventures and Chinese investment.

However, in 2022 released by the Iposo poll, ChatGPT has not yet split globally, and the United States and China may have changed their development attitudes towards AI.

Compared with the cautious attitude of some Western experts and corporate high -level attitude towards AI, Asia's overall attitude towards AI development seems to be more positive. Another case was displayed in Jensenhuang, CEO of the American AI chip designer Nvidia, is welcomed and received by star -like in Taiwan.

Bloomberg reported that the 60 -year -old entrepreneur recently came to Taiwan to participate in the Taipei International Computer Fair (COMPUTEX), and was sought after by the masses at the Taipei Night Market on the weekend. It has also been surrounded by fans and media at Taipei International Computer Show.

At a round table meeting at the Taipei International Computer Exhibition, Huang Renxun talked about AI supervision and how to use the technology in China and other places. Huang Renxun believes that AI will surpass the boundaries of the technology industry and penetrate all aspects of agriculture, factories, pharmaceuticals and climate change.

Huang Renxun said, "Artificial intelligence makes everything look different." It also talked about accelerating operational and generating AI is the two major trends in the computer industry today. He bluntly said: "AI will be a very important part of future games."

But when he discussed China, he seemed to be cautious. He believes that Beijing will support the development of AI and use this opportunity to cultivate local entrepreneurs.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-31T08-53-41/1-1685520815.jpg)On April 6, 2022, Sudan protesters walked towards the parliamentary building in the rally against military rule.(AFP)A Sudan diplomatic source told the Peninsula TV that the Sudan army had suspended the negotiations of participating in the ceasefire and humanitarian access, which caused people's concerns about the rebirth of the battle. This battle has led tens of thousands of people to leave.

The talks with the hostile military group quickly supported the troops at the beginning of May at Gada, Saudi Arabia, and formulated a declaration of commitment to protect civilians and two short -term ceasefire agreements that have been violated many times.

Before the expiration of May 29th, the army and the rapid support forces had agreed to extend a weekly ceasefire agreement for five days.

Until the later Tuesday, it was reported that there was a fierce conflict in the capital of Khatayoum, the capital of Sudan. Residents reported that all three adjacent cities that constituted the Great capital of the Sudan in the intersection of the Nile, namely Khamoum, Endaman, and Beikoumou, all had fierce battles.

Mohammed Valt, a Peninsula TV station, said the suspension of ceasefire agreement was the result of the Sudan government's surrounding frustration.

Wal said, "The fast support forces continue to violate the ceasefire agreement, so this ceasefire agreement is meaningless. We still need to hear more information from the army. They explain the reasons why they withdraw from the agreement in detail."

Wal added, "The purpose of Gada to hold a talks is to stop the infringement and help civilians re -place their lives. But this is still not realized. We also have someone to leave Khamoum. And it is reported that we are still trapped at home, and we are still trapped at home, and we are still trapped at home. Because the fast support forces use civilians as human shields. "

The suspension agreement was reached by Saudi Arabia and the United States and was remotely monitored by the two. They said that both parties violated the agreement, but allowed assistance to provide assistance.

The war forced nearly 1.4 million people to escape from their homes, including more than 350,000 people entering neighboring countries.

More than six weeks after the conflict, the United Nations estimates that more than half of the population (25 million) need assistance and protection.

Some areas of the capital are hit by large -scale robbery and frequent power outage and water break. Most hospitals have stopped serving.

Some departments of the United Nations, some aid agencies, embassies, and the central government of the Sudan have shifted their business to Sudan Port in Honghai, Sudan, which is a major shipping center that is almost unlusable.

Since the former leader Omal Bahill was overthrown in the 2019 people's uprising, the leaders of the army and the rapid support forces have been positions in the Sudan Governance Committee.

In 2021, when they had the leadership of the committee to the civilian staff, they launched a coup, and then parted ways due to command chain and rapid support for the reorganization of the army during the planned transition process.

Earlier on Saturday afternoon, 10 armed staff rushed into the house of Dr. Alaa Nogod in Katmome and took him away, while his brother and mother could only watch it.

According to his family, these people claimed to belong to the Sudan military affairs department and confiscated Nordor's laptop, notebooks, passports, and mobile phones. Then drove away, but didn't say where to take him.

Nortow's mother Alavia told the Peninsula TV that "they kicked a kick between Ala's shoulders and necks. I want to know the news about him. I am really scared because I know they are not good for others. "

Nordor has long criticized the former President Omar Bali and its National Congress (NCP).

As a Sudan Professional Association (SPA), a spokesman for the umbrella union that overthrew Basil in 2019. For a long time, he has accused the residual forces of the former regime in an attempt to destroy Sudan's transition from democracy.

However, since the main characters of the National Assembly announced last month, they announced the conflict between the support of the army and the quasi -military rapid support forces, and Nordor and other well -known Bohil critics have become the goal of threatening and slander activities.

A military officer of Basarik, Tarik Hardy, uploaded a video on Facebook and YouTube, accusing Norders of being a "unbelievable person."

Nortow's friends and colleagues also claimed that unknown people forged a record record for his Facebook dialogue with the fast -supported troops on May 24.

Although the Peninsula Television could not verify the authenticity of the so -called Facebook dialogue records, Norders accused the former members of the regime accusing him of using photo editing software to make him look like a conspiracy with the fast support forces. He was taken away three days later.

Alavia said, "Just a few days ago, (Nortow) talked with his brother a slanderous movement against him. He told him‘ I ’m not afraid.’ ”

Peninsula TV tried to contact the military spokesman Nabil Abdullah to comment on the detainees, but did not receive any reply.

According to his friends and family, although Nordogor is engaged in medical work in Sudan, he has greater ambitions that he wants to help the country to achieve democratic change.

In 2019, he became a member of a loose group composed of political parties and civilian social groups. The group formed the so-called freedom and transformation power-the Central Command (FFC-CC).

FFC-CC was severely criticized by the grass-roots owners, because within a few months after Bashil stepped down, it agreed to cooperate with the military and rapid support forces to form a transition government.

Nortow's close friend said that after joining the Federal Ministry of Health in 2020, he was still respected. He did not disclose a former colleague in the ministry because he was afraid of being retaliated. She said that Norders dared to investigate the improper behavior of the health department in the past.

Because she was afraid of making him more dangerous, she did not explain in detail, but added that Norders was angry with some people.

She told the Peninsula TV, "If everyone is in a room, and there is an opinion that no one wants to say, then he will tell the truth anyway. He is politically out of politics, but not everyone likes him. ","

After the military coup in October 2021, Sudan's transition to democracy was destroyed, and Norders continued to publicly oppose the army.

In a few months after the coup, Abdul Farita Berhan, the highest commander of the army, restored some characters of the National Congress to an important position in the national bureaucracy.

Alavia told the Peninsula TV, "I have always been afraid of him to say. I told him to stop, but he always told me he was not afraid."

#### Try to maintain neutrality

On April 15th, During the outbreak of the war, Nordor was one of the dozens of Sudan doctor alliance members who stayed in Khatamemoum to help the wounded.

A pharmacist, FFC member, and his close friend Mohammed Siger said, "Dr. Nordor always puts himself in danger for the sake of the Sudan people."

Within a few days, the emergency room of the entire city was full of patients who needed life -saving. However, due to the collapse of the health care department (usually impossible), saving these patients becomes more and more difficult.However, Nordogder continued to talk to the media and condemn the attack. On May 24, he told the Peninsula TV that the military detained the aid supplies of the World Health Organization, which should be transported to the hospital in Kayoumou.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-31T08-53-41/3-1685520837.jpg)According to reports, hundreds of people were killed in the violent incident of Dalfur, Sudan(Peninsula TV Station)Nordor also explained to the Peninsula TV station that he did not explicitly point out the perpetrators of attacks and attack medical facilities, so as not to cause strong opposition from any party.

However, he was slandered and threatened, claiming that he supported fast support forces. Since he was detained, some supporters of the Sudan army have put forward similar allegations on him on Twitter.

Siger said, "When I was talking to him last time, I told him that the former regime was designing a trap for you."

Nortow's close friend Abdul Monham Tyerbu added, "I have always warned him, (learned) he was in his house, and he was not hiding anywhere. I was very surprised. . When I asked him if he would hide, he told me 'I stayed in a safe place.' "

Although Nortow's whereabouts are still unknown, his detention has prompted some activists and unions to call for him to release him immediately. But others were worried that if they publicly called for his freedom, then they might suffer similar fate. The nature of Nortow's detention and the lack of related information also makes people feel more and more that as the country's conflict continues, Sudan is becoming increasingly unparalleled.

Nortow's outer health colleague said, "No one should be punished because of criticizing what Singaporean armed forces or the National Assembly did or have opinions."

She added, "Dr. Nordor is a role model (my). He is a great character like a father."

Previously, drones attacked Moscow and caused two people to be injured. Failure to better protect the capital of the Cremlin.

On May 30, local time, Pricigin issued a statement full of curse on the social platform Telegram, and blamed the drone attacks that Moscow encountered on the drone attacks on the wealthy officials living in the wealthy suburbs of Moscow. Class. It should be pointed out that the Mercenum of Mercegal forces in the Russia and Ukraine has played a key role in the Russia and Ukraine War.

In the statement, Porigo pointed out, "You, the Ministry of National Defense, did not take any action to launch an offensive."

"How dare you let those drones fly over Moscow?"

"What should ordinary people do when the drone with explosives hit the window at home?"

Porigeru concentrated his anger in the powerful residents of the Rubyevca in the high -end area in the western suburbs of Moscow. He also talked about the "defeats" and those who quietly sat aside when Moscow was attacked, "idiot".

After the attack on the 30th, Alexander Cindein, an important member of the Russian Parliament of the Unified Russian Party, posted on the social platform Telegram, said that the 3 of the 8 drones that were struck were on the Rubbing Liu Liu. Faka's three villages were shot down, one of which was only a 10 -minute drive from Russian President Putin in New Ogaror Wo.

Rubyfka is located in the forest on the western suburbs of Moscow. It is a closed community composed of elites. It once had the highest real estate prices in the world. It is also the place where many politics, business and cultural elites in Russia are located.

He repeatedly referred to those who lived in Rubyvca as the elite that had not been closely related to the Ukrainian war. The failure is attributed to senior leaders.

Russian military blogger Igor Gilkin (caused 298 people to kill 298 people in 2014, which shot down the MH17 in eastern Ukraine in Russia, and was criticized by the Dutch courts for committing murder) on the 30th. Residents said they "never thought of the country."

After Moscow was attacked by the drone, Ramzan Cadrov, a strong leader in the Russian Chechen area, urged the Kremlin to declare martial law and use all its resources in Ukraine to "remove the terrorist gang".

The Think Tank "Institute of War" in Washington, DC, said that Cadrov also warned European countries not to provide weapons to Ukraine and emphasized, "If they continue to provide weapons to Ukraine, when Russia knocks on their doors, they Use the lack of necessary weapons for self -defense. "

Some Kremlin observer pointed out that Putin's calm response to drone attacks was in sharp contrast to the angry speech of the Russian eagle, and it seemed that he had identified that the Russian public would not be uneasy because of these attacks.

Putin said that Obviously, Moscow's air defense system needs to be improved to deal with the so -called Ukraine "terrorism".

### Artificial Intelligence III: Why does scientists jointly regulate AI technology that can lead to human extinction

At 9:00 am on May 31, 2023![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129750600_1.jpg)Image source, getty images

** Experts including OPENAI and Google DeepMind have warned that artificial intelligence may lead to human extinction, but how can machines replace humans? **

Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to answer questions or generate text or even code according to the needs of users, has become the fastest -growing Internet application in history.

In just two months, its active users have reached 100 million. According to the technology monitoring company Sensor Town, Instagram spent two and a half years to reach this milestone.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129937053_8170a6fd-eb4b-403d-a91c-f8e20a055f54.jpg)Image source, reuters

Image adding text,

The emergence of the ChatGPT application has triggered a fierce debate on how to ensure the security of artificial intelligence.

OpenAI's popularity developed by Microsoft's funding is popular, which has triggered a fierce speculation of artificial intelligence affecting human future.

Dozens of experts support a statement published on the PentaFETy webpage of the Artificial Intelligence Safety, saying that "reducing the risk of extinction caused by artificial intelligence should become the world with the risks of other society such as epidemic and nuclear war, which should be the world to become global Priority. "

But some people said that this concern was exaggerated.

### 人

Chatgpt, Dall-E, BARD, and AlphaCode (from prose, poetry, and jokes to computer code) and images (such as charts, photos and artworks), which are almost the same as human works, are difficult to distinguish.

Students use it to write homework, and politicians use it to write a speech. Democratic Representative, Jake AUchincloss, launched this resource in the US Congress.

Technology giant IBM said that 7,800 positions can be treated by artificial intelligence.

If all these changes are overwhelmed, then prepare:

Image adding text,

The more advanced artificial intelligence, the more capable of replacing our work.

We are only in the first stage of artificial intelligence, and there are two stages that are coming. Some scientists are afraid that this may threaten human survival.

The following are three stages.

### 1 \. Weak artificial intelligence (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)

Weak artificial intelligence is also known as artificial intelligence in limited fields, focuses on single tasks, and perform duplicate work in a series of functions.

It usually learns from a large amount of data, such as learning from the Internet, but only in a specific field of programming.

An example is the chess program that can defeat the world champion, but cannot perform other tasks.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129938135_3.jpg)Image source, getty images

Image adding text,

Weak artificial intelligence can surpass humans, but only in specific fields.

This technology is used everywhere on smartphones. From GPS maps, to understanding your taste and proposed music and video program.

Even more complicated systems, such as unmanned cars and ChatGPTs, are weak artificial intelligence forms. They cannot operate outside the scope of the setting, so they cannot make decisions by themselves.

However, some experts believe that being programmed as a system with automatic learning functions, such as ChatGPT or Autogpt, may enter the next development stage.

General artificial intelligence means that machines have the same intelligence as humans.

It is also called "strong artificial intelligence".

** 6 months of pause **

In March 2023, more than 1,000 technical experts called on "the training of all artificial intelligence laboratories immediately suspended at least 6 months than the more powerful artificial intelligence system than GPT-4", GPT-4 is the latest version of ChatGPT.

Other technology giants including Apple co -founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk wrote: "The artificial intelligence system with intelligence with human beings may be on society. It is deeply risky with humans. "Musk was one of the co -founders of Openai, and later resigned from the board of directors due to inconsistent opinions with the company's leadership.

Carissavéliz, the Institute of Artificial Intelligence Ethics at the University of Oxford, signed the letter. However, she believes that the statement of the warning of the Artificial Intelligence Safety Center was too much, so she decided not to sign.

"The artificial intelligence we are currently developing is both smart and stupid," she told BBC's AndrewWebb. "If someone has tried ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence, they will notice that they have very significant limitations. "

Welz said she was worried that artificial intelligence would create error messages at a high speed.

"As the US election approached in 2024, they fired their artificial intelligence morality and security team like Twitter and other important platforms, and I was even more worried about this."

The U.S. government acknowledges potential threats. The White House stated in a statement on May 4: "Artificial intelligence is one of our most powerful technologies in our time, but in order to seize the opportunities it brings, we must first reduce its risk."

The U.S. Congress has summoned OPENAI CEO Sam Altman to answer questions about ChatGPT.

Sam Aldman

At the Senate Hearing, Aldman said that with the development of artificial intelligence, the government supervised his industry "very important".

Public Policy Researcher Carlos Ignaciogutiérrez explained to the BBC explanation that one of the huge challenges brought by artificial intelligence is that "no joint agency composed of experts determines how to supervise it, just like the between the government Climate change special committee (IPCC). "

This brought us to the third and last stage of artificial intelligence.

### 3 \. Super artificial intelligence

This is a theory. When we reach the second stage, we will quickly enter the final stage: "Super Artificial Intelligence". This is the case when artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence.

Nickbostrom, a philosopher and an artificial intelligence expert, defines super intelligence as "almost all areas, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills, far exceeding the best human brain intelligence" "" Essence

"Human beings must learn for engineers, nurses or lawyers for a long time. The problem of general artificial intelligence is ... it can continue to improve ourselves when we can't do it," Gu Tierez explained.

**Science fiction**

This concept reminishes the plot of the film "Terminator". In this movie, the machine launched a nuclear war that destroyed humans.

Schwarzenegger has starred in "Terminator".

ARVindnarayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, has previously told BBC that the sci -fi disaster scene is unrealistic: "The current artificial intelligence is not enough to make these risks a reality. Finally, it disperses people's right right right Pay attention to short -term harm of artificial intelligence. "

Although there are many controversy for whether machines can really get the kind of intelligence owned by human beings, especially in terms of emotional intelligence, this is one of the most worried things that those who think we are about to realize general artificial intelligence.

Recently, the so -called "artificial intelligence godfather" Geoffrey Hinton warned that we may soon reach this milestone. Xinton is the pioneer of teaching machines to learn from experience.

"I think (machine) is not smarter than us. But I think they may be like this soon," he just retired from Google, 75 years old.

Xinton said in a statement that he issued to the New York Times announced that he regrets his work now because he is worried that "bad participants" will use artificial intelligence to do "bad things".

He gave BBC a general example of "nightmare scenes": "Imagine, for example, poor participants like (Russian President) Putin decide to give robotic capabilities and create their own sub -goals."

He warned that these machines may eventually "create a sub -goal such as" I need more power ", which will bring" survival risk ".

But Xinton said that in the short term, he believes that the benefits of artificial intelligence are much greater than risks, "So I don't think we should stop developing such things." He said.

### extinction or immortal

British physicist Stephen Hawking issued a harsh warning.

"The comprehensive development of artificial intelligence may mean the end of human beings," he told BBC in 2014, which is four years before his death.

He said that such an intelligent level machine "will develop itself and redesign itself at a faster and faster speed."

### nano robot and eternal life

Futurist inventor and writer Ray Kurzweil is one of the biggest enthusiasts in artificial intelligence. He is an artificial intelligence researcher at Google and the co -founder of the University of Silicon Valley.

Kuzwell believes that humans will be able to use super intelligent artificial intelligence to overcome bi obstacles.

In 2015, he predicted that by 2030, because nano robots (very small robots) work in our body, they can repair and cure any injuries or diseases, and humans will achieve eternal life.Image source, getty images

Can nano robots make humans grow long or liveless?

### artificial intelligence management

Gotoris agreed that the key is to create an artificial intelligence governance system.

"Imagine such a future: a lot of information that has a lot of information on the earth and a lot of information (because of Internet search), which can control us in a way we can't realize." He said.

"The worst scene is not a war between humans and robots. The worst thing is that we did not realize that we were manipulated because we share this planet with a more smart entity than us."

The U.S. House of Representatives Council has passed a bill to avoid US debt defaults and pave the way for the House of Representatives to vote.

Reuters reports that the Republican House of Representatives Council's Council of the House of Representatives reviews the debt agreement text on Tuesday (May 30). It is the first key test of this agreement in the US Congress and a necessary step before the House of Representatives.

According to the US President Biden and the House Speaker McCarthy [Agreement on Debt Defense for Debt Defense](https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230529-1399442)The United States will suspend US $ 3.1.4 trillion (approximately S $ 42.4 trillion) debt limit to January 1, 2025. At the same time, it is limited to budget expenditures in 2024 and 2025, but the reduction of the Republican Party is not as large as the Republican Party requires.

The U.S. government will also recover the unused crown disease subsidy funds, accelerate the approval procedures of some energy projects, and improve the work requirements for some food subsidies. The non -national defense budget expenditure in fiscal year was basically unchanged, and the fiscal year in 2025 increased by 1%.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-31T09-32-07-00-00/000000.png)The evacuation alert was sent to all citizens of Seoul at 6:41 am local time. The content was "citizens, please prepare to evacuate to let children and the elderly take priority to evacuate."

The evacuation alert did not explain why it was evacuated, nor did it explain where to withdraw. Seoul has long been underground air -proof cars for a long time, but in people's memory, these air -raid caves have not been used in emergencies.

South Korea's largest entrance website Naver told AFP that its network was paralyzed for about 5 minutes due to excessive traffic caused by the alarm.

After about 20 minutes of chaos, the government recovered the alarm.

The second alarm said: "We notify you that the alert sent at 6:41 is wrong."

The withdrawal alarm caused anger and frustration, including the public on social media demanding that the mayor of Seoul Wu Shixun stepped down.

A 37 -year -old father told AFP: "I am very panicked; I take my two young children to the parking lot in the basement according to the instructions."

He said, but the second correction of the alarm made him "speechless and angry."

"Now no one will believe in the real alert, just like the boy lied to say the fables of the wolf came."

The alarm was issued by a rocket with a military spy satellite in North Korea, and the rocket fell into the sea later.

The South Korean military later confirmed that the Rockets flew over the waters west of the Korean Peninsula, not the urban area of Seoul.

But the Seoul authorities defended a warning.

Wu Shixun said at a press conference that due to North Korea's launch of rockets, the municipal government "judged that it is necessary to take action immediately."

"This emergency alert may over -response, but ... security issues cannot be compromised."

Wu Shixun said that Seoul will further improve the alarm system to avoid the public in chaos and issue proper guidance.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-31T09-36-38-00-00/000074707_piclink.jpg)As far as an economy is concerned, because R & D activities are positive, the research and development level of the economy will not reach the optimal R & D and output level of the entire society. To this end, people may actually think or assume that "tangible hands" can solve such "market failures" problems. However, from the current data samples and their research documents, the assumption that "the government can solve the market failure caused by the externality of R & D activities" is difficult to establish, and even further mismatch of resources produces resources. So why didn't you solve this problem?

Before answering the above questions, let's first understand a basic economic concept: market failure. According to neo -classical economics, market failure refers to the distribution of free markets for products and services. In terms of vernacular, the existence of third -party factors in the free market intervention in transactions between consumers and producers, resulting in the price reached by both parties without real reaction to the value of goods or services. In this article, third -party factors are the positive and external nature of R & D activities. This externality has led to some consumers benefited from the R & D activities, but did not conduct economic compensation to producers providing the R & D activities, which led to the price of producers' R & D activities that could not truly reflect the real price of R & D activities. In the end, the producer's R & D activity income was less than the total research and development of society.

With the help of the United States and other countries, Ukraine's success against Russia's invasion will issue a key information, that is, the invasion will not succeed, and the international community will vigorously resist the aggression. Valere Plesch for the New York Times "Our biggest hope is that Beijing can also learn lessons that will not succeed in aggression.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T09-55-21-08-00/30dc-taiwan-ukraine-vzgf-master1050.jpg)The representative of Taiwan in the United States, Xiao Meiqin, said on Tuesday that the success of Ukraine with the help of the United States and other countries is very important to prevent China from trying to invade Taiwan.

"I think resisting aggression is a key information. It helps to prevent any considerations that consider invading that invasion can be punished without punishment, no cost, or quickly misjudgment," Xiao Meiqin was hosted in the Christian Science Proverbs [hosted](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/monitor_breakfast/2023/0530/Taiwan-s-rep-in-US-on-Ukraine-lessons-and-deterring-China)At a breakfast meeting, I told reporters, "We must make sure anyone who considers the possibility of invasion understands this."

Xiao Meiqin refuted the arguments of some Republican councilors and former US officials. They believe that the United States should reduce weapons assistance to Ukraine in order to give priority to establishing Taiwan's defense capabilities and the United States to fight against China.

Missouri Republican Senator Josh Holy and the Trump administration's Pentagon official Elbridge Corbi and others believed that in order to prevent the possibility of potential invasion in China, Taiwan needs some missiles and missiles that are currently being transported to Ukraine The weapon system, also said that the pentagram can be quickly used by the US government to use the aid of Ukraine. They proposed that Taiwan should give priority to accepting weapons produced in the United States in the next few years.

But Xiao Meiqin said that she was not worried about this, because Taiwan's weapons orders were separated from other government orders. She believes that China is paying close attention to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and learning from it. The greater the price paid by Russia, the less likely China to take similar measures for Taiwan.

"Our biggest hope is that Beijing can also learn from the lessons that will not succeed in aggression. The international community will vigorously resist aggression," she said.

China is the most powerful partner of Russia. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Xi Jinping announced that the relationship between the two countries was "no end." However, China has not provided weapons assistance to Russia so far, which shows that China has a cautious attitude towards the conflict between the sanctions on the implementation of Russia with Western countries.

Like serving as Chinese leaders, Xi Jinping said that Taiwan must eventually return to Chinese rule. However, senior officials of the Biden government said that there was no information that Xi Jinping made a clear timetable for this. Xiao Meiqin said that there is no evidence of a specific timetable in Taiwan.

But Taiwan is still strengthening preparations for this. Xiao Meiqin said that Taiwan is aware that it is necessary to strengthen military deterrence and guarantee to China that this autonomous island hopes to maintain the status quo rather than declare independence. She pointed out that Taiwan is extending the period of male compulsory military service from four months to one year, cooperating with the United States to improve military training, and is creating its ability to provide services such as maintenance for F-16 fighters.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-31T10-13-40-08-00/30chun-master1050.jpg)For more than six months, North Korean leader Kim Jong -un seemed to have seen the world's private life, which is unprecedented. In the first group of photos, a girl wearing red shoes, [girl with ponytails](https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20221121/kim-jong-un-daughter-missile-launch/)With Kim Jong-un with Kim Jong-un near a "Mars-17" intercontinental ballistic missile.

Since November last year, North Korean official media have released photos of this pair of father and daughter on more than ten occasions, and they must have been carefully considered from the hairstyle to wearing gloves. Analysts regard these photos as a confirmation of Kim Jong -un's successor, although they cannot independently verify the authenticity of the photos. Since the beginning of the new crown virus, North Korea has been in a state of completely isolating. However, the propaganda machines of the North Korean regime have been operating busy, and the various "photography politics" has caused hot discussions, doubts and media reports from the outside world.

Now that North Korea ’s regular missile tests can no longer produce headlines that Kim Jong -un desired, he seems to be making full use of his daughter’ s global star charm. "Chairman Kim is always eager to get people's attention, but the spotlight is no longer on him," said the director of the North Korean Institute of Research, Kim Yong -soo (sound). The last time the North Korean leader attracted the attention of the world media. When meeting US President Trump.

The problem of the most likely debate of North Korean observer is: Is she the successor?

According to official media reports, the country had previously tested a "Mars-17" intercontinental ballistic missile at an uninterrupted place. In the photos released on February 8 this year, the father and daughter attended the banquet to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Korean People's Army in Pyongyang.

There are some signs to point to affirmative answers. The North Korean regime has long been [obsessed with portrait](https://www.nknews.org/2023/04/the-cult-of-kim-north-koreas-obsession-with-portraits-of-its-leaders/)It is part of the creation of personal worship around each North Korean leader.

advertiseFrom the founder of the country to Kim Jong Il, to Kim Jong -un, the North Korean regime has always been a father. The three generations of men have been announced as the highest leader, and with a set of "[sage] each generation" [sage](https://www.uniedu.go.kr/uniedu/atchfile/down/F000020763.pdf)"The unique rules centered ruled North Korea. North Korea's ideology (the so -called" subjective thought ") mixed socialism and Confucianism. Women's activities. In the theory of socialism in North Korea, society is an organic body. It consists of "the core saints (great leaders) and the party and people around them. Everyone has an irresistible relationship. "Jin Yuanhong (Yin) wrote in a report entitled" North Korea's Women: Careful Observation of Daily Life "in 2004. The core is of course the master of the family, the parent.

Qiu Haiyu, who once served as a senior agent in the intelligence agency, said that North Korea is also blowing the "style of gender reform". Despite this, he still expects that "the highest leader will only be male."

It is obvious throughout North Korea, which is obvious throughout North Korea. Perhaps now it is even more when it was founded by North Korea after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Jin Ri has become a country that has advocated equality between men and women in order to stimulate women to contribute to the economy and society. North Korea's laws give women the right to vote and the right to run for public office, and have established the Democratic Women's Alliance. However, the government was paralyzed in the economic crisis of the 1990s and the famine that caused a large number of deaths. The families who can survive are because the married women in the family have dual roles of supporting their families and housewives.

According to the Special Reporter of Human Rights in the United Nations, "the universal gender stereotype impression" is still the root cause of discrimination against women. "Women are called 'flowers'. Women's appearance -clothes, hairstyles, and even makeup -all are controlled by the country," Elizabeth Salmont wrote in her February report. She said that gender violence has been normalized: "Many women in the country are facing sexual assault and rape, especially the problem of sexual assault and rape that is completely free of punishment by men who live high." The report said that they fled to South Korea About 72%of the northern people are women. More than a dozen women who were architects and doctors told me that although they could only live in the public bathroom or work in a public bath in Seoul, they lived happier and the treatment was more fair.

The photos released on March 20 this year showed that the father and daughter were participating in the official media report as a missile launch exercise. Korean Central News Agency, Via Reuters

Before the love of Kim Lord, the Jin's regime also shaped elite women into political idols. In the 1970s, Kim Jong Il's grandmother Kang Panshi and his mother Kim Jong -Shu were regarded by the "North Korean Women" magazine as an example. Kang Panshi was promoted in popular songs, painting and revolutionary poetry as "[Mother of North Korea](https://www.academia.edu/3079517/The_Women_of_North_Korea_Part_1_Icons_Heroines_and_Power_Players)". Her image has always been wearing [North Korea's traditional clothing](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/07/14/femininity-in-north-korea/), Keeping traditional hairstyles. The North Korean regime Feng Jinshu as "[Mother of the Revolution](https://www.uniedu.go.kr/uniedu/atchfile/down/F000020770.pdf)". Education for women is required to be good wives and mothers.

Although there are several women in the core circle of Kim Jong -un, they all serve his goals. "Kim Jong -un has always used the expertise to give them different roles to use women's followers," said former South Korean Foreign Minister Yin Bingshi. For example, Kim Jong -un's sister [Kim and Zheng](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/kim-yo-jong-north-korea.html)He played the role of a bad police officer in his diplomatic differences with the United States, while the first lady Li Xuezhu played the role of "national mother".

Yin Bingshi said that Kim Jong -un showed that his daughter wanted the Korean people to know that the descendants of Baitou Shanxue have been prepared to defend the Jin's dynasty. He wanted North Koreans to see the image of "all the citizens of all citizens", and Cui Bingxuan, who had monitored North Korea's TV station for 30 years in the South Korean Ministry, said. Kim Jong Il released Kim Lord Ai as a test of balloons to "detect the internal and external reactions of his regime." Kim Yong -soo said. The loyalty of detecting the elite society is a way to measure the degree of consolidation of power; Cui Bingzheng explained that taking out his daughter out shows that he feels quite safe.

The photos of Kim Lord love not only strengthened our existing understanding of North Korea, but also told us more information. She is just the latest member of an elite woman who is idolized and turned into a propaganda. In February of this year, the North Korean regime will print the photos of Golden Lord in five new [stamps] [stamp](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20230214004700325)superior. We can only guess the true intention of Kim Jong -un pushing his daughter to the eyes.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that U.S. military aircraft are close to investigation and seriously endanger China's national sovereignty security. Analysis states that G7 has serious concerns about China's pursuit of militaryization in the East China and South China Sea. At this time, the United States' behavior of crossing the South China Sea with military planes supports and reflects the G7 summit.

It can be clearly seen from the screen that a Chinese fighter screamed in front of the US RC-135 aircraft. The press release issued by the Indo-Pacific Command of the United States pointed out that on May 26, a Chinese J-16 fighter pilot was intercepting the US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft(unnecessarilyaggressivemaneuver)Essence Chinese pilots flew directly to the RC-135 head, forcing American planes to fly across its tail turbulence. India-Pacific Command emphasized that "RC-135 is carried out safely and conventional operations in the South China Sea in the South China Sea in the international airspace."

The statement states that the United States will continue to carry out responsible flights, navigation and operation within the scope allowed by international law. It is expected that all countries in the Indian area can use international airspace safely according to international law. However, in the public statement, the United States did not disclose the specific flight location when the two sides encountered.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning responded to the relevant inquiry at a routine press conference on Wednesday that the United States has frequently sent ships to conduct nearly reconnaissance against China for a long time. This provocative dangerous action is the root cause of maritime safety issues. "China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly maintain its sovereign security."

Former Defense Minister Yang Nianzu in Taiwan said in an interview with this station that the distance between the two sides was so close, and there was the possibility of a gunfire. "Both sides are tense in the South China Sea, Taiwan Straits, or the East China Sea. It can be seen that the military confrontation between the two sides is very obvious."

Similar "close-up contact" was also staged last December last year. At that time, a PLA-11 fighter aircraft approached an RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft near the South China Sea. Forced to avoid collision.

Zhong Zhidong, assistant researcher at the National Security Research Institute of Taiwan's Think Tank and National Security Research Institute, told this station that the actions of the US military aircraft in the South China Sea once again reflected the United States to challenge China ’s sovereign statement to the South China Sea and practice the common claims of G7. He said, "The Shangri -La Conference focuses on the South China Sea and the entire East Asia. The United States uses actions to show the G7 summit's position on the South China Sea. China has responded to the so -called" provocations "behavior they think."

** Why does the South China Sea become a must for the United States and China **

Chen Yuzheng, an assistant professor of the Communist Party of Political and War in Taiwan at the School of Political Science and War of the National Defense University, issued a report that the Beijing government believes that the "South China Sea" is an important direction for the CCP to maintain marine sovereignty. It is the battlefield of the CCP's marine military struggle; on the other hand, the United States believes that the CCP authorities are continuing to expand the ability to effectively control the South China Sea. Therefore State, to jointly ensure the security and stability of the region, in line with the interests of the United States and regional countries.

** The United States announced that the PLA plane provoked the day before China refusing the United States and China Defense Minister talks **Tan Kefei, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, pushed the responsibility to the United States when he responded to the relevant issues on the 31st, saying that on the one hand, the United States had to strengthen communication on the one hand, and on the other hand, regardless of China's concern for human obstacles, it severely destroyed mutual trust between the two armies.

Yang Nianzu pointed out that the United States was dissatisfied with the military plane of the PLA and provoked it at a close range. China urgently notified that the Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu would not meet with US Secretary of Defense Austin in Shangri -La, and both sides were released by political information. "The first part of the United States and China has no mutual trust, the second action is still provocative, and the third is unwilling to use any opportunity to start a dialogue. It means that the atmosphere of the two sides is still very stiff and very serious."

"After the end of the G7, the US -China trade section meets at least first. In terms of national defense, China is currently retained, and maybe it may be slow." Zhong Zhidong analyzed.

Zhong Zhidong believes that China is currently separated from the economic and security dialogue. Because the United States is not decomposed in the economy of G7(decoupling)At least compared to China, meeting the Minister of Commerce and Trade on both sides. During the G7 summit, US President Biden said that the United States and China should be thaw soon, or maybe SoftIssue from such as climate change(Soft topic)Restore the dialogue, and then go to the safe Hard issues(Hard topic)It is possible that the so -called habitation meets again.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T10-25-00Z/59882749_303.jpeg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65779681/59882749)(Voice of Germany Chinese) The official PMI officially announced by China has declined in the second consecutive month in the industrial field, from 49.2 to 48.8. This is the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on Wednesday. PMI below 50 means production is shrinking.

Although the PMI in the service industry is above 50, that is, the expansion area, it also dropped from 56.4 to 54.5. Both the industry and the service industry's PMI are lower than expert expectations.

The world's second largest economy [Calling since the second quarter](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/經濟復甦緩慢-中國地攤重返街頭/a-65767207)The reason is diverse. Export growth slows down. The recovery of the real estate market is not as good as expected. The government slows down its infrastructure expenses. The decline in corporate profits has also put pressure on the political tension between the United States and its allies.

### How to achieve 5%growth goals set by the government

Since the end of the strict new crown policy, the Chinese government hopes to resume economic growth this year. The growth rate in the first quarter was 4.5%year -on -year. Chinese leadership sets the target of this year's economic growth to about 5%. This means that [the growth rate must be further increased to achieve this goal](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国经济好景不再/a-65723945)Essence

Nomura Securities said in a report that PMI declines shows that especially in the manufacturing field, [the risk of falling spiral](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为什么说中国不太可能再次拯救全球经济/a-65613569)More and more real. The report predicts that the industrial PMI in June may still be in the shrinking area.

Chinese manufacturers are deeply impacted by the weakening of global demand. The central banks in the United States, Europe, and Asia have increased interest rates to suppress inflation.

In China, Chinese consumers have recovered tourism and other commercial activities after lifting the new crowned seal control measures, but [strength is lower than expected](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338)Essence

In a report, Capitaleconomics believes that data shows that the Chinese economy recovered at a slower speed in May, and its industrial steps were difficult, and the financial support for construction projects also weakened. But the service industry can still see more obvious growth.

At the same time, the weak PMI data in the industrial field has similar performances in other countries in Asia. The output of Japanese industrial production has also unexpectedly declined, and industrial production in South Korea has also weakened.

China is equipped with an important part of autonomous driving -laser imaging, detection and ranging(Lidar, referred to as laser radar for short)The vehicle shipment of sensors is the first in the world, and after recently replacing Japan to become the world's largest car exporter, it is likely to maintain this position.

A spokesman for the United Maritime Force said that despite the suspension of the United Arabia, it is still a partner country.

Timothy Hawkins, the commander of the United Maritime Force, told AFP: "United Maritime Forces still include 38 partners countries, and the United Arab League is one of them."

Iran seized two tankers within the week of April and early May, including an empty ship sailing between the Port of Dubai and FUJAIRAH.

Iran was also accused of attacking an Israeli oil tanker in November 2022, which increased the tension between Iran and the United States.

There is a serious injustice in society. The education of young people in school is very different from their feelings. The psychological gap is very large. The execution rate of China's death penalty is also at the forefront of the world, and it is likely to have injustice and may even include political prisoners. In recent years, China's fines have been severely fined, and the amount of large amounts is amazing. Some drivers who live a truck have given up driving because of their fines. Even the officials who were fined acknowledged that recently fiscal tensions, so they have a lot of fines. There are many rotten projects in China. Soon after some projects were completed, problems occurred. In addition, many people know that the price is not allowed to reduce the price. The price reduction and selling houses will encounter trouble.

The U.S. Treasury has warned that if the federal debt -raising limit will not be raised by June 5, the treasury will be exhausted, and the government will repay the debt without cash.

Kevin McCarthy, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and US President Biden reached a debt limit, he had confidence in the debt limit bill in the House of Representatives. However, Chip Roy, a member of the Housefreedom Caucus, said, "Republicans should not vote in favor. This is a bad agreement. No one voted for us to increase debt 4 trillion US dollars without gaining nothing and obtained nothing. ","

Michael Hewson, an analyst of CMC Markets (CMC Markets) analysts, pointed out that CITIC has "fist to prepare to cut US debt -based criticism, etc.".

However, Hakem Jeffries, the leader of the House of Representatives Democratic Party, is still confident. He told Bloomberg TV: "We will allow this bill to pass the finish line tomorrow."

As the House of Representatives will perform the whole house later today, intense investors will go out of risk assets and drag out the decline of Asian stocks.

Although Chinese leaders have worked hard to quickly boost economic growth, the latest data show that the Chinese manufacturing activities last month have further shrunk and have also affected market confidence.

The 225 index of the Japanese stocks fell 1.4%to 30887.88 points. The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong stocks closed 1.9%to 18234.27 points. The Shanghai Comprehensive Stock Index closed down 0.6%to 3204.56 points.

As for other Asian stocks, it is also a tragic green. Sydney, Seoul, Bangkok, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all closed down.

On the one hand, the United States requires South Korea not to try to fill the gaps left by Micron in China. On the other hand, in the face of the downturn of the domestic economy in South Korea, some economic commentators believe that the United States requires violation of market principles, and South Korea should occupy this market.

In late May, after imposing sanctions on the US -optical chip in the United States on the grounds of security review, China was embarrassed by the South Korean semiconductor industry, which also triggered a major discussion at home and abroad.

** South Korea's embarrassing situation triggered by Meiguang's ban **

On the one hand, the United States requires South Korea not to try to fill the gaps left by Micron in China. On the 28th, Bloomberg quoted sources as saying: "The Korean government will not encourage Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to use Micron to increase in China to increase China in China Market share ". Korean economic commentator Kim Heypeng (sound) believes: "South Korea's semiconductor technology and equipment depend on the United States. From the perspective of long -term technology development, it should not violate the wishes of the United States, and the market share of Micron's Chinese market is not high, even if South Korea The occupation of this blank company will not help South Korea's economic development. "Facing the hustle and bustle of the media, South Korean semiconductor companies have fallen into an embarrassing situation. Samsung Electronics and SK Hemiliation cautiously said:" There is no formal position. "

On the other hand, in the face of the downturn in South Korea's domestic economy, some economic commentators believe that the requirements of the United States have violated market principles, and South Korea should occupy this gap. On the 29th, the Global Times (English version) also stated through the column: "South Korea's semiconductor companies are taken for granted in the Chinese market. South Korea should make practical choices. Otherwise, South Korea's economic prospects will be extremely worrying. "South Korea's economic commentator Park Shuxian (sound) believes:" South Korea and the United States are allies, so South Korea -US relations cannot have changed greatly, but this does not mean that South Korea and the United States are consistent in interest relationships. The country and the country are very complicated in economic interests. For example, the Dutch and Japan, which are also American allies, have always been hesitant on the issue of semiconductor exports to China. This is an opportunity for Korean companies. "

Since China and the United States have entered competition and opposition, South Korea has been facing the problem of border selection stations. For a year since he took office, Yin Xiyue, a conservative leader of South Korea, has joined the "Chip Quartet Alliance", "Indo -Pacific Economic Prosperity Framework", and visiting Japan and visiting the United States. Especially in May, he attended the Summit of the Seventh National Group in May. This was considered by the international community. It marks completely falling to the United States. However, this time the Chinese sanctioned Micron's incident fully exposed that South Korea could not do it in the United States in the United States.

South Korea's judge Song Huying (sound) believes: "In the current economic and diplomatic state, whether in terms of population size or geographical location, if we have cut off the imports and exports with neighboring countries, especially China, I am afraid that we will even be even connected If you can't persist in two weeks, you have to fall down. South Korea, Japan, and the United States have gone too close. This biased diplomacy is worrying. In the context of Chinese and American competition, South Korea's strength is still very limited. It is necessary to go in the beginning of the United States, because behind the instructions that our United States and Japan also have their own plans. In this case, why do we do against China in person to lose great opportunities? "

A relevant person in the semiconductor industry said: "Semiconductors have surpassed the simple industrial level and became the object of political conflict. From the perspective of an enterprise, we can only observe the situation and find the maximum benefits."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-31T11-05-00-04-00/000000.png)工人在山东德州一家工厂中工作REUTERS/Siyi Liu/File Photo  [Audio-1-Link：https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm2-05312023103930.html/@@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm2-05312023103930.html/@@stream)China announced on May 31st that the manufacturing PMI of May was 48.8%, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from the previous month, and continued to fall slightly under Rongku. The production index and the new order index in May also declined slightly. Statistics show that both ends of production have slowed down.

[** Chinese manufacturing PMI drops to the top 100 housing companies below the Rongku Line.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-05012023113906.html)*** [The momentum of the difficult manufacturing industry of China's economic recovery slows down](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-04032023121404.html)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China announced in May that China's manufacturing procurement manager index, non -manufacturing business activity index and comprehensive PMI output index were 48.8%, 54.5%, and 52.9%, respectively, lower than 0.4, 1.9 and 1.5 percentage points below the previous month. "The level of China's economic prosperity has fallen, and the foundation of restoration of development still needs to be consolidated."

The reason why the China Statistics Bureau further analyzed the manufacturing procurement manager index slightly declined. First of all, the two ends of the production demand have slowed down. The production index and the new order index were 49.6%and 48.3%, respectively, down 0.6 and 0.5 percentage points from the previous month. "The demand for the manufacturing market is still insufficient, and the release of enterprise capacity release is suppressed."

Second, the price index continues to fall. Affected by factors such as the recent decline in the price of some commodities and the weak market demand, the price indexes of products such as oil and coal and chemical raw materials are lower than 31%, and the industry's upstream and downstream markets are not high.

Third, the large -scale enterprise PMI is 50.0%to the critical point, but the prosperity of small and medium -sized enterprises is still under glory and is still weak.

On the other hand, the non -manufacturing business activity index in May was 54.5%. Although below 1.9 percentage points last month, the Statistics Bureau interpreted that this year has maintained more than 54.0%of the boom range. The industry has steadily recovered and the construction industry recovers high.

Zhang Liqun, a special analyst of Sina Finance, interpreted the data released on Wednesday, "indicates that the economic recovery trend is still gathered." He analyzed that the order class index continued to fall slightly, reflecting the proportion of enterprises with insufficient market demand to increase to more than 58%or more The problem of shrinking demand is still prominent. Affected by this, corporate confidence is still weak, and production and operation activities are cautious; insufficient demand also causes the price index to fall.

** Chinese boom "weak recovery" may wait for the July Politburo meeting to open the solution. **

The international copper price has recently fallen below the $ 8,000 integer level. Due to the weak economic recovery, the copper price of the commodity of the economic direction is the low point since November last year. Some media interpreted, because a series of economic data showed that China's prosperity was stagnant, and China did not sacrifice large -scale expenditure investment infrastructure, coupled with the low -end hovering of China's real estate prosperity, impacting market confidence.

According to the first financial analysis, a series of economic data announced since May is less than expected. Political games may also cause profitability. "

An article about how Sina Finance looks at "strong expectations" and "weak recovery" pointed out that the current economic structural problems are concentrated in three aspects. One is that the level of upstream and downstream inventory is relatively high; Large, the restoration of life and business travel services has a short -term chain of economic stimulation, and the process of revenue recovery is required. In the process, the economy may be weakened from the previous quarter; and the third is that the willingness of residents to add leverage is not strong. "The economy may be difficult to continue to strengthen in the next quarter."

According to the analysis of the article, the fastest of the change of the bureau needs to observe the Politburo meeting in July this year. It is more likely that under other macro pressure catalysis such as local finance or employment, the total policy increases.

[Enterprise Close](https://maps.clb.org.hk/?i18n_language=zh_CN&map=1&startDate=2023-05&endDate=2023-05&eventId=2023050515393622063&addressId=350500&address=%E6%B3%89%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82)Essence The factory also violated the law that the workers must sign a voluntary resignation letter before they issued the salary of March that had been arrears.

Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager. Some workers sent a confrontation scene in Douyin [Video](https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA1p7MwZLcIxN-nQUiu8yogLIDKf2PS7Cxw7e6pYJABIY?modal_id=7228898852244376847&relation=0&vid=7228898852244376847)Essence

Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.

Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to Wuli Industrial Zone was also the same. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?

It should be asked why!

Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?

As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. [Company Branch Committee](http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm)". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?

On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article [report](https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&source=search_tab)It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.

We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.

In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?

With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.

It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.

As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor [Xi Jinping once scolded](https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html)Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.

As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".

What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?

On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported [report](https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&source=search_tab)It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.

However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.

According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.

So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?

According to the report of China Industry.com, the union of various districts and counties in Quanzhou respects the first spirit of the grassroots and innovates independently through self -selected actions. The goal is to refine a batch of good experience and good practices that can be replicated and promoted. The Jinjiang Trade also creates a 2.0 version mechanism according to the actual needs of employees.Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[[Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality](http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html)"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.

However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.

In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".

In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.

The good situation of enterprises ".

The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.

Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".

For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.

The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.

In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.

Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.

The organizer believes that with the expansion of China's threats and influence on Taiwan and the world, stage play with the theme of June 4th incident will be more attractive.

[** Hundreds of Christian pastor believers in Hong Kong co -signed the "June 4th 34th Anniversary Prayer" **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-05292023120320.html)*** [[How do I know the June 4th] Come on the Come on the September](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/duzheguangchang/dz-05302023170923.html)**

The International Territory Taiwan Branch cooperated with Taiwan's "Xiaoli Theater". On the eve of the 34th anniversary of the 64th, the theme of Tiananmen was repeated. It tells the 64th stage drama "5 "March 35".

Qiu Yizheng, Secretary -General of the International Type of Taiwan Branch, said that last year, the Hong Kong version of "May 35" film in Taiwan was broadcast, which caused a large response. There were already planning to be repeated in Taiwan. This year, there are six plans to perform a total of six games. It's better. I believe that as China threatens the global threat, it will pay more people to pay attention to the theme of human rights in China and Hong Kong.

Qiu Yizhen: "We are not just talking about June 4th, but we will talk about more and more extensive human rights issues. Li Mingzhe's incident, Fucha and Yang Zhiyuan, etc. There are more and more people. They enter China or Hong Kong. It will face the danger of personal safety. After the implementation of the National Security Law, the Chinese government is constantly expanding the jurisdiction of the law. You may also be asked by the Chinese government to be sent to China to accept legal trials. More and more people can feel the same, and it cannot be related to me. "

Qiu Yizhen said that in the past, in Taiwan, it was mainly human rights groups focusing on the June 4th incident and the status of human rights in China. I hope to repeat the story of the stage drama of June 4th and attract the attention of Taiwanese who rarely come into contact with Chinese sensitive political topics.

Qiu Yizhen: "The issue of human rights in China is actually not that we close the door ourselves to care about it, and it will not affect us. In fact, it will affect the current situation of the entire area and even global human rights. The people do not touch politics at all, but in his daily life, he will still face his family or relatives and friends. Can you mourn? The oppression and control of freedom is actually omnipotent. "

She said that when looking for the theater cooperation, there was no theater group refused because of the risks of the "Hong Kong National Security Law", but they would specially arrange for Hong Kong performers in Cantonese to read a mask.

He said that with such determination, it is related to his experience of the mainland's freedom at once. In the 2020s of the Taiwan election voting day, the experience of being questioned in Macau made him cherish the value of freedom.

Although the June 4th incident has occurred for 34 years, Xun Boyuan believes that "May 35" through the mother of the victim "Kobayashi", fully expressing that Tiananmen is difficult to be suppressed and painful for many years. History can also reflect the contemporary human rights situation. In addition to talking about June 4th, the version of the performance in Taiwan also joined the historical elements of Taiwan and Hong Kong.

演: "We have to blur the boundary of this performance. The Taiwanese songs listening to 'Kobayashi' are Taiwanese banned songs. When the 228 incident, the white horrible Taiwanese ban song. The audience will see on the stage. A folding umbrella represents the "Umbrella Revolution" that has been once; there is a bouquet of sun flowers in the vase, etc. All the images about the struggle will be presented on the stage. It is not just a single one. Perhaps through this story, it can also let the audience think that I want to be economically handsome, or human rights. "

Liang Dexiang, the performer of the student's mother "Kobayashi", said that he understands the sensitivity of the subject matter of this performance, but emphasizes that as an actor, he is not a political struggle, but just wants to show his mother's love for his son. The problems affect the performance.

###  game reproduce the Russian and Ukraine battlefield: Is this okay?

(Voice of Germany Chinese) A German company developed a computer game called "Death Fromabove" based on the theme of the Ukrainian war. This drone simulation game recently opened the "Early Access" mode on the Internet distribution platform "Steam", that is, the game is still in the development stage.

Given that the Ukraine War was in a long -lasting state, before the game came out, the ethical issues around the game became a topic of discussion in Western media. Some people think that the development of such a game is not tasteful, and others praise this as a "ironic technique", and compare it with the imitation works of Chaplin Movies and Hitler.

"This is a promotional game," Remote Control Productions, the owner of Remote Control Production, the headquarters of Munich, said HENDRIKLESSER. The company brings together a dozen small computer game companies from six countries.

He said, "We deliberately make a simple game that anyone can play, and shows a clear position that handles this theme in a humorous way to some extent."

The game plot is a player played a Ukrainian soldier, controlled a drone bombing the Russian war equipment and fighters, and finally resumed radio communication.

### ** "Sacred Gun" ** from the United States

The first version of the game is English and Ukraine bilingual, 90 minutes. The Ukrainian soldiers played by the players threw bombs to the Russian tanks marked with the letters "V" and "Z", as well as the "Russian Occupible Forces" marked.

The location of the game is fictional, with a symbol of Ukraine everywhere, such as the sunflower field. The trajectory left by the UAV is the color of the Ukrainian flag.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T12-02-00Z/65724699_401.png)The sunflower field in the game of "Death from Above"

There are also many "humor" ingredients in the game, such as "sacred javelin" (this is the Ukraine's name for the American javelin portable anti -tank weapon), or [Russian president of the Russian President on the International Criminal Court of Criminal Court Putin's image](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/国际刑事法院对普京发出逮捕令/a-65035499)Essence

Developers regard the game as part of the so -called pro -Ukrainian Internet community NAFO movement. NAFO is a NORTH Atlantic Fellasorganization that combats the false information of Russia on Twitter(North Atlantic Partner Organization)The abbreviation is a cartoon dog.

### ** Donation for the Ukrainian army **

The Ukrainians participated in the design and music creation of this game. The most famous singer is the "Antytila" band. Their war songs, such as "Bach Murte Fortress", are very popular in Ukraine. In May 2022, the band performed with the Irish Rock Legend U2 band on the Kiev subway.The developer promised that at the beginning, 30%of the profit and loss will donate 70%of the profit to two plans to provide "non-offensive assistance" to the Ukrainian army-the Ukraine Foundation "back" and "drone army" project.

Rice said that he received the guarantee to use this money to buy unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, not an aggressive drone, but he also admitted: "I can't be sure of this."

### Russian border area has been attacked in Ukraine and said it has nothing to do with this

### ** "part of the information war"? **

Benjaminstrobel, a psychologist from Kir, said in an interview with DW that "a game with a game with a victory or defeat is a bit of no taste. "In addition, this game may be accused of mixing" political activities "with" economic interests ".

Strobell praised the developer, saying that this was a propaganda that supported Ukraine and "part of the information war." "As a society, we must answer whether we want to be part of this information war," the psychologist said.

Dianadutsyk, director of the Ukrainian Media and Communications Institute and a member of the Journalism and Ethics Commission, believes that if the game reflects the situation on the battlefield, that is, the battle between the army and the army, it is acceptable. However, "if the game provokes violence against civilians due to race reasons", it will make her feel disturbed, such as the "killing Ukraine" appearing on Russian TV.

### a to help Ukraine win the war?

### ** Raising funds for drones ** **

"Antytila" (antibody) band singer Tarastopolja believes that discussion on ethics is a matter of Western experts. He and his band members participated in the territorial defense war in the first few months after the outbreak of the war. He said: "In our camp, 45 children lost their father. That was our comrades -in -arms that we sacrificed in the war." Topers believes that this game will "inspire people to donate to drones." Promote some people to "join the army and learn air reconnaissance."

"Remote control" Hendrik Lesser said that he hopes to further develop this game after the first version released for the two for participation. He said that his main motivation was to "counterattack", not on the real battlefield, but on the virtual battlefield.

Officials said that Pashpa Kamale Dahar will seek a long -term agreement that exports water power and opens a new Indian route during the visit.

The four -day visits began on Wednesday was the first visit since Darhar was again elected Prime Minister in December last year.

As early as 2008, he visited India twice.

This visit is the tradition of Nepal's new leaders. New Delhi is the first foreign stop in Hong Kong after taking office, highlighting the solid relationship between neighboring South Asia.

Foreign Minister Narajan Placash Saudi Arabia said Nepal is seeking long -term transactions in energy, including India's more investment in hydropower projects and the construction of transmission lines between the two countries.

Narayan Pla Kash Saudi told reporters, "We also hope that India will promote our export of electricity to Bangladesh."

Nepal has the potential to generate a hydropower of up to 42,000 MW. It is hoped that it can produce about 3500 MW of hydropower by next year, and domestic demand is 2,000 MW.

Gedman hopes to export excess energy to its largest economic and trade partners and consumes large power consumption of India.

India is investing billions of dollars to build infrastructure including hydropower stations, because New Delhi hopes to expand its influence among smaller neighbors, and China is becoming more and more active among these neighboring countries.

During the visit of Dahar, it will urge India to open three more points along the border. Airlines can enter and exit Nepal from these points. Officials said that this will help promote air traffic from two new international airports -one is located in tourism Bokara, a small town, is the birthplace of the Buddha's founder of Buddhism.

Nepal Civil Aviation Bureau spokesman Jagnat Nurula(Jagannath Niraula)Tell Reuters, "This will save about 15 minutes of flight time to and from the west, reduce fuel consumption and make the flight cheaper."

Dahar, a 68 -year -old leader, will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

Since becoming the Indian Prime Minister in 2014, Modi has visited Nepal five times, and the latest visit was in May 2022.

She began to find a job since autumn. She hoped to find a primary position of about 7,000 yuan a monthly salary of about 7,000 yuan in a large city in central China. She only got a few internship opportunities, only 1400 to 2,000 yuan per month, without any benefits.

In May this year, she sent a message to more than 200 recipients within two days and delivered a resume to 32 companies -but only got two interview opportunities. She said she would accept any job, including sales of sales that was unwilling to consider before.

"In the past 10 or 20 years, the society is full of prosperity, and there are opportunities everywhere," she said in a telephone interview. "Even if you want to fight for some opportunities now, you know that you can't see which direction you can go in."

As China stepped out of the epidemic, young people in the country were facing a record high -loss rate. Whether in career or spiritual, they are struggling. However, Xi Jinping, the top leader of the Communist Party and the country, told them that they should no longer feel that they cannot engage in physical labor or not to the countryside. Xi Jinping instructed them to learn "hardships."

Many young people do not buy this. They believe that they have obtained a bachelor's or graduate degree through hard study, but found that the employment market has shrunk, salary levels, and extension of working hours. Now the government has told them to suffer. Why?

"I think it's like lied to you, just hope you dedicate it unconditionally, and then do something that they don't want to do," Gloolia Lee said.

Parents and teachers love to educate people like Gloolia Lee to endure hardships. Now I still have to listen to the national leaders.

"Let's put a good stable day, but let young people find hard," Cai Shenkun, an independent political commentator, wrote on Twitter that Xi Jinping's proposal was "contempt for young people."

"What kind of heart is this?" He asked. "Where do you bring young people in China?"

There were 11.6 million college graduates who entered the labor market this year, setting a historical record, and one of each five young people was unemployed. This generation grew up in an increasingly prosperous environment, and Chinese leaders hope to convince them to accept a different reality.

Youth unemployment rate is a statistics that the CCP attaches great importance to, because it believes that young people who are idle may threaten its rule. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong sent more than 16 million urban youths including Xi Jinping to the countryside. After the Cultural Revolution, these unemployed young people returned to the city to a certain extent forced the party to accept the work of individual operations or the national planned economy.

Today, the party's propaganda machine is making young people depending on [meals](https://tianmunews.com/news.html?id=2386126), [ recycle garbage](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1644948230_m620beb0603300zphb.html?from=edu)[Snack stall](https://finance.sina.cn/2023-03-28/detail-imynktuf8305864.d.html?from=wap#:~:text=%E8%B5%B5%E5%BA%86%E4%B9%A6%E4%B8%8E%E8%8C%83%E4%B8%B9%E4%B8%B9%E6%98%AF%E6%9D%A5%E8%87%AA,%E6%83%B3%E6%91%86%E6%91%8A%E5%81%9A%E7%94%9F%E6%84%8F%E3%80%82), [Fish](https://weibo.com/6004281123/4897583664990306)The story of farming lived a decent life. This is the official "gas lamp control" (a psychological manipulation method, which causes the victim to have a cognitive imbalance, questioning his perception or judgment -translation), and trying to transfer government policies to destroy the economy. Departments, imposing unnecessary rigorous epidemic prevention measures, and isolated Chinese trading partners.

Many people are struggling in spirit. Ms. Zhang in Shanghai graduated last year and obtained a master's degree in urban planning. She voted 130 resumes, but did not get any job opportunities. She only got a few interview opportunities. She rented in a three -bedroom Jiupongmi bedroom and lived with a part -time tutoring. The income of less than 5,000 yuan was barely living.

"When I was in a bad mood some time ago, I think if I am a robot," she said, "I will not feel helpless, I will not feel helpless, and I will not feel frustrated and disappointed. I will always vote. "

But she realized that she should not be too harsh to herself. The problem exceeded her solution. She doesn't believe the set of hardships.

"Tell us to suffering to cover up the situation of lack of power in domestic economic development and reduced employment," she said. Like most people I interviewed in this column, for safety considerations, she hopes to reveal only her surname. Some people want to use their own English name.

The information passed by the party is effective for some people. Guo is a data analyst in Shanghai. He has not worked since last summer. He said he did not want to blame his unemployment on the epidemic or the Communist Party. He blames himself to lack luck and ability.

He canceled the subscription of online games and music. In order to maintain his livelihood, he began to takeaway from December last year and worked 11 to 12 hours a day. In the end, he just earned a little more than 5,000 yuan a month. He resigned because the job was too tired.

In other words, he can't suffer.advertise

Such a policy will destroy the Chinese dream that many young people and their parents cherish, that is, the improvement of social status.

Wang is an former advertising executive in Kunming, southwestern China. Since the epidemic in December 2021 has caused serious blows to his industry, he has been unemployed. He talked to his parents who wanted to go back to his hometown to raise a pig farm. He said his parents strongly opposed the idea.

"They said they spent so much money to learn for me, just to make me not farmers," he said.

In the strict Chinese society, physical labor is despised. Due to the huge gap between the rich and the poor between urban and rural areas, the status of agriculture is even lower.

"Go to a girlfriend. When you hear that you are sending takeaway, you will definitely not consider it," he said. If it is a farmer, his situation in the marriage market will be worse.

For some young people, it is clear that Xi Jinping's suggestion to solve the problem of unemployment is a retrogression.

Xi Jinping "he is a great rejuvenation every day", graduated from a top university in the UK, a master's degree in interactive design, and Stephen, who has not yet found a job, said. "But the revival is not everyone to do physical work," he said. Due to the rapid development of robots and other technologies, these physical work can be easily replaced.

Of the 13 Chinese graduates in his school, five of them chose to stay in the West and found a job in Silicon Valley or Wall Street. Only three of the eight people returned to China got job opportunities. Steven moved back to China this year, so that he could be closer to his mother.

After a few months of futile job search, he, like almost all young workers interviewed in this column, believes that he has no future in China.

"I think it's the best way for me now," he said, "I just persuade my parents to make me moisturize."

Huang Renxun, the world's largest independent drawing chip (GPU) supplier (GPU) supplier and the Nvidia (Taiwan translated "Huida"), recently visited Taiwan.

Nvidia and Taiwan University announced the establishment of the AI R & D Center, hired 1,000 employees, and cooperated with the university to cultivate talents. The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that in 2021, through Nvidia's application for artificial intelligence and innovation research and development center plan, the total funding was about NT $ 24.3 billion (about 5.6 billion yuan), the Ministry of Economic Affairs subsidized 6.7 billion yuan (approximately 1.5 billion yuan), and Nvidia raised about 176 self -raising about 176 100 million yuan (about 4 billion yuan).

Huang Renxun, who is white -haired and wearing black leather clothes, encouraged to run towards dreams at the graduation ceremony of Taiwan University. Four sentences make the AI seconds compile into a song, buy a twist roll in the night market, and the theme song of the "Defending Warrior" theme song on the street on the street, Ladygaga, "Defending Soldier", a little brother met Huang Renxun in the restaurant, and went to buy it temporarily. The graphics card should be signed and other news, which has caused heated discussions on Chinese Weibo.

Chinese netizens pay more attention to Huang Renxun attended the Q & A meeting of global media and analysts on the 30th to the outside world that the US government has prohibited Nvidia and ultra -micro (AMD) advanced chips to China. Cloud services and consumer interactive services, digital payments have also improved, and the electric vehicle market has developed rapidly. Regardless of the regulatory situation of the United States, the Chinese government will use this opportunity to actively support the development of the localized chip industry.

Liu Peizhen, director of the production and economic database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty. It was said that Huang Renxun was standing on a commercial interest. It was difficult for Intel to catch up. SMIC was made in 14nm. In the 3 -nanometer process, China lacks advanced chips. It is difficult to surpass Nvida GPU overlord within three or five years.

Liu Peizhen said: "TSMC could not help him OEM, nor could he help him. Samsung I wouldn't think of it. Intel did not dare to help China work in the advanced process. If you do it in the year, there must be a corresponding process to help him manufacture. He must have a cooperation of an ecosystem's industrial chain. Nvida has been working for a long time, and the surrounding ecosystem is quite large. ","

Wang Xiuwen, an assistant researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense and Safety, was interviewed and analyzed by Radio Free Asia. Nvidia, ultra -micro (AMD), Intel and other American businessmen and Chinese industry players cooperated closely. US sanctions would make American companies feel pain!Although China has not yet produced a chip below 7 nanometers, it has been thrown behind in the short term, but China has been finding a way to break through this difficulty.

Wang Xiuwen said: "For example, with a variety of different non -advanced chips such as 14nm, 18nm, and 12nm, combined in combination, using small chip packaging technology to assemble the most advanced processor in Nvidia, but this requires this to be able to chase Nvidia, but this must be this required, but this must be this. It costs a lot of cost and time. Now that mainland China is trying this matter, Huang Renxun will be anxious, because he will worry that one of his processors will sell so expensive. In case of a relatively cheap method in mainland China, the combination is used in a relatively cheap method, a combination of combination If you do n’t need the most advanced things to catch up, it may be a lot to be lost in his market. "

On August 26 last year (2022) on August 26, the export restrictions on super -micro and Nvida graphics processors (GPUs) were required to obtain permission to export related products to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia to avoid related GPUs It is deployed in military use, and the ban has a 1 -year buffer period.According to a comprehensive report, the GPU chip of Nvidia A100 and H100 by the United States is banned by the United States, which is essential for developing generation AI technologies such as ChatGPT. The A100 is the 7 -nanometer process of TSMC, which is used to accelerate AI, data analysis and efficient energy computing operations. Nvidia confirmed to sell H800 in China in March this year, and has been adopted by Chinese cloud operators such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. Foreign media reports is about half a speed reduction than H100.

Wang Xiuwen said that some Chinese players responded to the "downgrade version". If the U.S. government's discovery of the downgraded version can still help develop missiles and ultra -high -speed weapons in mainland China, it may still be prohibited. Some American merchants have therefore adopted shares or investments in China to avoid restrictions on the US ban.

Wang Xiuwen mentioned that the top five AI servers in the world in 2020 and 2021, China Inspur Group, Huawei, and Lenovo are all listed. China AI server clouds and terminals need a large number of AI chips. Nvidia is optimistic that there are very good prospects around 2025. If you can only sell Chinese downgrade chips, it has a great impact on business.

American Semiconductor Industry Association(IS)Recently, although the US government has national security concerns, US semiconductor companies still want to enter the Chinese market, hoping that the government will make clear norms, and emphasize that China is the largest market and must play a role in that market.

The British media "Financial Times" published an exclusive interview with Huang Renxun on May 24, and mentioned that Huang Renxun admitted that the export control measures of the Bayeng government have caused Nvidia to be tied up. China accounts for about one -third of the US technology industry market. If American companies cannot do business with Chinese companies, they will cause huge losses to American companies. Huang Renxun also mentioned that it is feasible to make chips outside Taiwan, but the Chinese market cannot be replaced.

Chinese Weibo article reprinted this article particularly emphasized Huang Renxun, "If we are deprived of the Chinese market, we have no spare plan. There is no another China, only one China."

According to media reports, Huang Renxun will visit China in the next week to communicate with manufacturers. Wang Xiuwen said, just like ordinary American businessmen, in Asia, inspecting the Chinese market after inspecting the Taiwan market. Jeremy Lin Shuhao in the US NBA professional basketball team also played in mainland China and then played in Taiwan.

The artificial intelligence chat robot program developed by OpenAI ChatGPT launched the AI boom in November last year. Nvidia's stock price was soaring at $ 108 at the beginning of the year, and it exceeded $ 401 on May 31. Nvidia's market value is nearly 1 trillion dollars, and it jumps in the top five companies in the world. Taiwan financial expert Xie Jinhe said that Huang Renxun's light has covered Elonreeve Musk, CEO of Tesla, who is visiting China.

Taiwan media magazines described that Huang Renxun also led a ticket to Taiwan Factory to become the "AI server". Taiwan Media Joint News reported that among the top ten IC design, Huida, Super Weimin (AMD), MediaTek, Lianyong, and Ruyu are all from Taiwan. Foreign media pointed out that this special "human network" is the key to Taiwan semiconductors from downstream to the upstream.

According to the Central News Agency in Taiwan, in mid -April this year, six teachers in Bijie Weijin County, Guizhou picked up cobblestone in the river beach. The per capita has been drowned. It is rumored that the two teachers are Li Dijun, a teacher in the Racecourse Primary School, and Xu Qian, a kindergarten teacher in the racecourse town.

** School President: Teachers pick up stones probably about playing **

The family members of the two drowned teachers claimed that the six teachers would go to the river beach to pick up pebble pebbles because the relevant government units were not enough for the school decoration when they conducted a school inspection. It is recommended that teachers pick up pebbles to decorate the school environment.

However, Zhang Xijun, the principal of the Primary School, denied that the purpose of picking up the pebble pebbles was to deal with superiors for inspection. When the reporter asked Zhang Xijun's six teachers why he wanted to pick up stones together? Zhang Xijun said: "I don't know that, it should be to play together!"

At the same time, the Government of Malaysia Town and the Propaganda Department of the Zhijin County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also clarified the responsibilities, saying that "teachers to welcome leadership inspections on the Internet" is not a fact.

After the teacher's drowning incident received media attention, the Jianjin County Government News Office notified the incident on May 28, but the notice did not indicate the reason why the six teachers picked up stones. To this end, Li Xiancheng, a journalist Li Xiancheng, was assigned by the leader on May 29 to go to Guizhou to investigate the drowning incident. However, when Li Xiancheng first interviewed the family members of the deceased, he was questioned by a man with unknown identities, and then was followed by three strange men, besiege, and broke his mobile phone.

After the incident, Li Xiancheng said that he is not in trouble now, and he hopes that the local area can severely punish the perpetrator and take out the instructions behind the scenes. In this regard, the local government said that the public security department has not yet clarified the identity of strange men, but "it must have nothing to do with the government department."

Regarding the local government's constant decoration of peace and clarifying the responsibilities, the reporter was beaten in the case when reporting the case, which caused the outside world to discuss and dissatisfaction with black gold politics.

### Anti -monopoly and data security

Some experts have noticed that mostly the controlled enterprises are capable of collecting a large number of user information and obtaining platform companies with absolute advantage in the market. Maximilianmayer, a professor of global science and technology policy at Bonn University in Germany, analyzed the Voice of Germany: "The purpose of this movement is to strengthen the supervision of large Internet companies and its data processing methods."

### Wealth Reconstruction

Xi Jinping, a Chinese national leader, put forward the goal of "common prosperity", and the Chinese technology industry giants have expressed their full support. For example, Tencent and Alibaba will invest 50 billion and 100 billion yuan respectively to help "common prosperity." According to external analysis, the Chinese government uses suppression to promote technology giants to share their wealth with employees and consumers, and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in politics.

While "soft technology" enterprises encounter China's supervision, "hard technology" companies such as Huawei and DJI are more restricted from abroad. For many years, the United States has not only been committed to eradicating Chinese equipment such as Huawei in its country, but also trying to convince other countries not to buy related equipment. "Safety Equipment Act"(Secure Equipment Act)It is one of the latest actions made by the US government to combat China Telecom and technology companies.

Another example of tightening the restrictions on Chinese technology companies is to include Chinese artificial intelligence giants Shangtang Technology on a blacklist. The US government said that the company on the list provides support for China's military development. This week, the US Treasury Department also included a number of Chinese companies on the entity list, including the world's largest commercial drone manufacturer DJI innovation and multiple biotechnology companies.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-31T13-45-25/1-1685539582.png)Analysts said that the UAE was disappointed with the failure of the United States to protect the Middle East (Reuters)

The UAE Foreign Ministry said that after a wide range of security needs, the United Arab Emirates withdrew from the US -led maritime alliance.

In a statement quoted by the national news institution WAM on Wednesday, the UAE Foreign Ministry stated that "because we are evaluating effective and security cooperation with all partners, two months ago, the UAE withdrew from the participation of the maritime joint forces."

The UAE also stated that it is committed to dialogue and diplomatic contact to promote regional security and stability, and ensure the safety of navigation near its coast according to international law.

This decision marks the critical moment of the geopolitical pattern of the region, which has changed the dynamics of international cooperation in maritime security.

The establishment of the US Naval Base headquarters in Barin, a special forces of 34 countries, was established to combat terrorism and pirate behaviors in the Red Sea and Gulf areas.

The region has some of the most important routes in the world. Since 2019, a series of attacks on ships have occurred at the time of tight relations between the United States and Iran.

With its strategic position on the important maritime trade route, the UAE has always been an active participant in the United States Leadership Maritime Alliance.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-31T13-45-25/1-1685539829.jpg)The United States' rule in the Middle East is coming to an end, and now it is China's turn.

#### Iran threat

In early May, the United States stated that it would strengthen its "defensive situation" in the Gulf area because Washington accused Tehran accusing Tehran more attack on commercial shipping.

Iran detained two international oil tankers at the Strait of Holmus at the end of April and early May, including the "Neowei" from Dubai to the Port of Fullara, UAE.

Iranian officials said that one of the tankers collided with one Iranian ship and tried to escape, and the other oil tanker was brought into Iran's territorial sea after receiving legal complaints.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the UAE's decision to withdraw from the Maritime Alliance was frustrated because of its failure to respond to Iran's threat.

The US newspapers quoted US and Gulf officials as saying that the UAE was disappointed and asked the United States to take stronger actions after these incidents to deter Iran.

However, in the statement, the report of the report was accurate, saying that it was a "wrong description" of the dialogue between the two countries.

However, the Central East China Institute of Public Policy, the University of Lake, Cristian Ulrickson told the Peninsula Television that the Arab Emirates' move showed that Abuzabi was disappointed in Washington.

"UAE's withdrawal seems to be consistent with the frustration expressed by Abu Dhabi," said Ulricson, because people think that the United States is unwilling to actively protect its partners and rebuild the trustworthy power of the Bay area. How unfair. "

Andreas Crigg, deputy professor of the Department of National Defense Research of the King of London, said that the relationship between the UAE and the United States is undergoing a "difficult period". Abu Dhabi believes that the United States has "always" failed to fulfill its as a security guarantee in the region. Role.

Crig told Peninsula TV that this view promptly diversified regional participants to diversify their security partnership and fill in gaps by themselves if possible.

Crigg said, "The UAE uses the oil tanker event symbolically for the failure of the US security partnership," he also added that the UAE's actions stated to the United States. "They are a self -confident sovereign country. And exit. "

He also added, "The UAE is also fighting against the United States to cut off the relationship between Russia and China ... (because) they need to diversify partnership with the United States, including partnerships with Russia and China to serve their security Benefit."

Creig explained: "In the context of the partnership of the maritime partnership, the UAE sends a signal to Washington, that is, the United States also needs the support of the UAE, and the UAE has influence in this bilateral relationship."

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Wednesday (May 31) that as a retaliation measure for Moscow, Berlin will revoke four of the five Russian consulates' licenses. This move is made after the Russian government allows the German government officials (including personnel who work in cultural institutions and schools) to stay in Russia, and set the limit of 350 people.

A spokesman for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters that the measure aims to establish "personnel and structure -to -peer" between the two countries.

The spokesman said Russia has "upgraded measures" in restricting Germany's existence in the country. He said, "This unreasonable decision forces the German government to cut its existence in all areas of Russia on a large scale."

After the end of this year, Russia has only the Embassy in Berlin and another consulate to be opened.

"This decision has been conveyed to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today." The spokesman said that although the move is regrettable, the Ukrainian war means that many bilateral activities between the two countries have no foundation at all.

Last Saturday (May 27), the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that hundreds of civil servants and local employees in Germany in Russia will need to return to China or resign.

The number of people affected by this limit is hundreds of people. Although the order is aimed at consulates and embassies, most of the affected are the Goettic Institute of Culture, as well as employees of German schools and nursery.

Moscow's restrictions means that the German consulates in Calline, Yekaterinburg and New Siberia will be closed to retain the German Embassy in Moscow and the consulate in St. Petersburg.

The incident reflected that the relationship between Moscow and Berlin had further deteriorated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The Ministry of Agriculture of Ukraine said: "Continue to implement restrictions means that adding additional weapons to the hand of Vladimir Putin to fight against European unity. The current restrictions must be canceled."

The European Union is responsible for the Agricultural Affairs Executive Committee, Januszwojciechowski, yesterday called on some EU countries to extend the restrictions on grain imports implemented in Ukraine to at least at the end of October. This grain restriction is expected to be implemented until June 5. Russia's full invasion of Ukrainian grains last year was exported through the traditional pipelines of the Black Sea, and Ukraine was exported by land pipelines from neighboring countries.

EU member states agreed to allow the import of specific grains in Ukraine without the number of restrictions, and there is no need to undergo customs and official inspections.

However, this has caused the price of grains in some EU countries to fall, triggers farmers' protests, and prompting a series of restrictions and ban on Ukrainian grain exports.

The EU finally reached an agreement with the five Eastern European countries that allowed them to restrict the import of Ukraine. The five countries include Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.

In this way, Beijing also has one less excuse to not participate in substantial dialogue. Even during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union have always maintained a channel for military dialogue, because it is important to know how important the two sides know how to reduce the risk of "wiping guns and getting fire." For the same reason, China and the United States should immediately end the incurable situation.

The business of the chip manufacturer Nvidia (Nvidia) is getting more and more linked to artificial intelligence, which has attracted a large number of market investors to push into pursuit, and let Nvidi achieve one of the biggest winners in the artificial intelligence boom. The company's market value is on Tuesday (May 30) It once exceeded $ 1 trillion and briefly became members of elite clubs with a market value of over trillion dollars.

The value of Nvidia stocks twice twice in less than eight months, reflecting the wave caused by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Since October last year, Nvidia's stock price has risen by about 200 %, far exceeding the performance of all ingredients stocks of the standard and the Pur 500 Index, and also directly pushed its market value and throw the market value of other peers far behind.

Regarding whether the market value of Nvidia is reasonable, some analysts of market participants believe that the prosperity of artificial intelligence means that the value of the stock should be higher. For example, in Tipranks, analysts believe that Nvidia's stock price can reach up to $ 600 in 12 months.

However, Cathie Wood, the US "Valkyrie", publicly stated that [Nvidia's current stock price is too expensive](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/finance/singapore/story20230530-1399678)Essence After all, if calculated by the analyst's highest target price, Nvidia's market value will be about $ 1.6 trillion, then it will be equivalent to Google's parent company Alphabet.

Nvidia's stock price rose 3 % again at the end of overnight, at $ 401.11. The stock climbed to $ 419.38 in the market, driving a short market value of a short time exceeding $ 1 trillion. Although Nvidia lost part of the increase, the current price is only one step away from the valuation mark of $ 1 trillion.

So far, only four US companies have a valuation of more than $ 1 trillion in the United States stock market. Amazon.com Inc, a retail and technology giant.

This rise is mainly driven by Nvidia's strong first quarter performance. Nvidia also linked this strong performance to artificial intelligence business. After the market last Wednesday (May 24), the chip manufacturer also predicted that because the market's interest in artificial intelligence development is becoming increasingly stronger, the group's product demand will be strong, and the turnover will also perform well.

According to the data of the analysis company Refinitiv, Nvidia's long -term price -earnings ratio is 47.23 times, which is far higher than Qualcomm and Intel, which is also much higher than the median value of this industry, that is, 18.09 times.

Many large technology companies today have shifted their business focus to artificial intelligence. What is motivated to provide artificial intelligence is the powerful chip of the so -called graphical processing unit (GPU). According to the Nvidia analysis report released by many analysts, about 80 % of the graphic processing unit on the market is produced by Nvidia.

The market share of this "hegemony" made Nvidia's stock price soared by 25.96 % last week, becoming the world's most valuable chip manufacturer. Coupled with the previous increase, Nvidia's stock price has soared by more than 180.20 % so far.

Although the technology traders and artificial intelligence fans of the market crazyly want to promote Nvidia to a trillion -dollar elite club, this is a "not cheap" area after all. Nvidia must take out better turnover, cash flow, and assets in the shortest time to support this price.

Comparing the company's actual cash capacity, Nvidia is also the most expensive company in peers. Its cash flow has more than 140 times, which is more than twice as: Advanced Microdevices and Monolithic Power Systems. Compared with the company's asset value, Nvidia's stock price is nearly 40 times, while peers such as ASMLHOLDING and KLA Corp are less than 30 times.

Huang Renxun, CEO of Nvidia, has clearly showed his decision. He has bet on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the main growth driving force for the foreseeable future of Nvidia.

As the stock price soared so strong, Nvidia's BBOFA Securities Conference (BOFA Securities 2023 GlobalTechNology Conference on June 6, and June 7th RosenBlatt 3rd Annual Technical Summit: Artificial Intelligence Age (Artificial Intelligence Age (Age of Artificial Intelligence RosenBlatt's 3rd AnnualTech Nummit: The Age OFAI, and any message released at the 2023 shareholders meeting held on June 22, believes that many investors will pay close attention.

The Korean government's Fukushima First Nuclear Power Plant Sewage Extraction was announced on Wednesday (May 31st) announced the results of the inspection to Japan.

Yonhap News Agency reported that the South Korean inspection team went to Japan to inspect the scene from May 21st to 26th. Liu Guoxi, head of the delegation and chairman of the Atomic Safety Committee, said at a press conference that the trip focused on the polynuclein removal equipment (ALPS) (ALPS). In addition to nuclear performance and long -term stable operating performance, it also obtained the unprocessed data of the ALPS entrance and exit nuclear pollution water concentration provided by Tokyo Electric Power Corporation.

The Japanese side conducts a concentration analysis of 64 nucleo each year. The delegation can obtain the measured equipment operation data accumulated in the four years from 2019 to 2022. The Japanese side also provides more than a dozen nuclein that detects more than the entrance and exit data of the entrance and exit of more than a week.

The delegation inquire about the adsorption material replacement cycle of the ALPS device. Tokyo Electric said that every 8,000 tons of polluting water, if the purification capacity decreases once a week's concentration analysis, it will be replaced.

Liu Guoxi stated that the design capacity of its seawater conveying pump was enough to meet the dilution target. He also said that it has been confirmed that the Japanese side conducts a trial collection and analysis in the upstream sink in front of the sea in order to detect the concentration of the 氚, and will be in the tube between the tube head and the upstream water tank during the towning process. Perform a trial collection and analysis.

Liu Guoxi said that through the inspection, the main equipment was confirmed in the installation of the design drawings, and also confirmed that measures that could be cut off discharge in abnormal conditions and obtained specific information, and made meaningful progress in the scientific research process.

But he also said that in order to make more accurate judgments, further analysis and confirmation must be further analyzed. To this end, the South Korean inspection delegation will analyze the relevant fault cases that have been ensured so far to study and judge whether it can operate stable for a long time. It will also strive to obtain regular inspection projects and maintenance management programs from the Japanese side.

The author said in the foreword that to talk about the history of German Jews, the story must start from Sartre definition of Jews. Sartre believes: "Jews are those who are regarded as Jewish by others, no matter what their beliefs are religious, or which nation (country) is loyal to." This conclusion of Sat should be based on his long -term anti -Semitic anti -Semitic in Europe. Research and analysis of doctrine history.

European Jews, especially Jews in Germany, are hoping to gain an equal status under the enlightenment of religious reforms and enlightenment, especially the "freedom, equality, blog love" slogan brought by the French Revolution.

However, no matter how many richer rich people from the Jews, how many literati bachelor who is famous for their efforts, in Europe, especially in Germany, the Jews have always been difficult to escape the fate of discrimination and rejection; Social acceptance and recognition, and the confidence of Christian Jews is still discriminated and rejected.

For example, the famous German poet Heine, after graduating from the law school, he quietly converted to Christianity in order to obtain a position that can be eaten. And some people were criticized; shortly after the poet changed, he regretted it. He mocked himself in a letter to a friend: "If you are allowed to steal the silver spoon, I will never change the letter."

Uighurs, like Jews, in the eyes of the Chinese government, in the eyes of the Chinese people, no matter what their faith, or which country is loyal to the Uighurs- Others"!

Since the East Turkic Stan (known as Xinjiang) has been occupied by Chinese colonial, whether it is during the period of Yang Zengxin, Jin Shuren, Sheng Shicai's dictatorship period, or the Kuomintang occupation period, or the Communist Party ruled today; The rich man also had many scholars who introduced modern education. Among them, most of them chose to dedicate their lives to their national independence, but there are also so -called time -conscious people who choose to be loyal to the Kuomintang China or choose to be loyal to the Communist Party China.

Among these diligent and wealthy, diligent learning, and become literati and bachelor, some have adhered to the Islamic beliefs, traditions and Uygur culture from beginning to end, but there are also atheism that confidence in communism; but no matter what they believe in religion or religion, they are loyal to that. From the perspective of the Chinese colonial government, from the perspective of the Chinese colonial government, they have never been a member of the "China", but the Uyghur who must be "different". Reconstruction alien!

When a nation is driven away from the home garden and is marginalized and discriminated against, such as Jews in history; or the homeland is colonized and is marginalized and discriminated against. After the right to equal equality, it will also lose its right to speak and economic autonomy; as a result, not only will its national beliefs, culture, traditions, and history be distorted, the conquerors will be arbitrarily trampled, and their national identity will be hollowed out, distorted Face for all!

No matter what kind of beliefs, culture choose to be marginalized, discriminated and excluded, what kind of language and text to learn from, and what kind of national regime to choose to use, he cannot define his own national identity with his own choice. , Faith, culture and tradition, let alone tolerance and acceptance.

It can be said that the nation under the barbaric colonial rule, while being marginalized, has been deprived of the right to speak, not only loses the right to express its own national identity, shapes its own cultural image, reforms and revives its beliefs and revival Traditional power; it has also been deprived of the power to review history and look forward to the future.

Among the elites that were marginalized, discriminated against and crowded out, there were some so -called current people who needed to express themselves, express loyalty, and express fictional cultural identities in order to survive, but it was difficult to gain trust; of course, of course, of course, of course, of course It is because the colonists have already solidified their views on their national identity.

Of course, there are also warriors who adhere to their own national cultural identity, adhere to their faith and tradition, and be loyal to their nation; they will not be chanted to the colonists, nor are they willing to express themselves to the power; Pride to express his national identity and culture, and express his beliefs with a firm belief; but they are often submerged in the like -seeking historical statements, distorted and deforming by rumors and rumors.

Of course, Uighurs, which are severely marginalized, discriminated against, and excluded, are no exception. In the eyes of Chinese colonists, no matter what the Uyghur chooses, it is the enemy of Chinese colonists. Whether it is the independent East Turkistan (known as Xinjiang) as a sacrifice to Mao Zedong's Saifu Ding • Aizi, or the betrayal of the soul and the comrades of the stones in the well, the Abu Dura Zak Ruofef (Xuek Laiti Zakl's father), although they all gone for Chinese colonial occupation East Turkistan, they did not gain any trust from the colonists. They were abandoned and died lonely after use.

I remember that at the end of the 1990s, a friend of mine was transferred to the Urumqi City Government. At that time, the mayor of Urumqi was the young and promising Nurblite, and my friend and Nurbar seem to be a trusted good friend. In a dinner with a friend, he told me that Nurbail's goal was to become the first non -Han ethnic official who entered the highest power center of the Communist Party of China, the Politburo; 'Ambitions'.

At that time, Nur Baili could be said to be a rising sun among national cadres; he was tall, handsome and handsome, both capable and knowledgeable, and a fluent Chinese. The pyramid top. In order to show the unlimited loyalty to the Communist Party, he strongly promoted the so -called "bilingual education" of exclusion of the educational education education. He dedicated Uyghur education as his promotion sacrifice to the colonists, and even shouted that "Uighurs do not speak Uyghur, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality, such as the Hui nationality. , It can also be a faint "Uighurs", scolded by the Uighurs.I have heard a crying Uyghur black humor. It is about a Uyghur professor at Xinjiang University. Doubt out. One day, at the routine study meeting, when he was drowsy, he was awakened by the colleagues next to him; he opened his eyes and looked at the secretary of the school party committee on the stands, saying " How can I wake up or Uighurs? "

Those Uyghur names granted by their parents into Han names, those who sworn no longer believe in Islam, and the Uyghur who no longer read and write Uyghur, whether he is in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, whether he is in Shanghai, whether Communists, or atheist, or other religions, whether they are loyal to the Communist Party China or the future democratic China; in the eyes of the Chinese government, in the eyes of the Chinese people, he is still Uighurs. Cultural identity!This is a real version of the tragic world for these famous Uymenteders!

Living, as a Uyghur, difficult and difficult; life is full of unknown and difficult obstacles in life. For example, a Uyghur poet wrote in his poem: "I am Uyghur, born as Uyghur, and died as Uyghur." Yes, we must live up to the intention of the creature, live, no matter how others define it, to ourselves with ourselves with ourselves. The existence proves the existence of Uighurs.

How is this memorial and its preparation process? The following is the follow -up report of the reporter Wang Yun.

[** Column: What does the June 4th Memorial Museum show the June 4th 34th Anniversary? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/teahouse/tea-05262023155444.html)*** ["June 4th" 34th Anniversary Memorial Hall condenses the spirit of the two generations of people's owners](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html)**

Yu Dahai said that I like to do small things. "I have done many things in the memorial hall, including pulling wires, installation of projectors, etc., including many exhibition boards in Washington last year. I did it myself". He traced this habit to the habit of being a child during the Cultural Revolution, during the Cultural Revolution, during the Cultural Revolution.

** The curator with a low visibility **

Yu Dahai was the curator of the June 4th Memorial Hall in preparation at the end of last year. In the core preparatory group of the Memorial Hall, Wang Dan and Zhou Fengsuo, the leaders of the June 4th Academic Games in 1989, and Lu Jinghua, the leader of the worker movement of the year.

Different from these people, Yu Hai did not experience the movement in 1989. As early as the early 1980s, after graduating from the Department of Physics of Peking University, Yu Hai studied in the United States through the Li Zhengdao Scholarship. When the June 4th incident occurred, Yu Hai had taught at DartmouthCollege at the famous private university on the east coast of the United States.

But Yu Hai did not have a democratic movement from the outside world. After the CCP's army spread throughout the world in the early morning of June 4, 1989, it spread throughout the world, and in the sea, it was almost full -time in the sea to support Chinese democracy for a while to support Chinese democracy. In the 1990s, Yu Hai had engaged in research at the "Contemporary China Research Center" at Princeton University, and hosted overseas politics magazines such as "Voice of China" and "Beijing Spring".

Yu Hai's main business is financial investment, and he is not very often in the media's aforementioned and his own civil movement experience. But even if the overseas democratic movement experienced a low tide, Yu Hai never left the camp of democratic movements. In his own words, "the activities of the civil movement have never stopped for more than 30 years."

The preparation of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" this time, Yu Dahai's responsibility as the curator was responsible for administrative work, and he had to control exhibitions, finance and legal affairs. He and Lu Jinghua ran up and down in Manhattan, and finally selected the site near the traffic near the traffic.

Wang Dan announced in January last year to the public to build the "June 4th Memorial" in New York.(June 4th Massacre Memorial Museum)For this reason, the "June Fourth Massacre Memorial Museum Committee" was also registered for the establishment of the NGO.

11 years ago, Hong Kong citizens supported the Patriotic Democratic Movement Federation (branch association) to open a memorial hall with the theme of June 4 in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, but was repeatedly suppressed by the Hong Kong government. closure.

Wang Dan said that the closure of the Hong Kong June 4th Memorial Hall is the origin of the June 4th Memorial Hall of New York. "Then I think, such a big historical event should not have a memorial, and then start discussing with some friends. Just do it slowly. Everyone's ideas are consistent, and the preparatory committee is established. "

The preparatory committee has a five -year plan that originally planned to use the first phase of the first phase of crowdfunding of 500,000 US dollars in the first phase of crowdfunding, and first opened the memorial hall. But beyond everyone's imagination, the committee raised $ 500,000 in less than eight months. "At the beginning, it was more than 50 people of the preparatory committee. On this basis, the public appeals to the public, and then the donations in all directions come in, "Wang Dan said.

The deepest donation that impressed Wang Dan was a donation of 100 yuan for a single mother in China. "In my opinion, its weight is similar to 10,000 US dollars. In China, I heard that she wanted to build a memorial hall. She had to do her best, so she asked her friends to donate 100 yuan from China to China. "

According to Yu Dahai, of all donations, the largest one is also a $ 100,000 from a domestic friend. "In fact, it is also a student who has participated in the 89th Student Games. Later, he developed an industry in China. , But his 89 complex is obviously very strong. When he heard that this (preparation of a memorial hall) news, he took the initiative to contact Wang Dan and us. "

The first funds of $ 500,000 were in place for seventeen months, which greatly promoted the speed of the commemorative hall. However, this has also greatly reduced the time of several members of the core preparatory team. Wang Dan said that starting from the beginning of last year, the core preparatory team has a preparatory meeting every two weeks, and there are regular meetings of the work team every two weeks. Wang Dan's personal time for public affairs is two -thirds of the preparations for the memorial. As the curator, Yu Dahai has almost half of the time for preparation.

Zhou Feng Suo is mainly responsible for the collection and finishing of exhibits in the preparatory group. His current residence is located in New Jersey and the border of New York City. After settlement here a few years ago, he began to display June 4th cultural relics in his basement, and often introduced the background of these cultural relics to friends from all walks of life.

Participating in the "June 4th Memorial" preparations, Zhou Fenguo said that he was both his personal behavior and the non -governmental organization "China Human Rights" representing his executive director.

At 5 am on June 4, 1989, Zhou Fengsuo was the last Tsinghua student who withdrew from the Monument of the People's Heroes of Tiananmen Square. There is also a high -speed oil printer used for sports promotion at the same time with him. "I just saw Tsinghua's classmates raising this thing, and I was very worried. I said, at this time, why should I raise such a heavy one? Things? Classmates said, we have to lift it back and continue fighting. "

After Zhou Feng locked in June 4th, he did "continue fighting" and never left the front line of the Chinese democratic movement. What he did not expect was that after 34 years, he actually saw this oil printed machine again. "Just like an old friend reunion, for me, it was an era of smoke and fire. At that moment, we lost. Then it suddenly returned. "

There are many people's efforts and relays behind the reappearance of the oil printer. Zhou Fenguo said, "This is why this memorial is so precious, and each piece of cultural relics are the representatives of many people who have not changed for many years."

Zhou Fengsuo said that there were more than 100 exhibits exhibited at the June 4th Memorial Museum of New York this time, of which more than 30 of them were real objects from June 4th in 1989. Wang Dan emphasized that the current exhibited time span for more than 30 years, from the first half of 1989 to the 2019 Hong Kong counter -delivery of the Central Movement, because the Preparatory Committee believes that the Hong Kong Victoria Garden Party is actually a continuation of the 89 Democratic Games.

The former general secretary of the Communist Party of China Zhao Ziyang, who died at the end of last year and was forced to step down during the 1989 school movement, was also one of the exhibits inscribed by the museum "June 4th Memorial Hall" inscribed by the Memorial Hall.

This inscription was actually the last calligraphy work before Bao Tong's death. Yu Dahai introduced, "Mr. Bao Tong's words are well written, but you know if you see his inscription, you can almost see that his hands have a little tremor, that is, his body has been worse. Sex. "

On the eve of June 4th last year, Bao Tong published an article on Radio Liberty Asia for the last time, reviewing the details of June 4th. At the end of the article, he concluded that "'June Fourth" Tucheng is indeed an unprecedented revolution. A new era that is absolutely not restricted and completely loses the protection of civil rights. "

Today, this "new era" seems to be continuing. Wang Dan explained to reporters that the establishment of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" is of great significance to the world at the moment, because China is considered to form a challenge to the West and even human civilization under the rule of Xi Jinping. It should also be recognized the nature of the Communist Party of China. If you want to recognize the nature of the Communist Party of China, nothing can highlight the nature of the Communist Party than June 4th. He is essentially suppressing democracy and even suppressing democracy with violence. A regime. "

** For the younger generation **

Not only are the elderly people such as Bao Tong, and Wang Dan and other young people in the process of building the June 4th Memorial Hall, but also many young people. In the process of exhibition, collecting and organizing cultural relics, and organizing activities, more than ten young people participated. There are Chinese students studying in New York, as well as young people who work locally.

The museum grows in the sea. The memorial is also largely designed for young people. "Our Memorial Hall has held several democratic salon activities in New York several times. There are dozens of people come each time, and most of them are young people. "

Mr. Dong, 32, only arrived in New York from China last October last year. For security reasons, he was unwilling to disclose his full name. On the 30th anniversary of the "June 4th" in 2019, he went to Tiananmen Square alone, showed a commemorative tone shirt under the city of Tiananmen, and interviewed foreigners present. "Sin was sentenced to seven months in prison.

After arriving in New York, the preparation of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" was initial. Mr. Dong joined the volunteer team. "It is mainly helping Teacher Zhou (Zhou Fenguo) and they set up the venue, register for guests, maintain order, etc., all of them are very small jobs. But I think it is very meaningful. There was no such opportunity in China. "

Participating in the preparation activities, Mr. Dong finally stopped feeling lonely. "The mainstream environment in China is a small pink that we can see every day, but after coming to New York, I met such a group of friends who can like me. It is found that you are not alone, what you do is not a stupid thing most people seem to see it. "

At the end of last year, the white paper movement of resistance and unreasonable epidemic control in China at the end of last year, Mr. Dong also participated in the demonstration of the white paper campaign in New York. , Including young people overseas, did not lose the spirit of June 4th. In fact, the spirit of the June 4th is still in the hearts of each of us. "

He emphasized that this spirit only needs a fire to ignite it, or let more like -minded people stick to it, and let more people discover their expectations and desire for democracy.

It is hoped that the alliance sources revealed that the vice chairman of the Justice Party, Nuruita, was expected to run in Penang during the six states.

According to the online media "Free Malaysia Today", sources close to the Pakatan Harapan leader revealed that in addition to helping to raise the fair party in Penang, Nuruysa can continue to defend the existing seats in Penang. At the same time, it will help help. Strive for female voters support. "She will participate in Penang elections. If she wins, the vice chairman is expected to be committed to important state government positions."

Nuruya is the eldest daughter of Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar. She is currently the joint chairman of the Secretariat of the five -person consultant group. A total of 15 Malay voters in Penang account for the majority of the majority. It is unclear which constituencies will Naruysa run in.

Nurlisha said in a statement on Wednesday (May 31) and said that she will currently focus on the position of the Secretariat of the Special Advisory Group of Finance. But she said that as a member of the fair party, she still had to obey the decision of the Justice Party's leadership. In other words, Nurusha did not fully rule out the possibility of participating in Penang elections.

Nurusha pointed out that the Pakatan Harapan must be alert to the upcoming state elections, and is committed to consolidating the status of the Pakatan Harapan and the united government, ensuring political stability, and promoting economic growth.

Nuruita's 15th election in November last year failed to keep the East Po Parliament constituency. The Iraqi party candidate Mohada Favaz won with 5,272 votes in the four corners. Nuruya's defeat was unexpectedly the fair party, because Batong Dongpu has been the fortress area of the Anwar family since 1982. After Anhua was imprisoned in 1998, his wife Wang Azsha and Nuru Izha held Batong Dongpu.

Anwar, on January 3 this year, appointed Nuruita as a senior economic and financial adviser to be the Prime Minister and Finance Minister. Nurlisa announced his resignation of these consultants on February 12.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir prosecuted the current Prime Minister Anhua's "theory of gathering money" and [claim for RM50 million](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230505-1390985)(About 44 million yuan), Selangor's Shayan South High Court on Wednesday (May 31) approved Anhua for two weeks to submit a defense. Anwar should have been argued on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Anwar's representative lawyer, Alof, told the media on Wednesday that when the main book of the Samanan High Court conducted a case management on Wednesday morning, he approved Anhua for two weeks to submit a defense. "We have two weeks (for defense). The Gao Court will be managed again on July 7th."

According to "Malaysia Today", Mahathir's representative lawyer Mohamed Lafite also confirmed that Anwar's defense will be delayed for two weeks.

Rafik said that Anwar's application for postponing was extended for a month, but Mahathir did not agree because Mahathir believed that the case was related to the issue of public interest, so it should be resolved as soon as possible without delay. However, the court eventually allowed Anhua to postpone the defense two weeks.

Anwar on March 18 this year at the National Congress of the Justice Party, in the way of not named "a prime minister who has been held in 22 years and 22 months" [During his tenure, his family gets rich](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230318-1373780)Essence In early May, Anhua once again did not name challenge Mahathir selling all the domestic and foreign assets of his and his family, and shared the property with all the Malay people to be a "real Malay fighter." These remarks aroused Mahathir dissatisfaction.

Mahathir believes that Anwar's expressing such remarks as the Prime Minister is more harmful than the average person's expressions, and to a great extent to combat Mahathir's position as a former Prime Minister and politician.

Mahathir sent a lawyer letter to Anwar on March 28 and asked Anwar to apologize before April 17. Anwar's representative lawyer Arff said on the evening of April 17 that Anwar would not apologize and prepared to respond to Mahathir in the court.

Veedhovsky said that the European Commission has not yet taken positions, but he wants to persuade the rest of the members of the rest of the Ukrainian grain imports.

Ukraine has repeatedly expressed regret and opposition to the relevant ban. Ukraine responded on Wednesday (31st) to Veedhovsky's remarks that these food import restrictions were to help Russian President Putin split Europe and must cancel restrictions.

The Korean National Intelligence Institute (National Institute of Love) analyzed that the reason for the failure of the North Korean military reconnaissance satellite launch may be that the path of excessive changes may cause technical problems.

The Yonhap News Agency reported that the National Intelligence Institute's report on Wednesday (May 31) stated that the first and secondary pusher of the previous North Korean launch body was flying in a straight line. This time it was set to fly westward and forcibly changed the flight path to the east. There may be technical problems in this process.

Small near -orbital satellites for preliminary investigation tasks.

North Korea failed to shoot stars on the same day and disclosed specific reasons. The National Institute said that this may be that North Korea attempts to emphasize the legitimacy of launch activities through the launch process of public satellites.

The National Institute of Love pointed out that the engine abnormal maintenance usually takes more than a few weeks. However, if it is only a slight failure, it will not rule out that North Korea will arrange a second launch in advance, and may choose the existing launch ground for the second launch.

# Filipinos demand divorce legalization

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Manila, 31st) Stella Sibonga, the mother of 3 children in the Philippines, urgently hopes to end a marriage she never wants. But in this Catholic country, divorce is illegal, and the court will take a few years to abolish the marriage contract.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-31T5-02-07-00-00/000000.png)The Philippines is the only place outside the Vatican to prohibit divorce.

Those who support divorce believe that it is difficult for divorce to be more difficult for couples to cut off their relationships and remarry, and more difficult to escape violent spouses.

Those who want to end their marriage can ask the court to abolish the marriage contract or announce that the marriage is invalid from the beginning, but the government can appeal to these decisions.

The legal procedures for divorce are slow and expensive. In the Philippines, a country suffering from poverty, the cost of the case may be as high as 10,000 US dollars or more, and it cannot guarantee success. Some people seeking fast divorce fall into online fraud.

"I don't understand why divorce would be so difficult." She had spent 11 years trying to get rid of the marriage that her parents forced her to enter after her pregnancy.

Sibanga's law struggle began in 2012. At that time, she applied to the court to cancel her marriage because her husband was believed to have "psychological disorders", which was one of the reasons to terminate marriage.

After 5 years and spending $ 3,500 litigation costs, the judge finally agreed. However, Sibanga was just a brief liberation.

As the government's legal representative, the Office of the SolicitorGeneral is responsible for protecting the marriage system. The General Prosecutor's Office successfully overturned the decision in 2019.

Sibangjia said that she asked the Court of Appeals to recover her life, but she was still waiting for the reply.

"Why do we have experienced torture, abandonment, and abuse by Living near Manila and 45 -year -old Sibuka, but those who have experienced torture, abandonment and abuse are punished by law? What we want is just freedom."

The Philippines opposed the most powerful divorce is the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church also opposed abortion and contraceptives.

But Congress has achieved significant victory in recent years.

Despite the strong opposition of the church, a controversial breeding law was passed in 2012.

Most parties and opposition parties in the House of Representatives joined forces to pass a divorce bill in 2018, which later fell into a deadlock in the Senate. This is the first time the divorce bill has made such a progress.

A group of parliamentarians are now promoting the new divorce legalization movement and submitted several bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the drafts of the bill, Edcel Lagman, said, "We will not destroy any marriage."

Ragman said divorce is aimed at "unfortunate marriage that cannot be repaired." The legalization of divorce will enable women and their children to get rid of "husband who is not tolerant and abuse."
