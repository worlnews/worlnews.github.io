<p>The archeological team of the National University of Malaysia (UKM) found a complete human bone and funeral utensils about 14,000 years ago at Gelle Tongshidong, Wangsheng County. This is the discovery of the second old -fashioned human archeological discovery of Malaysia.</p>

The picture shows the information of the information of his information in Hong Kong in September 2018</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Chinese media reported that the authorities were accused of suspected bribery and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/華興資本證實失聯董事長包凡正配合中國官方調查/a-64828236">lost contact in February this year</a>Bao Fan, the founder, chairman and chief executive of China Financial Group "Huaxing Capital", has been extended for three months. In addition, the jungle, chairman of the Huaxing Capital Hong Kong Securities subsidiary related to Bao Fan's case, was also informed to continue to be extended after 6 months of the reserve period.</p>
<p>The China Financial Media "Economic Observer" reported on Wednesday (May 31) that those familiar with the matter said that the restrictions of Chinese supervision institutions for well -known investors Bao Fan will be extended for three months from May 7, 2023.</p>
<p>On February 7 this year, Bao Fan was taken away by the official disciplinary commission of the Chinese Commission for Discipline Inspection and was left for investigations and was left to the unit. The specific case handling institutions include the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Commission and the Beijing Discipline Inspection Commission and other departments.</p>
<p>In response to Bao Fan's extension of detention, Huaxing Capital did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the group has stated that after the Chinese government will take Bao Fan away to cooperate with the investigation, it will postpone the annual audit report from April 3 and suspend stock transactions.</p>
<p>After Bao Fan lost contact in February this year, Huaxing Capital's stock price plummeted by 50%. Its stock price has fallen by about 10%this year.</p>
<p>Bao Fan is widely known in the Chinese corporate community and participated in a series of high -profile scientific and technological mergers and acquisitions in China, including the merger of "Didi" and "fast" of the taxi company, and the mergers and acquisitions of takeaway giants Meituan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T01-44-00Z/64828048_401.jpg" />Huaxing Capital is a well -known local financial institution in China.</p>
<h3>Why is the goal?</h3>
<p>Bao Fan was not the first Chinese billionaire who was forced to miss or was arrested. In the past few years, there are nearly many billionaires in China, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國為何打擊知名企業家/a-64860293">similar situations have encountered similar situations</a>Essence</p>
<p>Nicknamed Buffett, China <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中媒中国巴菲特郭广昌失联/a-18909735">Guo Guangchang</a>He is the founder of Fosun Group. He disappeared for several days in 2015. In addition, Chinese Canadian businessman <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/保密式审理后宣判肖建华获刑13年/a-62866004">Xiao Jianhua</a>He disappeared in Hong Kong in 2017. It is reported that his trial had begun in July last year and he was sentenced to 13 years. In 2020, the founder of Alibaba <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察马云被回国中国经济会好起来吗/a-65165744">Ma Yun</a>It also disappeared from the public vision for several months. At that time, the digital payment company Ant Financial was preparing to go public.</p>
<p>Wang Yaqiu, a senior Chinese researcher at Human Rights Observation (HRW), told DW in February this year that "the Chinese government has used the same approach to many people. We know the only reason for the disappearance of well -known entrepreneurs is because they are big people."</p>
<p>Other experts believe that the reason why Beijing cracks down on these entrepreneurs is that they need to ensure that their companies or business behaviors are in line with the CCP's priority.</p>
<p>Ni Weiping, the research and propaganda coordinator of the Chinese Human Rights Defender (CHRD), told DW in February this year that in Bao Fan's case, the reason why he became the goal of suppressing Monopoly of power, or excessive control over the Chinese technology industry in financing.</p>
<p>He said: "(China) the government is trying to curb the ambitions of the technology industry, hoping that these companies will succeed, and they also hope to ensure that these companies can develop under the party's firm guidance."</p>
<p>The outside world is worried that with the continuous development of the Chinese government's suppression of entrepreneurs, this trend will cause investors to lose confidence in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Chinese legal scholar Teng Biao said: "The Communist Party of China has been suppressing private enterprises for many years, and sometimes their policies will cause the entire industry to be suddenly hit."</p>

<h3>UFO Public Hearing: NASA's Five Discovery of the Unknown Flight Group of NASA</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mike Wendling * BBC reporter</li>
</ul>
<p>June 1, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_129872124_gettyimages-72276225.jpg"></a>Image source, getty images</p>
<p><strong> The US authorities investigated about 800 unknown flight objects in decades. A researcher group stated that the phenomenon that was really unpredictable was a small part. </strong></p>
<p>The United States Space Agency (NASA) set up a group last year to explain the research on the institution's research on the so -called unknown abnormal phenomenon (UAP).</p>
<p>The definition of "Uap" is a witness that "cannot be determined as a aircraft or a scientific natural phenomenon".</p>
<p>The research team held the first public hearing on Wednesday (May 31).</p>
<p>This is a few of them that revealed.</p>
<h3>Many phenomena can be explained, and some are still a mystery</h3>
<p>"We have 50 to 100 new reports every month," said Sean Kirkpatrick, head of the ALL-DOMain Anomaly ResolutionOFFICE (AARO) under the AARO.</p>
<p>However, he said that only 2%to 5%of the entire database of these witnesses that "really may belong to abnormalities."</p>
<p>At this hearing, a video shot by the US Navy aircraft over the west of the United States showed that a series of light spots flew over the night sky. Military aircraft failed to intercept these objects at the time, and later found that it was a civil aircraft flying to a major airport.</p>
<p>Other witnesses are more mysterious.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png" /></p>
<h3>Background: What is the UFO public hearing?</h3>

<p>The U.S. General Administration of Space held a UFO public hearing.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the U.S. Space Administration has conducted research on unknown flying objects for decades.</p>
<p>Richardgray, editor of the BBC Future column, reported that the phenomenon of unknown flying objects (UFO) has been stigmatized for a long time -many people do not think it should belong to the category of rational scientific research, but held This meeting clearly shows that the US Space Administration now wants to take this topic seriously, and also shows that the scientific community is becoming more and more willing to discuss the possibility of alien life.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the first public meeting of NASA on UFO research. The detailed reports will also be announced in July* The special group research UAP data established last year -UAP is defined as "the observed in the sky cannot be determined as a aircraft. Or scientifically known natural phenomena " * NASA research is different from the US Department of Defense's investigation of unknown air phenomena, the latter is a research action led by American intelligence personnel</li>
</ul>

Officials do not want to rule out the possibility of objects from alien creatures.</p>
<h3>Privacy Rights into an obstacle to NASA Survey</h3>
<p>Kirka Patric also mentioned that the issue of privacy limits the investigation of the General Administration of Space.</p>
<p>"As long as we are willing, we can align the largest collection instrument at any time," he said.</p>
<p>"Many of our existing things are around the United States," he said. "Most people ... don't like we will collect instruments at your backyard."</p>

<p>Scott Kelly is a former astronaut and pilot with decades of experience. He told a story about visual myth.</p>
<h3>microwave oven and cartoon balloon</h3>
<p>The relevant data of UAP is often difficult to decipher, and it is easy to be interpreted.</p>
<p>David Spergel, chairman of the UAP team of the US Space Agency, mentioned that Australian researchers have intercepted a radio wave.</p>
<p>"Its structure is very strange, and people can't understand what's going on. Then they began to notice that many of them appeared concentrated at lunch time," he said.</p>
<p>It turned out that the high -sensitivity equipment used by the researchers received the microwaves they emitted when they were heated for lunch with a microwave oven.</p>
<p>Scott Kelly is a former astronaut and pilot with decades of experience. He told a story about visual myth.</p>
<p>He and deputy pilot were flying near the Virginia Beach, and his deputy pilot "was convinced that we had just passed an unknown flying object."</p>
<p>"I didn't see it. We turned back to find and found that it was a Simpson cartoon -a balloon."</p>
<h3>Study on the Influence of Starbing and Habits</h3>
<p>Spegel also said that civil aviation pilots are very reluctant to report to the incident because people are prejudice about flying saucer.</p>
<p>"One of our goals is to resolve these prejudices," he said. "Because for UAP, high -quality data is required to answer major questions."</p>
<p>Some scientists also face harassment on the Internet because of their work in this field.</p>
<p>"Harassing can only lead to more stigma in the UAP field, seriously hindering the scientific process, and damping the confidence of other people to study this important issue," said Nicola Fox, the scientific director of the General Administration of Space.</p>
<h3>NASA's practice has changed?</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_129951335_p09ml2kz.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Do Americans believe that there are foreign customers? (The picture shows tourists from the Space Museum).</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the hearing on Wednesday is worthy of attention is that the practice of the General Administration of Space in the United States has changed. It took decades to reveal the truth about UFO for decades.</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing, the research team answered public questions. One question is "What are NASA covering up?"</p>

<p>NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg visited Japan in early 2023. The title of the speech was "NATO and Japan: Face the new reality of security with strong partnerships".</p>
<p><strong> As the world's largest multinational military alliance, NATO (NATO) has become more high -profile in Asia since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year, causing the attention of the Indo -Pacific regional state. In May of this year, Japan officially confirmed that NATO will set up a liaison office in Tokyo in July, but at the same time clarify that Japan has no intention of applying to join NATO. </strong></p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately criticized NATO's move to destroy the stability of the area. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning responded to the news at the news meeting, "Asia -Pacific does not welcome camps to confront and does not welcome military groups." She emphasized that since NATO claims to be a regional alliance, it should not seek geographical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>However, NATO set the first formal contact place in India, only symbolic significance or had substantial strategic functions?</p>
<p>Stephennagy, a senior associate professor of Tokyo International Christian University (ICU), told BBC Chinese that provided more opportunities for Japanese and NATO member states to share information sharing, including emergency response on security challenges across the Atlantic and Indo -Pacific regions Plan: "This has a potential Taiwan Strait crisis, the Sino -Indian border friction on the Himalayan plateau, the problem of communication routes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and the spread of the large -scale killing nuclear weapons of Pyongyang."</p>
<p>Chen Yaohua, an assistant professor of Chinese research, told the BBC that Japan ’s assistant professor of research was in Asia that the possibility of“ Little NATO ”in Asia is low. The interaction between Japan and NATO is at least in the short term that symbolizes significance than substantial significance. "After all, NATO is far away from Asia, and it is unlikely to see the NATO army appearing in Asia, and the leader of NATO is the United States.</p>

<p>NATO has covered 6 countries except Japan in G7.</p>
<p>However, relevant persons commented that no matter how deep the tentacles of NATO in Indo -Pacific, China has caused China to be vigilant. The latter and Moscow will counter NATO, which will directly affect the direction of Sino -Japanese relations.</p>
<p>There are currently 31 member states in NATO, including 6 countries in the G7, including the United States and Britain. Japan, South Korea, and Australia are NATO's partner countries in India.</p>

<p>Kishida Wenxiong has been considered as a firm gentle school within the Liberal Democratic Party, but this year, three documents have been introduced to show that Japan will break through many post -war taboos, including further expanding weapons exports.</p>
<h3>How to generate NATO Tokyo</h3>
<p>The interaction between NATO and Japan became more and more frequent after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. In June last year, the Japanese Prime Minister Kishita Kishita attended the NATO Summit in Spain. In November, Japan officially joined the NATO Network Defense Center. At the end of January this year, Jensstoltenberg, the secretary -general of NATO, arrived in Tokyo and met Kishita Wenxiong. Last week, the Kyodo News Agency disclosed that Kishida was going to participate in the NATO summit held in Lithuania in July.</p>
<p>In fact, when Stoltenberg visited Japan at the beginning of the year, he discussed the idea of setting up a NATO -liaison office in Tokyo. He also issued a joint statement with Kishida Wenxiong after the meeting. In addition to criticizing Russia, the statement emphasized that he faced Beijing in the face of Beijing The rapid strengthening of military forces and expanding military activities have strongly urged Tokyo and NATO to cooperate in improving transparency and military control, disarmament, and anti -diffusion.</p>

<p>Japan is expected to increase defense expenses in the next five years. By 2027, national defense funds will reach 2%of the GDP in Japan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of May this year, after the plan to disclose the liaison office of the Japanese media was determined, the Japanese Foreign Minister Lin Fangzheng confirmed the news that the Prime Minister Kishita Tianshi immediately stated that Japan did not join NATO's plan. At the end of May, the Chinese website "The China Project" said last week that at the end of March this year, Olivier Rittiman, the president of NATO National Defense School, visited Taiwan and met with the president of the National Defense University of Taiwan. After the news was exposed, the latter confirmed a low -key confirmation that the Taiwan government did not respond.</p>
<p>NATO's activity in Indo -Pacific began to radiate to the Indo -Pacific region with Japan as the main axis. Professor Chen Yanhua believes that NATO and Japan's recent close interaction should be driven by the Ukraine War. For a long time studying Sino -Japanese relations, he told BBC that Tokyo judged that Beijing would learn the possible way of attacking Taiwan from the Ukraine War, while NATO judged that there may be Beijing support behind Russia. Therefore, Tokyo may think that "if Beijing can suppress Beijing, it can suppress Moscow, so starting from one year ago, Japan and NATO have begun to strengthen contact."</p>
<p>Su Ziyun, director of the Institute of Defense Strategy and Resources, located in the "Institute of Defense Security" in Taipei, analyzed the two levels of political and strategic cooperation between NATO and Japan.The focus of multiple yuan strategy is to expand the in -depth cooperation between the two parties in space, network and other spaces, and share information to improve early warning results. At the same time, you can also share the cooperation of advanced technology at the technical level to prevent various emerging online attacks. Su Ziyun said that this is a preparation made by the "Zero-Day Attack" to the purpose of improving the benefits of Deterrain Warfare.</p>
<p>Chen Yanhua also agreed that NATO cooperation with Japan should have long -term highlights in how the two sides deepen cooperation in the fields of "responding to network threats, destructive technology, and cracking down on false information." He emphasized that online defense is one of Japan's current economic security projects. At the G7 meeting earlier, Tokyo also specifically proposed that "Japan will definitely refer to the experience of Ukraine in the Ukraine in the Ukraine War in the Ukraine War."</p>

<p>NATO did not exist in Asia Pacific. The United States carried out military deployment through the so -called Pacific "island chain", which was a strategic pattern that continued to this day after World War II.</p>
<h3>Beijing's response</h3>
<p>Most comments believe that a major spindle between NATO and Japan is to open a military contest with China.</p>
<p>After NATO's confirmation of the contact office in Tokyo, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately slammed publicly on that day, and the wording was tough. Speaker Mao Ning said at a press conference that NATO continued to enter the Asia -Pacific and intervene in regional affairs in the east, which will inevitably undermine regional peace and stability and promote camp confrontation. Last week, Mao Ning again criticized Kishida Wenxiong's plan to attend the NATO summit this summer that the Asia -Pacific region was not the geographical category of North Atlantic.</p>
<p>In addition, the WeChat public account of the Chinese official media Beijing Daily, "Chang'an Street Knowledge", also issued a document in May to criticize that Japan is leading "NATO to the gate of China." In the article, the so -called "Chinese challenge" criticized NATO hype, which is called the initiator of the Russian and Ukraine conflict. "" ".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T07-59-39.000Z/_116746325_1ee99a67-a338-4c32-9fd4-520a7a3b3b72.jpg" />Image source, EPA</p>

<p>Dongfeng-21D ballistic missile deployed in China. The Pentagon believes that China has strengthened the anti -intervention ability in the first island chain through the deployment of missiles and space detection systems.</p>
<p>Sun Xingjie, a professor at Zhongshan University of China, said that the Hong Kong media "Ming Pao" said that the cooperation between Japan and NATO can be reminiscent of the British -Japan Alliance in the early 20th century, that is, Japan hopes to cooperate with the world's most powerful military group, and then I want to establish Japan's dominant position in East Asia during the changing period of Europe.</p>
<p>He believes that the actions that Kishida Wento wants to make the Japanese country normally obvious. The introduction of NATO into the Asia -Pacific "Cold War camp also brought the Cold War camp into the Asia -Pacific".</p>
<p>However, Sun Xingjie analyzed that Kishida's goal may not be achieved, because Japan's "normally nationally", which contained in military defense, actually involves the core of Japan and the United States. Seeing that Japan can be completely military autonomy and no longer be subject to the White House. In addition, with China's existing strong national strength, it will continue to prevent the ambition of Japanese military expansion.</p>

<p>不过，也有评论认为，战后数十年的日本内阁，曾经亲美或疑美路线更迭，同时影响到了日美中三角关系，但这种浮动关系，到了前首相安倍晋三后，日本“抗中亲美”的印太战略后已经底定，短期内没有变动的迹象。而安倍生前一手拔擢的岸田文雄，走的也是安倍的外交政策。</p>
<p>据此观察未来的中日关系，陈宥桦教授告诉BBC，未来日本可能会“逐渐摆脱二战发起国的内疚阴影，将破坏当下国际秩序与和平的责任导向北京”。他解释，安倍以前的日本内阁因为二战内疚之缘故，对国际事务倾向不闻不问，但习近平上台后，中国与美国或国际社会的外交对抗，让日本找到理由对国际事务变得积极，特别是在布置包围中国的网络，“日本与中国的历史角色在二战80年后渐渐开始互换。但这包围网的目的并非要与中国求战，而是要吓阻中国。”</p>
<p>孙兴杰则批评日本有意利用俄乌冲突的危机，在亚太地区推展安全化动员，最初是制造“今日乌克兰，明日东亚”炒作台湾问题，再炒作日本与俄罗斯的领土纠纷，未来日俄关系如何变化，也是一大问题。</p>
<p>不过，东京基督教国际大学奈吉教授则告诉BBC，即便北京会加强日本与北约的合作，但中日两国的经济连接仍然很深，所以预计不太可能看到两国关系会单单因为北约设立东京联络处，就将紧张情势升高。但他认为，北京可能会通过加强与俄罗斯在日本领土周边地区的军事合作回应日本：“这也是向东京发出强烈的信息——在日本自认较脆弱的的议题上，北京与莫斯科会共事合作，并对其施压。”</p>

<h3>Rare genetic mutation, making her a woman who can not feel pain</h3>
<p>June 1, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T08-45-55.000Z/_129854076_headshot.jpg"></a>Image source, PA Media</p>

<p>Joe Cameron's condition may lead to the development of new therapy.</p>
<p><strong> Jo Cameron is the only person in the world who has two genetic mutations in the world, which means that she can hardly feel pain and has a strong ability to heal. </strong></p>
<p>The researchers spent 10 years before discovering the role of these mutations. In 2013, the 65 -year -old man at the time had a regular hand surgery, which discovered a genetic mutation, which explained the reason why she was not sensitive to pain.</p>
<p>She told the BBC: "I had a handwritten arthritis surgery. I chatted with the anesthesiologist at the time. He said that it would be a very, very painful operation, and you will experience great pain afterwards."</p>
<p>I said, "I can't feel the pain." He came to me after the operation. He said, "You don't take medicine to relieve pain. This is very unusual."</p>
<p>When her anesthesiologist Devjitsrivastava, her anesthesiologist Devjitsrivastava referred her to the University of London (UCL) and Oxford University painter. The team of genetic experts collected tissue and blood -like to observe her DNA.</p>
<p>After six years of research, they discovered that the unknown FAAH-OUT gene mutations made Ms. Cameron, who lived in the Scottish highlands, had no pain, pressure or fear.</p>
<h3>What is the FAAH-OUT gene mutation?</h3>
<p>The FAAH-OUT gene is a member of a group of genes and has always been considered "junk DNA". But scientists are now understanding the importance of these genes in the process of reproductive ability, aging and disease.</p>
<p>In this case, researchers can determine which genes are related to lack of pain, which genes to eliminate anxiety and depression, and which genes help Ms. Qiao heal rapidly.</p>
<p>They found that the FaAH-OUT mutation "closed" the expression of the FaAH gene, which is related to pain, emotion and memory. The mutation also reduces the FAAH Enzyme.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiao's FAAH gene also has a mutation, which reduces the activity of the enzyme. This enzyme is a biocuk that makes a protein. It usually decomposes the "happiness" molecule called an Anandamide, but it cannot operate normally for Ms. Qiao.</p>
<p>Scientists also found that the two mutations owned by Ms. Qiao not only made her feel pain, but also related to healing.</p>
<p>"They are connected to some extent. Her cells can heal at a speed of 20%to 30%faster than ordinary people, which is amazing, so you can imagine the health potential of wound healing," Ande, deputy professor of the University of London, Andreiokorokov said. He is a senior co -author published in the research on the brain published in the neuroshi.</p>
<p>"This mutation deletes a part of the FAAH-OUT gene and close it. Ms. Qiao has another mutation in the FAAH gene. So far, we don't know who has these two mutations in the world."</p>
<h3>Why do we need to feel the pain?</h3>
<p>Pain is essential for protecting us from destructive and threatening life. The consequences of pain can not feel very serious.</p>
<p>For Ms. Qiao, who often burns her arms on the oven, she has to rely on the burnt smell of the flesh to know that her skin has been injured.</p>
<p>"We have worked with other patients, and they can't feel pain because of mutation of other genes, and sometimes they are seriously injured. Therefore, it is a good thing to feel pain, but sometimes pain will become chronic without any more. Useful, "Professor James Cox, an expert in human pain in the University of London and the author of the study, said.</p>
<p>During the growth process, Ms. Qiao didn't know she was different. She has never taken any painkillers.</p>
<p>She said: "I don't think this is unusual, because this is me. I have children. I have a husband who has been married for many years. They just think I have a huge painful ability."</p>
<p>Gene mutations also mean that she feels much faster.</p>
<p>She said, "When something hates happens, my emotions will respond immediately like others. But then, I think I can do something, and I start thinking about the strategy of getting rid of the predicament."</p>
<p>Professor Kokis hopes that these discoveries can promote new drug research to help pain management, wound healing and mental health.</p>
<p>He said: "Chronic pain is the most common health situation in our time. We urgently need new painkillers. By understanding how FaAH-OUT operates at the molecular level, we hope to develop new and better painkillers. "</p>

<p><strong>2024年共和党总统候选人提名的竞争正在升温，两名长期被看好的竞争者加入了候选行列。</strong></p>
<p>美国前副总统迈克·彭斯(Mike Pence)和前新泽西州州长克里斯·克里斯蒂(Chris Christie)将于下周宣布参选，让总统竞选场变得愈加拥挤。</p>
<p>这会让目前的领跑者、前总统唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)大为不爽，势必让竞选充满火药味。</p>
<p>最终的获胜者可能在明年11月的选举中挑战民主党总统拜登。</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65135322"> 特朗普因“封口费”事件遭刑事起诉成美国政坛首例，这将如何影响2024总统大选？ </a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-63649542">Trump "Rebumbing the Rivers and Lakes" in 2024 to run for the six uncomfortable factors of the President of the United States in 2024</a></p>
<h3>Mike Pence</h3>

<p>According to sources close to Pence's campaign team, Pence will launch a campaign in Iowa on June 7, which will cause him to make fire between him and his former boss.</p>
<p>For four years, he has been Trump's loyal deputy and served as the position of vice president. Until the riots of Congress in 2021, their relationship broke down.</p>
<p>Pence is the son of the Korean War veteran, and his conservative political career began at the host of the talk show.</p>
<p>He was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in 2000 and in his term until 2013. He claimed that he was a "conservative with principles" and was consistent with the Tea Party Movement.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2017, he served as Governor of Indiana. During his tenure, he passed the largest tax reduction bill in the state and signed a bill restricting abortion and protecting religious freedom.</p>
<p>63 -year -old Pence is a gospel Christian. In 2016, as Trump's campaign partner, he was considered to make effort to mobilize key voters.</p>
<p>He was calm and gentle, and was regarded as the spokesperson who exaggerated his president. But after he refused to help overthrow the results of the 2020 election, Trump accused him of lack of "courage".</p>
<p>The thugs who supported Trump attacked the US Congress Building in January 2021 and heard them shouting, "Turning Mike Pence!" It was reported that they were less than 40 feet (12 meters) less than the vice president.</p>
<p>Since then, the two have been keeping a distance, but Pence has been carefully avoiding the friendly voters of Trump.</p>
<h3>Christie</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129949572_christie.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>According to many sources, the former New Jersey Governor plans to announce the election at a city hall event held on June 6 in New Hampshire, where the first Republican primaries will be held.</p>
<p>After the failure of the president in 2016, Christie fidered with Trump, leading the transition team of the upcoming president at the time, and prepared for his debate with Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>But since the U.S. Congress riots, he has strongly criticized Trump.</p>
<p>In April of this year, the sharp words of Christie previewed the attack on Trump in the Trump in the city of New Hampshire. He said: "Donald Trump is a TV star, that's it. If he returns to the White House, things will change. It's bad. "</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2018, Christie served as governor of New Jersey. He was shadowed due to a political scandal involving a political scandal involving a bridge lane. This incident was alive to partly aimed at the political hatred of a Democratic mayor.</p>
<p>Before elected governor, Christie served as chief prosecutor of New Jersey in President George W Bush from 2002 to 2008.</p>
<h3>Ron Desantis</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_128629359_desantis.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Ron Desantis, Governor of Florida, has been working hard to follow Trump. He is regarded as the most capable of defeating Trump's candidates in frontal competition.</p>
<p>With the support of Trump, he won the governor's position and easily re -elected in more than 1.5 million more votes in the mid -term elections. This is the largest difference in the state in the state election for more than 40 years. During his term, the number of Republican voters in the state for the first time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65774908">2024 U.S. presidential election: the number of Republican candidates rose, the election situation became hot and heated</a>More than the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The 44 -year -old De Santis served as a lawyer after graduating from Harvard and Yale University, but he is still a newcomer in American politics.</p>
<p>He served in the U.S. Navy and went to Iraq. From 2013 to 2018, he was also a little -known House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But since he served as the governor in 2019, De Santis has increased sharply, and he has positioned himself as a enthusiastic cultural warrior.</p>
<p>He supports legislation to cancel the funding of diversified and inclusive projects, prohibit gender identification at public schools, prohibit transformation performances and gender care for minors, and restrict abortion and relaxation of gun laws. He was also trapped in legal disputes with Disneyland World Park.</p>
<p>The governor touted his political achievements as the "blueprint" of conservative leaders, and supporters said that he did not have so many drama effects to replace the former president who seemed to be nominated again.</p>
<p>Trump seems to be very concerned about this and attacks him almost every day on social media.</p>
<h3>Tim Scott</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129784138_gettyimages-1442811990.jpg" />Image source, getty imagesAt the age of 57, he was the only black man who worked in the two houses of Congress. He has been working on the Senate on behalf of South Carolina since 2013.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott is the grandson of cotton field workers and the son of a single mother. He often talked about how his family "walk from cotton to Congress."</p>
<p>When he was running for 2024, he vowed to reverse this "retreat country" and revive the "great culture" in the United States.</p>
<p>He was very popular among colleagues, and soon received support from two senators, including John Thune, a Republican Republican person in the Senate.</p>
<p>But he was not the only high -level South Carolina Republican Republican Party who participated in the campaign.</p>
<h3>Nikki Haley</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129845153_d4aa9f12932e582bf465c01caf31dc4810db17ea0_0_6000_33751000x563.jpg" />Image source, EPA-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock</p>
<p>Nikki Haley announced in mid -February that the president was the first major Republican candidate to compete with Trump.</p>
<p>The 51 -year -old Heili was considered one of the most promising young candidates for the Republican Party, but has maintained a low -key in recent years.</p>
<p>Heili was born in the Punjaik immigrant family next to South Carolina, and became the youngest governor of the United States in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2015, she called for the withdrawal of the federal flag from the State Congress of South Carolina, causing national attention.</p>
<p>Although she said in 2016 that she was "not a fan of Trump", she later accepted Trump's nomination and became the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. During the term of office, at a meeting of the Palestinian Special Envoy at the UN Security Council, she suddenly left the controversy.</p>
<p>Her campaign includes a compulsory psychological test of politicians over the age of 75, and emphasizes that the "new generation" US leaders need to be needed.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) According to the official website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the director of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with JenSplötner, German Prime Minister Foreign Affairs Consultant in Beijing. The press release quoted Wang Yi as a comprehensive strategic partner, China and Germany must not only stabilize the development of bilateral relations, but also contribute to jointly responding to global challenges.</p>
<p>Wang Yi emphasized that China will comprehensively promote Chinese -style modernization, adhere to high -quality development, open to the outside world, and share opportunities and win -win cooperation with countries. He said that in the face of the current instability of the international situation and increasing uncertain factors, China and Germany must work together to organize the seventh round of consultation between the Sino -German government and send positive signals to Europe and the world.</p>
<p>The press release stated that Pulutner said that he was full of expectations for the new round of Germany and Chinese government consultations, and will jointly step up various preparations. He also said that the foundation of Germany and China is stable, and the German side will continue to adhere to a Chinese policy and point out that the world's polarization is an inevitable trend.

<p>普吕特纳(左)经常出现在肖尔茨左右，但一般在“后排”</p>
<h3>不是新闻？</h3>
<p>德国总理外交顾问访华的消息，在中国是一条不大不小的外事新闻。新华社、《人民日报》等重要的中国官方媒体均以转发外交部通稿的形式，对此作了报道。</p>
<p>与此相对，普吕特纳的中国之行完全没有得到德国媒体的关注。至截稿时，有关信息没有出现在媒体的新闻报道中，德国政府及外交部的官方发布中也没有提到这次出访。针对德国之声的问询，德国总理府回复称“原则上不对工作层面的会谈进行表态”。</p>
<p>普吕特纳此行的主要任务是为预计本月在柏林举行的德中政府磋商作筹备。在德中关系趋于冷却的背景下，德国政府对这一2011年启动的磋商机制的期待评估相对低调。去年6月，普吕特纳同王毅的前任杨洁篪举行视频通话，德国官方亦未发布任何信息。</p>
<p>作为德国总理肖尔茨的外交和安全政策顾问，普吕特那尽管被德国媒体成为"肖尔茨最重要的顾问之一"，但这一职务在德国政坛是一个"幕后"角色，很少公开发表意见。普吕特纳经常随肖尔茨出访，包括去年11月闪电访问中国，但在新闻照片上，他一般只出现在肖尔茨的后排。</p>
<h3>德国总理肖尔茨任内首度访华</h3>
<p>上一次普吕特纳成为德国媒体的报道对象，还是去年6月。在德国外交政策协会(DGAP)举办的一次研讨会上，他的发言被一些批评者认为对俄罗斯过于友好，因而引发了一些争议。在同一场活动上，普吕特纳也提到了中国，认为不应将中国和俄罗斯划为同类，但同时指出，应警惕中俄积极扮演全球南方代言人的角色，"他们并不是这样的代言人"。</p>

<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said on Thursday (June 1) that Moscow could not stop Ukraine from joining NATO. At the same time, before the Wilsus decisive summit that was about to be held in mid -July, there was differences between NATO member states about Ukraine joining.</p>
<p>"All NATO member states agree that Moscow does not oppose NATO's rejection." Stoltenberg told reporters. At this time, the foreign ministers of NATO member states gathered in Oslo, trying to eliminate any signs of discomfort before the summit. Stoltenberg said: "We are advancing forward, and NATO member states agree to Ukraine to join."</p>
<p>NATO agreed in Ukraine to eventually join the alliance in 2008, but leaders of various countries have not yet taken advancement measures, such as providing Kiev's Action Plan for Member State, which will formulate Ukraine's official joining the timetable for NATO.</p>
<p>NATO leaders intend to send strong support information to Kiev at the Vilnis Summit. However, only six weeks left from the summit. In order to reach a consensus on the specific plan provided by Ukraine, the pressure of NATO member states was increasing.</p>
<p>Although Kiev and its closest NATO member states in Eastern Europe called for specific measures to promote the franchise process of Ukraine, the United States and Germany and other Western countries have closer to the alliance that may be closer to the war with Russia <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約秘書長挺烏入會-德國防長還不是時候/a-65393175">are cautious</a>Essence</p>
<h3>Zelei: Ukraine is ready to join NATO</h3>
<h3><strong> Accept Ukraine as a member of the war, NATO will start war with Russia </strong></h3>
<p>Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrieliuslandsbergis said Kiev suffered twice in 14 years waiting for NATO to answer. He said: "Now that we really sit down, how will Ukraine be close to NATO and when they become a member of NATO to find a very specific answer."</p>
<p>His appeal was responded to Estonian Foreign Minister Margustsahkna. Chachnes urged NATO member states to provide a clear way to enter NATO for Kiev, and provide a strong security guarantee for it after the war, so as not to leave any "gray zone" to make Russia organic. Chakner said: "Ukraine needs to join NATO to find a clear road and next action plan."</p>
<p>Stoltenberg also called for a security -guaranteed framework for Kiev to prevent Russia from taking military operations against the country again.</p>
<p>Other NATO member states such as Germany and Luxembourg emphasized the risk of NATO's urgency to make Kiev join.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Berbak said: "The open policy of the NATO's portal is the same as before, but at the same time, the war is still in progress, and we obviously cannot discuss and accept new members."</p>
<p>Luxembourg Foreign Minister Aseerbin warned that NATO's military mutual assistance clause means that if Ukraine is accepted as a member country during the war, NATO will start war with Russia.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Zeleki spoke at a meeting of more than 40 European leaders held by Moldova at Moldova, reiterating <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/泽连斯基乌克兰正走在通往北约的道路上/a-65266031">Kiev is ready to join NATO</a>Essence He said, "I think our future in the European Union is very important. Ukraine is ready to join NATO. We are waiting to see when NATO is willing to accept us as one of them."</p>

China's non -governmental organization "New Citizen Plan" recently released the "2023 Chinese Migrant Popular Children's Status", revealing the living conditions of the current children of the migrant population in China. What kind of challenges are this huge minor group in different cities in China?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/tebiejiemu/mingongchao40/mg-10192021101804.html"><strong> post -wave: Children lost on the starting line </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/nu-10172018105147.html">"Left -behind Children" Family Status: There are less reunion problems</a></strong></p>
<p>According to the definition of the Convention on Children's Rights, children refer to the population under 18. If you don't look at the numbers, it seems difficult to imagine that the number of children of the migrant population in China has reached 138 million, accounting for nearly half of the total number of Chinese children (46%). In other words, one of the two Chinese children is a child of the flowing population.</p>
<p>The latest report of the "New Citizen Plan" "2023 The Status of Children of China Popular Population: Facts and Data" conducted a detailed study of this. The source of the data includes the 7th National Census of the National Bureau of Statistics, the "Chinese Population Census of 2020" and The description and analysis of the Chinese children's population in the past population surveys and survey data, as well as the "2020 Chinese Children's Popularity: Facts and Data" jointly released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the United Nations Children's Fund, and the United Nations Population Fund.</p>
<p><strong> Together!Together? </strong></p>
<p>As a child, living with parents seems to be righteous. But for the children of China, it is often difficult to be with parents.</p>
<p>According to the report of the "New Citizen Plan", in 2020, 108 million children cannot live with both parents, of which 89.22 million are children affected by population flow. Many of them have become left -behind children, and they are far away from parents working outside. There are more than 6 million left -behind children in Henan Province alone.</p>
<p>At the same time, children who can migrate with their parents only account for half of the total number of children in the flow population (51.5%). In those cities with more restrictions on the residence of foreign populations, this relocation rate is even lower. In 2020, the migration rate of children in Beijing was only 22.5%, Shanghai was only 25%, and Guangzhou was 27.6%.</p>
<p>There are also children of some flowing population who return to the city after their parents enter the city. In 2021, 920,000 in China returned to their hometowns alone, most of them became left -behind children.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000002.png" />Children (Associated Press Information Map) in the school of a school of migrant workers (information map) [![] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/wy-06012023141816.html/ap091112073357.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Different challenges </strong></p>
<p>For left -behind children, their challenge is that they cannot be with their parents and lack their parents' affection, guidance and help in the growth period. Children who moved in different places with their parents still face many challenges.</p>
<p>The "New Citizen Plan" in 2022 The "2022 Chinese Popular Population Children's Status" has focused on analyzing the situation of relocated children to study, showing that 80%of them can admit to public schools and 20%of private schools.</p>
<p>However, when these relocation children enter public schools in different places, they often encounter unfair treatment. Li Qiang, the founder of the non -profit organization "Labor Observation" in New York, said that if Chinese relocated children are entering local public schools, they generally pay a sponsorship fee that local residents do not have to bear. The husband and wife earn less than 100,000 yuan a year, and you need to work overtime, and then a child will sponsor one or 20,000. "</p>
<p>Li Qiang pointed out that China ’s discriminatory regulations on migrant children’ s discrimination are also reflected in the financial subsidies that only local residents can enjoy. Pay by fiscal, but not allowed foreign workers to enjoy. "</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang, currently in the Netherlands, is from Shenzhen. In this city where foreign migrant workers gather a lot, Lin Shengliang, who has a wide range of connections, is often begged to help the enrollment qualifications of foreign workers' children. "Many people around me are the case and they are painful. , I think they seem to be abducted, very painful. "</p>
<p>In Lin Shengliang's opinion, the conditions for their children to enter public schools for ordinary foreign workers are relatively harsh. "You have to pay social security, and there must be a lease (rental) contract to study in public schools. In schools, if you want to go to a private school, you have to charge it. The teachers of private schools are not good enough. "</p>
<p>Shenzhen has been implemented at least ten years ago to implement the "points enrollment" approach, and unified points for Shenzhen household registration and non -Shenzhen household registration children who meet the conditions of Shenzhen City. , Getting scoring rankings, high ranking priority enrollment. This approach seems to break through the barrier between the household registration and the non -household registration, but whether this approach is scientific and fair, there are still many questions from the outside world.</p>
<p>According to the 2013 report of the Chinese Official Media People's Daily, Chu Zhaohui, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Education and Science, believes that this integral system is a negative policy. Division of other categories of education targets during the compulsory education stage is the infringement of the right to educators' rights. In essence, it is also illegal.</p>
<p>但这里的公平似乎并没有取得普遍的认可，人们仍然可以经常在社媒上看到对于流动人口子女无法得到公平教育权利的抱怨。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chinese non -governmental organization "New Citizen Program" recently released the Chinese migrant population scale diagram in the "2023 Chinese Migrant Population Children's Status" (screenshot of the new citizen plan) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/wy-06012023141816.html/capture.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> Work is also discriminated against </strong></p>
<p>Not only do you not get fair, but the minor children of these migrant workers will also be discriminated against.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang said that in Shenzhen, half of the work does not have discrimination, but enterprises and institutions related to the government will have regional regulations, such as grid staff, school administrative logistics personnel, hydropower gas companies and other units. Children who will recruit Shenzhen local hukou.</p>
<p>Li Qiang observed that this phenomenon is nationwide, but the degree of locality is different. "For example, the security guards assist the preparation of civil servants' work. This kind of work generally recruit children of the population of local villages and towns. It is difficult to find this kind of job. "</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang said that no matter whether to go to school or employment, these practices for migrant workers have been failed to be fair. "Taxpayers are equal. They have made so many contributions as foreign migrant workers. Tax."</p>

<p>On Thursday, a number of leaders of the Democratic Movement of Tiananmen in 1989 held a press conference of the June 4th Memorial Hall in Manhattan, New York. Wang Dan, Zhou Fengsuo, and Lu Jinghua, the worker movement of the year, attended the meeting. Wang Dan said at the meeting that the June 4th Memorial Hall will be established in New York because the Hong Kong authorities closed the June 4th Memorial Hall in Hong Kong in 2021: "The intention of the Chinese authorities is obvious. They want to cover up history and let the world forget the Chinese authorities. Sin, they want everyone to forget the Communist Party that is based on violence and lies. "</p>
<p>Wang Dan pointed out that through the June 4th Memorial Hall, let the world remember the Tiananmen Democratic Movement of 1989 is a very important thing: "1989 is the most important turning point in modern Chinese history. Compared Two completely different countries ... ... June 4th is still a very sensitive topic in China. It represents political reaction. We must maintain this opposition and reserve motivation for the future. For China; not only for the past, but also for the future. "</p>
<p><strong> Zhou Feng Suo: Many of the commemorative hall exhibits come from June 4th participants </strong></p>
<p>Zhou Fengsuo also talked that the memorial hall symbolized the 1989 democratic movement and the "white paper movement" young generation's desire for democratic China: "We have hope, no matter how we are defeated, no matter what kind of difficulties we have to go through, Democratic China has always existed. We will unite together, just like at Tiananmen Square 34 years ago, people all over the world see our dream of free China. "</p>
<p>Zhou Fenguo pointed out that many of the cultural relics in the memorial hall are donations from participants from the June 4th Movement: "For a long time, I have been assisting political prisoners detained because of June 4th. Formed an information contact network, this is why these exhibits will come to me. These participants hope that these exhibits can be displayed and preserved, and they also hope that their identities can be protected. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T18-50-00-04-00/000002.png" />The June 4th Memorial Hall is longer than the sea to introduce the cultural relics of the museum to this station (reported by the reporter Tang Yuanyuan) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/tj-06012023154632.html/571672474e8c.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T18-50-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Many young volunteers Wang Dan at the scene: Everyone has a free Chinese dream </strong></p>
<p>At the venue of the memorial hall, many young people participated in preparations, and there were many Chinese students who were still intending to return to China. In response to what kind of encouragement these young people are, they are willing to take the risk of being settled by the Chinese authorities to help the memorial hall for help. Wang Dan explained: "The two generations share the same values. China can become democratic. Many young volunteers come from the "White Paper Movement" generation, but we share the same dreams. This is why they participate in the activities of the memorial. "</p>
<p><strong> Twitter is full of the fake account of the June 4th Memorial Hall Wang Dan: Facing the online army is already ready </strong></p>
<p>On the eve of the June 4th Memorial Hall, a large number of false accounts of the June 4th Memorial Hall appeared on the community platform, and tried to deceive supporters to donate. Wang Dan was interviewed by this reporter. They said that they were prepared for the Chinese Internet forces' attacks and threats and were not particularly worried.</p>
<p>Wang Dan said: "It is harassed by the Internet forces and may encounter some trouble in the future. This is expected. Such a memorial hall will obviously be nails and meats in the eyes of the CCP and the CCP's embassies and consulates. This is completely possible. Understand, but we are also preparing for corresponding preparations. Frankly, if someone comes to make trouble, I dare to guarantee that he will be discovered by the FBI (US Federal Investigation Agency). We have some preparations with relevant units. I also understand. "</p>

<p>Today's Olaferson has grown into a hot performer on the international stage, and the performance schedule is dense. He mentioned that few people noticed that his first world tour started from China: "In October 2008, my father took me to tour together, and we arrived in Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei ... remember that the Iceland economy at that time was the economy of the Iceland economy at that time. Bankruptcy, I performed in China, I saw Chinese reporters on TV every day in Iceland, and reported my hometown of news with my expression seriously. "</p>

Archaeologists found duck bone fragments in jars in the ruins of the ancient city. They continued to analyze the things in the jar through modern technology. They found cooked pork, suspected sheep, fish and snails, and crushed broad beans. According to the explanation of the ancient Roman recipe book in the first century, crushed broad beans can be used to clarify the color and flavor of wine.</p>
<p>Later, the scholars discovered that this jar belonged to a bar, so they could learn more about the lifestyle of the people in the ancient city of Pompeii. Because ancient Roman law stipulates that these warm foods should not be provided, such as cooked pork. But this humble bar in the ancient city of Pompeii was definitely not the only bar secret to sell cooked food in the Roman Empire. Scholars speculated that this must be the cunning bar owner thinks that Pompeii is far away. The distant ancient Roman management authorities are unlikely to close his business because of this incident or give him a fine. Therefore, scholars believe that the unhappy citizens in the ancient city of Pompeii can eat cheap and delicious miscellaneous fish snail soup through illegal takeaway business.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-02T-8-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />The troublesome Boeing CST-100 Star Aircraft flight plans have been extended several times. In the end, it was originally scheduled to test flying on July 21 to the International Spacestation.</p>
<p>However, the Boeing engineers found some new problems during the test, including defects of the parachute system, and the wiring tape widely used in the spacecraft was flammable in some cases.</p>
<p>After the internal discussion, Boeing decided to abandon the test flight and notify the new issue to the National Airlines and Space Agency (NASA). Boeing is a contract NASA contract, providing international space stations transportation services.</p>
<p>Mark Nappi, vice president and plan manager of Boeing, said at a press conference: "We decided to suspend the preparation of manned flight mission to correct these issues." Boeing did not propose a new test flight date.</p>
<p>Boeing originally hoped that the CST-100 was for the first time last year to achieve manned flight mission, but in the end, it only made the spacecraft successfully arrived at the International Space Station for the first time in May last year.</p>
<p>Shortly after the end of its Space Shuttle project, NASA will create a contract to create a contract to the international space station transportation to Boeing and ElonMusk in 2014. The value is fixed, respectively, $ 4.2 billion (about NT $ 128.9 billion) and US $ 2.6 billion (about NT $ 79.8 billion).</p>
<p>During the empty window, the United States could only rely on Russia's SOYUZ Rockets to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>After the "Dragon" spacecraft created by SpaceX for this, SpaceX has begun to provide NASA's "taxi" service to NASA to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA now hopes that Boeing's interstellar aircraft is certified as the second service tool.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-02T02-46-10/image-13-1685672985.jpg" />Sudan explosion conflict(news agency)Analysts and experts who were interviewed by the Peninsula TV program believed that after the Sudan military announced the suspension of participating in the Gada negotiations, the United States imposed sanctions and restrictions on both sides of the Sudan conflict, which issued a warning, that is, it will not remain silent to the conflict. It will no longer tolerate the violations of any party.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they also agreed that these sanctions did not have a direct impact on the current conflict of Sudan, nor would it prompt the conflict to return to the negotiating table or comply with the ceasefire requirements. The expected results are worried.</p>
<p>After the Sudan military decided to suspend the participation in Gada negotiations, Sudan's ceasefire negotiations were facing the risk of rupture. Under such circumstances, the United States implemented visa restrictions on the country -including officials from the Sudan military and fast support forces. In addition, sanctions were imposed on companies related to these officials and accused them of promoting Sudan conflict.</p>
<p>The guest researcher of the Humanitarian Action and Conflict Research Center Abdul-Fatheh Mohammed said that these sanctions issued warning information to both parties in the conflict, that is, the United States will no longer remain silent on the conflict It will not force the two parties to return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>The researcher also said in an interview with a reporter from the Peninsula TV station that this warning measure is not enough. Only through sanctions can not force the conflict between the two parties to yield or listen to international demands. Go forward to improve the current situation.</p>
<h4>The consideration of the decisive victory</h4>
<p>According to the Abdul Fatak Mohammed, the Sudan military has suspended the participation of the Gada negotiations, maybe because it feels that the decisive battle is approaching. Therefore, on the one hand, it wants to continue confrontation, and on the other hand Unveil the opponent offending the crime of violations on the spot to unveil his moral guise.</p>
<p>He also believes that the Sudan military may have the ability to achieve military decisions, but it will pay a high price in terms of civilian casualties. He also believes that the worst situation is the public war in Sudan now -all efforts are all efforts. It has been suspended with the truce, and this consequences will be extremely miserable for the Sudan people.</p>
<p>Brook Hailu, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Asia Beta, also agreed with the point of view of Abdul Fatheh Mohammed, and believed that these sanctions were not only warning information issued by the United States to Sudan, and required them to ask for them. The two parties should not continue to violate the suspension agreement, and still emphasize to the two parties that if they do not return to the negotiating table, they will continue to implement these sanctions.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Peninsula TV program, Brook Hairo pointed out that the impact of these sanctions may not directly appear. In fact, both parties to the conflict have a lot of cash and gold, but these savings will be exhausted over time. The United States may continue to implement a series of economic sanctions and eventually weaken the power of the conflict.</p>
<h4>political warning</h4>
<p>This influence is not limited to the economic and military level. Hailu believes that this sanction also represents a political warning issued by those international forces that supports any conflict, and implies that these sanctions may be expanded to them later.</p>
<p>Hailu emphasized that it is necessary to double hard to put pressure on the Sudan conflicts to stop fighting, implement the ceasefire agreement, return to negotiate, reduce the upgrading of the situation, provide the way to protect civilians, and provide a smooth path for humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Sudan political and military affairs analysts Osama Edarus said that the decision on economic sanctions is very strange. Until now, there are only signboards.</p>
<p>He pointed out in the show on Peninsula TV that the US government hopes that these sanctions are not only a warning to the conflict, but it shows the image of hope to do practical things. In fact End the conflict and stop the suffering of the Sudan people.</p>
<p>He also believes that Sudan is developing towards one of the following two situations: the first is that the military will achieve military decisions in the next period of time, and the second is that all parties will conduct actions in the real ceasefire, including establishing a clear mechanism for the establishment of a clear mechanism. , So that the rapid support forces have abandoned important facilities controlled by it, and civilian houses that have become a safe barracks outside Khamoum.</p>

The weather warning issued earlier that day did not foresee the sudden storm on the lake. The violent wind caused a ship to sink, and four of the 23 passengers on the boat died.</p>
<p>Judging from news reports, the incident occurred on Maga Lei Lake on Sunday is an abnormal tragedy, which usually only attracts short -term attention.</p>
<p>However, in the following days, Italian media reported that 21 people on board were spies or pre -spy, of which 13 were from Israeli external intelligence agencies, Mosad, and eight from Italy. The official explanation said that they were celebrating their birthdays, but this did not calm down what these people were doing.</p>
<p>A explanation issued by the Italian intelligence department shows that two of the deceased belong to the Italian intelligence department. Israel said that there is another victim of the victims who have retired. The fourth place was a Russian woman, and her husband was the captain of the ship.</p>
<p>The Italians want to know that so many spies took a rental ship named "Good ... Uria" (the word "Happy" game game in Italian "on Sunday afternoon, what are you doing? This party was quickly called "spy party" by several media.</p>
<p>Some media speculate that the Alpine trip may be an opportunity to exchange information. Some people pointed out that the captain would speak fluent Bulgarian and marry Russians Anna Bogeov. Is this coincidental? Whether these spies are like the Milan Daily "Evening Post"(Corriere della Sera)What said on Thursday, was the wealthy Russian businessman who was investing in this area?</p>
<p>Prosecutor Maximo Defeli, who is responsible for investigating the incident, and Karlo Nobelino, his boss and chief prosecutor, said that these problems are not within their scope of investigation. Their investigation purpose is to determine the overthrow and The reason for sinking.</p>
<p>The 60 -year -old Captain Carlo Caminati was suspected of losing killing, causing a shipwreck accident and was responsible for the injury of surviving passengers and was under investigation. "We are not interested in what passengers are doing," Nortryo said in an interview in his office in his office in Bursto Asgio, Lunbaidi Province. Part of the lake in the ship is located in the area.</p>
<p>Nochearino said he had asked the captain of the salvage team to inform him immediately after returning to the water, so that he and Defelib could take the lead in boarding the ship.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, the ship had been dragged to the shore, but it was still underwater. The attempts that had been floating on the water with a balloon a few times before were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>"I don't want someone to suspect that we have not worked hard to investigate the greatest efforts." He said that the things on the ship and the boat will be confiscated and handed over to the judicial organs.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said he knew the media's guess, that is, if the document or a briefcase was found, the government might stop investigation. "If the briefcase is found, we will confiscate it," Nonchelin said calmly.</p>
<p>What is even more curious is that the surviving passengers seem to be quietly taken away from the lake within a few hours after the accident. According to two Israeli national defense officials, Mossad sent an aircraft to take the Israeli survivor back to China and tried to prevent the details of the incident from publish in Israel. (It was not until Wednesday that the Israeli media reported that the Israelites who were killed worked in Mosht.)</p>

<p>A statement issued by the Italian Intelligence Department stated that the 62 -year -old Claudio Alon and the 53 -year -old Tiziana Balnobii was an Italian intelligence staff. Essence A spokesman for the Italian agency said there was nothing to supplement.</p>
<p>The Israeli intelligence department has not officially announced the real name of the former Moshard agent. His funeral was held on Wednesday in Ashikarin, Israel.</p>
<p>Mosad issued a statement on Wednesday stating that "We can't introduce him in detail because of the institution of the organization. Mosad has lost a dear friend, a professional professionals. For decades, he has dedicated his life to his life for decades. The safety of the country of Israel, even after retirement. "</p>
<p>According to a former senior defense official, the killed former Mosad agent was affiliated to a department responsible for secretly liaison with foreign intelligence agencies. Due to the sensitive relationship between spy agencies, the official demanded no name.</p>
<p>The former official also said that although the agent had retired from Mosad, he continued to serve as a reserve personnel of the organization and as part of the cooperative relationship between Israel and the Italian spy organization, and arrived in Italy with colleagues.</p>
<p>He also said that Mossad and Italian intelligence agencies cooperated on issues that were caring together, such as the war on terrorism, or collecting information about the Iranian nuclear project.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, the survivor did not carry identity documents when the accident was stated to the Italian gendarmerie. Prosecutors said they said the documents were lost when they turned over.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also confirmed that the Italians told investigators that they were employees of the chairman of the Ministerial Meeting. This was a comprehensive government department, and the Israelites said they were members of a government delegation.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many doubts around the case, one thing is certain, that is, the violent outsiders of the storm of Mal Jiao Lei Lake on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The civil defense agency in Lunbaidi issued a yellow alarm, saying that there may be thunderstorms that night. A meteorologist Paul Valisa of a local meteorological institution said that although all the announcements warned that the situation in the region would deteriorate, "it is unlikely that the phenomenon of that night." "You can predict thunderstorms, but so far, we can't predict its strength, at least in such a local area."</p>
<p>He said that the wind speed indicator of the nearby lake surface shows that the gusts are between 42 and 60 kilometers per hour, but the wind speed may be higher in the place where the ship is sinking. The strong winds of cold air decrease and spread.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, Samuel Paneti and several friends also rowed on the lake. They were the first batch of survivors of the Survivor of "Good ... Uria".</p>
<p>"The weather is very good all day," he said, but when the storm strikes, the rain is heavy, just like sailing in the clouds, "he recalled." The rain is very large, there are hail The boat blows from left to right. "</p>
<p>At first he thought that there was a group of seagulls in the center of the lake. After approaching, he found that it was a person on the ship.</p>
<p>He and his friends helped some people board their boats, and threw the "anything that can float" on the boat into the water to catch others. Some survivors managed to swim on the shore.</p>
<p>The two women were found to be trapped in a ship sinking to about 15 meters deep. The third place was found at the bottom of the lake, and another victim was discovered on the water.</p>
<p>"It's terrible to see the people in the water, just like the scene in the movie. I still can't believe it is true," he said. "If we don't pass, I think they may die," he said."They found that they appeared at the wrong place at the wrong time," he said.</p>

Perhaps because of Keynes' life, it reveals how the economy affects politics, or how ideas affect reality. As one of his biographies said, "Thoughts will not float quickly with the wind soon. Keynes' thoughts will keep staying. "</p>
<p>Kanes was born in Cambridge, England in 1883. When he was a child, he was Eaton Middle School and grew up. It can be said that reading all the way is a noble fan. I was also sealed by the nobles, and the circle of friends was not simple. Including philosopher Russe Vittantein, novelist Woolf, poet Eliot and other elites.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65789014/65772428"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T03-09-00Z/65772428_303.jpg" /></a>American entrepreneur Musk's visit to China set off a dazzling wind. The picture shows the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met Musk in Beijing on May 30</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Reuters quoted people familiar with the matter and said that Elonmusk, the chief executive of Tesla, visited China a few days ago, met with Ding Xuexiang, executive deputy prime minister of the State Council on Wednesday (May 31) This may be the first time that the outside world is known to meet the person in charge of foreign businessmen since taking office, but the Chinese official has not yet confirmed the news.</p>
<p>Ding Xuexiang is the vice premier of the State Council of China and the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, ranking sixth in the committee.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that the Chinese government has always attached great importance to the relationship with Tesla. For example, when Musk visited China in 2019, he also had one -on -one talks with Li Keqiang, then Chinese Prime Minister.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Chinese government's inquiry, the State Council of the State Council, and Tesla did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T03-09-00Z/65768528_401.jpg" />Musk's private plane arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport on May 30</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Shanghai Municipal Government on Thursday, Musk also met with Chen Jining, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Chen Jining welcomed Tesla to increase investment and business in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>On Thursday, Xuanfeng visited China Xingxing</h3>
<p>Musk ended the Ironman Chinese visit with a full schedule on Thursday (June 1). <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/秦刚会晤特斯拉首席执行官马斯克/a-65771877">Except for meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang</a>Musk also met with the Minister of Commerce of China Wang Wentao and the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Jin Zhuanglong, and was received by the high specifications of China throughout the process. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消息人士马斯克本周将访问中国/a-65763757">Become the focus of the media</a>Essence</p>
<p>According to the news released by Chinese official media, Musk said on Tuesday (May 30) when he met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang that he was opposed to decomposing with China.</p>
<p>The next day, Musk and Wang Wentao met; according to Xinhua News Agency, Wang Wentao said that the deep integration of the Sino -US economy, and the two sides should strengthen economic and trade dialogue and cooperation under the guidance of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation. Vitality and potential are full of confidence in the Chinese market and are willing to continue to deepen mutual benefit cooperation.</p>
<p>Musk also met with Jin Zhuanglong on the 31st.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/电池的副作用宁德时代在德投资受审视/a-65549438)Chairman Zeng Yuqun has dinner.</p>
<p>Tesla did not respond to Reuters' comment requests, and Musk himself did not disclose specific conversation content to the media. Therefore, the outside world knows very little about the details of his talks with Chinese officials.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Musk's trip to China this week has attracted much attention from Chinese netizens; people call him "pioneer", "Ma Ge" and "global idols" in social media. Some users commented: "Musk is really great. If China can have people like Musk."</p>
<p>Previously, Tim Cook, President of Apple, visited China in March. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Starbucks ’s executive president Laxmannarasimhan also visited China this week; Compared with American entrepreneurs, Musk's visit to China has attracted more attention.</p>
<p>However, although the Chinese media became the focus, Musk seemed to have changed the usual high -profile style on Twitter. Before the interruption of this article, he did not publish any content related to China on his Twitter.</p>
<h3>Visit the Tesla Factory in China</h3>
<p>In addition to meeting Chinese officials, Musk also visited Tesla's electric vehicle factory in Shanghai on Wednesday evening; Reuters pointed out that he was welcomed by hundreds of employees locally.</p>
<p>"A very meaningful day!" Grace Ta, head of Tesla's public affairs in China, said in a Weibo article with photos.</p>
<p>Musk's trip was the first time since visiting the Tesla Shanghai plant in early 2020. Tesla built a super factory in Shanghai in 2019 and is the company's highest productivity automobile manufacturer. On April 9 this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/特斯拉首個海外儲能工廠落腳上海/a-65269257">Tesla announced in Twitter that it will open an energy storage plant in Shanghai</a>This will be Tesla's second factory in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In response to the prospects of Tesla's future in China, Chen Hongxin, an associate professor at the East China Normal University Enterprise Management Department, pointed out to DW that Tesla's production scale in the United States and Germany is smaller than in China. ; Tesla's goal of driving in China this year has reached 1 million, and the price of Tesla made by China is lower than the price made by the United States.</p>
<p>However, Tesla is currently facing many problems, including the weak demand in the Chinese market, and competition with Chinese auto manufacturers has continued to intensify.</p>
<p>Chen Hongxin believes that the overall automobile market in China is currently going downhill, but <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国一季度汽车出口超过日本-俄罗斯成为最大海外市场/a-65668908">new energy vehicle sales performance is still good</a>Essence As China's sixth -generation national environmental protection standards will be on the road on July 1, as environmental protection standards increase, the sales of China's gasoline vehicle market will be seriously impacted. Therefore, the outside world is still relatively optimistic about the electric vehicle market.</p>

<h3>Scholar: Release China Welcome Foreign Capital Signals</h3>
<p>Chen Hongxin told DW that Musk's visit to China was mainly because the Chinese government strongly invited at this time to represent its signal on behalf of it, hoping to clarify the recent <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国经济好景不再/a-65723945">China's poor economy</a> 。「中國政府做的每件事情都有它的意義，」他說。</p>
<p>中國廣西大學梧州學院台籍特聘教授王立本告訴DW，最近這4年外資不斷從中國外移，「很多指標性的大廠都撤退了」，這固然是新冠疫情的緣故，但是跟2018年之後的中美貿易戰也有很大的關係。</p>
<p>王立本解讀，馬斯克這次的訪問，等於是在向外界宣告，這些狀況有可能會結束，「他來到中國，如果能夠有指標性的加碼投資，那麼對於未來再度吸引外資很有幫助」。</p>
<p>"The result of decourse is to force China to do it by itself (this industry), and even in case of better and better, China can still go abroad to buy." Chen Hongxin believes that for such a large economy in China, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欲限縮中國晶片發展-出口管制有用嗎/a-65767213">the United States’s Sanctions</a>"Not necessarily the right method."</p>

<h3>European and American business community still has doubts about China</h3>
<p>Compared to Musk and some people in Europe and the United States who are actively returning to the Chinese market, many foreign and politicians still have doubts about China's future development.</p>
<p>The United States CNN reports that some high -level supervisors of some foreign companies have found that China is now a more complex business environment, which is characterized by <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國突擊美企上海辦公室-掀外商憂慮/a-65447816">crackdown on international consulting companies</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國加強反間諜-諮詢公司涉危害國安遭查/a-65557271">Geopolical tensions</a>And uncertain investment prospects.</p>
<p>Such uncertainty has caused some companies to invest more funds in China. A survey of the British Chamber of Commerce last month showed that 70%of companies said that they took a "watch" attitude towards a long -term investment in China.</p>
<p>Nick Marro, the head of the British "Economist" think tank (EIU), said that the business confidence was "relatively vulnerable" because China recently ended a strict epidemic prevention policy.</p>
<p>"Recently, the blow to information providers has exacerbated this uncertainty," Ma Zhiang told CNN. "The company is increasingly uncertain where the government's red line is, and what measures they need to take to avoid violating regulatory agencies."</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China last month, said that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國修訂反間諜法-擴大國安執法權力/a-65447359">American business people are afraid of becoming the next goal of Beijing</a>Essence "Regardless of the government's intention, this is the information received (we)," he said.</p>
<p>Alfred Wu, an associate professor of the School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore, said, "the Chinese government is trying to find a balance between safety and development, but this will be difficult to achieve."</p>

<p>Before the Memorial Hall in Hong Kong was demolished, Beijing implemented the [Comprehensive National Security Law] in Hong Kong.(https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20200803/hong-kong-election-national-security-law/)As a result, the local government basically prohibits disclosure to commemorate the 1989 massacre.

<p>The Chinese army used a slaughter to suppress the democratic movement led by students, hundreds or even thousands of people killed. A banner at the Manhattan exhibition shows that the names of 200 victims have been collected at present, but there is no complete list of victims. There was a photo of the wanted protesters on a banner, including Zhou Feng Suo.</p>
<p>The exhibition also included a bloody shirt worn by Jiang Lin, a reporter from the Chinese Military Daily. He risked to the square at the time to try to observe the situation at the scene. As a result, he was attacked by the police. In addition, there is a watch, badge and shirt of a soldier. Next to these exhibits is a book published by the government in July 1989 to justify the legitimacy of suppression.</p>
<p>Many student protesters were sleeping in the square while the massacre occurred. At that time, a sky blue tent they had used was in the exhibition. There is also a blood -stained banner. It was used by a teacher to bandage the wounds for the protesters who shot. In addition, a Hong Kong artist's paintings were displayed, which depicts the death of Lu Peng. He is currently known as the youngest. The victims were nine years old.</p>
<p>Wang Dan donated a letter written by Liu Xiaobo he received in prison, which was the writer and dissident of the Nobel Peace Prize. Wang Dan said that he hosted a democratic salon at Peking University in 1988. He called for a hunger strike in 1989 and was arrested in the same year. He was released in 1994, but was arrested the following year, and was detained for several years since then, and eventually exiled to the United States in 1998.</p>
<p>"I think that for the future of our country, the younger generation shoulders some kind of obligations and some responsibility, what should be done," Wang Dan said.</p>
<p>He said that the exhibition is not just a Chinese who lives here. He said that he hopes that Americans, especially high school students and college students can see the exhibition and understand "the situation in China, because this is not only important to China, but also important to the United States."</p>

<p>The organizer hopes to extend the exhibition to the entire museum. They have raised $ 500,000, but the goal is at least 2 million US dollars.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Following the House of Representatives, the US Senate also passed the debt limit bill on Thursday (June 1), and temporarily canceled the borrowing of the federal government in the next two years.</p>

Earlier, after passing the bill with overwhelming votes, the Republican leader of the Senate Mitchmcconnell also said that he hoped that the bill could pass the level as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Earlier, some people in the United States opposed the bill. Republicans of hardliners have hoped to further reduce expenses and make stricter reforms.

<p>Progressive Senator Berniesanders, an independent senator involved in the Democratic Party, stated on Twitter that he opposed the bill because the case involved an energy pipeline and will also be in the current Anti-POVERTYPROGRAMS.

<p>Recently, the State Council of the State Council announced the operation of the national economy in April 2023. In terms of consumption, from January to April, the total retail sales of social consumer goods were 1498.3 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5%year-on-year. The national online retail sales were 4410.8 billion yuan, an increase of 12.3%year -on -year. Among them, the online retail sales of physical goods were 3716.4 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4%, accounting for 24.8%of the total retail sales of consumer goods. Judging from the above data, social consumption is quickly recovering, and the Internet platform has become a growth momentum under the general trend of consumption.</p>
<p>Recently, the Institute of Finance and Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences released the "Platform Social and Economic Value Research Report", which analyzed the role of the Internet platform in the digitalization of the service industry for the excavation of domestic demand markets and driving consumption. The report believes that the Internet platform has become an important support for the infrastructure of service consumption and the growth of domestic demand. The platform can promote the efficient cycle between the supply and demand of consumers and consumers, and continuously drive consumption with the leverage effect.</p>
<p><strong> Promoting consumption urgently needs digitalization of the service industry </strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the data level and policy level, consumption has become increasingly the basic forces to drive economic growth. The digitalization of the service industry is important because the service industry's contribution to China's economic growth is nearly 60%. The Institute of Finance and Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicts that by 2025, the value -added of the service industry will account for the proportion of GDP, the employment of employees in the service industry, and the total proportion of service consumption will exceed 50%, which will promote the digitalization of the service industry to the development of the national economy. The expansion of domestic demand to drive consumption is crucial.</p>
<p>The importance of the service industry as the importance of the service industry as the importance of the "Report" reflects the long -term mechanism of "establishing and improving the long -term mechanism of expanding the consumption of residents, so that residents have stable income to consume, and they are not worried about the dare to consume. The consumption and consumption environment is a strong wish for consumption. "It also reflects the emphasis on the 2022 Central Economic Work Conference that" should focus on recovery and expand consumption in priority, enhance consumption capacity, improve consumer conditions, and innovate consumption scenarios. "</p>
<p>China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has gone into the stage of transition to consumption -driven after 45 years of reform and opening up. Based on China's population ranking second in the world, it is necessary to say that the scale economy is not needed. Since the reform and opening up in 1978, one of the main reasons to achieve such a large economic development is that the scale economy has played an important role. As the reform is continuously deepened, the scope economy has also begun to play. The scope economy generates the same or similar input elements when the specialization of management work and the production of a variety of products in the management work, or the technical changes that are better used to better use production equipment and conducive to joint production. The scope economy focuses on production. Product correlation.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that in the era of digital economy, the platform can promote the realization of digitalization of the service industry, especially in the context of the continuous expansion of domestic demand, orderly recovery of consumption scenarios, and explosive growth in service consumption. The advantages of scope economy.</p>
<p><strong> Consumption characteristics and pain points and blockage points of the digital economy era </strong></p>
<p>To promote consumption, we must make the pulse of the current consumption characteristics. In the era of digital economy, China's consumption shows the following characteristics: service consumption is the focus of further tapping domestic demand; a significant trend of service consumption presents structural upgrades; consumer demand has shown a diversified trend, and the grades are increasingly obvious. Just need; the platform becomes a key infrastructure for consumer supply and demand for docking services.</p>
<p>Specifically, it is necessary to meet consumers' diversification, high quality, and scenario needs, expand consumption, and reduce the time and costs of consumption satisfaction. In terms of willingness, new demand is expanded by expanding the scene; in terms of time, fragmentation, instantization, and unlimited time must be achieved; in terms of space, the consumer area must be expanded; in terms of participation, the threshold for participation must be reduced;</p>
<p>The above -mentioned diversified needs are considered to be experienced consumption. It can be said that the essence of service industry is an experiential consumption. Combined with the actual situation, the current promotion of consumption needs to clear the following blocks: First, some groups, such as the elderly group, have not yet completed the process of incorporating the digital economy. The threshold for digitalization improves their digital consumption experience; second, niche consumption is not satisfied. Niche consumption or consumer's niche demand is not seen. It is difficult for the products and services they want to consume, and the demand for niche demand is facing the problem of incompatibility between people and freight yards; After moving down to the online, failed to establish a full trust mechanism between the two parties to allow consumers to make personal transaction arrangements without worry. The threshold for consumption willingness needs to be cracked.</p>
<p><strong> The platform should establish a coordination mechanism for promoting consumption </strong></p>
<p>For the above -mentioned consumption characteristics, pain points, and blocking points, as the main platform for digitalization of the service industry, the platform can be solved to a large extent. In general, the platform must establish a coordination mechanism that can make both ends of the supply and demand (trying to reduce friction) during the transaction, so that the two parties from one -time buying and selling relationship The evolution of the relationship transitions the demand end from passive, traditional consumers to active types, and digital consumers.</p>
<p>Specifically, first of all, the platform must give full play to the connection effect, and coordinate the "digital gap" through technology and resource inclusiveness, so that each group can share the dividend of the digital economy and digital technology. This is a complete collection that needs to be fully set. Social engineering in society, consumers 'needs need to be brought to merchants and service providers by platforms, while merchants need platforms and service providers' support at the technical and resource level. Taking the elderly group that has not been met in consumer needs as an example, China, as the only country in the world with a population of more than 200 million, although the initial results of the "appropriate aging transformation" in the past two years, it is still not a system. People's digital consumption platforms also lack new products developed according to the characteristics of the elderly. Next, the platform combines the needs of the elderly to help merchants create digital business solutions to develop products and marketing that is more consistent with the consumption of the elderly. Models meet the needs of the elderly who have been ignored before.</p>
<p>Secondly, precise drip irrigation forms a link effect. Say goodbye to the extensive flow era of "big water drilling" in the past. Properly promote, thousands of people and thousands of people, give full play to the coordination mechanism of frictionless transactions, so that the cost of consumers spent on the collection of information collection and personal transactions related to transaction opportunities minimizes. In terms of technical level, it brings efficient and accurate connections through personalized recommendations and intelligent distribution technology. Through traffic tilt and sinking of products and services, the needs of niche consumers and niche can be fully seen. With the renewal iteration of the consumer group, the middle class and the post -90s have gradually become the main force of the Chinese consumer market. Copy service consumption, the platform can help merchants perform stratified marketing and precise marketing when advancing the digitalization process of the service industry.Finally, consumption through technology can maximize the effect of promoting consumption. In recent years, local governments at all levels have jointly distributed various consumer coupons to citizens, such as non -different consumer coupons, catering vouchers, tourist coupons, and so on. According to the survey statistics of the "Social and Economic Value Research Report" of the Social Sciences, since 2020, Alipay has promoted a variety of forms such as consumer vouchers and platform ticket marketing, and has accumulated a total of nearly 300 billion yuan. In the two consumer festivals in 2022, the platform's digital issuance coupons leveraged 1:25, which greatly played the "one leverage" multiplication effect. If consumers encounter a good consumer experience, they will repeat the purchase from the merchants to form a "secondary leverage" effect. Because the platform has the ability to accurately analyze scale effects and big data, it can improve the touch efficiency and conversion efficiency of the government or merchants, thereby bringing leverage effects.</p>
<p>In summary, the non -friction coordination mechanism established by the platform should be based on the user's first and innovation as the core, and closely focuses on the new stage, new scenes, and new concepts, and through the digitization of the service industry as the starting point, build opportunities and opportunities for technical knowledge innovation and innovation Dynamics, further integrate online and offline, form a long -term economic growth mechanism, and then expand domestic demand and promote consumption.</p>
<p>In the past 40 years, China's economic development has mainly relied on exports and investment in the "three carriages" of the national economy. The focus of development will be transferred to consumption -driven. Digitalization of the service industry is an important starting point for driving consumption. The platform transitions from passive, traditional consumers to active types and digital consumers by establishing a dynamic coordination mechanism centered on the first and innovation of the user's first and innovation as the core. Promote the high -level dynamic balance between the supply and demand ends, thereby promoting the digitalization of the service industry to achieve scale economy and scope economy.</p>

<p>Recently, the debate around China has appeared on the hot search of Chinese social media, because it was a bill adopted by the US Congress.</p>
<p>On March 27, 2023, the House of Representatives in favor of 415 votes and 0 votes against the voting of 0 votes unanimously adopted the "People's Republic of China is not a developing country". The U.S. Budget Office pointed out in a document marked on March 7, 2023 that the bill aims to "request the State Council to influence international organizations and categorize China into high income, medium and upper income or developed countries. It is not a developing country. The bill also requires the State Council to discourage these organizations to give China any preferential treatment as developing countries. "</p>
<p>Once the news came out, it immediately triggered heated discussion among Chinese officials and self -media. Except for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs clarification, the official nationalist tabloid "Global Times" controlled by China pointed out that the United States has no right to make a decision on China's developing countries. "The American attempt to further expose Washington to seek increasing China's development costs and forces us It is less noisy, calm, objective, and convincing on social media sounds that bearing the international responsibility within the scope of beyond ability.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of this bill and the subsequent influence, it is necessary to clarify several terms in the bill. This is exactly the most clear concepts of the development of economics.</p>
<p>In textbooks written by Western economists, Developing Countries, Less-Developed/UnderDevelopedCountries, and The Thirdworld actually refers to the same type of countries. Division and frequently appear in various works, from the cover of books to the title of thesis, it is very common.</p>
<p>Depending on the different observation dimensions, the countries on the earth can be divided into the following categories: high -income countries and low -income countries; DevelopedCountRies, developing countries or underdeveloped countries; democratic or autocratic countries; and modern or traditional countries Wait, these categories cross and overlap each other, and sometimes the boundaries are not clear. For example, a high -income country can be an authoritarian country, and a low -income country can also be a democratic country. It is not easy to judge that a country is a democratic country or a modern society, because there is no absolute standard, but from a relative perspective, such as choosing a more democratic and modern country from several countries, it is much easier.</p>
<p>The most used in the above classification, which is also generally recognized as the first, is the method of classifying the per capita income from the per capita income. Other categories, either the endorsement of authoritative organizations or institutions, or too broad meaning, making it difficult to grasp and easily produce ambiguity.</p>
<p>According to the latest standards launched by the World Bank, the per capita income of more than $ 13205 is a high -income country. Data show that in 2022, China's per capita GDP (GDP) was US $ 12,741, which was equivalent to only 1/6 of the United States. According to this standard, China is a medium -income country. Today China is a developing country or a developed country, and it is more like a kind of benevolent and wise. Because the simple figures in income cannot measure the development of a country.</p>
<p>Even the classification of per capita income is still rough lines, not static. On the one hand, the threshold of high -income countries is dynamic and will be adjusted according to the actual situation; on the other hand, under the high -income column, it can be subdivided into "high -income countries" and "high -income countries". Differentiated those high -income countries that do not rely on oil to achieve high income and non -co -organizers. This is because, in the perspective of professional researchers, the politics of high -income countries has its own uniqueness and cannot be the same as other high -income countries.</p>
<p>If the per capita income is a more objective quantity indicator, then the development of a country must not only have high support for high income, but also require soft indicators to ensure. In fact, in terms of basic meanings, the "developed" in English does not pay attention to the (one country) per capita income, but emphasizes that (one country) has many industries and supplemented by complex economic systems. Essence The logical relationship here can be summarized in one sentence, that is, high -income countries may not be developed countries, but developed countries are usually high -income countries. Perhaps this is the reason. Whether it is an international organization or a serious scholar, it looks particularly cautious when using the term "developed".</p>
<p>I think of the exchange with local scholars when I arrived in Australia in the beginning of many years. What made me curious at the time was why many Australian economists insisted that Australia was more like developing countries than China? The reason they give is that the exports of Australia are mainly primary products, such as iron ore, and China's exports are mainly industrial products, and the proportion is far more than Australia. Such awareness is not unparalleled, because the United Nations Trade and Development Conference has proposed an opinion on the proportion of industrial products to different countries.</p>
<p>It is surprising that it makes sense that Australian scholars do not like their country in private that their own country is called "Developed country". They admitted that they are more willing to define themselves with the "Developing country". Because "developed" English used in the past, people are reminiscent of the end, and "developing countries" use it now, it sounds like it has been improving. In fact, it is the most developed country today, and it is also facing matters that need to be solved through development. In this way, the meaning and boundaries of developed countries seem to be blurred again.</p>
<p>Although there are no clear and generally accepted standards for developed countries, there are opinions that the 38 member states currently organized by the OECD belong to developed countries. To join this Organization, which is known as the "rich country with music", in addition to the requirements of per capita income, it also needs to be in terms of labor issues, judicial system reform, corporate governance of state -owned enterprises, anti -bribery, trade, and industrial chemicals and waste management. Meet certain conditions. At present, there are only two countries in Asia (excluding Oceania), namely Japan (1964) and South Korea (1996). According to this standard, only 38 developed countries in more than 200 countries around the world. However, with the addition of Columbia (2020) and Costa Rica (2021), people's understanding of developed countries will deepen again and will not only stare at the per capita income.It can be speculated that if the US official promotes the above bill within the WTO and led a large country to refuse to accept the status of Chinese developing countries, and China insists on the stance of "defending the national interests", then the WTO is likely to be very likely The establishment of a special committee to be established to coordinate this issue.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the categories of countries around the world according to democracy or autocracy are new trends in recent years, and more and more use occasions have been used. The first is that recently some Western leaders have begun to distinguish between ideology and distinguish camps. For example, shortly after Bayeng's serving as the President of the United States, he held the "Democratic Country Peak Conference" to exclude China and Russia and other countries. For example, in 2021, TheEconomist has launched a list of "Fully Authoritarianregations", including 59 countries including China, Russia and Iran. The above actions undoubtedly lead people to the fundamental issue of moving attention to national politics, and Western countries led by the United States are enthusiastic about dividing the national camp with values. Essence</p>
<p>The thinking of dividing the country into democracy or autocracy is being favored by more and more researchers, and it is likely that it is possible to be systematically explained in future textbooks. When this concept affects the policy guidelines of the next -generation policy or appear in the future international organizations and institutions, China's activity space on the international stage may be limited. In addition, it seems to enjoy another label, that is, the potential benefits of the largest democratic country on the planet. Whether it is self -advertising or praised, India's controversy on this issue is not great.</p>
<p>Back to the US bill again, as the members of the drafting the bill said, China ’s current economic schedule is second in the world, which is an indisputable fact. In addition, from the South China Sea to Antarctica, and then from Europe to Africa, China's influence is everywhere. Economic assistance has long been criticized in Chinese folks. After all, there are still many poverty -stricken areas in China, and hundreds of millions of people are struggling on the edge of the internationally recognized poverty line. The Chinese government's aggressive overseas, a big investment in his head, not to mention developing countries, even if developing countries are estimated to be dazed, sigh. Obviously, these intuitive feelings have shaken and changed the recognition of China as a developing country, which is also the main reason why members of the United States Parliament insisted on promoting the passage of the bill.</p>
<p>When developing activities in international trade and financial institutions as developing countries, various preferential conditions can be obtained. It is mainly reflected in terms of taxation and loans. More international obligations. This may be the true concern that Chinese officials are not willing to say, although in many international occasions, China has declared a "responsible big country."</p>
<p>Chinese officials and media opposed the United States' "wearing a hat" to China, and also reminded the author's impression that visiting in poor areas in China and communicating with local officials. In fact, many of them are not interested in picking poverty hats, because once they "pick up hats", the once financial support and strong treatment will be greatly reduced until zero. There are "levels" in poverty -stricken areas in China, such as national and provincial levels, which are divided into different support standards. As a result, the more poor areas, the less lack of motivation for "picking hats" and the greater the resistance. When it comes to the response of Chinese official media to the US bill, it will immediately agree that the external posture of a country is actually just a continuation of domestic politics.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when Chinese economist Lin Yifu answered when China could solve the problem of haze, he said that as long as China entered a high -income country, the haze problem could be solved. question. This seems to be blurted with important economic ideas behind the words, that is, the environmental Kuzshanes curve, which can be briefly expressed that as the per capita income of a country increases, citizens' demand for environmental quality will increase, and the level of pollution levels will be present. The trend of long -term decline, and then promoting the improvement of the environmental quality of a country, this idea has been proven by the experience and facts of countries around the world. Of course, this logic may not be established, that is, countries with clean environment may not achieve high income.</p>
<p>Similarly, no high -income country is based on information blocking and limited speech, let alone developed countries. This is still a conclusion based on reality observation. The logic is the same. With the improvement of income levels, people's desire for freedom will become stronger. At this time, freedom of speech will become the necessary conditions for entering high income or modern countries. That is, the freedom of information and freedom of speech does not ensure that a country is pushed to the ladder of a high -income country, but high -income countries, especially developed countries, must be open information and freedom of speech. In this sense, China has many things that need to be resolved on the road to developed countries, and freedom of speech is just one of them.</p>
<p>When the author sees the full name of the United States Act, the first thing to think of is not the common sense of income, nor the controversy around developed, but a famous judgment on reputation in the theory of game, that is, the reputation is not by "who is". Definition is determined by "not who". The reputation here can be individual or organization, such as companies and countries. "Not who" contains more content than "Who" and is more in line with the principles of efficiency in economics. From this perspective, looking at the "The People's Republic of China is not a developing country" bill, it may be able to get another feeling. What country China is, there will be multiple answers, which depends entirely on the perspective and position of the observer, but from the perspective of the Legislator of the United States, China is not a developing country.</p>
<p>There are still traditional and modern distinctions in the world. At present, the Chinese ruling party is vigorously promoting the narrative of "Chinese -style modernization", which is just a hodgepodge that is just a Western material lifestyle and a Chinese -style spirit. Although the streets and alleys of China are filled with the slogans of socialist core values such as "democracy, freedom, and justice", as long as Article 35 of the Chinese Constitution is not implemented and the speech is not free, China will be missed with modern countries, let alone realize it. "modernization".</p>
<p>In summary, even if China's per capita income has reached a considerable level in the future, as long as China's reform is not completed, the rule of law is not implemented, politics is clear, and human rights are difficult to guarantee. China cannot become developed countries. This has nothing to do with income, and it is not even more economic. When the rigorous scholars are classified in China, they will still use the term "developed" cautiously to modify or limit it. The classification is the same.</p>

<p>"Kong Yiji" is a novel written by Lu Xun in 1919. In the novel, Kong Yiji (can be called "Literature Kong Yiji") belongs to the scholar, but it is completely marginalized by the long shirt and the short shirt and the short shirt. As for the contemporary reality, Kong Yiji has recently revealed the dilemma facing through the creation of "Kong Yiji Literature", which has attracted the attention of Chinese officials and the people.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Reador </strong></p>
<p>Kong Yiji is a scholar, and is a stubborn. He couldn't even pass Xiucai (student). Pu Songling, the author of "Liao Zhai Zhi Yi", did not have a person who was admitted to Xiucai, and he did not have to be. However, compared with Kong Yiji, the situation was better. As for the reason why Kong Yiji could not pass the talent, or because of his studies, he was not exquisite enough, but the competition for the test was more worthy of attention. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Liang Qichao wrote in the "Book on the Bus": "There are hundreds of children who are born with hundreds of children and do ten people as members." It can be seen that Tong Sheng's proportion of talents has become a talented ratio.</p>
<p>Except for the imperial examinations, the issue of Kong Yiji will not work. Kong Yiji wrote well, and someone invited him to the banknote book. However, he actually "sits for a few days, and he will even be disappeared together with people and books." The reason for this is because he is a little lazy to complete this "boring"; or because of low pay, he can only reluctantly do it; plus he loves books, he takes away other people's books (together with paper pen). After several times, no one will invite him to the banknote.</p>
<p>Among those who cannot pass the talents, some people live on their teachers. However, due to special reasons (perhaps including taking away other people's books, the pen and pen are worse), Kong Yiji was hired. In addition to being a teacher, the other way out of the reader is to be a curator and the curtain friends (especially those with special talents), such as Pu Songling. But for Kong Yiji, it is difficult for people like him to be appreciated by specific officials and become a curtain friend.</p>
<p>In ancient times (even in the late Qing Dynasty), there were scholars, farmers, industry and commerce. The scholars or "prospective" (not well -known scholars), because of the disappointment to do business or farmers, after all, it is rare -but not without. Kong Yiji has not embarked on such a way of making a living. He should lack labor experience and skills, and his culture and knowledge made him unwilling to engage in agriculture, work, and business. In this way, it is difficult for him to solve the problem of livelihood and be reduced to the kind of scholar.</p>
<p>When Confucius said in the Analects of Confucius, it is seen that he should read the Confucian classics by quoting what Confucius said in "The Analects of Confucius". He also wanted to teach the four writing methods of the "return" of the gang of warm wine in the counter, but the guy was unwilling to learn. Knowing the four writing methods of "Hui", or because he has read a lot of ancient books, but the four ways of writing are useless in reality, he will also be regarded as "pedantic".</p>
<p>Even if poverty is poverty, Kong Yiji is still easy to read, so he will steal books -thieves generally do not steal books, and robbers do not grab books. Perhaps Kong Yiji believes that "the book has a book" is justified (just as "the farmer has its own field"), so "the stealing can not be considered a steal." Perhaps he believes that the book should be transferred from those books that do not read to a good book.</p>
<p>Some people say that Kong Yiji is pitiful and ridiculous, but he should actually say that he is sad. In ancient times (and even the late Qing Dynasty), there were people who were "Dai Tian Shou Lang, Mu Dengtang Tianshitang", but there were also hopeless and powerless people like Kong Yiji. He could no longer participate in the "inner volume" of the imperial examination, but he did not seem to really "lie down", but he was struggling hopeless until he was completely swallowed by darkness.</p>
<p><strong> Second, wearing gown and short clothes </strong></p>
<p>The gown is a symbol of identity and social status. Lu Xun later wrote in the article "Push": "It can be seen that it is a gown, even if it is not 'high Chinese', it should always belong to the superior." As for the short shirt and short jacket, at that time, the clothing style of the labor people (see Huang Nengyi and other : "Dai Guan Tianxia: History of Chinese Clothing Pictures") In the hotel in Luzhen, these two people are actually separated. Standing and drinking by the cabinet. The former was used to sitting, and the latter was used to standing.</p>
<p>Kong Yiji is the only person who stands drinking and wearing a gown. For Kong Yiji, it is reasonable to say that it is not a clothing that exceeds his identity, but a clothing that reflects his identity (childhood). He wore a gown, and the main purpose should not be the recognition and acceptance of other gown wearing, but to distinguish it with the short clothes -he is a cultural person, and they are not (in fact, the values of each other are different).</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who have not been admitted to the talents, but Kong Yiji may be regarded as a downward person. When other scholars arrive at the hotel, they will still have to drink and drink. Kong Yiji fell to drink. As for the short gang of drinking and drinking, knowing that Kong Yiji is a very unsuccessful scholar, and regards him as a sarcasm that can be ridiculed. He will neither respect and lack sympathy. The hotel guys are roughly the same class as the short clothes to help customers, but he also looks down on Kong Yiji, thinking that the latter is "the same person who is a meal." Kong Yiji was completely reduced by the dual contempt of gown and short clothes, and has completely reduced to the edge of society.</p>
<p>Lu Xun wrote in "The Lantern": "Many differences that are still in the ancient times because of ancient times, so that people are separated from each other, so they can no longer feel the pain of others." "Leeks" lack sympathy for other "leek" unfortunate encounters, perhaps because of the differences and gaps between each other, maybe because of similar narrowness and limitations of each other. This "leek society" is quite indifferent and ruthless.</p>
<p>In addition to Kong Yiji, in addition to Kong Yiji, the novel also has Ding Jumen. The people are the upper -level gentlemen, and there are many privileges and higher social prestige (see Zhang Zhongli: "Chinese gentleman"). This person and Kong Yiji were regarded as a reader, but they actually belonged to different social classes. He has no sympathy for the poor Kong Yi. Kong Yiji went to his house to steal, and was actually discounted by him. It stands to reason that gentlemen should maintain Gang Lunji and be a model of morality. How can the readers discount their legs (even if he enters the room and steal the book), how can they be a model of the people?</p>
<p>After being discounted, Kong Yiji, life is even more disappointed. It can be said that there are only "dead roads." But what exactly does the ending, others (whether wearing a gown or a short gang) are not clear or careless. As a result, Kong Yiji disappeared forever in their "no see" and "no longer say".</p>
<p><strong> Three, contemporary Kong Yiji </strong></p>
<p>Chinese universities are constantly expanding. For 30 years from 1991 to 2021, the number of college entrance examinations increased by more than 15 times, and the admission rate rose from about 20%to more than 90%. Generally speaking, higher education has developed from "strict advancement" to "wide entry and wide out", and enrollment generally means to graduate smoothly. The number of rapidly growing university graduates will inevitably lead to employment difficulty -it is even more so in the background of the economic downturn (superposition of the epidemic).</p>
<p>So many college students are actually divided into different classes- "cut leeks" and "leek class". At the same time, getting the same college diploma will not make them the same class. In the circle of friends, the son of Nanchang (Zhou Yan), who dazzled the rich in the circle of friends. Those who were born in the "leek class" thought that they had academic qualifications to put on "gown", but they were actually "leek".</p>
<p>孔乙己曾因字写得好，给人钞书——但当代毕业生中有些人连类似的活也找不到。他们又不愿务农、做工，拿到大学文凭后，以为穿上“长衫”，但却找不到适于“长衫”做的工作。于是他们创作出“孔乙己文学”。</p>
<p>其实，他们的“长衫”与孔乙己的“长衫”有重要区别。孔乙己没考上秀才，类似没有学历。但他穿长衫，有意与短衣帮区分，主要是因为他认为自己是有文化者(乃至文化传承者)。对当今大学毕业生来说，有学历未必等同于真正有文化。他们以为拿到文凭使其穿上“长衫”，而非有文化使其穿上“长衫”(这或与他们缺乏真正的文化有关)。</p>
<p>“长衫”不能使孔乙己维持生计，“学历的长衫”也不能使部分高校毕业生维持生计。即便有些人穿着“长衫”找到工作，但他们还是“韭菜”——比如格子间中的“韭菜”等。倘若有些人像中国官方媒体提倡的那样脱下“长衫”，去干短衣帮的活，比如“挽起裤腿下田地”，也就回归了“本色韭菜”。这样一来，他们或无暇创作“孔乙己文学”了。</p>
<p>至于自诩喝过20万元一斤白毫银针的周公子之流，根本不会去创作“孔乙己文学”，只会创作“严世蕃文学”——周劼自称严世蕃，视其“老子”为严嵩(明代权臣)。他们的“长衫”，不是通过取得学历穿上的，而是通过“血缘”穿上的。他们更无真正的文化可言，穿着的肯定不是孔乙己的长衫，也不像是丁举人的长衫(尽管在“仗势”方面不无相似之处，但举人一般经历过严格的科举考试，而周公子没有)。</p>
<p>中国高等教育可以培养出当代严世蕃，也可以培养出当代孔乙己，套用胡锡进的“复杂中国”说法，完全可以自夸为“复杂教育”。</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) The June 4th Annmen incident will 34th anniversary. As the Hong Kong authorities continue to erase the traces of the massacre, it will cause related memory to systematically "disappear" concerns. On the occasion of this, the "June 4th Memorial Hall" in New York, USA will open on Friday (June 2), and also saved the overseas of the incident's legacy to ignite the light.</p>
<p>This small memorial hall is settled in a narrow fourth -floor office space in Manhattan, New York. Donation of participants in the June 4th Movement.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that there are similar museums in Hong Kong, which were closed by the government in 2021. Now the June 4th Memorial Hall in New York will become the only permanent exhibition in the world to commemorate this incident.</p>
<p>In this regard, Wang Dan, the leader of June 4th student Wang Dan, said at a press conference on the establishment of the museum on April (1st): "The intention of the Chinese authorities is obvious. They want to cover up history and let the world forget the crime of Chinese authorities. They hope that everyone will forget the Communist Party. It is a regime based on violence and lies. "</p>
<p>Zhou Fenguo, the leader of June 4th student, also said that this memorial is "the hope of free China." He assisted in planning this memorial hall and said: "We will unite together, just like at Tiananmen Square 34 years ago, people all over the world see our dream of freedom China."</p>

<p>紐約六四紀念館展出六四事件相關報導</p>
<h3>香港六四守夜活動「被消失」</h3>
<p>全球華人社群將在本週日(4日)紀念天安門事件，許多海外中國人和香港人都將參加世界各地舉辦的守夜活動。</p>
<p>然而，30多年前率先發起這個傳統、多年來也是此類活動標誌性地點的香港， <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/墙外文摘-维园悼念仪式不再港人如何海外移植/a-62037585"> 今年將不會舉行相關公開活動</a>Essence Since the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2020, the public activities that commemorate this tragedy have disappeared, and the Hong Kong authorities are also removing various memories of this bloody suppression incident and student protests.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/公共圖書館撤書挨批-特首借書須符香港利益/a-65633101">Hong Kong Public Library has removed dozens of books related to June 4th</a>Documentary; Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao stated that the collection must ensure that "no law violates Hong Kong laws" and "in line with Hong Kong interests."</p>
<p>In addition to the withdrawal of the relevant books of June 4th, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/六四悼念的最後避風港香港教會陷兩難/a-62021811">Catholic Hong Kong Diocese also announced last month that after the event of the June 4th commemoration of the June 4th commemorative Mass due to worrying about violating the National Security Law last year, this event will be suspended again</a> 。</p>
<p>一些專家告訴DW，香港人保持紀念六四傳統的原因之一，是因為他們想避免重蹈1989年抗議學生的覆轍；而當局抹去六四相關記憶的舉動，反映了中國政府長期以來致力刪去反對意見的作法，好將敘事改為對自己有利。</p>
<p>非政府組織人權觀察(Human Rights Watch)的亞洲部副主任王松蓮(Maya Wang)說，中國政府「不滿足於僅僅抹去對天安門廣場大屠殺的公開紀念，還想要改變香港和中國其他地區的人們對那段日子的記憶」。</p>
<p>英國倫敦國王學院(King's College London)潘迪生法學院(The Dickson Poon School ofLaw)的客座研究員黎恩灝(EricLai)則說：「香港人曾認為，在共產主義政權面前，民主就是保護自己生活方式的最佳辦法」，在這樣的背景下，紀念天安門的傳統反映了港人對中國政府根深蒂固的不滿。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T06-01-00Z/59306329_401.jpg" />During the June 4th Memorial event held in Taipei on June 4, 2020, there were candlelights on the banner of "Restore Hong Kong, Times Revolution" in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>囹圄 囹圄 囹圄 囹圄</h3>
<p>Not only did the June 4 commemorative event stopped in Hong Kong, but the main leaders of the June 4th Park Garden Party were arrested, detained or sentenced for being arrested, detained or sentenced for national security. Zhou Hengdong, Li Zhuoren and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/处于保释期的香港支联会前主席何俊仁再度被捕/a-65057914">He Junren</a>"<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/邹幸彤等三人拒交支联会资料罪成/a-64885114">Hong Kong Citizens Support the Patriotic Democratic Movement Federation" (referred to as the branch association</a>) Founding member, the alliance is the main organization responsible for organizing this night -guard activity. They have been imprisoned for more than 1 year.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that the Hong Kong Government has intended to kill chickens and cicadas with the arrest of the highly anticipated social movement. Patrickpoon, a visiting researcher at Tokyo University, said: "(Hong Kong Government) wants to send a message -if the Hong Kong people continue to hold public activities to commemorate June 4th, or shout slogans, raise banners to end the one -party dictatorship, they will be suspected of violating Guoan Law."</p>
<p>On the eve of June 4th (June 3rd to 5th), Deng Bingqiang, director of the Hong Kong Security Bureau, warned that if anyone tried to use "special days" to promote Hong Kong independence, or attempts to subvert the state power, Hong Kong The government will be decisively enforced.</p>
<p>At the same time, 26 Hong Kong and Guangdong Associations, including the China Provincial Township Club, will host a carnival event of "Celebrating Hong Kong Return" in Victoria Park, Hong Kong at the end of the sixth and fourth wears. Because the Tiananmen Memorial Party is held here every year, public opinion speculates that this carnival is denied by the organization to prevent any commemorative June 4th activities.</p>
<p>In this case, Hong Kong is expected to not hold any public activities related to June 4th. Wang Songlian and Tiananmen student leader Zhou Feng Suo, the leader of Human Rights Observation Organization, emphasized that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/數百移英港人聚首倫敦-燭海悼念六四/a-57786301">commemorative activities held around the world will help maintain the historical memory of June 4th</a> 。</p>

<h4>June 4, Tiananmen — Memory that cannot be forgotten</h4>
<h3>Democratic Goddess</h3>
<p>Under Tiananmen Morning Daxi, the protesters used plastic foam and gypsum to set up a democratic goddess about 10 meters high on the metal bracket. The goddess location is facing the statue of Mao Zedong on the building of Tiananmen City. In the early morning of June 4, soldiers used tanks and armed vehicles to push the statue.</p>

<h3>Singing female police officer</h3>
<p>Before the Chinese government suppressed, the situation was tense, but citizens often sent things to soldiers and police. Sometimes, the entry into the city will sing patriotic songs with the demonstrators. The policewoman in the picture was singing on Tiananmen Square, and a few days later, the army entered, and the democratic movement was suppressed by force.</p>

<h3>struggle</h3>
<p>On June 3, 1989, a day before the June 4th suppression, a woman was sandwiched among the democratic demonstrators and the army near the Great Hall of the People. In the midnight of the day, the 38th Army fired to the non -incompetent people, and finally seized Tiananmen Square, which was occupied by the demonstrators for weeks.</p>

<h4>June 4, Tiananmen — Memory that cannot be forgotten</h4>
<h3>The weapon seized</h3>
<p>One day before the suppression, thousands of demonstrators were around a bus, and a weapon seized on the top of the car. After the government announced martial law, the soldiers and demonstrations had a subtle relationship. The demonstrators sometimes send gifts to the soldiers to condolences, and the troops have temporarily retired.</p>

<h3>Fight for democracy</h3>
<p>In the middle of the night on June 3, a armored carrier car just broke through the roadblocks built by the demonstrator and were surrounded by the demonstrators in front of the party's party. At the same time, martial arts soldiers not far away are preparing to fire the demonstrators.</p>

<h3>Burning soldiers</h3>
<p>On the evening of June 3, the demonstrators ignited a armored carrier on the Chang'an Street in Tiananmen. This is the last photo taken by photographer Jeffwidner that night. Soon after that, he was accidentally hit by a brick thrown by the demonstrator. Although suffering strenuous brain shocks, because the camera in the hand offset most of the impact, Wednel escaped the robbery and was not in danger of life.</p>

<h3>suppression</h3>
<p>On June 4, the first day after the democratic movement led by the student was bloody, a truck loaded with a soldier patrolled on the Changan Street in front of the Beijing Hotel. On the same day, a soldier similar to a truck fired at the tourists standing in the lobby of the Beijing Hotel.</p>

<h3>"Tank Man"</h3>
<p>On June 4, a lonely man holding a shopping bag stood in the middle of Changan Street, trying to block the way of tank formation. Twenty -five years later, this person's final fate is still unknown. This scene has become one of the most symbolic images of the Democratic Movement of Tiananmen.</p>

<h3>dead hero</h3>
<p>On June 5th, a group of people showed a picture of a local native place on Chang'an Street. The deceased on the screen was allegedly a demonstrator who shot shot in the process of seizing Tiananmen Square. The huge wound on the deceased showed that soldiers used Dam. Amnesty International Organization believes that at least 300 civilians were killed.</p>

<h3>Clean</h3>
<p>After the army suppressed the democratic movement, two women were cleaning the square, and behind them were a bicycle that had been burned. In the protest movement, several cars and military vehicles were burned, and some soldiers died or injured.</p>

<p>In late May 1989, the Associated Press Photography reporter Weiderne (left) and Chinese photographer Liu Xiangcheng took a picture in front of the Forbidden City. At that time, they may not expect that a few days later, the Chinese government used force to suppress the Democratic Movement of Tiananmen.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The latest research report from an intelligence company pointed out that the Chinese intelligence agencies and the PLA are vigorously investing in Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to better understand the US military's capabilities in the Pacific and other regions.</p>
<p>The United States "New York Times" reported that the analysis report of the U.S. threatening intelligence company "RecordedFuture" detailed how the Chinese government and the company collected public data from the US Department of Defense, Think Tank and Private Companies, which helps the Chinese Army. Fang is a pre -pre -pre -made plan with the United States.</p>
<p>"There is a China Maritime Research Institute, which has conducted a large number of open source research on China," said Zoehaver, a threat intelligence analyst of "Record the Future". "This is a study under the academic framework, but in the end, the foreign government will think that this kind of information is valuable.</p>
<p>The U.S. military did not comment immediately on the results of the report.</p>
<p>The definition of open source intelligence is widely defined, but the "record future" studies the information of the Chinese PLA intelligence agencies to formulate plans and develop the army.</p>
<p>The report said that the PLA and the Chinese defense industry will almost use the open information environment of other countries to extract open source intelligence from foreign governments, military, universities, national defense industry companies, scientific research institutions, think tanks, news media, social media platforms, forums and other places. Personal and commercial data providers, printing media, radio radio, satellite and other sources are also sources of information.</p>
<p>The report also reviewed the contract issued by the Chinese military to Chinese private companies to understand how China collects a series of open source information, including information about the US military and information involving Taiwan's defense work.</p>
<p>"The PLA assumes that the United States will intervene in the Taiwan conflict in some form, and they work hard to prepare for this situation." Analyst Hefo said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T06-50-00Z/65275531_401.jpg" />According to the analysis, part of the reason for China to collect open source information is to prepare for possible Taiwan Straits War.</p>
<h3>Collection of open source intelligence constitutes a challenge for democratic politics</h3>
<p>The latest report of the "Record Future" company lists 5 Chinese private OSINT suppliers serving the Chinese PLA, including suppliers of the main sales platforms and database products, suppliers that mainly provide research and analysis services, and remote sensing dedicated to remote sensing. Data supplier.</p>
<p>The report believes that the PLA is likely to use these data to support decision -making and better understand potential foreign opponents and prepare for future conflicts.</p>
<p>The report also pointed out that although there is a security problem in the information disclosed by the United States and its allies, the extensive access to data may not be a solution. Analyst Black Buddha said that he hopes that more people can recognize China to collect open source intelligence, help private enterprises, military and other government departments to manage risks, and make it more difficult for "online crawlers" to from the public database and websites. Search for information automatically. In addition, Black Buddha also encouraged enterprises to conduct due diligence for Chinese companies that intend to purchase their information.</p>
<p>"In the final analysis, we don't want Western countries to close their information environment," said the analyst Black Buddha. "That's not even a good thing. We value openness."</p>
<h3>China has already started collecting open source messages</h3>
<p>In September 2020, many media reports that Zhenhua Data Company, located in Shenzhen, China, systematically collects "[Digital Bread Deduct] by millions of people in various countries.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/小心数字面包屑中国打响大数据间谍战/a-54930131)"And provided to the Chinese government and civil units as an intelligence, causing the outside world to shock. "Digital bread debris" refers to a clues left by a person on the Internet.</p>
<p>American scholar Balnding, an American scholar who found this database on the Internet, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访开源数据恐成为中国扩大影响力的利器/a-54942061">Tell DW in 2020</a>All sectors usually regard open source data as low -value or worthless information, but open source data is often the source of information from government departments or intelligence units.</p>
<p>Ballding is an independent scholar. He has taught at Peking University Business School for nearly 10 years, and has also served as an associate professor at the Department of Economics, Fulbright University of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Ballin explained to DW at the time that if a user shared a photo on Facebook or Twitter, the technology of these two platforms will automatically mark the location of the photo. Even if the user closes the function of the Twitter marked location, others can still analyze your location from the background.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a large number of foreign military personnel in Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Company, including thousands of grassroots military personnel. They track the Twitter or Facebook of these military personnel and use it to locate the location of the personnel. When Zhenhua knows the location of these personnel, it can further speculate that the location of a certain ship is located and what may happen on the ship.</p>

<p>Just as after the war of Russia, many Russian writers fled in New York; Marx fled in London in the 19th century -the most free city in the world at the time. Why can London be free to Marx?</p>
<p>The answer to this question was a bit accidental. I have been preparing for the exam recently. I applied for the Liberal Democratic Party candidate for the British election next year, and there was a 60 -minute test. The four British people's livelihood issues need to be explained.</p>
<p>This is not easy for me. The Liberal Democratic Party is the third largest party, and its party platform and position have not been in my scope of reporting and analysis. The Conservative Party has been in power for 13 years, so I have written articles about the British government in the past, which is actually the Conservative Party policy; I also know more about the Labor Party (see ["Equal Life of Marx and the British]](https://www.chineseft.com/story/001085440?archive)And ["The Influence of Marxism on Britain, Germany, and Russia"(https://www.chineseft.com/story/001097173?archive)To. At that time, I was willing to enter the Liberal Democratic Party. In addition to being seduced by the candidates, I met the Liberal Democratic Party's target "soft conservative party" standard, that is, to support the Conservative Party, but I was tired of what the Conservative Party did in recent years. So when I joined the party, I only knew that "this is the middle party between the Conservative Party and the Labor Party", but I don't know the specifics. From the test guide, I read the Political Program of the Liberal Democratic Party in 2021 "A more fair, greener, and more caring society". After reading 25 pages, I did not read the southeast and northwest. This title, the difference between the Liberal Democratic Party is only to increase/reduce resource subsidies to disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>In confusion, I started to look for the history of the Liberal Democratic Party. It was discovered that what was free to Marx was the Liberal Party, one of the two major parties in the UK at that time. The party took turns in governance with the Conservative Party during Victori. At that time, the British Labor Party (replaced the Liberal Party in the early 20th century as the British Party) was not born. The Liberal Party is the predecessor of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Marx was unable to get in Germany, and the freedom of remarks and personal freedom enjoyed in London came from the liberalism of Europe at that time; and the first leader in London was the first to lead liberalism. Marx exiled to Britain in 1849 and lived in 34 years until he died in 1883. At that time, France was replaced between the dynasty and the Republic, and the German would be unified into an empire to dominate, and the United States was still in the civil war. Only the United Kingdom has been steadily exercised in the constitutional monarchy's constitutional constitutional system for more than a hundred years. The nobles who are in charge of the actual political rights in the UK have invented the most stunning aristocratic level system, making Britain a "most class" society, but eventually 20 in 20 At the beginning of the century, the altar was beaten by British liberalism. When I went to Britain in 2004, I still thought that Britain was a society ruled by nobles. Now look back at the "Invisible Class: British" Upstream Society "" I wrote in 2017](http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001073461?full=y&amp;archive)There is a problem with the words and sentences in it, because I was still in the question of the general who "nobles really exited the British center stage" at the time.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has never been short of speculation, coexist in various views, and decides the mainstream view with democratic voting. But unlike today, the 19th century was full of changes -the economic method shifted from the noble's land manor system to the industry operated by capitalists; political aspects, noble rights were transferred to civilians little by little, the more people obtained votes. The faster the transfer speed. When the whole people get the right to vote, it is the day that the nobles have lost their rights.</p>
<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries of change, British thinkers and philosophers seemed to be endless, and their reputation has not yet decreased. When the Marx design worker class liberates the whole mankind by violent revolution and breaks the blueprint of national boundaries; liberalism is also in the construction theory. Related well -known theorists include philosopher Johnstuart Mill, Economist Keynes and Economist William Bellych(William Beveridge)Essence Mier also joined the Liberal Party and became a member of the party in Congress (1865-1868). Churchill was also a parliamentarian of the Liberal Party (he transferred to the Conservative Party camp after the decline of the Liberal Party) and wrote "Liberalism and Social Issues" (1909).</p>
<p>In terms of theory, the initial goal of liberalism is to oppose the control of the nobles, the absolute monarchy, and the church's control of the government and society. They believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions and should not be controlled by the government; except for freedom of speech or decision whether to believe in whether they believe in freedom of speech or decide whether to believe in worship In addition to the freedom of religion, people should also have the freedom to have property and use property according to their wishes.</p>
<p>Liberalism continued to evolve, and at the end of the 19th century, "Newliberalism" appeared, and this idea eventually led European countries on the road of welfare. At that time, some liberal writers began to question that if people are poor, healthy, or have not been educated, they can really develop freely according to their wishes. The government should ensure equality and develop a welfare system to provide better health, housing and education. This requires taxes on high -income people, but the government does not interfere with the market itself. From 1906-1914, the British Liberal Government began a welfare country for the first time.</p>
<p>Today, these two basic ideas have been regarded by the British for granted, because British society is a living model that gradually turns liberal theory into practice in argument and elections. The British Liberal Party first opened this pilot in the UK and led the atmosphere. Today's two British Conservative Party and Labor Party have basically accepted the basic ideas and claims set up by the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party developed from the Figgun Party, and the Waig Party originated from a noble faction during the rule of Charles II and the radicals of the early 19th century. The Huig Party agreed to reduce the power of the royal family and increase the power of parliament, although their motivation was originally to fight for more power to give themselves. The more idealized Huig Party gradually began to support the expansion of democracy for democracy. The Reform Act is the climax of the Hugs, but it also brings the perishage of the Wage Party. The middle class obtained the right to vote and entered the House of Commons, which eventually led to the development of the system's middle -class liberalism and the end of the Hugeg party. The official establishment of the Liberal Party (representing the interests of emerging middle class) dates back to Palmerton's second government (1859-1865), and tied with the Conservative Party to the British Party.The Liberal Prime Minister, which is worth mentioning, is David Lloyd George 1863-1945. I have interviewed his great -grandson Dasnow (British historian). He did not be proud of this ancestors, because David George had a scandal in the later period of political career, which made him famous in British history. Great. Moreover, during his administration, the Liberal Party had begun to decline from prosperity, and he later needed to jointly govern with the Conservative Party. This also shows that at that time, the liberal party and the Conservative policy existed in cooperation.</p>
<p>I personally think that because David George's greatest contribution to British politics was that he and the 1909 people's budget advocated by Winston Churchill, who were at the time of the Liberal Party at the time, levied unprecedented taxes to the rich in the UK (this opened The British imposed high tax on the rich), and introduced a radical social welfare plan in national policy; in addition, the bill made the House of House of Lords surrender most of the power, making the House of House from nowhere. The right to delay two years. Therefore, Britain's world -famous two -institution system (the reference version of the two institutions in the founding of the United States during the founding of the United States) was actually the first hospital, because only the House of Losites had real rights.</p>
<p>The facts of the British people participated in the two world wars changed the political structure of Britain, and the people were the ultimate beneficiaries. The Labor Party (representing the interests of workers) will gradually replace the Liberal Party (representing the interests of the middle class) into the British Party. After the end of the First War, the democratic reform of the "People's Representative Law" in 1918 increased the number of people who had the right to vote in the UK to double, from 7 million to 21 million. The Labor Party benefited the most from this huge change in voters. It formed its first minority government in 1924. After World War II, voters abandoned the War Hero Conservative Party leader Churchill and sent the Labor Party to the government with a high voting, which opened a 34 -year social democratic period in British history, namely elections, public ownership, and high welfare society. Since 1945, the personal freedom created by the Liberal Party and the national welfare system have been fully accepted by the Labor Party and the Conservative Party. It is still the basic party idea of the British party.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party has existed for more than 300 years in different forms. In the 19th and early 20th century, it became one of the two leading political parties in the UK with the Conservative Party. After the First World War, it was crowded to the third place by the Labor Party and gradually declined in the remaining time of the 20th century. After the decline, the Liberal Party has not been a climate. Until 1981, the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) established an election alliance, the latter is a group split from the Labor Party. In 1988, the two parties merged and formed the Liberal Democratic Party (Liberal Democratic Party).</p>
<p>If the Liberal Party was once prosperous because it was at the forefront of the times, led social changes with liberalism, created national benefits, and established the cornerstone of the British society today. The social change facing today is the global trade from prosperity to decline, and ideological battles. Severe, social media replaced traditional media, which enlarged personal rights and its influence. Today's predicament is that no matter the Conservative Party, the Labor Party, or the Liberal Democratic Party, there have not yet appear as thinkers who can design future capabilities such as Marx, Mill, Cairns, etc. So much so that the Liberal Democratic Party ’s party’ s Formation Document “A more fair, greener, and more caring society”, which I read in 2021, lacks creativity and new ideas. The difference from the other two major parties is often only different from funding projects and funding. It is difficult to wear the clouds and fog like the Liberal Party of the old ancestor, create new ideas, and lead the era.</p>
<p>The 19th -century London of Marx's life was actually a period of liberalism. At that time, the British universal selection system was far from forming. Democracy was only a patent for nobles and minorities. It was indisputable for capitalists to exploit the people of labor. It is also to fight for equality. Marx and liberals have created two ways. One of the violence (the era of Marx's life, to fight for freedom with violence belongs to justice). Fei Bian (founded in 1994) assisted the Labor Party. In Russia, which influences the influence of liberalism, the violent elements in Marxism have been thoroughly used, creating the first national Soviet Union in history to guide Marxism. Although the Soviet Union had disintegrated, in 2022, its inheritance of Russia continued its military government's violence tradition, and the war of aggression against Ukraine was deeply affected today the world.</p>

<p>Starting from Thursday (June 1) in the United States, the United States stopped providing some data from Russia with some "New Treatment of Strategic Weapon Treaty", including the position of American missiles and launchers to respond to the measure of Moscow's "continuous violations" agreement.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that according to a explanation issued by the official website of the US State Department, the United States will also stop providing remote test information (Telemetry) about intercontinental missiles and submarine ballistic missile launches to Russia.</p>
<p>Remote testing technology refers to the technology of the parameter of the object separated by a certain distance and transmits the measured results to the receiving place.</p>
<p>Russia announced in August 2022 that it temporarily withdrawn from the facilities inspection mechanism of the Newstart Treaty (Newstart ", and announced in February 2023 that the Treaty was suspended.

<p>Russian President Putin has not officially allowed Russia to withdraw from the New Treaty of Strategic Weapons.</p>
<p>The "New Treatment of Strategic Weapons" was signed by Russia and the United States in 2010 and took effect on February 5, 2011, with a validity period of 10 years. On February 3, 2021, Russia and the United States swapped diplomatic photos to complete the relevant internal procedures that extended the effective period of the "New Strategic Weapon Treaty". The validity period of the treaty was subsequently extended to February 5, 2026. After Russia and the United States' "Guide Treaty" failed in 2019, this approach became the only military control treaty between the two countries.</p>

<p>The Office of the United Nations Drugs and Crime issues said on the 2nd that nearly 151 tons of methamphetamine and recorded 27.4 tons of ketamine (also known as "K powder") in Southeast Asia and East Asia last year, which increased by 167 from the number of drugs obtained in 2021 167 %.</p>
<p>The Office of Drugs and Crime issues released the latest report on the condition of synthetic drugs in these two regions, and pointed out that in the past 10 years, the number of methamphetamine in Southeast Asia and East Asia will break the record. The level of the new crown epidemic may have little to do with the reduction in production and supply, but it is related to the conversion of new smuggling routes to the traffickers to avoid investigation or interception.</p>
<p>The Office of the United Nations Drugs and Crime Problems pointed out that in order to avoid investigations, organized criminal groups in the "Golden Triangle](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/18/qa-un-rep-on-opium-boom-in-golden-triangle)"(Refers to a triangular zone in the border areas of Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos, which is basically in a state of no legal supervision) to transfer a large amount of methamphetamine from the region under the military control of central Myanmar to the Andaman Sea. This does not include continuing to continue Smuggling through northern Thailand and Laos.</p>
<p>The Representative of the Office of the United Nations Drug and Crime Office Southeast Asia and the Pacific Region Jerry Douglas(https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/18/qa-un-rep-on-opium-boom-in-golden-triangle)China pointed out that "organized multinational criminal groups can predict, adapt to and try to avoid government actions. In 2022, we see that they are more active near the Thai border in the Golden Triangle than in the past."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-02T09-54-06/image-2-1685698723.jpg" /> 亚洲地区的毒品种植 (news agency)When Douglas used a new route used by the drug trafficking organization and passed through the central Myanmar, "" Few people seem to look at this specific direction. "It should be pointed out that the Burmese military is conducting the more and more military military in the local army. action.</p>
<p>Douglas pointed out in his report that "the supply of central Myanmar itself has also risen significantly, and drug traffickers have begun to quietly transfer drugs to the coastline -these supply is actually transported through the route of Andaman Sea."</p>
<p>Douglas said that the freedom of production and distribution of production and distribution of territorial control, as well as organized criminal groups and locations controlled by armed group partners distributed in the Golden Triangle region, so that these drug manufacturers can "" expand the market and control the market. Increased supply and diversified supply. "</p>
<p>"In other words, the most powerful regional trading network can operate in a high degree to determine that they will not be stopped. Therefore, they can determine the terms and conditions of the market."</p>
<p>According to the Office of the United Nations Drugs and Criminal Issues, although the "Golden Triangle" and Myanmar Bangbang are still the center of synthetic drug production and opium cultivation in the region, some organized criminal groups still protect themselves by establishing new production centers elsewhere elsewhere by establishing new production centers in other places. Risks, and Cambodia is one of them.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that "a series of industrial -level ketamine secret laboratories, processing warehouses and storage facilities were found nationwide in the country, which sounded the alarm for the region and international partners."</p>
<p>The Office of the United Nations Drugs and Crime issues said that South Asia has also more closely integrated into the drug supply market in Southeast Asia. "Blood poison is transported from Myanmar to Bangladesh and enters northeast India, and this frequency is still rising."</p>
<p>The office added that "in the area, the wholesale or street retail prices of methamphetamine remain unchanged in 2022, or fell to the lowest level in history, indicating that the supply of drugs has not been interrupted."</p>
<p>The United Nations agency also pointed out that the regional authorities have also found a large number of goods that mixed methamphetamine and ketamine, which shows that the criminal group is "binding these two drugs to sell to improving the demand for ketamine in the new market."</p>
<p>In a statement, the coordinator of the coordinator of the coordinator of the coordinator of the coordinator of the coordinator of the coordinator of the drug and crime of the United Nations pointed out that "the condition of chlorine in the region reflects in many aspects of the criminal group in the mid-2010-2020 The means of ice poison market.

<p>The latest research report of the German Federal Bank shows that the German Geni coefficient in 2021 decreased slightly compared with ten years ago. However, the gap between the rich and the poor will continue to shrink or expand in the future, and it is difficult to predict.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Federal Bank Report </strong></p>
<p>How rich is the Germans? The poor is still the poor, the richer the rich? In April 2023, the Federal Bank of Germany answered these questions in the research report entitled "The Wealth and Finance of the German Private Family".</p>
<p>According to this study, inequality is decreasing. From 2017 to 2021, everyone became richer, especially those with less wealth.</p>
<p>The co-author of this study Hannah Polk Parumkvitz(Hannah Paule-Paludkiewicz)Point out: "Net wealth has increased." The so -called "net wealth" here refers to deducting negative assets such as debt(For example, mortgage)后的资产。</p>
<p>联邦银行研究中心一个团队开展了这项调研。其结果显示，在德国4100万个家庭中，每个家庭2021年的净资产可能达到31.65万欧元，与上一个调查年份2017年相比，增加了约36%。</p>
<p>此外，德国家庭净资产中位数也大幅上升，从2017年的7.08万欧元上升到2021年的10.66万欧元。几乎比2017年增加了51%。</p>
<p>在上述研究报告中，联邦银行不仅调查了德国私人家庭的现金、持股、保险索赔和私人养老金，而且还研究了不动产所有权和公司股份，并涵盖债务。只有法定养老金不包括在内。因此，这项研究比其他一些有关这个问题的调查更加全面。</p>
<p>所调查的年份是2021年。有4119个家庭接受了调查。这是自2010/11年以来的第四次调查。</p>
<p>研究报告的共同作者托比亚斯•施密特(Tobias Schmidt)Simply pointed out: "It has increased in almost all fields." The first is reflected in assets. Especially the assets of half of the families have a significant increase in assets. One -five -fifth of the family, namely net debtor, can repay its 54%debt. In Germany, inequality is decreasing.</p>
<p>The "Wealth and Finance of German Private Family" also mentioned the wealth Gini coefficients of Germany and other euro countries, which are used to measure the fairness of residents' wealth distribution. The larger the Gini coefficient, the worse the gap between the rich and the poor. For Germany, the coefficient in 2021 was 73%; and 10 years ago, the number was 76%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Schmidt said: "When comparing with other European countries, the phenomenon of inequality is still very serious." He claimed that in the euro zone, only a few countries were more unequal than Germany. Data show that the Gini coefficients in Italy and Portugal are 68%and 66%, respectively, lower than Germany (73%). Of course, Schmidt also pointed out that the degree of inequality in the United States is higher than Germany.</p>
<p><strong> 2. The current situation of the gap between the rich and the poor </strong></p>
<p>According to the above research report, 10%of the richest families in Germany have a net asset of at least 725,900 euros. This group has an average of 1.77 million euros per household, which is usually invested in real estate, company stocks and securities.</p>
<p>In 2021, the richest 10%of the families had 56%of the total German net assets; ten years ago, this ratio reached 59%, so it accounted for a decrease.</p>
<p>In contrast, half of the families at the bottom, that is, all families with less than 106,600 euros, only have about 3%of the total net assets. Schmidt pointed out that this data is almost unchanged.</p>
<p>The World Unemployment Report 2022 released by the World Inequality Laboratory shows that 10%of the richest people in the world have 75%of the world's wealth, while 50%of the lowest population account for only 2%of wealth.</p>
<p>Although Germany's wealth inequality is not so serious, 50%of families have only 3%of the total net asset value, which is also shocking!</p>
<p>According to analysis, most of the richest families in Germany have real estate. Its assets are mostly invested in enterprises.</p>
<p>The research report pointed out that business owners have a significant than average wealth. The average net wealth of these families exceeded 1 million euros, with a median number of 503,600 euros, and about half of the assets directly came from corporate ownership. The average value of such enterprises is about 502,800 euros. The report states that more and more families appear in southern Germany.</p>
<p>In addition, it is worth noting that although the unification of the two and Germany has passed for decades, there are still obvious differences between East and West in Germany as far as family assets.</p>
<p>In 2021, the net assets of medium -digital families in the eastern region were 43,400 euros, while the western region was 127,900 euros.</p>
<p>This means that the absolute value of the difference in net assets in the middle and east -west areas has increased, and it has risen from 69,100 euros to 84,500 euros. However, due to the low starting point of wealth in the eastern region, it increased by 85%, far higher than 38%of the western region.</p>
<p>It is said that this is also in line with the results of the German government's investigation, that is, the living conditions in the eastern and western regions are further converging over time.</p>
<p>In contrast, it is more likely to have cash, survival deposit accounts and fund savings plans than poor families.</p>
<p>According to Schmidt, in recent years, the share of funds and stocks has also increased. Another trend is determined by the federal bank, that is: the number of unable to save families has decreased.</p>
<p>In 2017, 43%of families claimed to be able to deposit regularly. By 2021, this proportion has increased slightly to 46 %. The proportion of families that claim to be unable to save has declined: from 15%in 2017 to 11%today. In 2014, this ratio was still 20%, almost twice the number of numbers now.</p>
<p>Among the 20%of people with less assets, this decline is particularly obvious. In 2014 and 2017, 48%and 41%of the families claimed that they were unable to save. But in 2021, this proportion has dropped to 33%.</p>
<p>According to analysis, during the new crowns, people cannot spend so much money due to strict epidemic prevention measures, so they tend to put some money aside. The family savings rate has risen.</p>
<p>However, the increase in the increase in the number of savings families is the impact of the new crown epidemic or a sustainable development. It is yet to be observed.</p>
<p>In terms of savings, "preparation for the elderly" and "emergency preparation" still dominate. Of course, there have also been small changes.</p>
<p>Compared with 2017, these two reasons are called the most important motivation in 2021. About 32%of the families mentioned that year mentioned the same preparations for the emergency situation, which is the same as in 2014. In 2017, the ratio was 29%.</p>
<p>Of course, this development does not mean that in the process of experiencing the new crown epidemic in 2020 and 2021, German families need to prepare for emergency situations. This is because in the past two years, many families have safely spent the epidemic, and there are no major problems in financial.</p>
<p><strong>3.财富变动趋势</strong></p>
<p>当然，联邦银行上述研究报告所显示的数据还是两年前的。新冠危机已被纳入考虑范围。此外，还考虑到当时轻微的通货膨胀。</p>
<p>但从那时起，物价上涨了，有时甚至急剧上升。欧洲中央银行则通过连续加息来抗击通胀。银行信贷变得更加昂贵。股票市场也下跌了一段时间。所有这些都影响到了资产。联邦银行研究中心负责人法尔科•费希特(Falko Fecht)It is difficult to say that these influences are still difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Of course, at least it has a new figure of all private household financial assets: from the end of 2021 to the end of 2022, it has dropped by 8.2%, mainly stock prices and pension benefits. At the same time, debt is increasing.</p>
<p>And if the stock price falls, this mainly affects those who hold a lot of stocks, and this is often a richer German citizen. On the other hand, for those who have the money to pass the money or open a current deposit account, according to the federal bank, these people are often not rich, and the bank's interest rate hikes benefit them.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that data released by the German Federal Statistics Bureau on April 27 showed that, compared with 2021, German employees' actual salary in 2022 fell 4.0%. This decline greatly exceeded 3.1%of the preliminary prediction before.</p>
<p>It is said that this is the largest decline since the statistics began in 2008, and it was the third consecutive year. Of course, the decline in the first two years of the new crowns was much smaller: in 2020 and 2021, only 1.1%and 0.1%, respectively.</p>
<p>The reason is mainly influenced by Russian and Ukraine's conflict, and Germany's inflation has soared.</p>
<p>In 2022, the price of consumers rose by an average of 6.9%, which greatly exceeded the growth of wages. In other words, although German employees increased their salary last year, the money in their pockets was less than in the past, because the increase in salary growth could not offset the pressure of rising goods and services.</p>
<p>For 2023, many experts expect the actual salary will continue to fall, because the inflation rate is still high. This may once again devour many employees' salary growth</p>
<p>Federal banks say those who are not too rich often have money in the bank. The German TV No. 2 website said on February 7 this year, saying: "There are more money in the bank account, but the purchasing power is lower: due to inflation, the salary in 2022 has obviously depreciated."</p>
<p>In order to fight against inflation, on May 4, 2023, the European Central Bank raised interest rates again of 25 basis points. This is the seventh rate hike since the central bank since July 21, 2022. Key interest rates have now increased to 3.75%.</p>
<p>But the inflation rate is still much higher than the bank interest rate. At present, the German government is expected to be 5.9%this year, and it will not fall to 2.7%until 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, the beneficiary of interest rate hikes is mainly the banking industry, not the store, because they can quickly increase the loan interest rate, not the deposit interest rate. As a result, the money in the banks in the bank is still depreciating, which is also indisputable.</p>
<p>Today, all walks of life have generally reached an agreement to increase wages, and the increase is not small. However, such agreements have increased the risk of wages-price spiral increase, which may continue to enhance inflation pressure. Economists call this phenomenon "the second round effect".</p>
<p>The federal bank mentioned in the monthly report of this year that the rise in wages will further promote the rise. Experts wrote: "It is foreseeable that the second round of effects will have a significant impact on the price."</p>
<p>The rise in the price has brought an incomparable burden to those who do not have much money, and the remaining money has become less, and they have to take out the deposit.</p>
<p>It can be seen that German society is facing severe challenges, and wealth distribution is also changing. Although the German Gini coefficient in 2021(73%)With ten years ago(76%)Compared with a slight decrease, as mentioned above, compared with other European countries, it is still quite high.</p>
<p>In the next few years, whether the gap between the rich and the poor continues to shrink, or it will be expanded, it is unknown. However, according to data released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics on May 16, a total of 17.3 million people in Germany in 2022(Equivalent to 20.9% of the total population)Facing the risk of poverty or being excluded by society.</p>
<p>Once the rich with real estate and capital is becoming richer and richer, while the actual salary of the working class has continued to shrink, and its bank deposits continue to depreciate, then the phenomenon of "the richer the rich, the more poor the poor" will occur. Essence</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Federal Bank will investigate the wealth and financial status of German families in 2024, and then people will get more accurate information.</p>

<h1>Why is it difficult to "thaw" in the short term of US -China relations in the short term?</h1>

<p>Description: Despite returning to the negotiating table on some issues, the Chinese government's attitude is getting harder. Beijing expressed doubts about Washington's sincerity, adopted measures to fight back to the US technical export control, and also asked to cancel sanctions against Chinese officials. Manish Swarup/Associated Press Beijing rejected the invitation of the United States Minister of Defense Li Shangfu and US Secretary of Defense Louger at the Singapore Security Forum this weekend.</p>

Prior to this, China and the United States complained about each other and stopped high -level contact for several months, which caused people to worry about the risk of conflict -whether the conflict was due to accidents or other reasons.</p>
<p>The earliest US National Security Consultant Sarawan met with Wang Yi, the highest diplomat in Vienna in May this year. Then the first cabinet -level talks of the highest business officials in the two countries in Washington for several months. The Chinese Ambassador to the United States also arrived in Washington last week, and finally filled the positions that had been vacant since January this year.</p>
<p>However, while Beijing returned to the negotiating table on some issues, the Chinese government also came up with a more tough attitude, allowing President Biden President Biden to predict the US -China relations last month "<a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230523/biden-china-g7/">Trust</a>"It becomes more complicated. China’s sincerity of Washington <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/fyrbt_673021/jzhsl_673025/202305/t20230522_11081384.shtml">Expressing doubt</a>, And adopted its own restrictions to fight back to the US technical export control, and also required the United States to cancel sanctions against Chinese officials.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said this week that Beijing rejected the invitation of the United States Minister of Defense Li Shangfu and US Secretary of Defense Louger Austin at the Singapore Security Conference this weekend. Last Friday, a Chinese fighter was approaching an American reconnaissance aircraft over the South China Sea. It passed directly from the head of the US aircraft. The U.S. military described this operation as "no need to fight."</p>

<p>"China often regards senior leaders who contact it as a reward for obedience, rather than creating a tool for stable or solving differences," Tang An Zhu, who once served as an official in China in the United States(DrewThompson)说，他现在是新加坡国立大学李光耀公共政策学院的研究员。“想安排见面，就必须接受中国的条件。”</p>
<p>五角大楼称，中国拒绝让两国防长本周在新加坡举行的香格里拉对话会上见面，是北京不愿就军事问题进行接触的一个“令人担忧的”例子。李书福今年3月出任国防部长，自2018年以来，他因为从俄罗斯购买军事装备而一直受到美方制裁。五角大楼官员表示，这些制裁并不妨碍李书福与奥斯汀会晤。</p>
<p>但中国认为，制裁中国官员有碍两国关系的改善。中国外交部发言人毛宁称，华盛顿应该解除对李书福的制裁，“为中美两军对话沟通创造必要的氛围和条件”。她周二重申了中国的立场，如果华盛顿想恢复两军对话，就应该“立即纠正错误做法”。</p>
<p>上海复旦大学国际关系学教授沈丁立表示，中国不想在其认为有失尊严的情况下与美国官员见面。</p>

Bynden, 80, stood up with the help of others and looked back quickly.</p>
<p>The video of Biden fell on the social media. He seemed to be stumbled, then kneeling on the ground, and his hands supported on the podium floor. Subsequently, he was lifted up by several Air Force officials and agents of the Special Service and walked back to his seat.</p>
<p>Prior to the issuance of a graduation certificate, Biden delivered a vibrant speech to the Air Force graduates. He fell after issuing his last graduation certificate and was brought back to his seat.</p>
<p>"He is good," the White House Communication Director Benrabord said on Twitter on Thursday afternoon. "When he shook hands, there was a sandbag on the stage."</p>
<p>For the president, it is not uncommon for embarrassing moments, and they spend most of the time in front of the camera during the term of office. President Gerald Ford was played by comedians many times during his presidential trip.</p>
<p>The same is true of President Trump. The day before his 74th birthday in 2020, when he stepped down from the podium after the graduation ceremony of the West Point Military Academy, his pace was slow and stagnant, which also caused the online guessing of its health.</p>
<p>Biden is the oldest president in the United States so far. He still hopes that voters will support him to be re -elected until the age of 86. For him, the fall at the graduation ceremony on Thursday may increase his questioning of his physical condition.</p>
<p>Doctors of the White House admitted that with the age of age, Biden's gait was obviously stiff, and walking is slower and more unstable. He used to fall in the past: In February this year, he stumbled when he left Warsaw ascending the "Air Force One", but supported himself with his hands.</p>
<p>Republicans seized Thursday's incident as evidence that Biden was not suitable for public office. Some people used spoof pictures or videos to express their views online.</p>
<p>But including many of his staff, people who have close relationships with Biden insist that he is still very healthy, even in a long and difficult time, he is often energetic. They said that he exercised every day without heavy weights.</p>
<p>Biden himself acknowledged that questions about his age are reasonable. Before triples on Thursday, he added a joke about his age in his speech to his graduate.</p>
<p>"300 years ago, when I graduated from high school, I applied for the Naval Academy," his speech caused a laugh.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary Karin Pillr was with Biden to return to Washington in Washington, from Colorado, and told reporters that the president felt that his body was "completely fine."</p>
<p>After returning to Washington, Biden looked good. After hitting the aircraft door frame, he talked to the reporter about the fall of this fall outside the White House, saying that he was "blocked by a sandbag", and he jumped out of the siege, but was surrounded again.</p>

<h3>China -made large aircraft C919: Can you copy the success of the high -speed rail?</h3>
<p>10:07 am on June 2, 2023 [VIDEO-Link:/WS/AV-Embeds/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/Business-65787318/P0FR1K02/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/business-65787318/p0fr1k02/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-02T10-07-31.000Z/p0fr1nhq.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>China ’s first domestic passenger aircraft C919 first sailed on May 28. Nearly 130 passengers took a flight from Shanghai Hongqiao Airport to Beijing Capital Airport from Shanghai Hongqiao Airport to Beijing Capital Airport.</p>
<p><strong> On May 28, China ’s first domestic large aircraft C919 successfully achieved its first commercial flight and flew from Shanghai to Beijing. This aircraft was manufactured by the state -owned COMAC (Comac), from 2007 to its first commercial sailing in 2023, which lasted for 15 years. </strong></p>
<p>China hopes that this plane will break the monopoly between Boeing and Airbus, and will share a share in the trillion -level aviation market. Even the success of the Chinese high -speed railway -2004 high -speed railway items to 2018, 38,000 kilometers in 14 years, accounting for 70 % of the global high -speed rail mileage, and became the "business card" made by China's high -end manufacturing, and began to output.</p>
<p>However, the large aircraft is different from the high -speed rail. The latter through technical transfer, digestion, and upgrading through technical transfer, digestion and upgrading in just three or four years, key components such as large aircraft engines are still dependent on Europe and the United States. It is believed that under the increasingly tense geopolitical pattern, it is always in danger of the technology "card neck" at any time.</p>
<p>BBC sort out information, interviews experts, analyzes the unique advantages and disadvantages of China's large aircraft, and tries to answer a question -Can Chinese aircraft replicate the success of the high -speed rail?</p>
<h3>What is C919?</h3>
<p>In 2007, the Chinese government established large aircraft and formed the "COMAC" company. Three years later (October 2010), the new company with a state -owned assets submitted the C919 model qualification certificate application to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The aircraft officially entered the public sight for the first time.</p>
<p>After only five years of R &amp; D and manufacturing, in November 2015, the first aircraft of C919 was launched, but at this time, the real development was earlier -the aircraft originally scheduled to be delivered in 2016 was extended due to various problems due to various problems. Later, it did not succeed in the first flight until May 2017.</p>
<p>After the successful flight, the C919 entered the test flight and verification stage. It took five years. By September 29, 2022, the model qualification certificate was obtained, which proved that the design of the C919 was met. , Six of them participating in test flight subjects participating in power, performance, control, and two tests participating in static tests, fatigue tests and other tests.</p>
<p>At the end of 2022, COMAC officially delivered the first C919 to China Oriental Airlines. Five months later, C919 flew from Shanghai to Beijing and opened its first flight. From May 29th, the C919 will take MU9197 as the flight number, traveling between Shanghai Hongqiao Airport and Chengdu Tianfu Airport daily.</p>
<p>C919 is not the first show of the Chinese Shangfei aircraft. According to the official statement, the development route of China's civil aviation industry is three steps -branch aircraft, single -channel trunk aircraft, and dual -channel large -scale trunk aircraft.</p>
<p>Among them, the first step is the smaller ARJ21 line passenger plane. It was put into operation in 2015 and deployed more than 200 routes in China.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-64248228">How far is the Boeing Huali Hasing Passenger Airlines nearly clear China ’s domestic C919 from the road of aviation hegemony? </a></p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>China C919.</p>
<p>The C919 is a step in the middle, that is, a single channel trunk aircraft. It is also a large passenger aircraft developed in accordance with the international aircraft standard at the beginning of the design. The longest range is about 5,500 kilometers. There are 158 to 168 seats in the cabin. A single channel is divided into both sides, 3 on each side.</p>
<h3>Advantage —— "Unified Market"</h3>
<p>The special feature of the C919 is that its design is the best -selling airline A320 and Boeing 737, and this type of model is the best -selling, accounting for nearly 80 % of the two companies' delivery. Among this best -selling model, China is the largest buyer -China's airline orders account for about a quarter of market demand.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in China, airlines are completely state -owned. There are more than 60 passenger airlines operating in China. All private capitals or holdings are 9, such as spring and autumn, auspiciousness, and Huaxia. Southern Airlines occupied half of the Chinese market.</p>
<p>In addition, when airlines introduced aircraft, about half of them were not purchased directly, but through aircraft leasing. Several of China's largest aircraft leasing companies, such as ICBC Leasing, Traffic Bank Financial Leasing, Guobi Airlines, AVIC International Leasing, and International Leasing, and International Leasing,, International Leasing, International Leasing, International Leasing, International Leasing, International Leasing, and International Leasing of AVIC. Recruitment of Bank of Financial Leasing, as well as Chinese aircraft leasing in Hong Kong, all have the background of state -owned or state -owned commercial banks.</p>
<p>Similar situations also appeared during the development of high -speed rail. Under the leadership of state -owned assets, the power of "the hands of policies" is stronger than the "hand of the market."</p>
<p>"China Railway Economy Strategy" author Xie Xiaowen said in the book that China's "unified" management model has a natural institutional advantage for better construction and development of high -speed railways.</p>
<p>Xie Xiaowen believes that the management model of "unification" is the national management model of "unification" on the one hand, and on the other hand, the "unified" railway management model. For China, both. Under this model, we can maximize and maximize the advantages of people's property, and to develop national infrastructure in huge quantitative and efficiently.</p>
<p>He also cited an example that the construction process of the 109 -kilometer HS1 railway in the UK involved a series of problems such as land acquisition, public consultation, and environmental protection, which took 16 years; the United States passed the California high -speed rail construction expenses in 2008 and 10 years. , Still in the research budget stage.</p>
<p>An industry insider who has worked in a Chinese aviation industry related company and is currently engaged in independent research summarizes the BBC in Chinese that the biggest advantage of the C919 is not cheap, nor technology advanced, but it is produced by China because China is the world in the world. The market with the largest demand, C919 is the most demand model, and the main body of this market is "national character".</p>

<h3>需求——“中美脱钩”的催化</h3>
<p>从2018年中美贸易战开始，中国和西方国家的对立愈发严重，这种对立集中体现在芯片行业——美国不仅自身禁止向中国销售高端芯片和制造设备，还联合日本和荷兰，共同完成对中国的芯片及制造设备的联合禁运。</p>
<p>对于完全依赖波音和空客两个欧美巨头的大飞机市场，这种类似的“脱钩”已然发生。</p>

<p>In September 2019, after Boeing 737mAX was banned by the US Air Administration of FAA, the 737 MAX of airlines from various countries in Grant County, Washington, Washington, Washington. (Information picture)</p>
<p>Last year, the Boeing Company of the United States announced a total of 480 aircraft in 2022. Compared with its largest competitors Airbus, the largest competitor Airbus delivered a total of 661 aircraft. The gap between the two is mainly reflected in the Chinese market. Last year, Boeing delivered eight planes to China, while Airbus delivered more than 100.</p>
<p>In October last year, Boeing said that there are currently 138 other aircraft manufactured by Chinese airlines waiting to be delivered in the United States. However, in view of the fact that Chinese airlines will accept these planes in the short term, Boeing has begun to resold these aircraft to sell them to soldiers to soldiers to Other airlines. Boeing CEO DaveCalhouse said that he hopes to deliver more aircraft in China in the end, but "it is really difficult to find a signal, indicating that the situation in China will change and move towards (benefit) Our direction development. "</p>
<p>However, contrary to the logic of "decoupling" on the chip, the large aircraft, as the "Pearl on the Crown" as the industrial system, has a high value -added, obvious prying for the economy. China chooses to buy less Boeing, while producing its own large aircraft, and more more than more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more. Multi -consideration is the need for domestic economic transformation and upgrading.</p>
<p>In May 2005, then the then Chinese Minister of Commerce Bo Xilai stated at a conference in Paris, France that "China only sells 800 million shirts to import a Airbus A380." At that time, the two backgrounds were: a large number of Chinese textiles entered the European Union, causing the latter to panic; just a week ago, Airbus's A380 was successful.</p>
<p>Although Bo Xilai was dismissed in the political struggle seven years later, his words have been widely circulated for many years since then, attracting the shame of "Made in China". Regardless of whether it is C919 in 2017 or delivered in 2022, Chinese media often say that "the" 800 million shirts to change a plane 'will become history "in reporting, and there are many official media in China.</p>
<p>According to Corporate's own outlook, in the next 20 years, C919, a single -channel jet passenger aircraft, has a market space of 10 trillion yuan in China, and the global market is 4.4 times that of the Chinese market size.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned industry insiders said that China is now engaged in "abandoning the United States and Europe" in aircraft procurement. In fact, the order is finally returned to Europe and the United States, but C919 can be used to seize the domestic market of 10 trillion yuan in ten years. Till trillion international markets, and "more chips on negotiating tables."</p>

<p>On May 28, China's C919 took off from Shanghai and opened its first commercial flight.</p>
<h3>Lack -the engine is still made in Europe and the United States</h3>
<p>SKIP PODCAST and Continue Reading <strong> Podcast </strong><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-02T10-07-31.000Z/p02h1mg5.jpg" /><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/podcasts/p02pc9xp">BBC current affairs one week newsweek(Cantonese)  </a>BBC International Taiwan Cantonese Program, revisit international events, news on both sides of the strait, and the situation in Britain. There are special sections: "Reporter Lai Hong", "British Life" and "Chinese Talking about the World".</p>
<p>separation</p>
<p>End of podcast</p>
<p>In the celebration of C919's first flight, the biggest questioning is that China has "created an aircraft shell and has no core technology."</p>
<p>This is aimed at the engine used by the C919. Specifically, it is the Leap-X1C turbofan engine jointly developed by the United States Ge Aviation and the French Safran AirCraftenne. It belongs to the same series as A320.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned industry insiders said that this is not completely right, because even if the engine comes from Europe and the United States, there are still many parts with high difficulty and high technology content. For example Sexual; for example, a large number of controls such as control and avionics in the control system are very difficult and need to be tested one by one; even in the materials, China has made new gras in pottery aluminum materials, which is better than the materials used in Europe and the United States. Essence</p>
<p>"Although the localization rate is 60%, the entire aircraft of the C919 is still very strong, otherwise the Japanese industrial capacity, science and technology level, and the relationship with European and American countries will not fail to test the large water aircraft several times." The above People said.</p>
<p>However, C919 always needs to rely on Europe and the United States on the engine with the highest technical content and the most difficulty. This has been mentioned again that China has frequently faced the "stuck neck" problem that China has frequently faced in the past.</p>
<p>In fact, this concern has become a reality to a certain extent. When Trump was the president of the United States, he considered prohibiting exporting the Leap engine to China in 2020. Although the ban failed to take effect in the end, the current export permit of General Corporation was only 2025, and it was still a problem to continue exporting.</p>
<p>Chen Gong, the founder of Anbang Think Tank, said that it is difficult for large commercial passenger aircraft to produce all parts and components alone, and this industry has not occurred. Even today’s Airbus, Boeing, and Macao in the past They are all manufactured by outsourcing. The close cooperation is the basic form of the aviation manufacturing industry. This will not change because of the C919 to heaven. For a long time, Chinese passenger planes still need to rely on foreign manufacturers' products. This is a normal phenomenon and a normal production method.</p>
<p>After the United States included China COMAC in the "physical list" restricted to export in January 2021, it deleted it from the list five months later, confirming Chen Gong's point of view to a certain extent.The subtext is that even if the U.S. government does not find faults, it is difficult to accept the intellectual property rights of existing companies during the C919 localization process.</p>
<p>Similar situations also occur during the construction of the Chinese high -speed rail. For example, Japan ’s Kawasaki Heavy Industry has stated that if the content of China's high -speed rail applied for patents overseas with China and Chuanzaki Heavy Industry’ s contract on the export of Shinkansen's technology exports will be considered, and a lawsuit will be considered in infringement of China ’s high -speed rail.</p>
<p>"This can also reflect the biggest difference between high -speed rail and large aircraft. The high -speed rail is the main method of transportation in China, and the large aircraft is the main international transportation method. In China, how to build it, but the aircraft flying abroad has to worry about international traffic. Standards, rules and systems, "said the industry.</p>

<p>C919 successfully landed in Beijing and enjoyed the highest courtesy "water gate" in the aviation industry.</p>
<h3>Key -the confidence of the brand's establishment</h3>
<p>Experts believe that the current C919 is far from challenging Boeing and Airbus. The C919 comparison Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 series passenger aircraft have no advantages in terms of aerodynamics, energy consumption and maintenance. The longest flight mileage is only more than 5,500 kilometers, shorter than 6,900 kilometers of A320neo and 737max.</p>
<p>C919 has only price advantages. Eastern Airlines disclosed that the price of C919 was 99 million US dollars, and the price of Airbus and Boeing was about $ 110 million and about $ 120 million.</p>
<p>However, the price difference of 10%-20%is far from making up for the lack of C919. Markuskeiper said that the biggest challenge of COMAC may be its brand. If Airbus and Boeing have an ultimate advantage, it is a brand that they can recognize after 50 and 100 years of development.</p>
<p>The confidence brought by this brand is the huge global maintenance system that runs and maintains 12,000 aircraft behind it. Kaip believes that there is no brand image outside China outside China, and it takes decades to establish positive brand cognition and loyalty. If the Chinese Commercial Flying strategically chooses price competition, it will be considered cheap, which is not desirable in the aviation industry. To obtain a sense of advanced through design, security, service, customization and innovation, a large amount of investment and cost will be required.</p>
<p>So, where is the future of a large domestic aircraft?</p>
<p>Looking back at history, the only "century -old store" in the field of commercial large aircraft is Boeing. The company established in 1916 is nearly 90%of the market share in half a century.</p>
<p>Until 1970, many European countries formed an air passenger car company, and there was only one task: defeating Boeing. At that time, Boeing's market share was 87%.</p>
<p>After nearly half a century, 47 years later, Airbus finally exceeded 50%of the market share in 2017, and in the following four years, it led the delivery of Boeing.</p>

<p>Photos photos of the first aircraft of the C919 passenger aircraft in Pudong base in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After the emergence of COMAC, how often can this "double -headed monopoly" market become a "three -point world"?</p>
<p>Reuters quoted industry analysts that in the face of the monopoly position of Boeing and Airbus, it would take ten years to want to challenge them practically. During the period, it is also necessary to build a stable maintenance system from scratch to improve the training of maintenance personnel, management system, and aviation material guarantee system.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned industry insiders have further stated that if China wants to achieve the "three -point world" in the field of large aircraft in the field of large aircraft, China also needs nearly half a century. It has been more than ten years since the establishment of the COSCO to the present, and it will take 30 years in the future:</p>
<p>In the first ten years, C919 needs to maintain a record of safe sailing and successfully deliver domestic orders. As long as it is successful in the Chinese market and Boeing and Airbus, it is successful.</p>
<p>In the second ten years, on the next generation or the next generation of large planes, increase the localization rate, and install the domestic "Yangtze River -1000A engine", which significantly reduces the price. Global operation and maintenance system.</p>
<p>The third decade is the process of gradually rising global delivery, and eventually reached the situation with Airbus and Boeing's "three -pointers world".</p>
<p>What I have to mention is that any safety accident will disrupt this process. Chen Gong proposed his own concerns. He believes that some "satellites" and "Great Leap Forward" in C919 have seen in the C919. For example, at the beginning of this year, the flight was terminated due to the engine failure. Hidden danger? How high is the safety coefficient of C919? This is a deeply confusing thing.</p>
<p>Similar problems have occurred during the progress of high -speed rail construction. The rear -end accident of the Yingtaiwen Railway train that occurred in 2011 has allowed the national high -speed rail to reduce speed and stop construction for many years. The above -mentioned industry insiders said, "This is what I said for thirty years, and the process of confidence can only be rely on time, and others are not good."</p>

"We thank Taiwan's partners for helping us achieve this important milestone and look forward to negotiating negotiations on the negotiation tasks of the proposal in the negotiation task of the proposal."</p>
<p>Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen said that the "Taiwan -American 21st Century Trade Initiative" is the most complete trade agreement between Taiwan and the United States since 1979. "In addition to being an important milestone of Taiwan -US economic and trade relations, this will also take a key step for Taiwan and major trade countries."</p>
<p>According to the press release issued by the Economic and Trade Negotiation Office of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, the first batch of agreements include five issues including Customs Administrative and Trade, good legal operations, domestic rules and regulations, anti -corruption, and small and medium -sized enterprises. The topic of the project is negotiated, including labor, environment, agriculture, digital trade, standards, state -owned undertakings, non -market policies and practices.</p>
<p>The office pointed out that the completion of these issues one after another will help promote fair market competition, information transparency, reduce corporate transaction costs, and bring more development opportunities and substantial benefits to SMEs. "More importantly, this agreement has laid a complete and solid legal foundation for Taiwan -US economic and trade exchanges. Free trade agreement".</p>
<p>In May 2022, US President Biden announced in Japan that it launched the "Indo -Pacific Economic Framework" (IPEF). The first batch of members did not include Taiwan. However, Dai Qi, a US trading representative, said in an interview with Japanese media that in addition to the Trade and Investment Formation Agreement (TIFA), the United States also launched a new bilateral consultation with Taiwan. In June of the same year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美21世紀貿易倡議啟動談判-專家走向fta第一步/a-62845314">Taiwan and the United States announced the launch of the "21st Century Trade Initiative" negotiation process</a> 。</p>

<p>Mao Ning said: "The so -called 'initiative' is just the guise of the United States under the guise of economic and trade cooperation. The personal interests of the enterprise, the "investment name" of the "harm Taiwan '' '; is the latest example of the United States blurring and hollowing out a Chinese principle."</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the United States to "abide by a Chinese principle and the three joint communiqué regulations of China and the United States, immediately change the string more, stop the official exchanges of any form of developing with Taiwan, stop promoting and immediately revoke the so -called 'initiative' and 'agreement' 'The split forces send any error signals, otherwise the consequences of this must be completely borne by the United States.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-02T10-21-46/1-1685700066.png" />Russian President Vladimir Putin (Middle) visited the Russian Defense Control Center in Moscow, Russia in 2018 to supervise the test of a new Russian hypersonic missile system named "Pioneer". This system can carry nuclear warheads and conventional warheads (Reuters).</p>
<p>A famous Russian scientist participating in the country's hypersonic missile program was tried under strict confidentiality under strict confidentiality. At the same time, the health of the elderly defendant was worrying.</p>
<p>Anatoli Maslov(Anatoly Maslov)The trial was opened in St. Petersburg on Thursday. This is the first case of three hypersonic missile scientists working in a research institute in New Siberia, Siberia. They are now facing the so -called "very serious charges" of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>The St. Petersburg Court stated that the trial was marked as "secret" and was not open to the media and the public. It was unable to contact Maslov's lawyers to comment on the start of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>A source of a 76 -year -old Maruslov told Reuters that the missile scientist has been arrested and hospitalized twice since he was arrested in New Siberia last June.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-02T10-21-46/1-1685700110.jpg" />For the first time from a submarine to test the hypersonic cruise missile from a submarine</p>
<p>Sources said that the doctor of the pre -trial detention center did not let Maslov get all the drugs prescribed by his normal doctor, and added: "He persisted, but of course, his condition is not very good." Unable to independently verify allegations of refusing to provide drugs.</p>
<p>Maruslov is a professor and researcher at the Institute of theory and Applied Mechanics, one of the top scientific centers of Russia.</p>
<p>The three defendants are all supersonic experts -this field is critical to the development of Russian next -generation missiles and can fly quickly with 10 times.</p>
<p>Colleagues of the Christian Nonovich Research Institute issued an open letter on May 15, supporting three scientists in prison, proved that they were innocent and patriotic, and pointed out that the defendant avoided the possibility of engaging in high salaries overseas overseas. Sexuality is committed to "serving Russian science."</p>
<p>According to the translation content of this letter, "we know that each of them is a patriot and a decent person, and they are not able to do investigating the authorities suspect what they do."</p>
<p>The signer of this letter said, "In this case, we are not only worried about the fate of our colleagues, but we just don't understand how to continue our work," and pointed out that they are afraid of being accused of criminals just because of the work of scientists. There is a crime of betrayal.</p>
<p>"We get a reward today and set an example for others, and tomorrow will become a reason for criminal prosecution."</p>
<p>The details of the three people are confidential, but their scientific city portal said that Maslov was suspected of leaking secrets to China.</p>

<p>Sources said that Maslov insisted that he was innocent and "he didn't think he was a traitor, and he believed that he always did everything correctly."</p>
<p>Shortly after the arrest, Maslov was sent to the Lelelovo prison in Moscow, which was the place of the first KGG interrogation and was transferred to St. Petersburg for trial.</p>
<p>In April, the Russian Parliament decided to increase the maximum punishment of the montioplasm from 20 years to life imprisonment.</p>

<p>Description: On the evening of June 1, the Swiss National House of Representatives rejected a bill that designed to allow third countries to sell Swiss arms materials to Ukraine. Since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, it has launched fierce debate around whether it should abide by whether it should abide by neutrality. After the bill was rejected, Germany, Denmark and other countries were unable to transport Swiss arms to Ukraine.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) According to the current permanent Chinese legislature in Switzerland, the arms produced by Switzerland must not be transported to areas where armed conflicts are occurring; only when the UN Security Council decides to condemn Russia to invade Ukraine, the Swiss government is allowed to use exception clauses The third country is allowed to transport the arms materials made of Switzerland to the Ukrainian theater. However, in view of Russia's rejection of the Security Council, this situation is almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Swiss National House of Representatives voted for only 75 votes to support the revised new bill of legislation. 98 votes against the bill allowed the third country to transfer Swiss arms to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Many years ago, Germany had purchased a group of armored vehicles and ammunition used by tanks. However, when Germany provided armored vehicles and tanks to Ukraine, it was limited by the Swiss Chinese Liberal Military Bill and was not allowed to supply Swiss -made <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/乌克兰需要迅速得到西方武器包括弹药/a-64756246">ammunition</a>Essence Similar applications submitted to Switzerland by Denmark, Spain and other countries have also been rejected for the same reason.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T10-23-00Z/61606505_401.jpg" />Germany provides self -produced cheetah air defense tanks to Ukraine, but it cannot provide supporting Swiss ammunition</p>
<p>The controversy of all sectors of Switzerland surrounding the Chinese Legislative Council is still continuing. Those who support the amendment of the legislative case believe that they must increase their support for Ukraine and make greater contributions to Europe's security. Opponents believe that this move will damage Switzerland's internationally neutral position and will also lead to the country's excessive approach to NATO.</p>
<p>At the same time, Switzerland was also suffering from increasing international pressure. NATO and governments of the European Union are pressured. They believe that not supporting Ukraine is to condone invaders and try to make Switzerland softening. Many Western countries have also accused Switzerland that objectively becomes an oligopo -hasn of Russia, which also makes Switzerland worry about its international image.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T10-23-00Z/64873177_401.jpg" />Switzerland also purchased the German "Leopard 2" main battle tank. Now Germany seek to repurchase 25 tanks sealed by Switzerland</p>
<p>The Swiss National House of House of Representatives' veto bill will not calm down whether it is allowed to transport arms to Ukraine. In another case, Rhein Metal Group, a manufacturer of the German "Leopard 2" main battle tank, is seeking to repurchase 25 tanks sealed by Switzerland. Although the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense stated that although these tanks will not be transferred to Ukraine, they are used to fill the vacancies left after the national tank aid Ukraine. The Swiss government has recently stated that this approach is not to transport the arms made from Switzerland to Ukraine, so it does not damage the legislative case.</p>
<p>However, this "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瑞士拒绝他国将瑞士产弹药转运乌克兰/a-64936059">indirect assistance in Ukraine</a>"The approach is also facing a lot of obstacles: Parliament first needs to approve the seal tank to withdraw from the active service, and then the government can start the sale process. According to the plan, the Swiss National House will begin discussing the case in mid -June. ) It will discuss the case in autumn. Some of the members of the hospital have expressed their opposition: indirect assistance will also damage the neutral position of Switzerland. In view of the current international security situation, Switzerland is likely to need this batch of sealed tanks.(Germany's New News Agency, South Germany will report, etc.)</p>

<p>高频经济公司(High Frequency Economics)首席美国经济学家法鲁奇(RubeelaFarooqi)表示：「数据展现美国就业持续以快速步伐成长，但薪资上涨压力并未不断增加。」</p>

<p>法鲁奇指出，美国5月新增就业人口虽然远远超越分析师预估，但薪资数据仍可能让联准会有空间维持货币政策不变。</p>
<p>美国央行决策官员将在本月中旬召开会议。一些高阶官员本周已释出讯息，表示这次可能支持暂停升息一次。</p>

<h1>C919's first COSCO: China's aviation industry welcomes milestones, challenges still exist</h1>

<p>Description: At present, the only C919 aircraft for commercial flights completed passenger flight from Shanghai to Beijing on Sunday. Industry experts said that Chinese aircraft manufacturing seriously relies on Western suppliers, and it takes a long time to meet domestic needs. Age France-Presse-Getty Images Sunday, China's first domestic large-scale passenger aircraft C919 completed the first commercial flight from Shanghai to Beijing.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-02T10-51-40-08-00/01CHINA-PLANE-mbtw-master1050.jpg" />China takes a million flights every year, and the aircraft used are almost made by Boeing and Airbus, the world's leading aircraft manufacturers. For many years, China has been working hard to change this situation. Now, China celebrates this pursuit of the new milestone: the first large passenger aircraft made by China flight for the first time.</p>
<p>According to Chinese official media reports, the C919 passenger plane of China Oriental Airlines transported about 130 passengers from Shanghai to Beijing on Sunday. This aircraft was manufactured by Chinese state -owned aviation manufacturers -China Commercial Aircraft Corporation. It is currently the only C919 aircraft for commercial flight.</p>
<p>COMAC was founded in 2008. The company is headquartered in Shanghai, which is closely related to the China Aviation Industry Group, which is a turboprop, a fighter, and bomber manufacturing for China. C919 is a narrow -bodied aircraft, benchmarking Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.</p>
<p>Aviation experts said China faces fierce competition from Boeing and Airbus from the United States. Airbus is a European company controlled by France, Germany and other countries. These two companies have been dominated by global aircraft sales for many years.</p>
<p>Boeing CEO Dave Calkhorn this week in the Boeing Factory in North Callen, South Carolina, told reporters that C919 is a "good plane" and will eventually meet the needs of China, but he said that China must establish enough enough enoughness The production capacity to meet these needs also needs to be "long for a long time."</p>

<p>Karkhorn's speech is located in a room that can overlook several Boeing 787 dual -channel aircraft. Customers of these aircraft come from all over the world, including China ’s flag airline China International Airlines. He said that he believed that the C919 of China COSCO could eventually meet the needs of Chinese flights in China. He believes that the global market can accommodate the third large manufacturer.</p>
<p>"Three suppliers should not be the most terrible thoughts in the world in such a global market with a volume and scale."</p>
<p>China is still an important market for Boeing and Airbus.</p>
<p>According to data from aviation data provider Cirium, last year, about 42%of China's regular domestic flights used Boeing planes and 54%of Airbus aircraft.</p>
<p>Airbus entered the Chinese aviation market in 1985. The company said in April this year that it will build a second -loading line in a factory in China and get green lights that promote 160 aircraft orders. The company currently has about 2100 aircraft in China.</p>
<p>As for Boeing, in the past 20 years, the company has delivered about 10,000 planes worldwide, of which nearly 14%are delivered to Chinese customers.</p>
<p>In recent years, Boeing's sales in China have been affected. In January of this year, Boeing 737max's commercial flight resumed flights in China. Earlier, the model has been resumed and used around the world (including the United States) for about two years -about four years ago, two crash accidents occurred in Boeing 737max, causing 346 people to die, so it was banned worldwide.</p>

For many years, Airbus has been the main supplier of Chinese aircraft. Carlos Garciawlins/Reuters</p>
<p>Karkhorn said that with the strict epidemic restrictions of the Chinese economy, more and more Chinese people have begun to resume and Boeing will support China. However, he said that the repeated tension between China and the United States means that the progress of the relationship between Boeing and China will "rise and fall". He also said that in any case, Boeing will have a lot of business.</p>
<p>"What will happen without Chinese life? It turns out that life is not a problem. This is not what we want, but there is no problem," he said.</p>
<p>"We should focus on existing competition and strive to win this technical competition. While we do this, no matter what China does, we must maintain our status in the industry," he also said.</p>
<p>C919 manufactured by COMAC relies heavily on suppliers in the United States and Europe, including engines and many components that provide drivers and controls for aircraft. The company has stated that the final planned production is 150 C919, but analysts are suspicious of the production capacity of COMAC, especially after the production of the aircraft has been postponed for many years.</p>
<p>C919 has not yet obtained international airworthiness certification, but over time, it can meet China's domestic demand for the increasing demand for single -channel aircraft. Ruisu(Cirium)Analyst Xie Haowen said that by 2030, China is expected to need about 4,800 single -channel aircraft like C919 for regional travel.</p>
<p>He said that if the company can increase the output of C919, COMAC may become a popular choice for Chinese airlines and get a share in the market, but it will still lag behind Boeing and Airbus.</p>

June 4th case diagram <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/kw-06012023130017.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaODao/renquanfazhi/kw-0601202317.html/@stream</a>June 4 this year is the 34th anniversary of the "June 4th" Tiananmen slaughter in 1989. Just last year, the severe "clearance" policy of the Chinese authorities caused the "white paper movement" outbreak, which also marked the spiritual awakening of the new generation of Chinese people. So how do this generation of young people understand the "June 4th" incident? And how did the truth of the "June 4th" have on them?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/special/tiananmen/index.html"><strong> There is no windy wall, even the firewall </strong></a><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/duzheguangchang/dz-05302023170923.html"><strong> [How do I know the June 4th] Come on the Come on </strong></a></p>
<p>今年5月，作者冰乐(笔名)在海外发表的小说《渴望》中，写到了一个和“六四”事件有关的情节：<em>“2011年6月4日，是小女孩岳莹的8岁生日。那天，自小学习京剧表演的她收到了一份特别的礼物：一个密码被妈妈预设为“198964”的红色存钱罐。可是，每当岳莹问起妈妈为什么要选择这串数字作存钱罐的密码时，妈妈的脸上，总会浮现出那个小小的她所不曾见过的复杂神情……。”</em></p>
<p><strong>"六四"密码</strong></p>
<p>身为00后的作者冰乐告诉本台，小说中这个情节实际源于她的自身经历：“真实的经历就是，家里每每需要设个无关紧要的密码时，因为小时候受到过耳濡目染的熏陶，我肯定就会用到这串数字。”</p>
<p>冰乐说，少年时代，爷爷书架上的那套由包尊信先生主编的《走向未来丛书》就成了她的好朋友。16岁那年，她皈依基督教，并首次从一位长辈那里听说了张伯笠牧师的名字(张伯笠是“六四”时被官方通缉的21个学生之一，名列第17)。</p>
<p>一年多后的某天，妈妈忽然叫她去网上看一段视频。“‘孩子，你听一听这个。这个叫张伯笠的牧师，他讲的这些内容真的好有意思。他还是那个天安门学运的副总指挥。’我一听就来了兴趣。天安门什么时候又多了这么一个事？我怎么都没在历史书上了解过？而且终于听到这位风闻已久的张伯笠牧师了。”</p>
<p>透过那个未被屏蔽掉的信仰公众号，冰乐听到了“六四”亲历者张伯笠牧师2001年在台湾的布道演讲。“我听到了那些后，我心中的很多疑虑就一下子解开了。那里，我也听到了我熟悉的人名，比如说参与编写《走向未来丛书》的严家祺先生。”</p>
<p>直到那时，尚未成年的冰乐才了解到，原来有一段真实发生的事已经被她的祖国从历史书上生生地抹去了......。这也促使她后来撰写了小说《渴望》，并特别“以此献给1989年天安门广场上的那个共和国。”</p>

<p><strong> The historical book of the sealing strip </strong> **</p>
<p>In Bingle's novels, the saving can of the 8964 password seems to symbolize the history of the "June 4th" that the "June 4th" has been distorted, dusty, and annihilated under the strong suppression of the Communist Party of China for many years. For those who want to know the truth, they must find the "password" with their heart to open the closed history. However, in reality, this password is often around people, and only a curious heart is needed to discover.</p>
<p>Cheng Gang (pseudonym) is a high school student in China in China. According to him, in China, historical textbooks of international schools will be reviewed, and some cities do not even allow academic history (AP, Alevel or IB courses). In his school, the students' historical books were accepted as soon as the school started, and they returned them a month later.</p>
<p>"Our book is affixed with a variety of seals. Driven by curiosity, I and my classmates and I carefully tear the sealing in the book." Cheng Gang described, "I'm watching about it about I saw a picture when I was in China (a man stood in front of the tank to block the tank), and I and my classmates were shocked. We started to read the content in the book. We found that we have been being drumped by our government. We have never written such anti -human and anti -human rights atrocities in our history. "</p>
<p>After that, when he talked with his classmates in the classroom, he talked to the "June 4th" content and was still holding the book with a torn seal in his hand. The teacher who came in was seen. The teacher sent him and his classmates to the principal's office angrily, and the school gave them and asked for a review.</p>
<p>However, this did not stop Cheng Gang's desire for the truth. In the end, he downloaded the VPN overturning software and went to see the relevant news documentary of the BBC and Radio Asia (RFA), so as to learn about the "June 4th" incident. He did not understand why he was punished by the truth of history? Why should the Chinese government cover the facts?</p>
<p>At present, this station cannot independently verify what the specific situation is mentioned as Gang Gang, but according to China's official website and domestic media reports, the Chinese government has become more stringent in the management review of overseas textbooks introduced by international schools in recent years.

Then, 'long hair'(Liang Guoxiong of the Social and People's Federation) asked Zeng Yinquan, and he said what do you think of the development after the "June 4th" incident? He told the key words of the "June 4th" incident. "Xiaoming said," Zeng Yinquan's answer is to avoid it, saying that the development of the motherland in recent years is obvious to all. ‘Chang Mao’ As you ask, can economic development ignore them to kill? This is also broadcast. "</p>
<p>Xiao Ming asked his parents that night, what was going on with the "June 4th" incident? His father just told him vaguely that the PLA went to Tiananmen to "maintain order." From then on, Xiaoming knew that if there were no examiners at the time, it was impossible for him to hear the word "June 4th", and his political position could not be completely changed.</p>

<p><strong> Lie who wants to cover the mad </strong></p>
<p>In the past thirty -four years, although the Chinese authorities have suppressed the discussion of the "June 4th" incident and have severely blocked all channels that can obtain the truth, they still cannot stop the people from understanding this history. Recently, in the feedback of the topic of "how young people know the June 4th", the reporter found that the way people get related information can be described as a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Many of these young people mentioned that on the evening of June 3 last year, Li Jiaqi, a "brothers with the goods", showed the tank ice cream cake in the live broadcast room and was stopped by the authorities, causing heated discussions on the Internet. From this, they first knew the "June 4th".</p>
<p>Some readers also said that he was suddenly disappeared because of the song "East East of the Queen" in the summer of 2019, and went to see a report on foreign media about Hong Kong's anti -repair storm, and saw the "June 4th" incident in it to understand To this historical truth.</p>
<p>Another post -00 reader mentioned that the reason why he actively searched for the "June 4th" information was because when he watched the game live on station B, the "Killing Information" in the upper right corner suddenly showed "Power Boy#8964" (When opening the live broadcast mode, the opponent's nickname will automatically become character name+four -digit number). As a result, the live broadcast room was immediately sealed, making him feel absurd.</p>
<p>Some netizens said that when he was in college, a foreign video lecture on a foreign professor was arranged on June 4. As a result, the professor could not log in first, and then fell crazy, and finally the whole class knew the reason.</p>
<p>Zhou Fengsuo, the leader of the former "June 4th" school movement, said that these practices of the Communist Party of China were "wanting to cover": "If people don't care, or they accept this lie, or the outside world has forgotten it, then it does not need to block it anymore . Now, because there are still people commemorating, the truth still exists actively, so they are actively blocked. But this blocking itself will also cause some people to be curious. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T11-00-00-04-00/000005.png" />At 4 am on June 4, 1989, college students sang international songs under the Monument of the Beijing People's Heroes. (Map of the June 4th file) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/kw-06012023130017.html/kw0601e.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T11-00-00-04-00/000006.png" /></a><strong> The idea of transformation from "Little Pink" to "Anti -Thief" transformation </strong></p>
<p>Understanding the truth of the "June 4th" brings a huge ideological impact on many young people, and it has also quickly transformed from the "small pink" that is completely brainwashed into a normal person with independent thinking ability. Xing Mingzhen, a high school student in China(Pseudonym)It is one of them.</p>
<p>Xing Mingzhen, who claims to be "born in a four -generation red environment", learned to turn over the wall in high school and registered a Twitter account: "At that time, I was still a 'pink', and they would still have bad words to see the CCP. Scolding up, maintaining the CCP, until one after another of the CCP, and I never know the evil things, including the "June Fourth". That is our top talent. They are full of hope in their hearts. They are their own hope. Have they ever thought that this regime will have such a great hostility to themselves? "</p>
<p>In the face of the truth, Xing Mingzhen was very ashamed, so late to know such a tragedy. He also lamented that there were so few people who knew the truth over the years: "Students, young people's life, hope of achieving democracy and freedom in China, etc., the CCP was destroyed on the day of" June Fourth ". It has been completely transformed into a 'anti -thief', not only seen on the Internet, but I also encountered a lot in real life. Although there are only ten years, especially the new crowns for three years, I will hit me once and once, and I have worn out my to the CCP. Finally fantasy. "</p>
<p>Xing Mingzhen admits that only what he can do now is to spread the truth as much as possible, and tell the "June 4th" to his classmates or friends who are younger than him.</p>
<p>He Jun (pseudonym), who has been studying in a foreign language school, has been playing with games from junior high school, and in the way, playing Twitter. He still remembers that for the first time, Twitter happened to be on June 3, and the overwhelming quarrels and the "June 4th" content came. Since he was brainwashed since he was a child, He Jun naturally joined the "Pink" army and began to send netizens for nearly a year of "fighting" with "Mida" (online language "instead of the shielded sensitive words" freedom "freedom" freedom "freedom" freedom "freedom" freedom "freedom" free ".</p>
<p>"Later, I boarded YouTube and watched a lot of documentary, including BBC, CNN, and some Chinese Youtuber's explanations. I slowly understood that this does not seem to understand before. Nothing, this is at least an authoritarian government's suppression of students, which is irrational and cruel. "</p>
<p>He Jun said that he began to pay attention to some disappeared topics, that is, the "black history" of the Communist Party of China. In the past three years, China's economy has declined, and many things have had a great impact on him: "I am very impressed, such as village banks in Henan, Shanghai Fengcheng, and even the movement of dynamic clearing last year. A 'little pink' that is completely praised and ethics has become a person who considers himself to have the ability to think about. "</p>
<p>After entering high school, He Jun encountered more partners with the same cognition. They talked about politics in English and read the books of thinkers and philosophers in the library, and even the traces of commemorating the "June 4th" appeared on the interior walls and toilets. He Jun said that he helped many students to understand China rationally and objectively, and also witnessed everyone's ideological changes during the epidemic. He was distressed by Xi Jinping's dictatorship, and was moved by his classmates' confidence in the future of light.</p>
<p>Regarding the process of Chinese young people who broke the authorities and cognition of the "June 4th" process, Zhou Fengsuo, the former "June 4th" school movement leader, said: "In my opinion, it is indeed this kind of goodness of human nature and the natural power of seeking truth. Those wiped, especially on young people. "</p>
<p>Cao Yaxue, editor -in -chief of "Change China" website, also pointed out: "This institutional lie and government behavior lies are very powerful because it has all power and machines. But once it is unsuccessful, it is very easy to be deceived. People, information receivers -people, have a thorough doubt about it. "<strong> "White Paper Movement" and "Plaza Second Generation" </strong></p>
<p>These young people who dare to break through the "June 4th" lies of the authorities have naturally devoted themselves to the resistance to defending basic freedom and human rights in recent years. In late November 2022, a fire in Urumqi caused a "white paper movement" that broke out in many cities in China against the "clearing" controlled by the authorities. Many Chinese students overseas also bravely stood up to express their solidarity. Many of them were young people who were deeply infected with the "June 4th" mental infection, including the "second generation of the square".</p>
<p>The United States is one of them. His father, Wu Pinghui, was an active participant in the Wuhan area of the "June 4th" academic movement, and was imprisoned for one and a half years. However, his father didn't tell him until he grew up.</p>
<p>Wu Heming said: "I remember on my eighteen birthday, he told me his encounter on June 4th. I think my dad is a hero."</p>
<p>In the "White Paper Movement", He Heming participated in the support rally of San Francisco without hesitation. He felt that from a personal perspective, he had such a responsibility: "This may have a certain relationship with my father. But even if you are abroad, young people who do not have a background in my country, see colleagues in the country to fight against Under the country and totalitarian state, we still risk life. We have an advantage from fear overseas. We see that domestic people have been so brave, and even some people have been arrested, but we are a little bit overseas There is no sound, it will really be condemned by conscience. "</p>
<p>Ai Jingjing (pseudonym), who is also studying in the United States and is also a "second -generation square", also actively participated in the "White Paper Movement" in New York last year. The reason for the background of the family is also related to her own experience. She said: "I was persecuted in the country during the epidemic. At that time, I almost clashed with the police, and it was not far from being arrested. Because I was really in a public resistance at that time, I was on a train. On the square of the station. "</p>
<p>Ai Jingjing's father went to university in Beijing during the "June 4th" in 1989. He also actively participated in the school movement. Fortunately, he was not arrested. At the same time, the whole family was also very "anti -communist", so she knew "June 4th" from a very young age.</p>
<p>Ai Jingjing admits that the "White Paper Movement" in terms of scale and participants' ideological consciousness is far from the support of the people. Compared with the "June 4th" of the year, the overseas sports effect is very limited, but she still thinks that In the face of the high pressure of the Communist Party of China, young people should stand up bravely and do what they should do: "Since it is no longer in China, what am I still afraid of!If people overseas dare not stand up, then no one really dares to dare Speak. "</p>

<p><strong> "We are all the same generation" </strong></p>
<p>A "white paper movement" participant in Japan "one grain of wheat" (net name) recently tweeted: "'Six Four' is alive in our father's heart, just like 'Urumqi Middle Road' 'living in our hearts . Their shouts and struggles are our shouts and struggles; the hope and losses they have experienced, that is, the hope and losses we have experienced. "</p>
<p>Cui Jian, known as the "Father of Chinese Rock", once said: "As long as there are still hairy statues on Tiananmen, we are still the same generation."</p>
<p>Indeed, on the road of opposing autocratic tyranny, when the "white paper" and the "June 4th" generation encountered in the past 30 years, they had almost no many generations. Some "June 4th" school movement leaders have naturally become the "white paper movement" youth's forgotten and spiritual mentor. Free and democratic fire species consciously inherit and relay between these two generations.</p>
<p>On the eve of the "June 4th" anniversary, Xing Mingzhen, a high school student mentioned earlier, paid tribute to the "June 4th" students of the year: "Your actions and wishes failed, but successfully left a wound in history. People will only be blinded and will not forget. Now the seeds of democracy and freedom will start germination on the Chinese land, we will work hard. You will not be forgotten. I picked up the torch, no matter whether anyone follows, maybe I will fall down, and I will fall down. , But more people will continue. Democracy cannot kill, and justice is not killed!"</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future, this article mentioned that the novel author Bing Le is full of confidence: "Whether the road ahead is bright or dark, it is easier to see hope if you insist on walking forward!"</p>
<p>Due to security reasons, Cheng Gang, Xiaoming, Xing Mingzhen, He Jun, and Ai Jingjing in this article are all pseudonyms. Their voice is also technically treated.</p>

<p>One of the organizers and online shopping platform "Ruyi" quoted Gaoxian Cinema on Facebook that the hospital received the "strong suggestion" of "industry representatives". Decide to cancel the charter.</p>
<p>It is understood that "Not yet End" tells the deeds of the founder of a movie theater in Hong Kong. Some media in Hong Kong found that there have been multiple suspicious account messages in Gaoxian Cinema about "Not yet Ending".

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-02T11-35-40-08-00/01dc-china-intel-gjck-master1050.jpg" />A new report states that China's intelligence agencies are investing in open source intelligence to learn more about the US military's capabilities in the Pacific and other regions.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/private-eyes-chinas-embrace-open-source-military-intelligence">Analysis Report</a>A threat intelligence company named RecordedFuture, which details the efforts of the Chinese government and enterprises to collect public data from the Pentagon, Think Tank and Private Companies -the Beijing Military can use this information to help plans for potential conflicts with the United States.</p>
<p><strong> Why is this very important: Beijing's collection of open source intelligence can bring it advantages. </strong></p>
<p>As the US -China confrontation intensifies, both countries are increasing their investment in intelligence collection.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>With Beijing's investment in big data management, the source of information on public information can enable China to dominate the intelligence of the United States and its allies.</p>
<p>Although authoritarian countries like China hide their information about their own army, the United States, as a democratic country trying to make rapid response to the public, has released a lot of information about its military capabilities, theories and plans.</p>
<p>China can dig this information and find materials that can be used for their own military advantages. For example, the report detailed some of the tasks done by a major Chinese open source intelligence company to analyze viewing analysis from the "Network Evaluation Office" from the Pentagon's internal think tank "Network Evaluation Office". RecordedFuture also outlines how China tries to collect information released by the Naval War Academy on the Naval War of New Potter.</p>
<p>"There is a China Maritime Research Institute, which has conducted a large number of open source research on China," said Zoy Haval, threat intelligence analyst of RecordedFuture. "This is completed in the academic environment, but after all, it will be identified as valuable intelligence by the foreign government."</p>
<p>Military officials did not comment on the report immediately.</p>
<p><strong> Background: China is digging information about the U.S. military. </strong></p>
<p>In recent decades, China's ability to collect secret information has made rapid progress, and Beijing has increased its investment in open source information in the past decade.</p>
<p>The definition of open source intelligence is widely defined, but Recorded Future has studied information about the Chinese People's Liberation Army's intelligence agencies to help them formulate plans and develop military information.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Recorded Future launched a survey on a contract issued by the military to Chinese private companies, allowing them to collect a series of open source information, including materials related to the US military and their defense work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>"To a large extent, the PLA assumes that the United States will intervene in Taiwan's conflict in some form, and they work hard to prepare for this situation," Haval said.</p>
<p>Most of the contents of Beijing's excavation from open source data are likely to be in the hands of individual Chinese spy institutions. However, according to the analyst of RecordedFuture, Chinese intelligence agencies are their own politics and will not share information. Compared with asking confidential information from sister spy agencies, for some intelligence agencies of the PLA, it is easier to develop an open source source information about American capabilities.</p>
<p><strong> Next: Collecting open source information challenges to democratic countries. </strong></p>
<p>Considering the public information of the United States and its allies, Recorded Future acknowledged security issues, but cutting off the wide access to data may not be a solution.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Haval said that RecordedFuture hopes that people realize the collection of open source intelligence, which will help private sector companies, military, and other government agencies to better manage this risk and make it more difficult for automatic network crawlery to from the public database. Or grab information on the website. She also encouraged private companies to conduct due diligence on Chinese companies trying to buy their information.</p>

<p>"In the final analysis, we don't want Western countries to close their information environment," Haval said. "That's not even a good thing. We value openness."</p>

<p>Non -profit organization artificial intelligence security center published a copy <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk">only one sentence statement</a>Writing: "The risk of reducing artificial intelligence should become a priority of the world, just like the risk of other social scale -such as a major epidemic and nuclear war." This open letter is more than 350 in artificial intelligence work Sign signed by executives, researchers and engineers.</p>
<p>Sign signeders include three leading executives of artificial intelligence companies: OPENAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Jimis Kazakhs, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amoda Yi.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Simon and Joshua Benjio are two of the three researchers who have won the Turing Award for their pioneering work in neural networks. They are usually regarded as the "godfather" of the modern artificial intelligence movement. They also signed the statement, and there were other outstanding researchers in this field.(As of Tuesday, Yang Lekun, the third Turing Prize winner and the head of the Meta artificial intelligence research project, has not signed.)advertise</p>
<p>The statement was issued when people's possibilities of artificial intelligence were increasingly worried. Recently, the so -called large -scale language model, that is, the progress made by the artificial intelligence system used by ChatGPT and other chat robots has caused people's concerns -artificial intelligence may soon be used to spread error information and publicity, or It may eliminate millions of white -collar jobs.</p>
<p>Some people believe that in the end, artificial intelligence may become strong enough. If no measures are taken to slow down its development, it may cause social scale destruction within a few years, although researchers sometimes do not explain how this happens.</p>
<p>These concerns have been recognized by many industry leaders, which has made them in an unusual situation. They claim that they are developing a technology -in many cases, they are desperately working to draw faster than competitors than competitors. ——The constitutional risk and stricter supervision should be subject to stricter.</p>
<p>This month, Altman, Kazakhs, and Amandi met with US President Biden and Vice President Harris to discuss artificial intelligence regulatory issues. In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html">Senate Explanation after the Conference</a>Among them, Altman warned that the risks of advanced artificial intelligence systems have been seriously enough to need government intervention and call for supervision of potential harm of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In an interview, Dan Hungrik, Executive Director of the Artificial Intelligence Safety Center that this open letter represents the "out of the counter" of some industry leaders, and they have expressed concern about the risks they are developing. Private.</p>
<p>"Even in the artificial intelligence industry, there are generally misunderstandings, thinking that only a few people are doctrines," said Hendrik. "But in fact, many people will worry about these things privately."</p>

<p>Some suspects believe that artificial intelligence technology is still too immature, which is not enough to constitute a threat of life and death. For today's artificial intelligence system, they are more worried about not long -term danger, but short -term issues, such as prejudice reactions and incorrect reactions.</p>
<p>However, some people believe that the progress of artificial intelligence is too fast, so that its performance in some areas has exceeded the level of human beings, and it will soon surpass humans in other fields. They said that this technology has shown signs of advanced ability and advanced understanding, which makes people worry that "general artificial intelligence"(AGI)——It artificial intelligence that can be achieved or exceeded in various tasks -may not be far from us.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence">a blog post last week</a>Among them, two other executives of Ortman and Openai proposed several methods to manage powerful artificial intelligence systems responsible for managing powerful artificial intelligence systems. They call on leading artificial intelligence manufacturers to cooperate, conduct more technical research on large language models, and set up an international artificial intelligence security organization similar to international atomic energy agencies (designed to control the use of nuclear weapons).</p>
<p>Altman also stated that he supports the formulation of rules and requires a large -scale cutting -edge artificial intelligence model to register to obtain a permit issued by the government.</p>
<p>In March of this year, more than 1,000 technicians and researchers <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230330/ai-artificial-intelligence-musk-risks/">signed another public letter</a>It is called to suspend the development of the largest artificial intelligence model for six months, because it is worried that "the competition for more powerful digital thinking is out of control".</p>
<p>This letter was led by another non -profit organization that focuses on artificial intelligence, the Life Future Institute, and Elon Musk signed with other well -known technology leaders, but there are not many signatures from the leading artificial intelligence laboratory.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Hendrix said the short new statement of the Artificial Intelligence Safety Center -only 22 English words in total -aimed at uniting artificial intelligence experts, which may have differences in the nature of specific risks or measures to prevent these risks from occurring these risks. , But they have common concerns about the powerful artificial intelligence system.</p>
<p>"We don't want to promote a large menu containing 30 potential intervention measures," he said. "This kind of thing will dilute the information."</p>
<p>The statement was originally shared with several well -known artificial intelligence experts, including Sington. Sington this month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html">resigned from the job in Google</a>He said that he can talk about the potential harm of artificial intelligence more freely. After that, the statement entered several major artificial intelligence laboratories, and then some employees signed it.</p>
<p>As hundreds of millions of people use artificial intelligence chat robots to seek entertainment, companionship, and improve work efficiency, and the rapid progress of underlying technology, the urgency of warnings from the leaders in this field is also increasing.</p>
<p>"I think if there is a problem with this technology, there may be major problems," Altman told the Senate Group Committee. "We hope to cooperate with the government to prevent this situation."</p>

<p>Singapore Minister of Defense Huang Yonghong (right), the Ministry of Defense, welcomed the Minister of Defense Li Shangfu (left). Beijing claims that Li Shangfu does not meet with Austin, and "responsibility is exactly the United States."</p>
<p><strong> IISS SHANGRI-LADialogue held the 20th session in the context of the continued conjunction of China and the United States. The world's national defense security officers, arms dealers and diplomats have gathered in Singapore to observe how the two major powers are swords. </strong></p>

<p>Before the meeting, the US Pentagon stated that General Li Shangfu, who was sanctioned by the United States, rejected the invitation to meet with Austin, indicating that the two parties would "pass by" during the meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to Sino -US relations, more than 600 representatives from more than 40 countries are expected to discuss issues such as international tension, the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) and Asian relations, and the North Korean nuclear military plan caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

<p>Austin believes that China intercept the provocation of the US military's machinery, which is worrying. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's southern theater refers to the US "wicked first priority".</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, Sino -US relations have been reappearing because of balloon storms, and before that, it has been nervous because of Taiwan and trade issues.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Shangri -La dialogue, Taipei and Washington signed "[21st Century Trade initiative] on Thursday (1st) Washington on Thursday (1st)(https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-65788057)"The first batch of agreements. China said on Friday that" strong dissatisfaction and had a serious negotiation to the United States. "</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said that signing this agreement "is the latest example of the virtualization of beauty and empty the Chinese principle", and requires the United States to "stop and immediately revoke the so -called 'initiative' and agreement, and stop sending any of the split forces to the 'Taiwan independence' division forces. Error signals, otherwise the consequences of this must be completely borne by the United States. "</p>
<p>Coupled with Washington and Beijing this week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IJfxs2efqBs">the United States accused the Chinese fighter "provocative" US reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea</a>On the eve of the dialogue, the US -China relations can be described as cold wind.</p>
<p>Council On Foreign Relations, a senior researcher at the National Security Affairs, Richardbetts, said to the BBC TV news station: "(China and the United States) are concerned about how to avoid direct conflicts -there is no doubt that because there is no doubt because Many obvious reasons, they all hope to avoid war -but there are currently no clear or obvious ways to solve the Taiwan problem. "</p>
<p>Bates said that China originally hoped to press the Taiwan issue to be disappeared, but recently changed. Taiwan is not an independent country, but due to a certain degree of protection in the United States, Washington must face the reality that it is not easy to deal with the strategy of responding to the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>After the Pentagon announced on Monday (May 29) announced that after Li Shangfu refused to meet with Austin, the Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman Tan Kefei said on Tuesday (31st) and said: "The dialogue must not have no principles, and the communication cannot be communicated. The responsibility is exactly in the United States. "</p>
<p>Austin transferred from Tokyo, Japan to Singapore to attend the Shangri -La dialogue on Thursday that China refused to meet as "unfortunate". "I think the Ministry of National Defense should talk to each other often, or to establish a communication channel."Image source, EPA</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The Shangri -La dialogue ushered in the 20th session.</p>
<p>The Global Times of the CCP's "People's Daily" quoted "a Chinese scholar" on Friday, saying: "Just like the role played by the United States in the Russian conflict, the United States has continued to do things in Asia Pacific, trying to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this region in order Fishing from it. "</p>
<p>"However, the United States never wants to directly conflict with a big country. It is afraid of wiping guns and getting angry.</p>
<p>Allen Connery, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Strategy, believes that Sino -US relations are not tight, so that the entire forum will be shadowed.</p>
<p>Connerly said to BBC: "By bringing both the United States and China to Southeast Asia to publish its position, this can force them to think about what the region wants to develop in this area and what they can do to ease tension. "</p>
<p>At the Japan Seventh -National Group (G7) summit held in May, US President Joe Biden had predicted that Sino -US relations were expected to thaw, and Huafu's internal "consultation" was also "negotiating" to lift the sanctions against Li Shangfu.</p>
<p>The G7 leaders also said in a joint statement that countries hope to seek reducing risks in relations with China rather than De-Couple.</p>

<p>Taiwan's security issues have continued to become Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>But Dr Lynn Kuok, a senior researcher at the Asia -Pacific Security Institute, who is also from the Institute of International Strategy, told Reuters that she was not optimistic about improving US -China relations.</p>
<p>"We should focus here to arrange guardrails to prevent compete from falling into the whirlpool and evolving into an open comprehensive conflict.</p>
<p>Yang Nianzu, the former Minister of Defense, who attended the meeting, pointed out to the Taiwan Central News Agency that he expects that Li Shangfu will show that China ’s position on Taiwan’ s issue and elaborates China's security strategic blueprint. The two sides will have relatively tit -tat words.</p>
<h3>North Korean missile threat</h3>
<p>Singapore's "Straits Times" quoted Dr. Zhuang Jiaying, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science at the National University of Singapore, said that it will continue to support Ukraine's anti -Japanese war, control the North Korean and Iranian weapons and missile plans, and how to cope with the spillover effect of the Myanmar civil war.

<p>Compared to China and the United States, "passing by", South Korean Minister of Defense Li Zhongzheng will meet Li Shangfu during the dialogue. According to the Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean side will clearly point out at the meeting that North Korea ’s nuclear guidance provokes to severely damage regional peace and stability, and calls on China to play a constructive role to promote North Korea's restraint and provocations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65761995">Korean Wednesday (31st) launched spy satellites failed</a>On the eve of the dialogue, the official North Korean Society issued a document to warn the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) activities in the Asia -Pacific region. Jensstoltenberg, Secretary -General of NATO, condemned the satellite launch of the North Korean satellite. It was the origin of this article.</p>
<p>The article said: "If, the launch of my country's military reconnaissance satellites makes NATO worry, which clearly shows that NATO tries to the insidious heart of the opportunity to intervene in the Asia -Pacific affairs on the grounds of the unnecessary 'North Korea threat'."</p>
<p>"Recently, the increasingly active NATO, Japan and South Korea's representative office and network joint training are representative evidence, which indicates that the military collusion activities of the Atlantic and Pacific aggression forces have entered a dangerous signal of a comprehensive implementation stage."</p>
<p>"If NATO continues to attempt to infringe the sovereignty and security interests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we will regard NATO as the same opponent as the United States to deal with it."</p>
<p>In May this year, Japan confirmed that NATO will set up a liaison office in Tokyo in July, but at the same time clarify that Japan has no intention of applying to join NATO. In addition to North Korea, China also set up a offices to propose dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Richard Bates, a senior researcher at the American Foreign Relations Association, commented on the BBC that North Korea has difficulty in the United States because of its nuclear weapons and its own "crazy" characteristics. However, the United States needs to guarantee the long -term commitments of the allies to South Korea. It is a way to explain these guarantees to the local and US military soldiers and register defense resources to the local area.</p>

<p>According to the US "Wall Street Journal" reported on June 2, in order to cope with the increasing military challenges from China, the United States has adopted a new military strategy in Asia, including increasing outpost bases to get rid of serious dependence on large military bases.</p>
<p>This weekend, the Shangri -La dialogue attended by the Minister of Defense of many countries will begin. China's increasing military power and the US military existence in Asia are expected to become one of the themes of the meeting. China recently rejected the requirements of the United States on the meeting during the meeting.</p>
<p>It is reported that as the Chinese missile library has expanded and technology is becoming more advanced, the large bases of the U.S. military in Asia are increasingly dangerous. By dispersing weapons, troops, and command posts to smaller outpost bases, the United States hopes that China will make it more difficult for China to launch a blow by weakening any single military facilities.</p>
<p>According to Pentagon estimates, more than 1,300 ballistic missiles in China can be used to combat the Asia -Pacific goals, of which more than 250 can be played in the United States' main military base in Guam.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T11-59-00-04-00/000000.png" />The human rights observation of the International Human Rights issued a statement on the eve of the June 4th anniversary of the June 4th incident, urging the Chinese government to recognize the responsibility of large -scale killing of democratic movement demonstrators. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-06022023115605.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T11-59-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Screenshot of Human Rights Watch official website</p>
<p>The human rights observation of international human rights organizations headquartered in New York, USA issued a statement on the eve of the June 4th anniversary of the June 4th incident, urging the Chinese government to recognize the responsibility of large -scale killings of democratic movements and provide compensation for the dead and their families.</p>
<p>The statement pointed out that when the global people mourned the June 4th massacre of 1989, the Chinese authorities were increasingly actively eliminated related memories, and began to prevent the people's mourning from a few weeks before the 64th anniversary. The members of the rights protection and members of the June 4th deaths of the June 4th deaths "Tiananmen Mother" are restricted to act and connect with the outside world. The Chinese government has never acknowledged the responsibility of the slaughter, nor has it been pursued by any official's legal responsibility. It has no intention of investigating related incidents, nor to announce the information of being killed, killed, forced to disappear or prison.</p>
<p>Human rights observations have stated that the lack of long -term consistent international response to the June 4th slaughter and its subsequent suppression is one of the factors that have caused the Beijing authorities to invade human rights. As a number of international human rights treaties and the current members of the UN Human Rights Council, China has the obligation to "maintain the highest standards for human rights."</p>
<p>Human rights observation urges the Chinese government to respect the rights of remarks, freedom of association, and peaceful assembly, and stop harassing and arbitrarily detaining those who question the official statement of June 4th; apologize to members of the "mother of Tiananmen", announce the list Family members provide compensation; approve an open independent investigation of June 4th and follow -up incidents, and quickly announce the results and conclusions of the investigation; allow Chinese citizens who are involved in exile and exile involved in the 1989 democratic movement. Government and military officials who illegally use fatal force in the masses and prosecute them.</p>

<p>Description: On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the Tiananmen incident that shocked the world, the CCP authorities were still re -elected after the Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, and after experiencing three years of epidemic and white paper movement, as always, she still avoided it without mentioning the "calming counter -revolutionary riots" that year or later diluted. The history of "political storm" has repeatedly emphasized national security, highly alert, and strengthened strict monitoring of political sensitive figures. It is required that they are in contact with the outside world in the sensitive period of June 4th, and even forced some objender people. To travel, at the same time, we stepped up some human rights lawyers and relatives in Beijing, which seriously interfered with their normal life and work.</p>

Hair dye .org/mandarin/column/labor communication/good place -06022023090338.html/@@ stream</a>After the May 1st Labor Day holiday this year, the workers of Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. returned to the factory on the first day of work, and was informed by the factory. <a href="https://maps.clb.org.hk/?i18n_language=zh_CN&amp;map=1&amp;startDate=2023-05&amp;endDate=2023-05&amp;eventId=2023050515393622063&amp;addressId=350500&amp;address=%E6%B3%89%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82">Enterprise Close</a>Essence The factory also violated the law that the workers must sign a voluntary resignation letter before they issued the salary of March that had been arrears.</p>
<p>Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager. Some workers sent a confrontation scene in Douyin <a href="https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA1p7MwZLcIxN-nQUiu8yogLIDKf2PS7Cxw7e6pYJABIY?modal_id=7228898852244376847&amp;relation=0&amp;vid=7228898852244376847">Video</a>Essence</p>
<p>Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.</p>
<p>Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to Wuli Industrial Zone was also the same. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?</p>
<p>It should be asked why!</p>
<p>Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?</p>
<p>As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. <a href="http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm">Company Branch Committee</a>". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.</p>
<p>In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?</p>
<p>With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.</p>
<p>It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor <a href="https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html">Xi Jinping once scolded</a>Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".</p>
<p>What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?</p>
<p>On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>说，福建泉州工会根据全总、省总“县级工会加强年”专项工作部署，各市、县工会迅速行动，建立专班，制定方案，围绕政治引领，筑强县级工会这个“桥头堡”，上下联动、稳步推进。</p>
<p>可在今次佳信关厂事件中，根本找不到晋江工会这个桥头堡的专班、方案、联动和推进。</p>
<p>中工网这篇报道说，泉州市总工会每名班子成员挂钩联系1至2个县级工会、2至3家基层工会，常态化沟通联系。</p>
<p>那么，佳信厂作为一家大厂，是由泉州市总工会哪位班子成员挂钩联系、常态沟通的呢？</p>
<p>中工网这篇报道还说，泉州各区县工会尊重基层首创精神，通过自选动作自主创新，目标是提炼一批可复制可推广的好经验、好做法。晋江工会还要根据职工实际需求打造一个2.0版机制。</p>
<p>Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[<a href="http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html">Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality</a>"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.</p>
<p>In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".</p>
<p>In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.</p>
<p>The good situation of enterprises ".</p>
<p>The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".</p>
<p>For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.</p>
<p>The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T12-28-54-04-00/000000.png" />On Weibo, the discussion of the Treasury Bureau of Wuhan Hubei recently publicly reported debt collection in full version <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/heqinglian/hql-06022023121842.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T12-28-54-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Weibo screenshot</p>
<p>Recent Family companies and units repay the arrears that have not repaid the total amount of more than 100 million yuan as of 2018. China's local debt explosion is imminent. These two orders are alarm.</p>
<p><strong> How much do you know about China's local debt? </strong></p>
<p>The debt of the Chinese government and the estimation of international financial institutions and the Chinese government are different. Here only the estimate of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in February this year: The total debt of China's local financing platform has soared, which has increased from 57 trillion yuan last year to 66 trillion yuan, about 9.5 trillion US dollars, accounting for the Chinese world. Half of the second largest economy. Since then, international financial media such as Reuters have mostly cited this data and said that they are still growing. According to public information in China, most provinces in China are currently debt, and fiscal revenue is in a negative growth state.</p>
<p>China's official data, as of November 2022, the balance of local debt in the country was 35 trillion (as of November 2022); the balance of the central government's debt was 2.33 trillion (internal debt+foreign debt, as of the end of 2021), so the explicitity of the country nationwide The balance of debt is 5.83 trillion.</p>
<p>——The explanation here must be explained that debt balance = total liabilities-paid parts. Chinese local governments borrow new debts to pay the old debt. They are digital games on the book. These numbers are only clear debts and do not include hidden debt. If it includes hidden debt, it is much higher than this.</p>
<p>The local government financing platform plays a key role in national infrastructure project financing, and it is also one of the important driving drivers for economic growth. Local governments 'financing platform has become the "black hole" of China's financial system. It is used to fill the gap of local governments' revenue and expenses. Local fiscal tensions may directly affect Beijing's moderate 5%economic growth goal for this year. Local governments have no fiscal surplus, "cannot repay the debt owed", and many local financing platforms will collapse and face credit breach of contract.</p>
<p><strong> Local debt -Roman City is not built in one day </strong></p>
<p>However, China's local debt black hole was formed after years. The following only take the history of local debt in Wuhan and Yunnan as an example.</p>
<p>You can find a set of special articles on the Internet "Debt Pressing City: Pain in the Big Wuhan Butterfly Change" http://hb.sina.com.cn/zt/whdebt/index.shtml. If you look closely, you will find that this set of special articles is published in 2012 -11 years ago. This group of articles talked about three major questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How big is Wuhan debt? As of June 30, 2012, Wuhan's government debt balance was 203.705 billion yuan. 2. The three largest investment and financing platforms in Wuhan are Wuhan City Investment, Wuhan Real Estate Group and Wuhan Metro Group, all of which are companies run by the government. Class financing accounts for about 86%of total debt. How dangerous? This article quotes the comments of "senior people in the audit community": local government debt has left the controlled range; local government debt with a rapid expansion, like a sword of Damocles hanging above China's head, may fall at any time. , Bring the nightmare into reality. The risks behind large -scale construction of the city have become the biggest challenges in the macroeconomic operation. The government relied on land revenue to repay debt, which is to drink thirst and quench their thirst, and the evil results have appeared. How to continue to develop in the future, the government will make more substantial efforts at the relevant reform level.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at Yunnan Province, the province was caught in debt quagmire as early as 2011. In order to build a highway, on May 28, 2006, the Yunnan Provincial Government established a wholly -owned government enterprise "Yunnan Provincial Highway Development Investment Co., Ltd." (referred to as "Yunnan Highway"), with a registered capital of 5 billion yuan. In the past few years, in the construction of infrastructure highways in Yunnan Province, the Yunnan Highway has contributed to the state -owned banks. One is the son of the local government, the other is the son of the central government, and the transportation and railway have always been a large loan for banks. There are future charging rights for pledge, and the reputation of the government and the Ministry of Railways is guaranteed. Loan, the state -owned "two brothers" cooperate happily.</p>
<p>However, there are no hundred days of red. Four years later, in the first half of 2010, the total assets of the Yunnan Highway Company were 131.4 billion yuan, the liabilities were 101.5 billion yuan, and the asset -liability ratio reached 77.24%. Jiang Zhigang, general manager of Yunnan Highway, admits at the Economic Activity Analysis Conference in the first half of 2010 that "the company's capital turnover may break, unable to repay the principal and interest of bank loans, and may cause bad debt loss to banks and form financial risks." More than a dozen credit banks such as the National Bank of China and ICBC issued a letter of letter from "now, only paying interest and not repaid". At this time, Yunnan Province thought that Yunnan was located in the mountains and mountains. Whether it was a bridge, it was almost impossible to recover the cost. The Yunnan Provincial Government played the "third -party role" between the Yunnan Highway and the state -owned bank's "government companies" to adjust, requiring the Yunnan Highway to withdraw the above official letters, and make a commitment to increase capital, advance, subsidies, etc. to help the company Temporary crossing is difficult, but risks have not been eliminated.</p>
<p>The Dian Highway's repayment storm has aroused questions about the risk of government debt. According to the 2010 Audit Report of the National Audit Department of China, as of the end of 2010, except for 54 county -level governments, there was no government debt, and a total of 107.17491 billion yuan in local government debt balances of the provincial, cities, and counties. In this huge debt, how many risks have been hidden, there is no authoritative data at present. The situation of other provinces is roughly the same. Since the 2008 US financial crisis spreads the world, the Chinese government invested 5 trillion to rescue the city in 2009. Eight immortals across the world and showed their magical powers and became infrastructure madness. This time cleaning up, cutting continuously, and chaotic, everyone knows that the existence of this gray rhino, no one can invite this giant beast.</p>
<p><strong> Self -made Xinxin Pills regardless of </strong></p>
<p>Do the Chinese government know the local debt crisis? of course I know.</p>
<p>On February 16 this year, Sina Finance boarded a "31 provincial local government debt panoramic scan: who is more and less pressure", and comprehensively sorted out the local explicit debt stock, interest payment situation and investment. The results are as follows as follows. : 1. In 2022, the balance of local government bonds in China was as high as 35 trillion yuan, creating historical records. The first year of interest expenditure exceeded 1 trillion yuan;3. Among the 27 provinces calculated in this article, 23 provinces have the debt rate of 23 provinces than 100%of the warning line, of which Tianjin is as high as 295.7%, and Jilin, Yunnan, Liaoning, Guizhou, Fujian, Chongqing, Qinghai's debt ratio exceeds 150%of more than 150% It shows that the situation of local debt is not matched with financial resources;</p>
<ol>
<li>Local debt repayment is mainly from re -financing. "Borrowing new and old" is more common, so the pressure on interest payment expenses is relatively stressful to local finance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The conclusion of this article is that as of the end of 2022, the local government's debt ratio was 29.1%. After the central government's government debt, the government's debt ratio was 50.1%, which was lower than the international alert value. — Considering the domestic public opinion environment, the author's conclusion can be understood, because the risk is too large, and those with professional knowledge can see 16 charts and related data in the text to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>After three and a half months published this article, Wuhan and Yunnan successively staged the drama in the beginning of this article due to the lack of financial resources of the local government and the tightening of the tightening of income pressure, the rigidity of expenditure, and the tightening of debt.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T12-36-46-04-00/000000.png" />Hegang Municipal Government held a fiscal reorganization RFA drawing in 2021 <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediansaomiao/econ-06022023122930.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediaomiao/econ 06022023122930.html/@@stream</a>Good audience and friends, welcome to listen to the financial and epochs of Liberty Asia, I am Rao Yiming.</p>
<p>As the first city in China to declare bankruptcy, Heilongjiang, Heilong City, has gone through more than a year of debt reorganization. The pressure of fiscal tightening has penetrated into all levels of society: locals lack sufficient heating in the cold winter; More traffic fines; public school teachers anxiously give students classes in the rumors of layoffs; street cleaners have not received salary for more than two months. These brutal reality are portrayal of a bankrupt city. However, recently, the Hegang economy has risen against the trend. First of all, due to the price of cabbage prices, Hegang suddenly attracted a batch of young people who were lying here, driving the real estate market. In addition, because graphite mining has injected a new vitality into this resource -exhausted city. This episode will discuss the previous life and this life of Hegang. The guests who participated in the discussion were Qin Weiping, an economist in the United States.</p>
<p><strong> The first city to reorganize debt </strong></p>
<p>The prominent problem of China's local debt is no longer a matter of overnight. According to Goldman Sachs Group's estimates, the total amount of Chinese official loans and local government financing platforms and policy banks is about 23 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 1.63 trillion yuan. If China's local debt is out of control, it may be dragged down on China's economic development in the future. Song Houze, an economist at the US Think Tank Paulson Foundation, said that many cities in China will become the same as Hegang a few years later. He pointed out that population aging and decreased population means that many cities have no labor to maintain faster economic growth and tax revenue.</p>
<p>What experience can Hegang from the first bankruptcy city from China provide? Hegang, located in the coal -producing cities located in remote areas in the northeast, has a long -term contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure and seriously relied on superior transfer payment and debt income. In recent years, due to the sharp decline in land transfer revenue, the risk of debt repayment has increased, and debt reorganization was carried out at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>According to the Macro introduction of China Merchants, since the end of 2021, the financial reorganization has been announced, and the financial situation of Hegang has increased significantly income and the decline in expenditure. From the perspective of 2020 and 20121 final accounts and 2022 budget reports, tax revenue and non -tax income have increased significantly. Among them, the tax revenue was 1.330 billion, 1.52 billion and 1.68 billion yuan in three years. Among them, non -tax revenue was 970 million, 1.3 billion, and 1.43 billion yuan, respectively. From the perspective of details, the increase in large changes in tax revenue is VAT, corporate income tax, resource tax and personal income tax. The major increase in non -tax income is the main thing is that it cannot be income and paid revenue of state -owned resources.</p>
<p>As of the end of 2022, the balance of local government debt of Hegang was 24.3 billion yuan, of which 11.1 billion yuan in legal debt and 13.2 billion yuan in invisible debt. The debt risk has been used as an orange area.</p>
<p><strong> Young people who go to Hegang lying flat </strong></p>
<p>In recent years, due to the price of cabbage price, the small town of Hegang has suddenly become an Internet celebrity city. As China's third batch of resource -exhausted cities, the population continues to flow. Hegang's house prices have continued to decline, ranking backward in the country. The low housing prices provide a good choice for young people who are high -voltage and high -life costs in large cities and despair.</p>
<p>In 2019, young people bought a house at Hegang at a very low price, and quickly detonated social media. Next, many years go to Hegang to buy a house. According to statistics, between 2020 and 2022, a total of 7,286 people settled in Hegang. Although the ideal is beautiful, is this really the case? According to a report from the website 36, from 2019 to the present, half of the first batch of people going to Hegang to buy a house will sell the house under the loss.</p>
<p>Although the price of Hegang is low, it has a long winter and severe employment environment. So it is not suitable for everyone. The reason why Hegang became an Internet celebrity reflects the infinite magnification of young people in the environment where house prices are not rising.</p>
<p><strong> Hegang salted fish turned over because I found the new mine? </strong></p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2023, the growth rate of Hegang GDP reached 8.5%, ranking first in 13 prefecture -level cities in Heilongjiang, which was higher than the average growth rate of Heilongjiang and the country. It is understood that the growth rate of Hegang GDP in 2022 was 4.5%, which was also higher than the average growth rate of He Longjiang Province.</p>
<p>But before that, the economic situation of Hegang went down the way. He once had more than 300 coal mines in large and small, but as the resources were exhausted, there were now only a dozen left. With the exhaustion of resources, the permanent population has continued to lose.</p>
<p>However, as the cabbage price house became an Internet celebrity, Hegang changed a lot. In the case of 2022, the sales area of commercial housing decreased by 24%, but Hegang's commercial houses increased by 37%year -on -year. The sales of commercial houses were 220 million yuan, a year -on -year increase of 28%.</p>
<p>Although the sales of commercial housing have become some reasons for the economic growth of Hegang this round of economic growth, it is more important that major progress has made in industrial development. According to the data of Hegang City Statistics Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, the added value of Hegang's secondary industry was 3.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12.7%, and the contribution rate to GDP growth was 60%, and 5 percentage points were driven by GDP.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hegang Industrial Investment increased by 17.8%year -on -year, 9.4 percentage points higher than the average level of Heilongjiang Province.</p>
<p>Among them, the graphite industry has to be mentioned. Hegang has proved that the ore reserves have reached 1.731 billion tons, mainly crystal graphite. Large reserves and high quality. The graphite industry has become the second largest industry in the coal -related industry of Hegang. There are 37 graphite companies in the city. The natural graphite product application market mainly includes electronics, new materials, metallurgy and other fields. Among them, the electronic industry is the most widely used, mainly used for lithium battery negative materials, conductive membranes, graphite electrodes, etc. In the past two years, the electric vehicle market has exploded, leading to increasing demand for natural graphite.</p>
<p>However, Niu Fengrui, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that a large city needs multiple pillar industrial support to develop better. The city of Hegang itself relies on the emergence of resources. If the graphite industry can form a complete upstream and downstream industrial chain and scale effect, it will be helpful for supporting the development of a small city.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/米老鼠的中国亿万淘金梦/a-19330715">Disney</a>The live -action version of "Little Mermaid" was released simultaneously on Thursday (May 26) in North America and China. However, due to the disparity between the box office performance, it set off a wave of transnational Internet arguments.</p>
<p>African -American actress Hallebailey starred in the fair -skinned heroine Alice in the animation, which was greatly praised by American audiences, saying that Disney played a role in motivating young African -American girls, but the Chinese people did not pay for it and criticized the movie " Excessive politics. "</p>
<p>"Can I go back to my Alier?" A Chinese netizen wrote on Weibo, and at the same time, many netizens said that one of their childhood favorite fairy tale has collapsed. In fact, since Disney's determination of the heroine last year, a large number of Chinese netizens have decided to express their anger and vowed to resist and refuse to watch when the movie was released.</p>
<p>According to the data platform "Yien", the live -action version of "Little Mermaid" earned nearly $ 95 million in North America for 3 days, while only 2.63 million US dollars in China in China. The lowest movie.</p>
<p>Some Chinese netizens pushed the text after the movie was released: "It's really not that I am dissatisfied with the black actor itself. I am not satisfied with the story of the white race and even the yellow race into a black protagonist. And the legend, is it difficult to shoot a movie that really stands from the perspective of black people and truly respects the black culture? "</p>
<h3>加 入 also joined the battle situation</h3>
<p>After the box office was released, some Western netizens accused the Chinese audience on Twitter to resist the film because of the "racial discrimination" of the black people and set off a fierce debate on the Internet. This accusation was even more angered by Beijing. The Chinese state -owned media "Global Times" published an article on the 2nd to refute Western remarks and strongly criticize Disney's decision to choose a "black mermaid".</p>
<p>One of the articles: "Disney forcibly joining the ethnic minority in classic movies is not based on racism, but a narrative strategy that shows its laziness and irresponsibility." The article pointed out that Disney is turning the classic fairy tales into " Politics correct "victims."</p>
<p>Another article strongly denied the accusations of discriminating against blacks in China. "The vast majority of Chinese audiences have no prejudice against the little mermaid," the author wrote, "The main direction of China's discussion is to adapt traditional fairy tales around (Disney)."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T13-35-00Z/65357692_401.jpg" />In the movie "Little Mermaid", the little mermaid living on the bottom of the sea fell in love with the prince on the shore, so he decided to abandon his country and race into humans.</p>
<p>The Global Times pointed out that the West should not "abduct Chinese audiences", hoping that they "accept this movie in the same way ... because the Chinese have no political correctness" and said that from a historical perspective In the case of, it is Westerners -not Chinese -invading Africa, colonial and slavery local races. Therefore, in the face of blacks, the Chinese do not have the "guilt" of Americans.</p>
<p>Dai Yuhui, an associate professor of the Department of Communication and Science and Technology of the National Yangming University of Taiwan, told DW that since the first generation of leaders of China, Mao Zedong, the banner of "internationalism" and "the boss of the third world country", attempts to win Asia, Africa, and Africa, and Africa, Latin America fights against "evil Western imperialism" together. Such a strategy has continued to this day, and the Global Times is the "mouthpiece" that Beijing transmits information on the outside world and conducts a large internal publicity. One of the media.</p>
<p>After Chinese President Xi Jinping took office, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/義大利總理退出一帶一路仍能與中國友好/a-65761538">he promoted the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013</a>Provide huge loans to African countries to build infrastructure such as railways, highways and ports, and invest in local minerals. This has deepened the local control of Beijing, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/债务研究中国对非洲国家放贷利息偏高/a-65491688">BRI Plan is therefore criticized by the international community as "new colonialism"</a>Essence</p>
<p>In addition, Beijing's suppression and assimilation policies for ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet have been regarded as "big Han Sandianism" by the outside world, even though China has so far denied any relevant allegations.</p>
<p>Dai Yuhui analyzed that China is therefore necessary to respond to this matter, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/除了政治正确-中国人无所不能/a-19564058">at the same time, vigorously criticize the term "political correctness"</a>Because this represents the reflection on "racism, feminism, etc.". She believes that China ’s racial controversy of“ Little Mermaid ”is just like the previous“ Ice Cream Incident ”, but Beijing has taken the opportunity to say one of many cases of the West and incite nationalism.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T13-35-00Z/65357680_401.jpg" />Elier was criticized by Chinese netizens in the play, saying that Disney destroyed people's beautiful fantasies about fairy tale</p>
<h3>How do you treat black people in China?</h3>
<p>Over the years, China has discriminated against African ethnic groups, including <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/黑人洗涤后变白中国公司劝莫过分解读/a-19291550">laundry powder advertisements that can be "washed" in 2016</a>, 2018 and 2021 Spring Festival Gala's offense of performers "black face", <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/非洲人在中国广州/a-2337095">and new crown epidemic in Guangzhou in 2022</a>The Chinese authorities have announced that they areolation of African -American groups and many people have been driven out of their homes and hotels, and they have fallen on the streets.</p>
<p>In 2022, a Chinese living in Malawi shot a number of racial discrimination films and was mad by Chinese netizens. One of the films showed that a group of African children were arranged in Chinese and shouted: "I am a black ghost, IQ is very low." Obviously, it does not mean the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>Even though the Chinese government has come forward to declare that domestic discrimination against racial discrimination is "zero tolerance", in real life, black people living in China still have to face discrimination and problems that lack job opportunities. "They (employer) said to you directly:" Sorry, we want white people "](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/对不起我们要白人/a-62431699), "A African who has lived in China for 13 years said in an interview with Deguang Lian (ARD) last year.With the improvement of Western society's awareness of "political correctness", in the casting controversy of "Little Mermaid", the Chinese circle seems to be more unable to accept the black heroine compared to Western audiences. In this regard, He Jie, a columnist living in the UK, wrote in the "Change of the Daily": "I thought about how the Asian community defended white nature. It is found that many people are not deliberately choosing, but" I didn't think so much so much. "Many people do not realize that white hegemony such as white people and unconsciously advocating white aesthetics, which makes white people have many advantages to exist."</p>
<p>Dai Yuhui told DW that China does also have the thinking of "white first", "but they love and hate the white world, that is, China wants to replace whites and the United States becomes the world's first. You, but I am not you, so you will be extremely sensitive and cared for what you do.</p>
<h3>Defending China -Africa relations</h3>
<p>In the report of "Global Times" criticizing "Little Mermaid", it also emphasized the positive relationship between China and the black ethnic group, and said that Western people's accusations about Chinese discrimination against blacks were "provoking separation between China and Africa."</p>
<p>"China has always maintained a brother -like relationship with Africa, and never needs the" atonement "mentality that Hollywood prevailed." The report pointed out that China ’s support and assistance to Africa is“ visible ”, unlike the West is just“ empty talk ”.</p>
<p>In the past 20 years, China has been the largest trading partner in Africa. However, "Nikkei Asia" reported in March this year that China ’s BRI investment in southern Sahara, Africa fell to a new low last year. Analysts believe that some reasons come from the increase in investment in the United States and the European Union; once Western funds are injected, the leaders of African countries may begin to consider reducing dependence on Beijing.</p>
<p>However, Nigerian political economist UCheigwe told "Nikkei Asia" that China's goal was to win African products with a value of $ 300 billion from 2022 to 2024, and "China has not abandoned Africa."</p>
<p>Taiwanese scholar Dai Yuhui analyzes DW that the purpose of China to unite the third world countries such as Africa is not to "create an equal society." The pyramid structure with black people ". Therefore, even if China replaces white people and stands on the top of the pyramid, the black people may continue to the bottom.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>The initial ally</h3>

At the end of the year, Mao Zedong went to Moscow to visit and stayed in the Soviet Union for more than two months to participate in the 70 -year -old Japanese celebration life movement (picture). After the incident, Mao Zedong complained that he was not well made by Stalin and the progress of the signing talks was not smooth. On February 14, 1950, Mao Zedong signed the "Sino -Soviet Friendship Alliance Mutual Aid Treaty" in Moscow, and the two countries and the Soviet Union were ally.</p>

<h3>"Big Brother" in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>From the 1950s to the early 1960s, it was regarded by the outside world as the "honeymoon period" of Sino -Soviet relations. The two parties signed a series of agreements. The Soviet Union provided China, materials and personnel from trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry aspects. Aid to help China build a complete industrial system. The first "five -year plan" formulated by the Chinese government in 1953 was introduced by the help and planning of the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong emphasized that he would learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects, "the Soviet Communist Party is our best gentleman."

<h3>From reverse to break to break</h3>
<p>In September 1959, the Soviet leader Khrushchev visited China (pictured) to participate in the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. At that time, the contradictions of the differences between the Chinese and Soviet leaders in the political concept and the strategic interests had emerged. In 1960, Moscow recovered all the Soviet experts that recovered China to abolish various agreements for economic and technological cooperation between the two countries. Beijing has carried out long -term sharp criticism of the Soviet Union's "revisionism" and the foreign policy of the CPSU.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war in February 2022, Russia has been sanctioned and isolated internationally. However, China has always refused to condemn Russia's aggression, and accusing the United States and NATO in charge of conflict, opposing sanctions, and calling on the "security concerns" of Russia. At the same time, China has greatly expanded imports from Russia, especially energy imports.

<p>"If you encounter this situation a few years ago, the Chinese government will definitely spend billions of to boost the economy. However, during the epidemic, the Chinese government becomes cautious in spending money to save the city. It is no longer infinite.

South Korea ’s Minister of Defense Li Zhongzheng will hold talks with the National Defense Ministers in the United States, China, and Japan during the Xianghui. Among them, the“ highlight ”is the meeting of South Korea’ s Minister of Defense.</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reports that the South Korean and American Defense Ministers are expected to discuss the exchange mechanism to build a North Korean missile warning information (WarningData). The Three Kingdoms leaders held a third -side talks on the side of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) summit at Hiroshima, Japan last month to decide to improve the level of safety cooperation and the establishment of a system of sharing North Korean missile information as the first step in follow -up measures.</p>
<p>South Korea -Japan Defense Minister will also hold bilateral talks after about four years. South Korean Ministry of Defense officials said that the South Korean Defense Ministers' talks will discuss a variety of bilateral security affairs required for future Korean -Japanese relations.</p>
<p>However, the contradiction between the Korean ship's Japanese machine is actually the biggest obstacle to the expansion of national defense exchanges. The conflict of the ship began on December 20, 2018. The Japanese disclosed that the Korean side was exposed to the Japanese Maritime Self -Defense Force P1 patrol aircraft with a fire control radar. Essence The Korean side said that the Japanese machine made an aggressive action, but the Korean ship did not target the radar. The positions of the two sides have not been loosened so far.</p>
<p>Regarding the talks of the Minister of Defense in South Korea, considering the recent stalemate of South Korea and China, the opinions that the talks are difficult to obtain specific results. It is expected that the South Korean side will call on the Chinese side to play a constructive role in promoting North Korea to stop nuclear guidance, but it is unknown whether China responds. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China recently stated that the current China -South Korean relations are facing difficulties and challenges, and their responsibilities are not in China.</p>
<p>South Korea and the United States did not arrange for the "Xianghui" during the "Xianghui" period, but the possibility of the temporary meeting of the defense ministers of the two countries cannot be ruled out. Li Zhongzheng will also hold talks with the defense ministers such as Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and the European Union to exchange opinions on the Korean Peninsula and regional situations and bilateral defense cooperation affairs.</p>

<p>Perhaps Elonmusk, chief executive officer of the electric vehicle giant Tesla, has to thank the decision to visit China because his trip allowed Tesla's stock price to break the $ 200 mark again, making him the world again the world The richest man.</p>
<p>With the outstanding performance of Tesla's stock in the past few days, Musk finally surpassed the luxury brand group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louisvuitton CEO Bernard Arnault. After all, Tesla's stock is the main source of Musk's wealth.</p>
<p>According to the calculation of "Baron Weekly", Musk's net worth is about $ 216 billion. This includes the Tesla shares he holds, Tesla options, and his shares in SpaceX, The BoringCompany and Neuralink. Twitter is also a significant part of Musk's assets, but according to the FidelityInvestments that helped Musk for $ 44 billion, today's Twitter value is only three of Musk's buying price. One of them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-02T14-08/000000.png" />Today's Twitter value is only one -third of Musk's buying price. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Based on a net worth of $ 216 billion, Musk defeated Alno. According to Forbes's real -time figures, the total value of Alino and his family has a total value of US $ 2120 billion.</p>
<p>Musk is with Tesla's strong stock and relatively weak LVMH stocks, narrowing the distance between the two's wealth. Tesla's stock price has risen by 29.45 % in the past month, but Tesla's stock price has risen 11.22 % during the past five trading days, that is, Musk's visit to China.</p>
<p>At the same time, general investors are worried that the global economic slowdown will have a negative impact on the demand for luxury goods, resulting in LVMH's stock price falling by about 8 % in the past month.</p>
<p>The third place in the global rich list is Jeffbezos, the founder of Amazon.com. Fourth, fifth, and sixth are Oracle co -founders Larryellison, Microsoft co -founder Bill Gates, and Warrenbuffett. The wealth of these six people alone reached 933 billion US dollars.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-02T14-08/000001.png" />Market news is rumored that Arnold plans to visit China this month. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Whether it is the richest man or sneering in the crown, Musk and Alino must be very rich. Although I don't know if these rich people care about this ranking, market news has been rumored, and Arnold also plans to visit China this month. The trip to China this time coincides with China's economic recovery last month, and the market's demand for luxury goods may be weak. Perhaps his business will make the global luxury stocks that have fallen into this time again to rebound hope.</p>

This is one of the most recent interviews between the two countries.(Associated Press)In April this year, South Africa's African National Congress(Non -National University)A senior officer delegation accepted the party's invitation from the Russian ruling party -Russia's ruling party -ruling party. The delegation went to Moscow to discuss the so -called "reshaping of global order" by the Non -National University, and the delegation includes the country's deputy minister of Foreign Minister Alvin Botza.</p>
<p>This month, the South African Army Commander Lawrence Mbbata visited Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Army Commander Oleg Sayakov, which was called a "friendly visit". South Africa National Security Minister Kunborah Endchavini will also visit Russia a few days later, and then South Africa President Rama Tosa will visit Russia and Ukraine under the framework of African Leaders' Peace Delegation.</p>
<p>Although there is a long -term relationship between South Africa and Russia, South Africa has publicly insisted on maintaining neutrality in the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Now, before the BRICS Summit will be held in August this year, the neutrality of South Africa will be tested before the BRICS Summit will be held in August this year.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Putin and accused him of forcibly bringing Ukrainian children to Russia.</p>
<p>South Africa is one of the signed countries of the International Criminal Court. Under such circumstances, if Putin set foot in the country, South Africa will be obliged to execute the arrest warrant. The Russian leader has confirmed that he will attend the meeting, thus laid a foreshadowing for a dramatic diplomatic difficulties.</p>
<p>In fact, South Africa has stated that it is evaluating its legal options, including exemptions to visiting officials.</p>
<p>South African officials told the parliament on May 2, "We will explore how to make the Roman Statue(Founding Treaty of the International Criminal Court)In my country ’s localization, it also includes the practice of exempting diplomatic exemption to the head of state visiting my country. "</p>
<p>Former South African President Mobki has said that Putin is unlikely to be arrested in the country, which is also in line with the emotions within the ruling party. In April of this year, Lama Tosa said that the country is considering withdrawing from the International Criminal Court. But a few hours later, his office denied the statement and said that the position was caused by a mistake in communication.</p>
<p>In 2015, South Africa failed to arrest the then Sudan President Omar Balle -the latter was also the object of arresting warrant issued by the International Criminal Court at the time. But this time, the situation is slightly different, because there seems to be an unknown relationship between Belleka and Moscow.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-02T14-16-31/image-1685715032.jpg" />BRICS expansion: The Economic Group discusses absorb more member states(news agency)#### "irrational feelings" between Russia</p>
<p>Over the years, the relationship between South Africa and Russia has troubled Western authorities and governments.</p>
<p>There is no cultural and language connection between the two countries.</p>
<p>Russia is not the main trading partner of South Africa -the United States, Britain and the European Union account for more than one -third of South Africa's total imports, while Russia accounts for only 0.4%.</p>
<p>In October last year, when the UN General Assembly condemned Russia to vote for the issue of war on Ukraine in February 2022, South Africa had voted abstain from many other African countries. Finally, the resolution was supported by 143 votes. At that time, South African resident representatives at the United Nations emphasized that the country "will persist in seeking peace."</p>
<p>Regarding the reason for South Africa's unwillingness to criticize Russia, a widely spread explanation is that South African policy makers are eager to see a more polar world, and in such a world, Africa and Asia will get on the global stage around the world. More control, including seats within the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>"We don't want a hegemonic United States, but said" we are a rational international participant in the United States, "said Things. This is not romantic ... Global order needs to be changed. "</p>
<p>Belleria's preference for Moscow -just like the National Defense Minister of the country and the member of the South African Democratic Alliance, the so -called "irrational feelings" between Russia, can trace traceable To the root cause of the Non -National University.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-02T14-16-31/maxresdefault-1685715092.jpg" />South Africa's position on the Russian and Ukraine War(Peninsula TV Station)The African National Assembly was established in 1912. It is the oldest liberation movement in Africa's history and aims to oppose the rule of minorities in South Africa. During the most intense period of the Cold War, it was seriously dependent on the support of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The former South African ambassador to the United States, Ibrahim Ruser, told a reporter on Peninsula that the movement "did not receive Western support, and the Soviet Union was the only ally who was willing to give the party time."</p>
<p>When no one else is willing to do this, the Soviet Union provided a large number of urgent financial and other support to the Non -State.</p>
<p>According to Russian historian Elena Frathov, during the 1960s, the Soviet Union "spear to the AU(Couch)Provide weapons, ammunition and equipment, and conduct military training for its cadres and leadership. "</p>
<p>She wrote, "No other countries have provided such support to Africa University."</p>
<p>Professor Zwelinzima NDEVU at the University of Statunbos agreed to this.</p>
<p>In an interview with a reporter from the Peninsula TV Station, he said that the Soviet Union "supported non -State's University with financial assistance and training in the dark days of racial isolation." "Now, by 2023, this relationship still exists. This is this that is. The reasons for the country's conflict between Ukraine and Russia. "</p>
<p>But some people think that this is a complex relationship.</p>
<p>In 2014, during the President of South Africa in Jacob Zuma, South Africa and Russia reached a $ 100 billion nuclear power plant agreement. But three years later, a local court's order prevented the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p>South African opposition and civic society believes that this agreement is trying to give Russia's influence on Africa. Zuma was a senior member of the African National Congress, and before the end of the race isolation, he was a member of the national spear, the person in charge of the movement of the movement, and had a long -term relationship network in Moscow.</p>
<p>Lausur said, "We suspect that Zuma wants to sign the motivation for this agreement", "we know something wrong. Some people try to turn us into a country where thieves rule."</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that even today, Russia seems to be forcing South Africa to take action.</p>
<p>Analysts Fan Siliden told a reporter from the Peninsula that the visit to Moscow in April this year was to contact them and "let the Russians understand the dilemma of South Africa." Senior politicians came to participate in Putin.</p>

<h4>friction and sanctions</h4>
<p>South Africa's non -promised position has triggered friction between it and the United States (one of South Africa's largest political and trade partners).</p>
<p>In May of this year, the US Ambassador to South Africa Ren Bridge accused South Africa for providing weapons for Russia, and claimed that he had stopped weapons on the Russian merchant ship "Lady R" at the naval base in Simmons last December.</p>
<p>Since then, the South African authorities have been denied this in the public relations offensive.</p>
<p>South Africa, Russia and China have recently held naval exercises. However, these measures have triggered a strong protest from the opposition party in South Africa and let them question the neutral position of South Africa in the Russia -Ukraine conflict. At a press conference held in May this year, Brigiti said, "We hope South Africa will begin implementing its unprecedented policy."</p>
<p>Professor Endu told a reporter from the Peninsula TV station, "On paper, South Africa is neutral", "But in reality, in my opinion, we must not."</p>
<p>In a recent statement issued by John Stenhason, the leader of the South African Democratic Alliance Party, "Many of their recent actions have shown that the Anti -National University has firmly formed an alliance with Russia."</p>
<p>Stetenhason added that this ambiguous can cause serious economic and social damage to the country. Once foreign sanctions are subject to foreign sanctions, it may cause the loss of thousands of jobs, and the country and Western countries are worth billions of South African Rand in South Africa Rand. Trade loss.</p>
<p>In May of this year, a few days after the Southern African exchange rate fell by 2.4%in the Southern African Rand's remarks, South African Reserve Bank warned that if the United States imposed sanctions on South Africa according to these allegations, the country's economy may be damaged Essence</p>
<p>The bank warns that any such punishment will make it "unable to provide financing or investment in any trade or investment, nor can it be paid or collect any money from the agency bank."</p>
<p>But the resistance from different aspects has not changed the position of the South African government.</p>
<p>Endchavini recently pointed out in a debate held in the parliament that "South Africa will continue to support the efforts to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and as a country and global participants, we believe that this conflict should pass through The way of peaceful negotiations and contact is over, not the favor of any of them through South Africa.

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The foreign minister of the BRICS Group held a talks in South Africa on Thursday (June 1), calling on the world order to "re -balance" and declare the ambition to compete with Western powers.</p>
<p>Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyamjaishankar said in his opening speech: "We gather here, we must send a strong signal, that is, the world is polarized, it is re -balance, the old method cannot solve the new situation."</p>
<p>He said that the concentration of global economic power "allows too many countries to be subject to too few countries"; as a "symbol of change", the BRICS countries must take corresponding actions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T14-26-00Z/65799764_401.jpg" />The BRICS 5 was held in Cape Town, South Africa on the 1st</p>
<h3>What did the BRICS Foreign Minister discuss?</h3>
<p>BRICS 5 countries -Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — were once regarded as loose alliances of different emerging economies. In recent years, the group has become more united under the promotion of Beijing. Since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/金磚峰會習近平批西方制裁-分析稱中國助普京重返國際/a-62228080">Moscow</a>It also provides additional driving force.</p>

New Development Bank (New Developmentbank) is also known as the BRICS Bank; the BRICS countries are more convenient for each other's settlement and loans, so as to reduce dependence on the US dollar and euro](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国用人民币向美元发动主攻/a-15798875)And jointly propose to establish this international financial institution.</p>
<p>South African Foreign Minister NaledIpandor said that international unilateral sanctions will indirectly affect countries that have not been involved in sanctions. Therefore, the BRICS countries want to seek alternative currencies to ensure that "will not become a victim of sanctions."</p>
<p>Member states have also discussed how to reform the global decision -making process. Pan Duor has criticized that there is no permanent representative of Africa in the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p>Most options supporters said that they are currently voting to the option party because of their disappointment and sense of distance (67%), and only one -third (32%) people think their claims and options parties It's closer to convince it.</p>
<h3>Refusing refugees</h3>

The results show that the attitude of foreign immigrants is the most important issue, and two -thirds of the people mentioned. 47%of people think that the current debate on environmental, climate and energy issues is important, and 43%of people think that economic problems are important.</p>
<p>The German ruling party has argued for several months for the heating system for climate protection. Roberthabeck, Minister of Economic Affairs of the Green Party, hopes that starting from 2024, only the heating system driven by at least 65%of renewable energy. The government also hopes to ban natural gas and fuel heating during the transition period. This clearly differentizes the people. 45%of the respondents agreed to the ban in principle, and 49%did not agree. 67%of people are worried that the measures to replace the heating system will bring them overweight. Haber's support also dropped from 30%to 23%.</p>
<p>80%of the respondents and most Social Democratic Party believe that the three -party joint government spent too long in solving the problem and lacks a clear direction.</p>
<h3>Provide a fighter to Ukraine?</h3>
<p>Since discussing the issue of providing weapons to Ukraine, Shulz has been hesitant for many accusations. At the G7 summit held in Hiroshima, Japan, several Western countries including the United States announced that they planned to provide Ukraine with the US F16 fighter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-02T14-30-00Z/49332287_401.jpg" />European Fighter of the German Defense Force</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/乌克兰国防部长希望德国提供欧洲战机/a-65769382">Ukraine also expressed his hope to get the "Typhoon" European fighter in Germany</a>Essence However, German citizens' attitudes towards German fighters are still negative. Only 28%believe that Germany should provide, and 64%of them are opposed. Among the Green Party supporters, the proportion of European fighters is basically balanced. Among the supporters of other party factions, the opposition voices dominate.</p>
<h3>Military fire delivery, sanctions, diplomacy</h3>
<p>In general, the Germans' attitude towards providing weapons to support Ukraine has reserved three months ago. Only a few people believe that the weapons provided to Ukraine are not enough.</p>
<p>The evaluation of German diplomacy is not high. More than half of the people (55%; increased two percentage points) believed that diplomatic efforts were not enough. The attitude towards sanction policies has almost no change. 42%of respondents believe that they can expand existing sanctions on Russia.</p>

<h3>John Sebastian Bach: .d Small Ton Takata</h3>
<p>Takata comes from Italian, which means touch. This style of music from Italian Renaissance is improvisation. The music usually uses a series of decomposition chords to alternate the rapid sound steps. It is characterized by fast movement and playing light finger. It is also called touching skills, which represents freedom, enthusiasm, fashion, passion and madness.</p>
<p>Like most Bach Wind piano works, this song does not leave any original manuscripts.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that from the unrestrained enthusiasm, magnificent spirit, and the bold style of chord connection, it is a work of Bach Youth.</p>
<p>The Polish composer Stolkovsky once adapted this song into orchestra, fully showing the majestic and profound mood of the music. Polish pianist and composer Taoisig have also adapted it into piano songs, making it more widely spread.</p>
<p>Please listen to the piano version played by Johnnes Lang.</p>

<p>It is reported that British Prime Minister Sonak is trying to quietly repair the relationship between Britain and China.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that a trade minister sent a trading minister to Hong Kong a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>British Consul General in Hong Kong, BrianDavidson, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post in early May that Britain hopes to restart relationships with Hong Kong and discuss through cautious and uninvited channels instead of MEGAPHONEDIPLOMACY and revealed that Senior officials on both sides will visit each other.</p>
<p>British Foreign Minister James Cleverly is expected to visit China within a few months.</p>
<p>However, Sunak did not meet in Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in person like France, Germany and Spain leaders.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter said that Sunak is unlikely to visit Beijing before the next election in the UK, so as not to make people feel that he tries to please China through high -level interviews.</p>
<p>This reflects the dilemma facing Sunak. When he tried to lead Britain to expand the diplomatic space of Brexit, alienation Washington or Beijing was unbearable for London.</p>
<p>Sunak must also respond to domestic, especially his conservative party, increasingly increasingly trust China.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter said that Sunak didn't want people to feel that he was rewarding China through high -level interviews. As for whether Sunak's measures can make China feel satisfied, it is unclear.</p>
<p>Another person familiar with the matter revealed that Beijing also hoped that Britain would send a senior economic or trading official and a commercial delegation to visit China, instead of sending foreign ministers to China.</p>
<p>A spokesperson at the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal and Development Affairs and the Sunak Office refused to comment on Bloomberg reports.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Hong Kong, 2nd) Investors are optimistic about the U.S. Federal Preparatory Council (FED) this month's meeting will not increase interest rates and allow central bank officials to evaluate the impact of currency tightening policy for more than a year.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-02T15-02-09-00-00/000000.png" />After several months of disputes in the United States and the United States, the Federal Senate finally passed a bill that suspended the upper limit of the federal debt and was preparing to be signed by President Biden. With the suspicion of the US debt default, the market's attention returned to the Fed again to crack down on the inflation rate for decades high.</p>
<p>According to the data released yesterday, the number of new people in the United States in May declined, but it is still better than analyst expectations; salary growth has slowed down for the second consecutive month. The news is welcomed by the stock market dealers.</p>
<p>This data also brings a good sign to the US non -agricultural employment report that will be released later and the more attention in May. The latter is one of the major reference indicators for the Federal Substitute to make interest rates.</p>
<p>U.S. currency decision officials have stated that if they want to stop raising the cost of lending, key factors include the US labor market softened and inflation.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve ’s later month may be the hope of the first time to suspend interest rate hikes for more than a year. Now, two more central bank officials have spoken speeches to add market optimism.</p>
<p>Patrick Harker, president of Philadelphia Fed, advocated that central bank officials should "at least this meeting skipped interest rates."</p>
<p>Philipjefferson, the director of the nominated vice chairman of the Feds Association, also said that it can stop the impact of officials to evaluate the interest rate increase, but it does not mean a tightening cycle stop. His opinions are often consistent with the Federal President Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market closed up by 4.0%under the drive of technology stocks and led the rise in the Asian stock market. The Tokyo stock market closed up 1.2%, and the Shanghai stock market closed up 0.8%. Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Bangkok and Manila's stock market also received red.</p>

These include strengthening the "selection of students", "special post teachers", "three branches and one support", "Western Plan", "Rural Revitalization Plan", "Medical College Special Admissions Graduate Program", "Special Program for University Student Rural Doctors", " The publicity of grass -roots employment projects such as the "Urban and Rural Community Plan" encourages graduates to get off the grassroots and enter the troops.</p>

<p>"The local government is to complete a task. Because the current social instability of the Communist Party of China is a social problem, especially young people."

Beauty data to decorate the peace will only further intensify social contradictions.</p>
<p>Chen Chuangchuang, a member of the National Federation of Aesthetics, told this station that employment is not a short issue. In the next five years, the unemployment rate will become a foreseeable social problem. Political mobilization is not a solution.According to statistics released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China this month, the national urban survey unemployment rate was 5.2%in April this year. Among the labor forces 16 to 24, the unemployment rate is as high as 20.4%, which is the highest level since China announced this number since 2018.</p>

In fact, during the "White Paper Movement", a large number of Chinese women at home and abroad bravely made a sound of resistance to totalitarity. What do they think of the "June 4th"? How do they connect the female leaders of the 89th Study Games of that year?</p>

<p>"Freedom China!This is still our responsibility!The Communist Party stepped down!Xi Jinping stepped down!June 4th is not history!Instead of our political reality!" The Que's in the last year of the university undergraduate in the UK, stood on the special day in London. A corner of Lafaya Square.

<p>Even though she shouted her throat, she still worked hard to keep her voice. "What do you want to do on the street? Just shout loudly, you just want to grab the right to speak!It has always been that men are more likely to grab the right to speak. Why? Because women are ruled, let you not speak, and then men's voice I have never been a woman. Then I have realized this, so since then I have been talking loudly, I am not a obedient little girl. "</p>

<p>In China to grow up and receive education, Que's said that she had a blurred understanding of the "June 4th" in the past. She only knew that "very bad things" had happened in Tiananmen. Until I went to study in the UK, after being asked by local classmates, she was asked, and she was asked by local classmates. She was asked by local classmates.

<p>On the other hand, she also re -reflected that the Eighth and Ninth Study Games, which is a precedent for the Chinese resistance movement. She believes that this movement is dominated by men, and women are more logistical. However, their contributions have been ignored in the past 30 years. "When I have learned some of the more familiar theories of feminist, such as power levels, inequality of power, and how women are exploited by invisible ways, and why women are always erased in history.

During the 89th school movement, Wang Chaohua, who participated in the Beijing University Student Autonomous Federation (Gao Zilian), was a few female student leaders of the year. The Beijing Public Security Bureau released only two women two women and Chai Ling released by the 21 -person wanted list released after the "June 4th". Wang Chaohua recalled that at the end of April 1989, a few days after Hu Yaobang's memorial service, when she first went to Peking University to meet with the student leader, Chai Ling brought her to a boys' dormitory and introduced Feng Congde.</p>

The room was full of boys. The girls were more assisted from the side, so that she felt the gender difference: "For example, I from us from us When the school goes to Peking University and other schools, to see the status of sports, to understand and communicate, you must go to every school for a boys' dormitory. Yes, positive girls have basically become the secretary of active boys, and girls are basically auxiliary and supported characters. "</p>
<p>Wang Chaohua is 37 years old during the school movement. He is the older graduate student among the student leaders. Therefore, he has won the respect of other student leaders. It is comparable to women's identity and free voice. Looking back at that year, Wang Chaohua believed that she and Chai Ling played different roles in the academic movement, but they couldn't get out of gender: "I am a role that is much older than everyone, and then can play a balance. A weak, passionate, pure, and ideal image. From the beginning of the hunger strike to the end, there is a strong appeal image. "</p>

"Of course I have been there, I am a woman in myself, but my gender identity is basically marginalized, or wiped out. For more than 30 years, you are the first to find me. From a gender perspective, more than 30 years. Although as a woman, although they are commemorating each year, this gender role is erased in history. Or marginalized. "</p>
<p><strong> The feminist voice absent from the 89th school movement </strong> **</p>
<p>From the perspective of Beijing citizen Lu Jinghua at that time, although there were not many female leaders in the school movement, many women participated in miscellaneous and supported work. At that time, she opened a clothing store in Beijing. She was infected with students' movement. She simply closed the door and did not do business. She pushed a bicycle to raise donations and send materials for students: "I watched a group of students holding donations boxes, and a group of students were in Tiananmen Square is on a hunger strike. Then many students are from other places. They do n’t eat or drink. We can support it if you can support it, because after all, it is a foreign child. We can give it a little help. "She said," Anyway At the time, the citizens came to support, and they were particularly actively given some supplies. The soda bought at home, a box of boxes and a box of buns and buns at home. "</p>
<p>Lu Jinghua also joined the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation (Workers' Union) to organize the workers' movement. She served as the latest news of the broadcasting campaign on Tiananmen Square, as well as the manuscripts of various masses to spread the voices of workers and different groups. Looking back at the time, she said that students and the masses had the demands of anti -corruption, fighting for the rights and interests of workers, and political reform, but they had hardly heard the voices of fighting for women's rights.</p>

<p><strong> After the "June 4th", political reforms ended women into political vases </strong></p>
<p>Wang Chaohua also said that she participated in the Beijing university student dialogue delegation. When the student was preparing to talk to the government, the feminist appeal was never included in the agenda. However, in fact, she believes that the social status of women during the 1989 Studies Games retreats during the Cultural Revolution. The reason is that after the CCP has gone out of the Cultural Revolution and entered the economic reform, many social issues including men and women, including men and women, have been abandoned.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong advocated that "women can top half the sky" and encourage women to get out of their families and participate in the public domain. However, Wang Chaohua believes that with the end of the political reform in the "June 4th", the social status of Chinese women is getting lower and lower -the social tradition is increasingly required that women should be obedient; in the political system, women have become vases and become more than vases and become even more become more vases and become even more. The victims in the struggle of power and nobles: "The economic reform of the nearly two or 30 years, the bureaucrat is basically the noble, and at the same time, there is the right to and money. When it is black and greedy, it often comes out. In the political struggle, the role of sexual services. Not only the officialdom, including the big companies, all of them have become a matter of course and publicly accepted. So this is a social reality that is very unfriendly to women. "</p>

Among the 14th China National People's Congress, the proportion of women is less than 27%. The committee is concerned about the lack of women in China's highest leadership, and urges the Chinese government to increase the number of women in decision -making and government departments. The committee also expressed concerns about the reports of Chinese women's human rights defenders' intimidation and harassment.</p>
<p>Lu Jinghua believes that it is the current system of China that there will be tragedies like the "iron chain girl". However, Xi Jinping's wife Peng Liyuan, although the title of "Women and Children's Special Envoy" of the UNESCO, did not say a word to the situation of the "iron chain woman": "What contribution of Peng Liyuan to Chinese women? Does a singer? Does she go to the grassroots level? Does she know the pain of Chinese women? If you really understand, you really represent Chinese women, and a 'iron chain woman' was exposed in March last year. Chinese women, who spoke at the International Women's Congress, I think it is a violation of the title of women's representatives, which is unacceptable. "</p>
<p><strong> Chinese women who came out of the "White Paper Movement" from silence to explosion </strong></p>
<p>Lu Jinghua said that when she worked as an overseas Chinese human rights agency, many grass -roots women in China were overwhelmed and risked to her. Dissatisfaction with the system.</p>
<p>Wang Chaohua believes that the long -term oppression of Chinese society has made many professional women who have been educated from higher education to participate in the "White Paper Movement" and admire them very much: "White paper sports, we see that standing in front, most Some are girls. Including arrested, they are basically girls. It is really a very eye -catching social change. You can see that feminist consciousness is entering the new generation, and women who have been educated have a conscious consciousness. "</p>

<p>A new study in the United States has confirmed that an unusually dim distant galaxy is the typical representative of the first batch of galaxies in the universe. It is the fog of "tearing" hydrogen atoms of this type of galaxy, ending the "dark era" of the universe.</p>
<p>New discoveries help in -depth understanding of the Reionization process that is vital to the evolution of the universe.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday (June 2) that the University of California Los Angeles issued a statement recently saying that the researcher at the university cooperated with international counterparts to use the James Wob Space Telescope to study the spectrum number "JD1" galaxy in detail, and and and and and and. It is calculated to calculate its accurate age, structural characteristics and heavy elements.</p>
<p>JD1 was first discovered in 2012. Behind a huge galaxy group, the gravitational lens effect of the galaxy group enlarged its brightness by 13 times, allowing people to discover it.</p>
<p>The new study published in the British "Nature" magazine shows that the shape of the JD1 galaxy is complicated, and the volume and quality are much smaller than that of the Milky Way. Its light presents a scene in which the universe is only 480 million years old. Judging from the actual brightness, it is the typical galaxy that ended the "Dark Age" of the universe.</p>
<p>Researchers pointed out that due to observation technology, most of the most distant galaxies discovered before were brighter and scarce. They were not representative in early galaxies. The theory believes that the main contribution to the universe is the main contribution of the universe, but they are wrapped in neutral hydrogen atoms and are difficult to observe.</p>
<p>After the Big Bang of the Universe, with the expansion and cooling of the universe, protons and electronics were combined into neutral hydrogen. At this time, the first batch of stars and galaxies had not yet been born, and the universe entered the "dark era" without light. Hundreds of millions of years later, the first batch of high -energy ultraviolet rays issued by the star and galaxy caused the hydrogen atom to ionize and opened the "reconstruction era", and the universe became more and more transparent.</p>

Recently, the United Nations human rights experts have paid attention to the Tibet Autonomous Region's compulsory vocational training plan and forced labor, which is similar to the situation of Xinjiang Uighurs. According to UN experts, since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Tibetans have "shifted" from traditional rural life to low -skills and low -income jobs. The Tibetans living in the United States are working hard for the inheritance of Tibetan language, culture and religion. They also said, "Once you lose your language, it is easy to lose your culture." In this episode, let's find out together.</p>
<p>A UN human rights expert expressed concerns that allegations about the compulsory vocational training plan and labor transfer of the Tibet Autonomous Region in China may affect the human rights of Tibetans, similar to the situation of Xinjiang Uighurs.</p>
<p>The UN contemporary form slavery special reporter Tomoya Obokata and other United Nations experts said that these projects were used to destroy Tibet's religious, language and cultural identity, as well as supervising and political instillation of Tibetans.</p>
<p>In a press release issued by the UN High Commissioner's Office of Human Rights on April 27, Xiaobao Fangzhi also warned other people that these projects could cause forced labor.</p>
<p>Xiaobao Fangzhi also said that he was waiting for the translation that the Chinese government responded. The Chinese government had previously stated that participating in professional training programs was voluntary. Professor Xiaobao Fang Zhi, a professor at the International Human Rights Law, also told Liberty Asia on April 28th,</p>
<p>"But in practice, according to the information obtained from various channels, many times Tibetans have no choice, so they can only accept it. I don't say that all situations are unwilling because there is no clear evidence in this regard. ... but similar to Xinjiang's situation, there may be signs of some forced labor, so this is why we ask the Chinese government to provide clarification and reply at this stage. "</p>
<p>In 2017, after the Chinese authorities began to detain Uighurs in the "re -education" camp in Xinjiang, some Uighurs were forced to work and other rights. The Chinese government said that these camps are vocational training centers to prevent religious extremism and terrorism in turbulent areas.</p>
<p>In a 20 -page report released in August 2022, Xiaobao Fangzhi also said that Xinjiang's Uyghur, Kazakh and other ethnic minorities were used as agricultural and manufacturing departments under the stipulated systems stipulated by the two countries. Forced labor, ethnic minorities are detained and forced to accept work resettlement or become extra labor farmers.</p>
<p>According to the report, similar measures have also been adopted by neighboring Tibet. The extensive labor transfer plan has shifted Tibetan farmers, herders and other rural workers to low -skills and low -income jobs.</p>
<p>The Chinese government restricts Tibetans as a Buddhist political activity and peaceful expression culture and religious identity.</p>
<p>Tibetans often complain about the discrimination and human rights of Chinese authorities, as well as policies they mean to eliminate their nation and cultural identity.</p>
<p>UN experts said in the press release: "The Tibetans are traditionally have relatively advantageous sustainable livelihoods, such as wool and dairy products to turn to the low salary and low skills of manufacturing and construction."</p>
<p>They then pointed out that the Tibetans shifted directly from the training center to a new workplace, but they did not know whether they agreed with these tasks. However, experts said that due to the lack of supervision, it was impossible to determine whether the working conditions constituted forced labor.</p>
<p>Xiaobao Fangzhi is also worried about other people. The vocational training plan "aims to promote the development of non -diversified, single races, and single ethnic countries, which violates the provisions of the prohibition of racial discrimination by the International Human Rights Law."</p>
<p>They call on China to provide detailed information to explain measures taken for Tibetans to choose to withdraw from vocational training and labor transfer programs, supervise the working conditions of Tibetans at a new work place, and ensure that they respect the religion, language and cultural characteristics of Tibetans.</p>
<p>UN experts also submitted a letter to the Chinese government, expressing concerns about Xinjiang's mainly Muslim Uyeuristic ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Xiaobao Fangzhi also said: "We have seen a similar model in treatment, so this is why we have to express concerns about Tibetans at this time."</p>
<p>In addition, Tibetans are committed to cultural heritage. Nine -year -old Tenzing Kunzang Gyanakwa stepped forward to pick up the microphone. He stood in front of about 60 students, teachers and parents gathered in the center of the community.</p>
<p>He told the crowd with a clear voice that the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama Dalai Lama was "simple and powerful" in a children's book. Dan Zeng wore a blue Tibetan shirt with golden border and tassel, telling about "seeds of compassion". He said,</p>
<p>"The Dalai Lama believes that cultivating compassion can make us happier and more fulfilling, and it can also have a positive impact on others."</p>
<p>Danzheng's Sunday afternoon lecture is part of the opening ceremony of the Tibetan school every week. The school is located in a community center in Vienna, northern Virginia, Washington. Volunteers teach Tibetan to children aged 3 to 18. Essence</p>
<p>This self -funded school is one of the 36 schools in North America, where about 36,000 Tibetans live — the largest Tibetan community outside India. About 400 families live in the Greater Washington area.</p>
<p>The goal of the school network is very simple, and it is becoming more and more important: in the face of the Chinese government's attempt to suppress it, it keeps Tibetan language and culture.</p>
<p>China forced the Tibetan Autonomous Region and other Tibetan children to separate from Tibetan children and family members into Chinese provinces (such as Sichuan and Qinghai), and then sent to boarding schools taught in Mandarin.</p>
<p>This is just one of the many measures that Chinese authorities try to erode Tibetan lifestyle.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities prohibit the sending boys and girls under the age of eighteen to the temple and the nuns and close the religious school.</p>
<p>They implement strict surveillance on Tibetans while restricting their connection with overseas Tibetans. They forced collection of biometric data and drove the herdsmen out of their ancestors. The Beijing authorities even interfered the selection of the next Dalai Lama. The principal of the school and operating the school's "Capital Region Tibetan Association"(CATA)Member of the board of directors Gesang Dorji said,</p>
<p>在维也纳举行的开幕式上，在与会者齐唱美国和西藏国歌并诵念佛经后，50 多名学生根据年龄分散到三个教室学习两个小时的藏语。</p>
<p>在一节课上，二年级学生正在学习和背诵藏语中的颜色词。在另一场比赛中，学龄前儿童在学习身体部位词汇方面的功课做得很好，得到了老师用藏语的表扬。</p>
<p>高中学生在开始藏语课之前进行了两分钟的冥想。</p>
<p>课程在周日下午 3 点到 5 点举行，然后是一个小时的唱歌或跳舞。老师都是志愿者，学校向每个孩子收取大约每月 20 美元的象征性费用，用于支付中心的租金。</p>
<p>这所学校于 1997 年非正式成立，当时一名藏人在 1990 年代后期根据一项计划来到美国，该计划向居住在印度和尼泊尔的藏人提供 1,000份移民签证，这名藏人开始在他的地下室向五六名学生教授藏语。</p>
<p>学校遵循总部设在印度达兰萨拉的西藏流亡政府藏人行政中央教育部为在西方长大的藏人儿童设计的课程。课程指导是非政治性的，对中国政府在西藏的政策只字不提。</p>
<p>多吉说：“我们正在努力保存佛教教义，几千年前，我们的祖先费尽千辛万苦去印度把它带回给藏人。如果随着时间的推移我们失去了这种语言，我们将失去所有这些年来一直保存下来的教义。”</p>
<p>多吉估计，有 350 至 400 个西藏家庭居住在大华府地区，其中包括哥伦比亚特区以及马里兰州和弗吉尼亚州北部的部分地区，他们的成年人是 1990年代后期移民涌入的一部分。</p>
<p>但这些家庭也担心他们的孩子会融入美国文化，以至于忘记他们的文化身份和传统。</p>
<p>另一位首都地区藏族协会董事会成员，也是丹增根藏嘉瓦的爸爸丹增诺布说：“所有藏族家庭的恐惧和担忧之一是，我们担心下一代将无法遵循藏族文化和传统，尤其是现在他们更多地融入美国的生活方式和文化”。</p>
<p>在该校任教超过 15 年的次仁拉莫( Tsering Lhamo )对此表示赞同，他说 <strong>，</strong></p>
<p>“一旦你失去了语言，就很容易失去你的文化”。</p>
<p>3 月中旬，该校的两名教师与来自类似学校的大约 80 名其他教育工作者一起在加利福尼亚州举办了为期三天的研讨会，学习如何将社交、情感和道德学习(SEE)Incorporate their education plan.</p>

<p>听众朋友大家好，我是陈爱祯，欢迎您与我一起解读新疆。在过去的一年里，为被关押在中国的亲人寻求正义的维吾尔人，向一个鲜为人知的联合国机构寻求帮助；联合国任意拘留问题工作组对总共八名维吾尔族被拘留者作出了三项裁决。在每一个案件中，它都对中国政府作出裁决，称北京当局通过监禁方式侵犯了他们的人权。裁决虽然不具有法律约束力，但提供了外交官在进行交涉时可以向中国政府提交的文件。此外，在中亚峰会上，北京与五个国家达成贸易和投资协议，但人权组织称，中国对维吾尔人的镇压被忽视了。本期节目中，我们就一起来进一步了解情况，相关人士的谈话由安克录音。</p>
<p>来自新疆的图马利斯.牙里坤说，“每个案例都是一个单独的故事，但更多地证明了中国政府试图将维吾尔人作为一个整体抹去”。图马利斯成功地向该组织请愿，要求对她父亲、作家兼教科书编辑牙里坤·肉孜作出裁决。</p>
<p>今年 3 月，这个由联合国人权事务高级专员任命的五人所组成的工作组要求中国当局立即释放企业家艾克拜尔·艾塞提( Ekpar Asat)、医生古丽仙·阿巴斯(Gulshan Abbas) 和新闻工作者库尔班.马木提( Qurban Mamut)。三人在美国都有家人，马木提是一名自由亚洲电台员工的父亲。</p>
<p>2022年，除牙里坤·肉孜外，工作组还裁定中国政府对喀什一家四口的拘留是任意的。</p>
<p>工作组的决定不具有法律约束力。但对于向该组织请愿裁决的海外家庭成员来说，它们代表了中国侵犯其亲人权利的重要官方确认。</p>
<p>他们还可以提供有用的第三方文件，供外国外交官在与中国交涉时引用。艾克拜尔·艾塞提的姐姐、国际法律师热伊汗·艾塞提(Rayhan offended)explain,</p>
<p>"The report of the working group is their recognition of the Chinese atrocities, and this is a big step forward."</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia called the Chinese delegation to China in New York and the Geneva United Nations.</p>
<p>The opinion pointed out that the Chinese government did not respond to the work group's inquiry about Esseti, Abbas, Mami, and Kashgar Abdullahid family, and added that the Chinese authorities failed to respond. main reason.</p>
<p>The opinion also said that the Chinese government told the working group that it strictly abide by the law when he tried the case of Kun Kun · Ji Zizi, but did not solve other problems.</p>
<p>The Chinese government did not disclose any judicial documents about the detention, but Chinese officials confirmed through sporadic exchanges that except for a detention person, everyone else was sentenced to long -term imprisonment.</p>
<p>In the response, the Chinese government told the working group that Yanyu Kun · Ji Zizi was sentenced to life imprisonment with "splitting the country and destroying the unity of the country".</p>
<p>Officials of the Chinese Consulate in Istanbul told Turkish residents Nurssman Abdullahid that her father Abdullahid Turpi was sentenced to nearly 17 years for "disrupting social order and preparing terrorist activities" for nearly 17 years. In prison, her mother, Taguri Cardir, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for "ready to carry out terrorist activities."</p>
<p>Abdullahid later learned that her brother Muhammad Ali was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but she had never heard of her other brother Aimai Titanjiang.</p>
<p>Gulian Abbas's daughter, Ziba Mulati(Ziba Murat)The words were quoted "a person who was exposed to sensitive information" said that in 2019, Abbas was sentenced to 20 years in prison for terrorism.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington was a senator Chris Kanes in 2020(Chris Coons)An email in the office stated that Ecbiel Esseti was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was convicted of conviction. According to Xinjiang officials interviewed by Radio Free Asia last year, Kurban Mumimiti was sentenced to 15 years in prison for "political crime".</p>
<p>These rulings reflect the concerns of some family members, that is, the detainees may become the goal for their relationship with the United States.</p>
<p>Mami's son Bahram Sintash is a digital content producer of Radio Free Asia. In February 2017, shortly after Mumimi visited the United States, Bykramu lost contact with his father.</p>
<p>Acet disappeared three weeks after participating in the US State Department's leadership training program. Abbas's last contact with the outside world was in September 2018. A few days ago, her sister in the United States delivered a speech that accused the Uyghur infringement of human rights. "Uyghur intellectuals like my father who served Radio Free Asia," Uyghur intellectuals like my father are the first victims of the Chinese government to suppress the Uighurs. I strongly ask the Chinese government to respond to the call of the United Nations working group and release my father unconditionally. Let him and my mother live for the rest of his life. "</p>
<p>According to its website, the UN arbitrarily detention problem group held three meetings in Geneva each year and issued about 70-90 rulings each year. The working group said that the Chinese government has not approved its request to visit the country in 2015.</p>
<p>The working group determined that the Chinese authorities' detention of eight Uighurs violated Article 2, Article 3, Sixth, Seventh, Article 8, Article 9, Article 10, and No. 1 of the World Human Rights Declaration Declaration of the World Article 11 and Article 19. China helped draft the document and signed in 1948. Although the Chinese government continues to support the statement, it is not legal binding.</p>
<p>Uyghur activists have long demanded the United Nations to condemn the Chinese authorities' actions in the Uighur region, but slowed down in the Chinese government and opposition with their friendly countries.</p>
<p>In 2019, the United Nations representatives from more than 50 countries jointly issued a public letter to the Human Rights College to praise China's human rights records and China's "de -extremization" and "anti -terrorism" methods in Xinjiang.One month after the report was published, the UN Human Rights Council with 47 member states rejected a proposal to debate the region's violation of human rights in the region. As a protest, 50 UN General Assembly, including the United States, signed an open letter to support the report.</p>
<p>This functional disorder makes any UN ruling -even from a five -person working group -the Uighurs who seek justice for the family of the detention people are of profound significance. Nurssman. Abdullahid told Liberty Radio,</p>
<p>"I know my family is innocent, but others don't know -they may think that my family has committed these crimes. Therefore, when an international organization released a official report that the Chinese government should release my family, I am very happy. "</p>
<p>The UN arbitrarily detention problem group website said that any family or individual can submit complaints on any detention case to the working group. The Uyghur family in this report submits petitions, hires lawyers, or cooperates with non -governmental organizations to file a case.</p>
<p>After obtaining a positive verdict, Uighur families may be difficult to find the next step of justice for their loved ones.</p>
<p>Abdullahid said, "(After the ruling) I feel confused again because we cannot use this report to deal with the Chinese government. I can't find any organization or individual to use this document to take some actions against the Chinese government. "</p>
<p>However, racial extinction prevention consultant Hano Shadler(Have screen)It is said that the UN ruling can provide useful third -party documents for foreign diplomats in negotiations with China. He said,</p>
<p>"It allows various countries to mention an institution. Although it is not without problems, it is still very important in ensuring human rights."</p>
<p>At present, a spokesman for Senior Commissioner's Office of Human Rights, led by Forter Tilk, commented to Liberty Radio Radio in Radio Asia in the latest report of the working group of the Sales Devitice. It is consistent.</p>
<p>Human Rights Specialist spokesman Jerry Lawrence(Jeremy Laurence)In an email, "We have urged the Chinese authorities to provide information about the whereabouts and status of the detention person's whereabouts and the release of the person who was arbitrarily detained or imprisoned."</p>
<p>Ru Xian Abbas, the executive director of Gu Lixian and the executive director of the Uyghur Movement, said that she hopes that the United Nations has recently paid attention to the Uyghur region to promote the agency to issue a bold statement. She used the Uyghur's preferred name for their homeland,</p>
<p>"The next step they must take is to declare that China has committed racial extinction and harming human crimes in East Turkestan (known as Xinjiang)."</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese government ended the first summit with the five Central Asian leaders on May 19, and reached several agreements to promote trade, investment and security relations.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to provide US $ 3.8 billion in initial financing support and gifts to the region, and said that his government would encourage Chinese enterprises to open enterprises in these five countries to create employment opportunities and development.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping said in his keynote speech: "China-Central Asian relations have a long history, driven by extensive and actual needs, and solid people. In the new era, our relationship is full of vitality and vitality."</p>
<p>In particular, China and neighboring Kyrgyzstan signed a comprehensive strategic partnership, promising to support Beijing to maintain Xinjiang's security and stability. There are 11 million -dimensional n -wers, most of which are Muslim Uyesical who lives under the control of China's increasingly oppressed control. They were detained in the "re -education" camp, tortured and forced labor.</p>
<p>China and Kyrgyzstan agreed to jointly crack down on the "three forces of terrorism, extremism and divisionism, including" East Turkestan Terrorist forces ".</p>
<p>Human Rights Organization and Uyghur Vitamin said that despite similar religious and cultural values, the leaders of five Central Asian countries are the Uighurs who live in the northwestern region of Xinjiang and Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbekistan, and Tajik people who live in northwestern Xinjiang. The suppression is gone.</p>
<p>The World Uyghur Congress stated that it strongly condemned priority to considering economic and trade relations to serve China's expansionist and influence in Central Asia, rather than curbing the continuous racial extinction of Uighurs and other Turkic people.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is eager to expand its influence in the region through trade, investment and diplomatic contact.</p>

The next day of the incident, our Liberty Asian website was reported on the topic of "The Largest Mosque in Yunnan or the Police Conflict Video Exposure".</p>
<p>As of now, the latest progress of the incident that can be found from public news channels can also be refer to our report yesterday report on Radio of Liberty Asia. Human networks are still interrupted from time to time. "</p>
<p>Although this incident also attracted a certain degree of attention from the outside world, the author did not see a media or the netizens who were concerned about the incident therefore thought of it in Yunnan 48 years ago. The so -called "Sandian Incident" or "Sandian tragedy".</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, the Shatian incident was a large -scale uprising incident in the Cultural Revolution during the Cultural Revolution, and eventually ended with the slaughter of the PLA. The massacre occurred in 7 counties in Yunnan Province from July 29th to August 4th, 1975. Among them, Shadian Town, an old city of the Hani Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Honghe, caused a total of about 1,600 civilians ( 866 people are from Shadian), including 300 children, nearly 1,000 disabled, and damaging more than 4,400 houses.</p>
<p>As for the causes and endings of this incident, you can still find some of the articles that have been recorded on the Internet. After the author compares one by one, he believes that a memories article title "The Enemies of the Yunnan Hui -14 Army Blood Shadian Township" relative Reliable.</p>
<p>Liu Jiaju, the author of this article, was a propaganda cadre of the PLA at that time. He bluntly created this tragedy was a troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the local 14th Army, and Deng Xiaoping, who issued the suppression of the suppression order.</p>
<p>The author said here that Xi Jinping, a member of the Central Political Bureau and the first vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Central Political Bureau and the first vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, was in this 14th Army. However, the author verified many parties and found that the number of troops who performed the Sandian slaughter mission should be a Army and an artillery regiment of the 42nd Division of the 142nd Division of the 14th Army of the PLA Army at the time. Leading Staff of the 119 League Command.</p>
<p>At that time, the author of Liu Jiaju went deep into the Kunming Military Region as the editor of the PLA Literature and looked for creative materials in the revolutionary literary and artistic creation learning class. The story he first heard was Liu Shaoqi's daughter's guilty rebellion and was captured by the China -Myanmar border. "The next time it was a division of artillery camps in Zhaoyuan's 14th Army, saying that he was" talking about a negative theme. "</p>
<p>The instructor of this artillery camp said: "Chairman Mao taught us that Chinese reactionaries, relying on us to organize the people to knock them down. If you are reactionary, you will not fell ... One month ago, our army dispatched it a month ago. Our army dispatched it. A infantry regiment and five artillery battalions suppressed a counter -revolutionary riots in Shadian, killed more than 1,300 enemies ... "</p>
<p>The artillery instructor was told by the host of the study class, saying that "the military region has greeted the military region long ago, and the incident is not allowed to be announced. Don't mention it again. "</p>
<p>Liu Jiaju recalled that in the past ten years, I walked south to the north. The instructor revealed that more than a thousand people were really horrified in the news. It not only shocked my soul, but even made me doubt its authenticity. After dinner, I asked him to take a walk outside the camp, and asked him to tell me the story he didn't tell:</p>
<p>Shadian is a production brigade of the Jiejie Commune in Montzi County, Yunnan Province. It is located in the hills. More than 7,200 people in more than 1,500 households are distributed in 8 natural villages. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the rebels in the commune and county used the beliefs of the Hui people as the "Four Old" to break away, closed the mosque, and burned the Coco. Some of the Hui compatriots who insisted on worship were detained, humiliated, hanged or swept out of the house, 14 were died, and 160 were beaten. In order to survive, the Hui compatriots organized the rebellion.</p>
<p>As a result, the local and nearby rebels formed two major factions. One school advocates closed mosque, extinction of religious beliefs, and the other faction is opposite. The opposition between the two factions has developed into the fist, and the knife is moving, and the martial arts spread throughout the province. The people of the Shadian are all the Hui people, and 98 % of the masses have gone to defend the mosque. Essence</p>
<p>At that time, a few counties and cities in the counties and cities were chased by the local opponents without standing, and more than 500 people ran to Shadian to hide. The county revolutionary committee of Honghe Prefecture came forward. With the support of the army, the masses of Shadian surrendered these cadres. After being rejected, the 14th Army sent a camp to the village to search, captured the cadres, and tied more than 1,000 Hui compatriots in Shadian to a big "anti -revolutionary" sign on each person's neck and pulled it to the streets of the county.</p>
<p>Next, because the local people returned to the people, Zhou Xing, who had just become the director of the Provincial Revolutionary Commission at that time, asked the army to send a regiment to surround Sandian. The returning people of Shadian did not show weakness, building roads to confront the road, and the two sides shot shooting and set off the battlefield in nearby counties and cities ...</p>
<p>Next, under the intervention of the central government, the 14th Army executed the central government's instructions for the collection of weapons, and sent a camp to collect the weapons of the Sandian militia and was rejected. Thousands of people in Shadian bombed the PLA out of the village. Both sides were re -ignited.</p>
<p>At that time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China urgently summoned the representatives of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the two factions of the Yunnan Provincial and Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the martial arts. Workers, the PLA must enter the village. Ma Bohua, a member of the Communist Party of China, immediately expressed his decision to support the central government. However, more than a dozen people who represent more than a dozen people, including Aya, returned to the local area. Just as soon as they got off the cars, there were thousands of armed doctors surrounded them, and more than ten pig heads they prepared in advance were buckled all over to the top ten pig heads. On the head of the representative, pulling on the street ...At that time, Zhou Xing, the leader of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, was seriously ill and was seriously ill. He did not forget the struggle. He sent a big member to watch it around Shatian for two days and hurriedly reported to the central government. The 14th Army destroyed this "political bandit".</p>
<p>Who is Zhou Xing? During the war, he and Deng Fa, Kang Sheng, Li Keong and others were listed as the main person in charge of the CCP's hidden front. Zhou Xing's life is killing. In the Central Soviet Area of the early 1930s, he served as the executive minister of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Defense Administration, together with the killing demon Li Shaojiu, and killed 100,000 "AB groups" unnecessary. In the Long March, he was the deputy director of the Legion (Luo Ruiqing), the deputy director of the Defense Bureau, and he was executed by him. For the army's action, he did not leak, and he was killed by him who could not act. When he arrived in Shaanxi and Gansu, he was the director of the security guard. In the rectification movement, he grabbed more than 5,000 people. After the four aspects of the army, dozens of senior generals wandered to security guards in northern Shaanxi. Under the instructions of Mao, he detained the interrogation of 17 people such as Xu Shiyou and Wang Jinan. After the CCP's establishment, he was compatible with Luo Ruiqing and served as the deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security to clear his best. Some people say that the top of his head is blood red. At present, an organization that suppress a Hui -people -made villain is not only a piece of cake, but also a good name for him.</p>
<p>In July 1975, Zhou Xing sent the town's anti -report to the central government and was catching up with Deng Xiaoping. Deng received a report from Zhou Xing and did not need to discuss it, and immediately approved the 14th Army to send troops to attack the "Turbuko".</p>
<p>The author also read another memories article. The primitive author was the 42nd Division of the 14th Army and the 42nd Division of the combat department. He made it clear that the main attack mission was the 126 regiment.</p>
<p>Liu Jiaju's memories article records: On July 29, 1975, a infantry regiment entered the battle preparation position and surrounded eight natural villages such as Shadian. At the beginning they did not look at the "Huimin Detachment" of Xiaodiaidian at all. I did not expect that in order to defend the dignity of their religion, everyone in Shadian regarded death. After a modern infantry regiment forced a day, it was resisted by a special death, and the price of dozens of people had not yet entered the village. This was a heavy casualties they rarely encountered in the domestic war. The commander flushed his eyes and quickly transferred the artillery regiment to participate in the war. The cannon diameter was 122 grenade, 76 wild guns, and 120 heavy mortars. They were all Soviet -style equipment.</p>
<p>Liu Jiaju's memories article stated that the battlefield revenge started in the early morning of August 1. 48 cannons instantly emitted thunder and flashes. Thousands of ejaculation split through the night sky. In the past, the mountains on the periphery of the eight villages of Shadada were rolled up and rolled up. Smoke columns, dance in the air.</p>
<p>For the first time, it was 15 minutes, and the new earth of the shells flickered. As soon as the gunfire stopped, more than a dozen promotional vehicles sounded again, "Surveying quickly, wait for the death without surrender!"</p>
<p>Without much, fried bean -like guns sounded in the brown soil layer, and the back of the Hui people was resurrected again. It told the invaders that the people of Allah would not yield.</p>
<p>For the second time, for 10 minutes, on the plowing mountain, the dense bomb pits were like the puppets on the head, and the gunfire was dumb, but I did not see a white flag. The artillery began to move and shot towards the trenches and castles by various villages. The direct artillery aimed at the bunkers in the building in the village, one cannon, and the work was gone. The artillery stopped firing, and the infantry assault team began to move to the village.</p>
<p>The attacking infantry was not lucky on artillery, and the gunfire of sniper kept sounding in the village. For the first time, the soldiers fought. The offensive and combat formation on the training ground was gone. They shuddered behind the squad leader and never dared to move forward.</p>
<p>The attack was blocked. The commander of the army called the artillery fire again. The commander of the artillery hesitated and smashed thousands of cannon shells into the residential area. Seven thousand people would suddenly become a stall of meat. He asked, Zhou Xing pat: We are suppressing, even if the tile is not existed, we must not lean right!</p>
<p>As a result, thousands of villages in the six villages in the thousands of cannons, instantly collapsed the house, people cried and screamed in the sea of fire, calling for scolding to rush to the crops outside the village. The attacking infantry seemed to be hunting, and the fiery tongue of the machine gun rifle swept to the people who ran away like an ant.</p>
<p>There are more than 600 households in Shadian Village, and the most pop -ups are the most. There are only one or two hundred households in the nearby Tian Xin, Che Beni, Xinzhai, Dazhuang, Maochen, etc., and they are also a broken wall. ..</p>
<p>Liu Jiaju's article described: After the fire was calm, the troops poured into the village to start cleaning the battlefield. A surviving woman suddenly jumped out of the collapsed house and slapped a warrior's head with a brick ... A company's healthy staff rescued an eight or nine -year -old child from the drainage groove. On the way back to the patching house, the little guy pulled out a dagger from his body and inserted it into the neck of the health staff ... an old one ... Mrs., she was bloody, lying on her own broken threshold, closed her eyes tightly.</p>
<p>At that time, the captain of the Central Committee of the Central Committee and the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee entered the then deputy director of the Yunnan Provincial Ethnic Frontier Working Committee of the Yunnan Provincial National Frontier Working Committee, Li Changmeng, who said to his family in the future: the responsibility of the Shadian incident, the central government issued documents Zhong was blamed for the Gang of Four. In fact, Deng Xiaoping was the chief of staff at the time. At that time, he vigorously advocated "rectification" and "beating the soil", which was in line with his claims.</p>
<p>Li Changmeng also recalled to his family: Deng Xiaoping also said that "not enough to fight is not enough to be indignant", I all remember in the notebook.</p>
<p>In the British "Economist" magazine published on October 22, 2011, there is an article entitled "Deng Xiaoping's Heritage"(Deng xiaoping 'is leggacy)Article. The article mentioned that "Deng Xiaoping ordered the army to suppress a Muslim village in Yunnan Province in 1975. That operation caused more than 1,600 civilian deaths, of which 300 children. It can be seen that after 14 years, Deng Xiaoping responded to the student and workers' parades. (That is, the suppression of the June 4th) full of his character. "</p>
<p>It was after reading this text, Li Changmeng's son wrote a memories of the article "Father's Past: Sandian Incident". The article said: At that time, the last and largest controversy was concentrated in the closure of the mosque. And this matter is exactly the most concerned about the Sidadian people. Because the government did not promise the PLA after entering the village without closing the mosque, the people of the Sidian people did not let the army enter the village. Finally, the force was resolved.</p>
<p>It can be seen that 48 years ago in the Sandian returning compatriots, in fact, it was just a massacre to safeguard their religious rights and interests.</p>
<p>In the article of Li Changmeng's son, he also said: When it comes to the June 4th incident, my father often said: "I knew that there would be such an ending, you don’t know him(Deng), he dared to start, and he was very heavy. "" ".</p>
<p>Today, it is the June 4th anniversary, citing historical materials to write this article, reminding people not to forget the June 4th suppression 34 years ago, and also forgotten the Sandian massacre 58 years ago!(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

<p>Japanese privacy regulatory agency issued a warning to OPENAI, an American company in the artificial intelligence chat robot ChatGPT, asking the company to not collect sensitive data without permission.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the Japan Personal Information Protection Commission said on Friday (June 2) that OpenAI should minimize sensitive data to enhance the learning of ChatGPT. It means that if there are more hidden dangers using ChatGPT in the future, the committee will take further action.</p>
<p>Recently, regulators of many countries have strengthened the supervision of artificial intelligence technology, including data collection and usage.</p>
<p>Although Japan has been in a backward position in some advanced technology and technology trends in the near future, the country is considered to have a huge driving force to keep up with artificial intelligence and robotics, because Japan needs to maintain productivity when the population continues to decline.</p>
<p>The committee pointed out that it is necessary to balance privacy issues and potential benefits of generating artificial intelligence, including accelerating innovation and response to climate change.</p>
<p>According to the data released by Analysis Company Similarweb, Japan is the third largest source of traffic on the OpenAI website.</p>

<p>据路透社6月2日报道，美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文(JakeSullivan)当天向军备控制协会倡导组织发表讲话时表示，美国无需更多核武器来威慑俄罗斯与中国加在一起的武装力量，因为美国具有先进的军事能力。</p>
<p>沙利文还表示，只要莫斯科能保持一致，华盛顿将遵守2010年有关战略核武器限制条约的规定，直到该条约2026 年到期，并且美国希望与中俄两国举行军备控制谈判。</p>
<p>报道说，中国在扩大其核武库的同时，与美国在台湾问题上也处于紧张对峙状态。中方拒绝与华盛顿进行减少冲突风险的对话，本周更拒绝了两国防长在新加坡香格里拉对话会期间的会谈。根据五角大楼估算，到2035年，中国的核武库可能会增加两倍以上，达到1500枚核弹头。而威胁要在对乌克兰战争中使用核武器的俄罗斯，今年2月已宣布暂停参与上述战略核武器限制条约。</p>
<p>沙利文表示，美国不需要将核力量增加到超过竞争对手的总和才能成功威慑他们，也不需要部署更加危险的核武器来维持威慑，威慑意味着有“更好”的方法，而不是“更多”的方法。但他强调，上述战略核武器限制条约必须考虑到中国不断增长的核武库问题。</p>

<h3>June 4th Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>The June Fourth Memorial Hall of Hong Kong has been temporarily located in Jiulong since 2012, and has moved to urban universities and Tsim Sha Tsui. It has been repeatedly settled during the new hall site and was forced to close it many times. In 2018, the Branch Federation will purchase real estate in Mong Kok as the new site, and re -opened the museum in April 2019. After the renovation of the rest of the museum in April 2021, it was reopened at the end of May, but after a few days, it was closed again by the authorities on the grounds of "incomplete licenses".</p>

<h4>Lululemon Athletica(纳斯达克证券交易所代码：LULU)</h4>
<p>运动服饰连锁集团Lululemon隔夜不仅公布了超标的业绩，而且也因为中国业务和集团货运成本显著改善，决定上调对全年业绩的预测，带动Lululemon股价在隔夜盘后飙升超过12％。</p>
<p>根据Lululemon截止于今年4月底的第一季度业绩报告，集团的营业增长24％至20亿美元，每股盈利则是2.28美元。而Refinitiv所搜集到的分析师平均预测是营业额19亿3000万美元，每股盈利1.98美元。以这两个上下线指标来看，Lululemon是双双超标的。</p>
<p>业绩报告也显示，集团单单是在中国市场取得的营业额就比去年同期增长了79％。Lululemon在中国总共有71家零售店。</p>
<p>除了业绩超标之外，Lululemon高管们在隔夜还上调了对2023财年的全年业绩预测。他们预计全年净营业额将会是在94亿4000万美元至95亿1000万美元之间，每股盈利则会在11.74美元至11.94美元的区域。</p>
<p>在这之前，高管们曾预测全年净营业额会介于93亿美元至94亿1000万美元，华尔街分析师也普遍预计Lululemon的营业额会是93亿7000万美元。</p>
<p>首席财务官弗兰克(MeghanFrank)就说：“我们产品在全球市场获得良好反应，支持第一季度的业绩表现强劲。再加上我们在中国的销售步伐明显加快，整体的空运费用也下降，使我们的业绩比预期中来得好。我们对第二季度和全年业绩的势头感到满意，这也反映在我们调整后的业绩数字上。”</p>
<p>不过库存一直是Lululemon所面对的一个问题。它的存库在第一季度末增长24％至15亿8000万美元，而且高管们还预计下一季度将增长20％。不过他们坚称集团库存与销售增长速度一致，并表示他们对现有状况“感到满意”。但是他们也承认Lululemon在这方面“仍有工作要做”。</p>
<p>在Tipranks的24名分析师当中，有18名给予Lululemon股“买进”的评级，三名给予“持守”的评级，三名给予“卖出”的评级，一年期限平均目标价是401.05美元。</p>

<p>During the hostage crisis of the US Embassy in Iran more than 40 years ago, the United States began to impose sanctions on Iran. Since then, the scope of sanctions has gradually expanded and its strength has continued to increase. Over the past few decades, the U.S. Congress has successively passed and revised more than 10 related bills including the Sanctions on Iran, and has issued a total of at least 26 administrative orders related to sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>Former Iranian President Rouhani has stated that the sanctions imposed by the US Trump alone have brought at least US $ 200 billion (about S $ 269.2 billion) in economic losses.</p>

<p>Description: After China successfully launched the Shenzhou No. 16 manned spacecraft, three astronauts have officially completed the transfer with the astronauts of the previous period at the Tiangong Space Station on June 2. Observer said that this means that China's manned space technology has made steadily progress, helping the CCP to further preach national strength and consolidate the legitimacy of its regime. Analysts said that although the United States still has technical leadership and experience advantages in the space sector, if the aerospace development is not continuously regarded as a priority policy, it may be caught up by China in the future.</p>
