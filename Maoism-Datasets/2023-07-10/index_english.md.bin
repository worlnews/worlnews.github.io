(Voice of Germany Chinese) Washington will provide a bundle bomb to Ukraine, which is part of a $ 800 million military assistance plan to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion. In a statement issued to reporters this Friday (July 7), US Secretary of State Brillin said that the weapons and equipment in this new assistance plan "[[combat power to strengthen Ukraine](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国防长乌克兰有足够的反攻能力/a-65942860)It is important to help them regain Ukrainian sovereignty and protect their compatriots. "

At the same time, German Foreign Foreign Minister Annalenabaerbock has rejected suggestions for providing such weapons to Ukraine. Belbak said in Vienna that the German government will adhere to the Oslo Convention. Another ally in the United States Spain said it did not support the United States to provide cluster bombs to Ukraine. Non -NATO decision. Spain believes that such weapons should not be used even under "legal defense". British Prime Minister Rishisunak also said that he would not support the use of cluster bombs, emphasizing that Britain is one of the countries that signed the Oslo Convention. He said that Britain will continue to use other weapons (including heavy combat tanks): "Continue to support Ukraine's illegal and unprecedented aggression against Russia."

### American factory overtime to produce ammunition for Ukraine

The Oslo Convention is considered a milestone to restrict the controversial cluster bomb. The convention took effect in 2010. So far, 110 countries have signed, and there are 13 countries to be approved. The signing country promises not to produce, store and use such weapons. However, none of the major powers including Russia, the United States, China, and India have not signed the convention. Ukraine is not in its list, and the proportion of member states in Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe is very low.

The bundle bomb is a form of small bombs into a general gap between bombs and shells. The characteristics of the quantity increase the area and the killing range. Each small bomb is also known as the child bomb. According to the International Red Cross, they can be launched through aircraft, artillery and missiles. In addition to the initial damage caused by ammunition during the impact, the explosive dumb bomb rate of the bundle bomb is also very high, as high as 40%in some recent conflicts. This is also one of the reasons why the bundle bomb is controversial. This means that thousands of smaller unblied bombs are still residual, and it may continue to cause casualties after decades.

People who oppose the use of cluster bombs believe that this weapon has caused "huge damage" to civilians, and "can still hurt civilians for decades after the conflict." The effects of them are similar to mines, and sometimes they are unable to live in a certain area. For example, after the end of the war, some parts of Laos still cannot live.

According to the Human Rights Observation Organization, the Russian army "widely used cluster bombs in Ukraine, leading to many civilian casualties." The international non -governmental organization stated that the Ukrainian army has also used these weapons, leading to "multiple civilians' death and severe injuries."

Some military experts believe that cluster bombs can help Ukraine make progress in a counterattack against the Russian troops stationed in trenches. Russia criticized the US decision, arguing that it increased the possibility of nuclear war. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zaharava said on Saturday (July 8) that the decision of the United States was another "blatant display" of its anti -Russian route, which aims to extend Ukraine's conflict to the maximum. She also pointed out that the decision in the United States is a "desperate move."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has entered the 500th day this Saturday (July 8).

Li Qiang met Yellen.

It is worth mentioning that Yellen met with the retired former deputy prime minister Liu He. The latter has led the Chinese negotiating team in the US -China -China trade war and signed the first phase of trade agreement with the White House with Trump.

Last month, Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" quoted five sources that Liu He still participated in the internal meeting of the Chinese government's economic affairs after unloading all his positions and had a high influence. China will cooperate with the United States in some areas, and other areas have to fight back, and Liu He's knowledge reserves and experience are extremely valuable for Beijing.

He Lifeng, the deputy prime minister of China, who met with the main meeting on Saturday, entered the ranks of members of the Politburo on the "20th National Congress" of the Communist Party of China. At the age of 68, he became the deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission of China in 2014. Essence

At the non -official level, Yellen discussed with many executives at the Huamei Enterprise on Friday, including Boeing, Bank of America, and agricultural giant Cargill. It is correct to try to reduce the effort to rely on China's supply chain.

At noon on Saturday, Yellen, who was born in the college, lunch with six Chinese female economists. The attendees include Golden Carrier. Scholars. Her father, Jin Liqun, used to be the deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance of the Ministry of Finance and the current president of the AIIB.

### The contact of stagnation

Sino -US relations began to be in a trough by the Trump era. After Bayeng came to power, it was slowly repaired. Until August last year, NancyPelosi visited Taiwan in August last year. channel. By November last year, after meeting with Xi Jinping, Biden opened the process of slow repair and planned to visit China at the beginning of this year.

However, in February this year, the Chinese reconnaissance balloon incident caused the restoration process of Sino -US relations again. Until Brintken visited China last month.

However, Brinken had just left the front foot, and in a public event, Xi Jinping said that Xi Jinping was the "dictator", which caused the Chinese to oppose it. Yellen's visit to China is also considered an attempt to continue this repair process.

During the meeting, He Lifeng told Yellen that he regretted the "accident" of hurting Sino -US relations. These incidents caused "the consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries at a summit last year had some problems in implementation."

According to the official Chinese media Xinhua News Agency, He Lifeng and Yellen conducted an important consensus on implementing the first Bali meeting in China and the United States, and conducted a "in -depth, frank and pragmatic" exchanges on the situation of the two countries and the world's economic and financial situations and cooperation in the world. The talks are constructive.

It can be seen that the work of the two sides at this stage still returns to the results of the implementation of the worship of last November, rather than solve new problems.

Yellen's plane arrived in Beijing. The sky appeared in the sky.

### What did you talk about

Although Yellen has a word of criticism of China, she overall continues her tone in the United States, that is, opposition to China and the United States "decoupling".

When Yellen flew to Beijing on Thursday, a rainbow appeared in the sky. It was discussed by Chinese public opinion as a good sign. In the meeting with Li Qiang the next day, the latter also mentioned this detail saying, "Why is it that this is not the case in China and the United States. It is not completely storm. After a round of storms, we will definitely see more rainbow ".

Yellen told Li Qiang that the United States seeks healthy, not the economic competition of "winners to eat", and hopes that there is a set of fair rules to benefit the two countries in the long run. At present, there are important international challenges, and China and the United States have the responsibility to cooperate and show leadership in their respective countries and the world.

At a press conference on Sunday, Yellen also expressed a similar point of view.

According to Reuters, Yellen said that Washington does not seek decoupling with the Chinese economy, saying that it is "catastrophic for both countries and unstable to the world."

She also summarized that a total of 10 -hour bilateral talks with Chinese officials with Chinese officials were direct, substantial and effective, and said that it helped stable Sino -US relations. The purpose of this visit is to establish and deepen the connection with China's new economic team, reduce the risk of misunderstanding, and pave the way for cooperation in the fields of climate change and debt distress.

"Tapping" China has a lot of words, mainly involving three aspects:

Increasing China's "unfair economic behavior" and the coercive actions against American companies, we have put forward serious concerns;

The two sides discussed the issue of the Russian and Ukraine War. Yellen said that Chinese companies avoid providing material assistance to Russia or assisting them to avoid sanctions;

### The most likely cooperation area

Unexpectedly, climate cooperation has become a key point for Yellen to visit China, not a matter of fortune.

In a Saturday's speech, she said that the two largest gases of greenhouse gas emissions in China and the United States to lead the climate actions and call on China to support the United States -led Green Climate Fund. The fund is established to help developing countries. Adapt to climate change and reduce its impact.

Although China and the United States have invested in new energy fields such as solar energy, carbon emissions in the two countries have risen last year.

However, China and the United States are not frank in climatic cooperation. The crux is that China insists that it is still a developing country, so it should be paid by the United States and Europe to pay energy transformation, because Europe and the United States have created most of the carbon emissions in history.

It is worth mentioning that when Biden Climate Special Envoy, Kerry said in Yellen that he would go to China next week to restart the global warming negotiations between the two countries.

### Nothing to talk about?

Yellen's long -term care of tariffs did not occur in public issues.

During the Trump era, most of the products between China and the United States have implemented high tariffs and have not been removed in the Bayeng era.

Within the U.S. government, the support of the abolition of tariffs on China is the Minister of Finance Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Raymond. They agree with the abolition of tariffs to resist inflation.

The opponents are mainly US trade representative Dai Qi. They are unwilling to abandon the important chips of the United States to China, and hope to continue to use tariffs to reshape China's economic behavior, formulate a more strategic China trade strategy to protect the United States Employment.

In May last year, US Treasury Secretary Yellen confirmed in a public speech that she was calling to cancel part of the tariffs on Biden because some tariffs were "not strategic" and hurt American consumers and enterprises. She said, "In my opinion, some of these measures seem to cause greater harm to consumers and enterprises, and they are not strategic in solving our actual problems with China."

After the start of the trade war, the export volume of American soybeans fell sharply, and the price fell to the lowest point in 10 years, which caused huge losses to farmers in the central and western regions.

Yellen emphasized at a press conference that no visit can solve the challenges between China and the United States overnight. Public opinion generally believes that Yellen's visit to China mainly establishes a tough, effective communication channel with China's new economic team, and paving the way for Cry's climate negotiations, rather than solving specific problems such as trade.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The German Federation of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) emphasizes China's importance as the German market. Chairman Peteradrian told Dexin News: "The federal government and the European Union are worried about excessive dependence, otherwise it may have an adverse effect on the economy. This concern is understandable. As a result, companies also hope to further diversify their supply chain. He added that in this regard, political support is important: "At the same time, in Asia, China is Germany and the most important market for European companies to date."

A few years ago, a school I had attended by a child in my child committed suicide under the age of 12. When the child talked to me, it was raining outside. He said, "Mom, you see, the sky is crying!"

Some scholars have studied the "China Health and Health Statistical Yearbook" data pointed out that China's suicide mortality rate in China from 2010 to 2021 decreased significantly, but the suicide mortality rate of children and adolescents from 5 to 14 years old continued to rise. From 2017 to 2021 The death rate of suicide rates of aged and young people 15 to 24 years old is also rising.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-09T23-37-50-00-00/000168250_piclink.jpg)When it comes to Sino -European relations, the first country in most people's minds is usually France or Germany, or Britain and Italy. Few people think of the Nordic countries, and few people think of Sweden directly. Sino -Swiss relations seem to be an extremely rare topic. If we look back at history, we will find that Sweden in 1950 was the second Western country that established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China after the United Kingdom, 14 years earlier than France, which has established diplomatic relations with China in 1964.

Many people may strange the Swedes in that environment at that time to break through various ideological constraints and build diplomatic relations with China? In fact, a large part of the reason is that the essence of Swedish culture is actually the pragmatism of the merchants. This kind of recreational pragmatism can be traced back to the Hansha Alliance with the Rubak as the core of northern Germany in the 12th century. The strong business culture is inherently born to be a supporter of trade liberalism.

** Editor's note: Located in the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau in southwestern China, it is known as the "roof of the world". It is the most developed area of the world's glaciers and the source of many important rivers in Asia. It is also a key area and sensitive area for global climate change. In April this year, China passed the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau Ecological Protection Law and will be officially implemented on September 1. Among them, the study of "strengthening climate change, biodiversity, ecological protection and restoration, hydrological water resources, snow mountain and glaciers in the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau". Studies must first enter the field. Geological scholar Yang Yong has been investigated and studied the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau since the 1980s. In June this year, he was inspected on the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau. He sent us inspection notes last year and this year for many consecutive months, and used first -hand information to show the most primitive records in the wild work and the status of the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau under climate change. **

In May this year, I entered the southeast of Tibet along Hengdou Mountain. Now crossing the lake group on the middle of the north of Tibet, entering the Taklama Gaman Desert in Xinjiang from the Ali Line 219.

In the past three decades, I went to the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau for inspection almost every year. I have experienced the impact of climate change in myself. I also witnessed the changes in the environment and ecology of this "third pole of the earth" and the "Asian Water Tower". In the past few years, El Niopy is likely to happen, or leads to extreme heating up, which has brought many challenges to the climate, hydrology and ecological environment of the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau, which makes me very worried.

The last time the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau Inspection was 2022. My friend, Mr. Ren Wenjie (Chairman of Ningbo Fei Shi), set off from "Bing Chasha" in April -that is, Bingzhong Luo, Yunnan, in observing Walong Township, and reached the Tibet Line in Chada, Tibet -entered Tibet. In this development area of marine glaciers, I watched the Sabapa glaciers, the Qiaqing Glacier, the Czepu Glacier, and the Rinlonbaka Glacier. In July, we first followed the Himalayas, from Yang Zhuoyong to the Shiquan River in Ali, and inspected the river lake along the way. After returning to Lhasa, he turned to the north to Yuedoura Mountain, passed through the Sanjiang source, then turned over Kunlun Mountain, west along the northern slope of Kunlun Mountain, and reached the Alki Mountains into the West Chaidama Basin. Back to Sichuan in early August. This half was inspected in Gobi, seasonal rivers, Yadan and Salt Lake. Two new Yadan development areas were also found during the inspection.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-09T23-42-39-00-00/000186995_piclink.jpg)The coloring of the Laotang Plateau in northern Tibet. The source of the water mainly comes from the glacial melting of the glacier in the south slope of the Tanggula Mountains. Due to the accelerated melting of the Glacier of the Tang Gula Mountain in the climate, the lake has continued to expand in recent years, and the water area is approaching Nami and Qinghai Lake. Picture source: Yang Yong

The inspection is to see the marine glaciers and the Asian continental glaciers in Tibet. Choose April and July because April was the time when the avalanche was high in the southeast of Tibetan, and July was the main flood season. Observing the environment of the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau in different hydrological season can get a more comprehensive understanding. Moreover, in 2022, high temperature and drought, maybe you will see a special hydrological scene.

**high temperature**

It is hard to imagine that the biggest feeling for me to go to the glacier is "hot". During the process of crossing the north this year, it was originally a precipitation season, but every day it was like a sun, and the earth was yellowish.

During the July inspection last year, I didn't seem to be in high altitudes, but in the summer of the Mainland. I remember that in the 1980s, in this season, I needed to wear coats and even cold clothes during the day. In recent years, the sun has been exposed to the sun during the day, and wearing short -sleeved shorts is enough. If it rains or winds, the temperature will decrease, and it will feel cold until night.

Many wetlands, grasslands, or desertized sandy areas around many glaciers have a maximum temperature of more than 30 degrees or even more than 40 degrees.

This is the norm in the plateau. In mid -August in the past few years, we measured the highest temperature of 46 degrees in the ground environment of Zeng Songquan desert in the southwest of the West Snow Mountain West Slot of the Ladan Winter Winter Snow Mountain. In January 2021, I was in Grade Gula, the source of the Yangtze River, and I hadn't set up a heavy snow. Our snow -proof equipment has not been used. The hot sun during the day is roasted, and the surface of the glacier is engraved with deep flowing water.

On the surface of the glacier, we measured more than 10 degrees, and the ice body was above zero, which shocked me a little. Glacier is like an environment similar to oven. It looks very fragile, as if it will quickly melt and collapse quickly.

**glacier**

I have visited the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau many times in the past 30 years and recorded multiple glaciers. Marine glaciers are frequent in snow, and flood disasters often occur. A large amount of stone, soil, and ice crickets are left on the surface of the glacier and next to the glacier. We all observe the traces of retreating through these.

From the beginning of the 1980s to the present, the retreat of several glaciers in the Yangtze River source area is very obvious. For example, according to the contrast between field measurement and satellite images, Gangjiaquba Glacier has retreated more than 2,000 meters in the past half century, while Jiang Gudi Ru Ru Northern Glacier has retreated more than 500 meters.

Jeima Yangzong Glacier in the western section of the Himalayas is the source of the Yarlung Zangbo River. I saw that the ice -cut ice wall at the front of the glacier had become a broken ice slope, and a large ice lake was formed at the front end. It was about 400 meters after 12 years.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-09T23-42-39-00-00/000186996_piclink.jpg)Tibetan marine glacier. Picture source: Yang Yong

During the investigation, I can even hear the sound of water flow and stones from the glacier. In the first stage of the icing tongue, the residual ice tower and the lone ice peaks separated from glaciers are basically unavailable now, indicating that the melting speed of glaciers in recent years is very fast. The front of the glacier is widened, and the ice crickets are flattened, and they are rarely accumulated into a mound. More than 20 kilometers of the source flow section of Qinqu on the upper reaches of the Langhe River, the tributary of the valley glaciers on both sides, and the cross -strait of the Chezu Mito River bed, you can see dozens of large glacier mudslides and ice stones full of riverbeds. In Rinlongbaka Glacier and Anima Qing Glacier, we also encountered glaciers' floods.

China has carried out two glaciers, that is, register the location, height, area and volume of the glacier one by one, and arranged it into a book. Data show that from the mid -to -late 1950s to around 2014, China's glacier area was reduced by 18%. Among them, the Glacier area of the Glacier area of the Himalayas and Himalayas in the south of the Ganglazi Shandong section in the south of the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau and the Shanxi section of the Himalayan section has the fastest atrophy, and the average annual atrophy is as high as 2.2%per year.

The retreat of glacier is only a phenomenon that can be observed on the surface. In fact, tens of thousands of ice lakes are distributed in the Himalayas. The melting and retreat of glaciers have expanded the ice lake, causing serious losses in the underwater ice. Studies have shown that from 2000 to 2020, about 2.7 billion tons of underwater ice quality losses were underestimated.

**water**

July and August are the main flood season, and it should be the most abundant time. However, it was rare in these two inspections. Compared with the normal years of previous years, the water flow of the river is very small. The beaches of some rivers are exposed, and most of the reservoirs are in low water level.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-09T23-42-39-00-00/000186997_piclink.jpg)In recent years, the continuous drought of the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau has decreased in precipitation after summer. Many rivers have decreased flow. Reservoir and power stations are generally at low water levels. Picture source: Yang Yong

In addition to the glacier melting to bring a lot of replenishment to the river lake, there is also the water supplement brought by the thawing of frozen soil. Studies have shown that compared with the beginning of this century, the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau has many years of frozen soil area to the middle of the 21st century (2030 to 2050), which will decrease by about 39%, and by the end of the 21st century (2080 to 2100), it will decrease by 81%. It is difficult to imagine what is the scene of a Qinghai -Tibet Plateau that is basically not frozen.

The increase in the number of lakes and the expansion of the area is not necessarily a good thing. As for my personal observation, it is more about the evolution and unpredictable disasters of the river water system. During the previous inspection, I saw the Big Gongbut Mountains collapsed and landslide in 2000 to form a large flood in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tibetan River. In 2012, the rising decision of the Coco Xili table formed a new riverbed, and the pattern of the flowing water system inside and outside the north of the Yangtze River was changing.

A achievement of the scientific investigation of the second Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China in 2017 shows that from 1980 to 2018, the solid water of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau accelerated melting, and liquid water increased. Mainly the increase in liquid water in the internal flow area in the north, and the liquid water in some watershed in the southern outflow area shows a reduction trend. Scientists use "imbalances" to describe the impact of the "Asian Water Tower" under climate change, and believe that the contradiction between supply and demand of water may become increasingly serious.

Moreover, the water of the river lake seems to increase, but it destroys the water cycle, which may lead to a decrease in water volume. A study of land water resources in the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau published in 2022 found that the land water reserves of the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau from 2002 to 2017 decreased at a rate of about 10 billion m³/year. Seriously threatened its water supply capacity.

** Grassland degradation and desertification **

In the hot Baojie Basin more than 10 kilometers away from the Jaya Yangzong glacier, we saw the ending of the glacier when the glacier was advancing during the small ice period, that is, when the glaciers were temporarily stable, the monopoly position formed on the front end of the accumulation of the front end was formed. terrain. The flood seductive covers dozens of square kilometers in the basin. Today the basin is more like a drought and silent desert.

In the past, the Qiangtang Plateau and Coco, at first glance, were green and sparse green, showing a large amount of vegetation coverage. In recent years, many places here look more like desert or gray Gobi. In the Yangtze River source area and even the upper reaches of the Tongtian River, the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the hinterland of the cocoa, the dunes are getting taller and taller, and they have spread to the desert.

In the past 20 years, the scope of human activities in the Tang Dynasty Plateau and the Sanjiangyuan area has become wider and wider, and the grazing has exceeded 5,500 meters above sea level. The range of grazing has penetrated into the "restricted areas" of cocoa Coco and northern Tibet. Many of the original nomadic areas can be grazing all year round, and even settled in the administrative village under the glacier of the Yangtze River. More than 20 years ago, more than 20 years ago, the "unmanned area" has now been "permanent" for human beings.

In the Yangtze River source area, the closest to Jiang Guding's sand dune chain is only about 20 kilometers. Under the Que Moshan, we found several new -monthly crescent dunes. I don't remember these sand dunes when I passed here in the 1980s.

**Influence**

As for what I have experienced and seeing, the impact of climate change on the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau is mainly manifested in the rise of temperature, rising snow lines, retreat of glaciers, evolution of water systems, grassland degradation, desertification expansion, etc. A series of composite disaster chains have the greatest impact on humans, and at the same time, the natural ecosystem is also facing unknown risks.

In recent years, in the predible Tibetan area, the mountain collapse has formed a large dammed lake, which then collapses and causes the flood to form a disaster chain. There are also many dammed lakes in the southern slope of the Himalayas to make floods. In 2019, the upper reaches of the Jinsha River, the Grand Canyon of the Yarlung Tibetan River, has occurred similar to geological disasters.

Although it continued to high temperature and drought in 2022, there were also heavy rain and snowfall in local areas. Extreme disaster weather is common.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-09T23-42-39-00-00/000186999_piclink.jpg)The dry hot river valley of the Jinsha River has intensified degradation in the process of climate change. Picture source: Yang Yong

The Zhuo Nai Lake of Coco was originally a inland saltwater lake. After the rise of the water surface, it collapsed, shaping a new river, which is connected with the Yangtze River water system, and from an inner flow system to the outer water system. Zhuo Nai Lake may also evolve into a freshwater lake. Each year, Tibetan antelopes will gather to the Lady Lake. Whether its change will affect the habitat environment and the function of the Tibetan antelope and the function of the "big delivery room".

My intuitive feeling can also be confirmed with scientific research to see the impact of climate change on the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau.

In 2019, a research results of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on the global water tower showed that the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau is one of the most intense regions of the world's warming. The new disaster includes glaciers accelerated, lake surface expansion, glacier runoff, and frequent ice collapse. Among the 78 water tower units around the world, the Asian Water Tower occupies 16 units, and it is also the most important, vulnerable and most risky.

In April 2022, the "Third Polar Environmental Science Evaluation Report" issued by the UN Environment Agency believes that the intensification of water circulation has caused geological disasters such as ice lakes and Bingnan. The Qinghai -Tibet Plateau will further become warm and humid at the end of this century, which may cause more geological disasters.

The threat of climate change to the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau is multi -faceted and long -term. Perhaps at the inflection point, we need to take a serious understanding and response. Now, I am on the way to investigate the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau, not only to record but also to protect.

Brazilian doctors, government officials, and UNICEF have warned the Brazilian conventional vaccine vaccination rate. According to official data, Brazil's overall vaccine coverage has dropped from 95%in 2015 to 68%last year.

Experts said that there are many factors that cause the vaccine vaccination rate, including vaccines that cannot be delayed during the vaccination period, cannot obtain medical care, and have declined with dangerous cognition of diseases that have been ubiquitous.

However, experts said that a new factor is worse, that is, a toxic complex made of politics, opposition, and fake messages that broke out during the epidemic situation, and now it is becoming universal worldwide.

Description: Sino -US differences are increasingly expanded. Chip manufacturers have found that it is increasingly difficult to operate in China, but business in China is still the key to their survival. The dependence of the chip industry's dependence on China highlights the close but contradictory economic relationship between China and the United States. Steve Helber/Associateed Press is located in a factory in Manasas, Virginia. Global semiconductor companies like Micron are in an extremely difficult situation when trying to meet the increasingly expanding cracks.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T01-16-08-08-00/00dc-chinachips-jhbk-master1050.jpg)In May of this year, the US -China technology war brought a heavy blow to the Edhata chip manufacturer Micron Technology. Chinese government [Enterprises that prohibit key information](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230523/micron-technology-china-ban/)Buying Micron's chip said the company did not pass network security censorship.

Micron said that this ban may lead to the company's global revenue [decrease](https://investors.micron.com/static-files/5d57ee3a-72f3-40f2-99e5-51322403192b)About one -eighth. However, in June, the chip manufacturer announced that it would increase investment in China and spent $ 600 million to expand a chip -testing factory located in Xi'an, China.

"The investment project highlights Micron's unswerving commitment to Chinese business and Chinese team members," said the company in an announcement issued by the company's social media account.

As the United States and China are increasingly expanding their differences, global semiconductor companies have tried to take care of both ends, but their situation is extremely tricky. The semiconductor industry has become the core issue of technological competition in the United States and China, and both sides have implemented new sanctions and punitive measures.

US officials say American products are used in Chinese military and surveillance projects, which contrary to the national security interests of the United States. The United States has imposed increasing restrictions on the types of chips and its manufacturing equipment that can be transported to China and their manufacturing equipment, and provides new incentive measures for chip manufacturers who actively build factories in the United States, including allocation and tax credits.

However, the establishment of a factory may take a few years, and the connection between enterprises between the two countries is still firm. China is the main market of chips, because many factory manufactured products are used here, including a large number of chips, including smartphones, dishwashers, cars, and computers. These products will be exported to all parts of the world and are also purchased by Chinese consumers in China.

China occupies about one -third of the total global semiconductor sales. But for some chip manufacturers, China accounts for 60%or 70%of its revenue. Even chips produced in the United States are often sent to China for assembly and testing.

"We couldn't press the switch to take away everything from China," said Emily Waynestan, a researcher at Georgetown University Security and Emerging Technology Center.

The dependence of the chip industry's dependence on China highlights that the close but contradictory economic relationship between China and the United States has challenged both parties.

This tension also reflects the trip to China ’s visit to China. She tried to testify carefully and criticized some Chinese actions. At the same time, she insisted that the United States did not intend to cut off the relationship with China.

Yellen [Critical](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230707/yellen-china-companies-meetings/)China's recent punishment measures for foreign companies, including restrictions on some mineral exports for chip manufacturing. She said that such measures are the reason why the Bayeng government hopes that American manufacturers will reduce dependence on China. But she still affirmed the strategic and importance of US -China relations.

"I have clearly stated that the United States does not seek a comprehensive separation of the economy of the two countries," said at the round table conference held by Yellen and the round table held in Huamei. "We seek diversification rather than decoupling. The decoupling between the two largest economies in the world will destroy global economic stability, and it is almost impossible to do it."

Bayeng Government Preparation [Start a lot of investment](https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230104/us-chip-making-china-invest/)The US semiconductor manufacturing industry attracts factories to leave China. Later this year, the Ministry of Commerce is expected to start funding to help enterprises establish chip manufacturing facilities in the United States. These funds [with conditions](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/business/economy/chip-industry-congress.html): Enterprises accepting funds cannot expand high -tech manufacturing facilities in China.

The U.S. government is still considering further restrictions on chips that can be exported to China as an enlarged and finally completing the [Comprehensive Restrictions] introduced in October last year(https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/business/the-biden-administration-is-weighing-further-controls-on-chinese-technology.html)Part of the measure.

According to people familiar with the matter, these measures may include [restricting sales of China](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230629/biden-administration-ai-chips-china/)Advanced chips used for artificial intelligence, new restrictions on Chinese enterprises using American cloud computing services, and restricting [American Risk Capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html)Investment in the Chinese chip industry.

The U.S. government has also been considering stopping issuing licenses to some American chip manufacturers to prevent them from continuing to sell products to China Telecom Corporation Huawei.

Japan and the Netherlands are the location of many advanced chip manufacturing equipment manufacturers, partly due to the pressure of the United States, and they have also applied new restrictions on sales of China.

China has also introduced its own restrictions, including new export controls for mineral manufacturing for chip manufacturing.

When the United States and Europe have all introduced stricter regulatory measures and new incentive plans, when global chip companies choose the next key investment destination, they are increasingly investing in outside China. However, these facilities may take several years to build, which means that any change in the global semiconductor market will be gradual.

John Neuifu, president of the semiconductor industry association representing the chip industry, said in a statement that the continuously upgraded control measures constitute a major risk of global competitiveness in the United States.

"China is the world's largest semiconductor market. Our companies must carry out business there to achieve sustainable growth and innovation, and maintain their position in the world's competitors," he said. "We call for unintentional and lasting damage to protect national security and not cope with the chip industry, and avoid the solution of future conflict upgrades."

Earlier Russian President Putin was also invited, but Lamaguza did not confirm whether Putin was determined on the 9th.

Lamagosa told the media at the African National Congress (ANC) meeting on the 9th: "This summit will be offline entities, and all of us are firmly hope to see each other at the summit." Brick countries have not held physical meetings for nearly 3 years.

In March of this year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrested the order to Putin, accusing Putin's criminal responsibility for Putin's forced migration of Ukrainian children.

However, China and India are not limited by the obligation.

### Is the exemption that allows Putin not to be arrested abroad?

Agence France -Presse pointed out that local media in South Africa had rumored that the country was considering changing the summit to China to avoid its own situation that had to arrest Putin. This arrest order is a diplomatic problem for South Africa. The country has been closely related to Russia since the anti -ethnic isolation period. Since the outbreak of the Russia -Ukraine War in February last year, South Africa has not condemned Russia, claiming to be neutral and called for dialogue.

As global food prices soared due to war, Africa was deeply hit. In June this year, Lamaguza led the President of the Congo Republic, Egypt, Senegal, and Uganda to launch a peaceful plan, hoping to mediate Russia and Ukraine. The plan includes 10 suggestions that claim to ease the situation, recognize the sovereignty of various countries, ensure that the grain exports of the Black Sea are not hindered, and send prisoners of war and children back to their original countries.

According to Reuters at the time, the main points of the African version of the Peace Plan were refuted by Putin. Putin advocates rising grain prices is the responsibility of the West instead of Russia, claiming that Russia has children who protect the theater, and said that the Russian side has never refused to negotiate with Ukraine. Ukraine President Zeroski reiterated the premise of Ukraine's peace plan: as long as the Russian army completely evacuated the Ukraine territory, the two sides could start a dialogue.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T02-35-17-08-00/08db-shum-wjpg-master1050.jpg)Shen Dong is one of the most widely connected businessmen in China. He and his ex -wife Duan Weihong used the relationship with high -level government officials to establish a billions of dollars of real estate development companies in the golden age of entrepreneurs in the mid -1990s.

Now, the tension with the West dominates public opinion, US Treasury Secretary [Yellen](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230707/yellen-china-companies-meetings/)During his visit to Beijing this week, he severely criticized China's way of treating American companies.

In 2015, as Chinese leaders Xi Jinping claimed that the government had greater control over the country and enterprises, Shen Dong left China. Duan Weihong's English name is Whitney, she disappeared two years later. (It is believed that after a senior political allies were arrested for suspected corruption, Communist Party officials [detained her](https://www.ft.com/content/3e59e10e-8c3c-44dd-bf75-9acbc7382ee8)Essence .

Now, he and Duan Wei's son live in the United Kingdom (since Duan Weihong's disappearance, both of them have seen her), he said that he was in danger of traveling to China.

Next week, Shen Dong will be in [Congress](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-notice-risky-business-growing-peril-american-companies-china)The challenges facing American companies operated in China are testimony. For clear reasons, the content of this interview has been compressed and edited.

** Since your book was published, what happened? **

First of all, people's views on China have become more negative. The new crown has a lot to do with this, especially in terms of changing the general public's views. This helps accelerate the speed of policy makers to deal with Chinese issues -they can now follow the trend.

Secondly, the outside world underestimates the severity of China's economic deterioration. In the conversation with Chinese business people, several things shocked me. A large dairy company is increasing the production of milk powder because people are reducing the purchase of milk. Under normal circumstances, milk is one of the most unwilling to save.

Many executives have also said that since the epidemic, employees have blatantly robbed and stole from the company. why? Because the economic outlook was too bad, they lost hope.

** How can this affect government governance and business? **

advertise

This has increased the increasing sense of insecurity of the Communist Party of China, so the government is taking measures to strengthen control during the use of the epidemic. This is impact on commercial: [assault search] that is related to the West, [assault search](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230515/china-anti-espionage-law/)And for Chinese data providers [10,000](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-data-provider-tightens-some-information-access-offshore-users-sources-2023-05-03/)The restrictions on access are part of China's efforts to control foreigners.

** How to adjust multinational enterprises? **

Each company is vigorously preventing risks. People talk about "de -globalization", but the correct statement is "minusing China at the same time globalization." It will not replace China by a certain country, but to expand its business to Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and other places. See how many Taiwanese manufacturers are entering Mexico on a large scale. Then there are friends in Europe and near -shore outsourcing.

** US information -make a tough remark, and at the same time expressed the hope to keep the dialogue -Does it complicate the problem? **

After Trump's ruling four years and Biden for three years, you will see the overall consistency of policies against China. The slight changes or differences in tone will not affect China ’s opinion that the United States has believed in it. In order to restore business confidence and introduce more capital, they need to ease some tensions. If measures that can be alleviated or delayed, they will want to do that.

According to China Securities.com, the reporter learned from the news ventilation held by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government on July 9 that the Shanghai Big Data Center is accelerating the "Suixing Code" to "urban code" under the deployment of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government. "The function upgrade, build a comprehensive urban service and governance system of" one person, one yard, one enterprise, one yard, one yard ". At present, Shanghai has formulated a new version of the "Sui Application Code" standard specification and management system, upgraded and constructed the "application code" operation management platform, and established the "Suizhou code" comprehensive operation support system.

In this regard, current affairs commentators Bi Xin believes that Shanghai's "urban code" as an upgraded version of the "health code" of epidemic prevention is undoubtedly the authorities that the authorities are undoubtedly the authorities to strengthen the control. He said to this station on Monday: "This is equivalent to a new way to restrict people's flow. When entering (in some places), if you do not have green codes, you may not enter.

Ms. Chen, a petitioner of Shanghai, told this station that she was worried that the "city code" would be abused again: "This is the tool maintenance tool.

Some netizens commented that in the era of big data, through "one person, one yard", companies can find the status of the candidate.

He believes, "During the war, NATO is currently incorporating Ukraine into the NATO family. [Opinions have not reached an agreement](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約秘書長挺烏入會-德國防長還不是時候/a-65393175)"". Several media pointed out that Biden's saying hinted that Ukraine had to join NATO after war.

Biden said that although Ukraine joined NATO "it takes a period of time", before that, Washington can provide Kiev with security support similar to the United States, including [Provide weapons](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美宣布向乌克兰提供集束弹-欧洲盟友保持距离/a-66168345)And assist them to have self -defense.

A recent report from the US Congress Research Services Department shows that since World War II, Israel has been the country in the world the most supported by the United States.

### Summit will follow China ’s influence in India

Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Yoshiko will also participate in this summit. Matsuna Matsuna Matsuna, the official house of Japanese cabinet, said on the 7th that Kishida will take this opportunity to emphasize that "the security of the Indo -Pacific region and Europe is inseparable." NATO must strengthen the participation in India and deepen Japan. However, there are still differences in NATO in NATO on how to cope with China in Indo -Pacific influence.

Bloomberg quoted a European senior diplomat that reported that the NATO allies are discussing that they may issue a statement with 4 Indo -Pacific countries to deepen the cooperation between the two sides.

However, whether NATO should leave the scope of its activities in the area where "extending from Northern Europe to Southern Europe and extended from the Atlantic coastline to eastern Turkey", there are some conceptual differences among member states. The diplomat who did not want to disclose his name stated that some members wanted NATO to take a wider and non -targeted approach to such issues that affect the security of the alliance.

Since the beginning of the war of the Russian and Ukraine War of Chinese President Xi Jinping, it has not condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約警告中國勿援俄-北京要求反躬自省/a-65245521)It was an insult to international order and said that China constituted a "systemic challenge" to the alliance. NATO has continued to deepen relations with the closest allies in the region in the region in the near future; Washington has also continued to seek to establish various multilateral mechanisms in the Indo -Pacific region to care about the expansion of China's influence.

Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary -General of NATO, also stated in June: "What happened in Asia is important to Europe and what happened in Europe is also important to Asia." In order to strengthen the connection between NATO and Asia, Stock Ertenberg visited Japan and South Korea in January, and said that Japan was the most "close and powerful partner" in NATO.

However, in May this year, [NATO will open the first Asian office in Japan](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日媒北約擬藉東京辦事處-升級印太合作/a-65907575)At that time, [French President Emmanuel Macron had raised objections](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英媒馬克宏反對北約在日本設辦事處/a-65834394)It is considered a big mistake to expand any attempt to expand NATO.

The possibility of NATO eastward expansion and activity in the Indo -Pacific region also expressed opposition, saying that the western move is intended to curb the rise of China. In June, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, once said that most countries in the Indo -Pacific region are not welcome to the east of NATO to Asia.

### China: Lithuania exposes NATO's "disaster" to China

About one week before the summit, Lithuania announced a "Indo -Pacific Strategy", which emphasized that the development of economic and trade relations with Taiwan was one of the strategic priorities of the country, and said that they opposed the "force or coercion to change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait." "Nikkei Asia" reported that in this 16 -page document, Li Guo mentioned China at 18 degrees to China and 16 times to mention Taiwan.

On the 7th of this month, the Chinese official media "Global Times" said that Lithuania's move was "imitation of the United States", and said that NATO's provocative malice against China was exposed before the Lithuania Summit. Keep a vigilance.The comment also said that this year's NATO Summit is the "public performance" of the "anti -China small group Washington Washington" in Washington, which also indicates that while NATO has increased pressure on Russia while accelerating the expansion of the Asia -Pacific region, In one step, the Vilnius summit may become a "watershed" moment.

According to the comments, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, as NATO's "global partners", will attend the summit for the second consecutive year. The plan for strengthening cooperation with the four countries in NATO will obviously "come to China"; On the same day when Lithuania announced the Indo -Pacific strategy, the United Kingdom and Poland also signed the "2030 Strategic Partner Joint Declaration", which also mentioned "the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and announced that the status quo of one -sided changes will be announced and will be free to open the Indo -Pacific region. The Global Times believes that these signs show that NATO member states have coordinated their positions in Taiwan's issues, trying to "form a siege for China" in international public opinion.

# China and the United States jointly crack down on the deadlock of Fennei, and the United States pressures China

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T04-34-20-08-00/07china-fentanyl-01-bmzh-master1050.jpg)Just four years ago, the United States and China stopped the joint operations of Fantani produced by China in the United States. Beijing has promulgated a new law that comprehensively prohibits synthetic opioid drugs. The Trump administration also praised the "excellent governor" of Chinese supreme leader Xi Jinping.

Soon, China -US law enforcement officers began to investigate and sue China's fentanyl dealer.

But now, the cooperation between the two countries on the fentanyl's issue has fallen into a deadlock. In the United States, Fentney causes thousands of people to abuse every year, but the joint efforts to crack down on the proliferation of drugs are hindered by trade, human rights, Russia, and Taiwan issues. The failure of cooperation on the obstacle to interception is a symbol of bilateral relations at all levels.

State Secretary of State Brills hosted the first global national alliance virtual meeting aimed at ending the threat of dangerous synthetic drug threats last Friday. The part of the purpose is to put pressure on other countries to put pressure on China and ask them to take more measures to curb to create Finastery in the manufacture Flowing to the world to the world.

During the opening speech, Brinken claimed that nearly 110,000 Americans died of excessive drugs last year; two -thirds of the deaths were related to synthetic opioids. This was the number one killer of the 18th to 49 -year -old group in the United States. He said that this is "a problem that can be solved alone."

Assistant Secretary of State Todd Robinson, who is responsible for international drugs and anti -drug, said that about 84 countries were agreed to participate in the efforts at the beginning of the establishment of the alliance. China was invited to join, but it did not show any signs of participation. In contrast, the Mexican government has promised to participate in the country that plays a key role in the supply chain of Fantne and other deadly opioid drugs.

"As a global partner, the People's Republic of China needs to take more actions to combat the illegal synthetic drug chain," Robinson said at a blower on Thursday when he mentioned China on Thursday.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T04-34-20-08-00/07china-fentanyl-02-bmzh-master1050.jpg)On Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Yellen arrived in Beijing. POOL Photo by Pedro Pardo

US Treasury Secretary Yellen is expected to mention this problem when meeting with Chinese officials this week. This year, as a wider part of the US government cracking down on the source of this fatal crisis, the Foreign Asset Control Office of the Ministry of Finance sanctions on Chinese and Mexican companies suspected of the production of Finiti pills.

After Yellen visited China, after Blint's visit to Beijing last month, Brinken called on China to restart cooperation with the United States on anti -drug issues. After the Speaker of the House of Representatives Pelosi visited Taiwan last August, China frozen communication with the United States on this issue.

During the visit, Brinken told reporters that the two countries had agreed to "build a working group or collaborative plan" to crack down on Fentney smuggling. But just a few days later, the US federal prosecutor [announced the prosecution](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/nyregion/china-fentanyl-companies-charged.html)Four Chinese companies accused them of illegal trafficking chemicals, and made a large number of Fentany sold to the United States through the Mexican drug trafficking group, and the cooperation prospects of the two countries became dim.

Since then, China has violently criticized the United States on drug problems, accusing the United States of blaming China on China, and denied its failure on the problem of fighting fenni.

"The United States must face up to its own problems, and we must not taboo diseases and doctors," said the Communist Party of China "People's Daily" recently commented. "Attacking China cannot cure the flood of domestic drugs in the United States, it will only delay the problem of American drug treatment into a larger social crisis."

China often claims to be experienced on anti -drug issues. In the 19th century, it was a victim of the Opium trade for the Britain for plundering.

"Due to the painful memories of the Opium War, China can be said to be the country with the deepest drugs in the world," the CCP's "Global Times" wrote in a social editorial last month.

Analysts pointed out that Fantney has almost no market in China, and Beijing has not had much motivation to supervise its pre -chemicals. This chemical product also has a widely legal use in the medical industry.

As China became more and more dissatisfied with the various actions of the United States (in its opinion, these practices are curbing China), it is likely to treat the Findni crisis as an opportunity to show strongness to the United States. These measures in the United States include restricting China to obtain advanced semiconductor technology and strengthen security cooperation with neighboring Chinese neighboring countries such as Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. Analysts said that China hopes to get some valuable returns, so as to help the Biden government solve the problem of fentanyl.

Some Chinese analysts believe that the Bedden government has continued to put pressure on China on the Fantney issue, because of domestic political factors in the United States.

"The American anti -drug policy has always been weak, and the presidential election is coming soon," said Wu Xinbo, Dean of the International Institute of International Issues of Shanghai Fudan University. "This has given the Republican excuses for attacking the Democratic Party and the Biden government. This is why the United States is hype."

In 2019, all fentinis were incorporated into banned drug control, fulfilling Xi Jinping's commitment to Trump. Since then, the direct exports of fentanyl's related chemicals have dropped sharply to the United States.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T04-34-20-08-00/07china-fentanyl-04-bmzh-master1050.jpg)In 2019, China -US officials held a press conference in Xingtai on the issue of Fentany's trafficking. Wang zhao/Agency France-Presse-Getty Images

However, experts said that the Chinese party discovered that the Trump administration had gradually weakened its law enforcement after the Trump administration had no intention of canceling the trade tariffs on China a year ago. This has led to a surge in the fentini predestined body chemicals transported to Mexico. Most of the Fentany produced and transported by drug trafficking groups eventually flowed into the United States.

Analysts said that the dispute around Fentni highlighted the fundamental differences between the United States and China in responding to competitive relations. The Biden government thinks that they can compete with China on strategic issues such as security and technology, while working on issues of common concern such as climate change and drug control.advertise

Chinese expert Wu Xinbo said that the approach to the United States seems arrogant in China because the Bayeng government tries to dominate the way of contact between the two countries.

"The United States thinks it wants to cooperate with China, and China should cooperate," said Wu Xinbo. "And when it wants to suppress China in the name of competition, it can also do it without fear."

"But sorry, this is impossible," he added.

Analysts said that the Chinese side believes that the problem of fentanyl is one of the areas of a bargaining chip that forces the United States to make concessions.

"For a long time, Chinese people have regarded cooperation with the United States as a chip rather than regarding cooperation itself. Nowadays, China urgently needs to obtain chips, and this demand is still growing."

Scholars believe that the Ministry of Industry of the Central News Agency continued the functions of Mao Zedong's establishment of the Central Social Ministry of the Central Committee in Yan'an in 1941, and his work covered the grass -roots government.

This is the first time that Chinese official media has disclosed the news that Wu Hansheng has served as the Minister of Social Work of the Central Committee.

According to the official website of the China Quality Association on Monday, Liu Zheng presided over the first batch of National Industry Association Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce's theme education research seminar on July 6 as the deputy minister of the Central Social Work Department. People noticed that the two ministerial officials appeared in the way of attending the meeting, not officially officially reported.

Ding Hanqiang, a scholar who lives in Australia, said in an interview on Monday this Monday that the newly formed "Ministry of Social Work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" was called "the CPC Central Committee" during the Yan'an period. The Central Social Work Department is intended to strengthen internal control. He said: "In order to consolidate the regime, the Social Work Department is the penetration and control of all aspects. It can be said that in addition to the network management and network supervision, it is to strengthen the social work department, which is nothing more than maintaining stability."

** Eighty years ago, Mao Zedong formed the Central Social Department **

Before the establishment of the Communist Party of China in 1939, Mao Zedong established the Social Department and the Central Intelligence Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yan'an. Kang Sheng served as Minister and Leading Intelligence (Anti -Spy). Since then, Mao Zedong launched the Yan'an rectification movement, and tens of thousands of cadres were beaten into agents, traitors and traitors. The so -called criminal evidence was fabricated by the Central Social Ministry. The department was dissolved in 1949.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T04-41-00-04-00/000002.png)Minister of Social Work, Wu Hansheng, recently appeared publicly. (Network data map) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T04-41-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/gt2-07102023044035.html/image.png)In an interview with current affairs commentators, Cai Shenkun said that it shows that above, the Central Social Work Department uniformly leads the State Letters and Calls Bureau to guide the party building of mixed -owned enterprises, non -public ownership enterprises and new economic organizations, social organizations, and employment groups. But the fact is not so simple. He said: "In fact, this department is not simple, it penetrates every corner of society. In these years, they have discovered that ordinary people are a big problem. He does not know what the people are thinking and what to do. After the establishment of this department , Find more enemies in the whole society, differentiate the enemy, and disintegrate the enemy. "

In mid -March this year, China officially announced the reform plan of the CPC Central Committee's institutional institution, set up a new Central Social Work Department, and is responsible for overall guidance of letters and visits. Officials say that the Central Social Work Department formulates responsibilities such as social work policies, and coordinated the promotion of party building to lead grass -roots governance and grass -roots regime construction. It also said that the provincial, municipal, and county -level party committees set up social work departments to be corresponding to the responsibilities of the "two new" workers' committees of party committees and organizations at the same level.

** The functions of the Social Work Department are extensive and penetrated into the grass -roots government **

In other words, the grass -roots organizations of the Central Social Work Department have penetrated into the first -level party branch of local townships and towns without being subject to the administrative department of the State Council. Cai Shenkun continued: "In the past, many of our letters and visits belonged to the national administrative level and government level, but now the Central Social Work Department has been improved to the CCP level, and this institution is with the Central Organization Department, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central United Front of the Central Committee, the Central United Front of the Central Committee. The Ministry of Political and Legal Committee is on the same place. I believe that the Minister of the Central Social Work Department will enter the Politburo in the future. "

Cai Shenkun believes that the Central Social Work Department will enter the grass -roots party committee: "His hand reached to each grass -roots government without dead ends. Including all civil organizations, social organizations, and all chambers of commerce."

Wang Jian, a media person, said that the newly established Central Social Work Department belongs to the super institution. Public security, Guoan, anti -terrorism, transportation, immigration, and even social organizations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Civil Affairs can be understood as concentrations of the CCP's Internal Affairs Commission (unprepared) concentrated) Version.

** 1. Why are Chinese liberals more and more split **

Recently, the US Federal Supreme Court, which has already completed conservatives, made a judgment, withdrawing the "correction" admitted by Harvard University and North Carolina State University to the new students.(affirmative action)Essence This problem was originally one of the "gunpowder barrels" that the United States had been arguing for a long time, and the popularity of judging in the United States can be imagined. It is also a "sensitive issue" that Asians, especially Chinese, are concerned, because they generally believe that the rectification of college enrollment is not good for Asians and white people. Starting at least in the 2020 presidential election, the US issue has always been the focus of Chinese people at home and abroad. Together with the previous abortion judgments, homosexual wedding cakes, and webpage customized judgments made by the Supreme Court, these issues have generated fierce and lasting controversy in the WeChat group. The argument itself is a good thing, and it is not so good to become mutual.

At the invitation of a group of friends, I also commented on the judgment in a WeChat group. I did not expect to be involved in the vortex of controversy at once. Because my "US Federal Constitution" and other books cannot be updated in China, I do not have enough time and motivation to track the US constitutional jurisprudence in recent years, so my so -called "comment" is actually the analysis ideas and ideas in this field. Background introduction. I have made a "prevention needle" in advance. I did not closely track the progress of the United States university correction in nearly ten years. I don't know much about today's specific situation. However, I have studied the constitutional process of the United States for more than 200 years. Nature, analysis methods and the real dilemma they are facing. Therefore, I did not observe the specific conclusion of supporting the judgment, but only adopted the "golden mean" position: both sides were a bit reasonable. The problem of this boss was time to reflect and adjust.

Unexpectedly, this position has attracted the criticism of many left -wing people, accusing me of not being criticized by criticizing the Supreme Court with the "mainstream" intellectual industry in the United States. Some of them are for specific issues, such as the exception of the military school? But there are also some on the outline, even suspected of attacking abuse. I support me and I started to talk to each other in the group, and my words were very polite. I also leave a message again to clarify that the qualitative criticism as "extreme left" may also make some opponents unhappy. I was worried that this debate was the same as before, and finally dispersed; the problem was not clearly discussed, and the attack on each other worsened each other's feelings.

Since the Liberty and the new left "big division" in the 1990s, the US elections have split the "liberal" (more "progressive") and "conservatives" that were originally inside the liberals. If the Russian and Ukraine War may have a split in the conservatives, the disputes this time mainly occur in the Liberal camp against Trump. Regardless of left and right, freedom or conservative, this phenomenon is common in the WeChat group of Jianzhong. As long as there are different opinions, they will have a mutual conversation and finally dispersal. To sum up in a word from the great leader, politics originally had to make a lot of themselves, and the enemy did it. Today, China ’s liberals do the opposite, and keep making themselves less.

** 2. Freedom and tolerance **

On the surface, this seems very natural. The so -called "liberal" is to be a jealous temperament, not only has independent opinions, but also expresses the chest and casual expression. If you have to obey "organizational discipline" and forced "pace consistent", it is not a liberal. However, this is just one aspect of "freedom". If freedom refers to his own pleasure, then the dictator will become the most "free" person in the world.

Of course, the "freedom" of liberalism not only refers to its own freedom, but also refers to respecting the freedom of others -not only simply let people speak (you do not have power, you can't let people speak), but in your heart and and Different opinions on attitude. "Tolerance" is not "harder", not to talk about right and wrong, but just not treating himself as God, thinking that he has mastered the absolute truth, the other party is either stupid or evil. Almost any issue, there will be different opinions between people. If you think that others are wrong, of course, you can criticize directly, but in most cases, these questions do not have a simple correct answer. If you think your answer is absolutely correct, it is likely to be simple because you want to be simple.

Mortal is wise, and human wisdom is limited. Human morality and judgment ability is roughly equal, and those who disagree with me may be right -not acknowledging this, it can only show that you are not liberals, but a dictator who only respects. Since everyone makes mistakes, you are roughly the same as others. Why are you absolutely correct confidence? Therefore, when there are different opinions, I will first reflect on myself to see if there is a reason for the opposition; if there is a reason, it will be corrected. But even in this case, I have to retain the minimum respect for the other party. Maybe my reflection has not played a role. It proves that he was right afterwards?

Therefore, tolerance is not a "humility" that is high above, but the honesty of a basic fact -we are all people, not God; we have a cognitive ability, but everyone's cognition has obvious limitations. We can hardly say to others seriously, "You are wrong!" - Who do you yourself? Why must others be wrong, not yourself? Putting yourself in the position of God, just as ridiculous as his guest appearances at other people's homes. Anyone who knows it should not do this. With a tolerance mentality, there will be no more abusive attacks, aggressive, and ridicule in the WeChat group.

It can be seen that the reason why these phenomena happened so that the liberals made themselves less and less, the root cause is that we are not really a real liberal. On the contrary, we are self -righteous dictators who like to overlook our opinions on others. After a few rounds, of course, all of them have become "lonely people." If you can't tolerate different opinions sincerely, you can't be a true liberal. Hu Shi said, "Tolerance is more important than freedom", this should be one of the meanings. True liberals tolerate others from the heart will always retain space for different opinions, and tolerance is the adhesive of a free community. Since they are tolerant of each other and treat each other, at least they don't quarrel, why do they still make them less? Based on the tolerance, the power of the free community will continue to grow and grow.

Of course, tolerance is not a bottomless line. If you make mistakes on the so -called "big right" issue, you cannot be "tolerant". If a person violates the basic rights such as political natural law, disrespect the freedom of belief, freedom of speech, negative equality (anti -discrimination), etc., or does not accept basic systems such as democracy, administrative neutrality, and judicial independence, then you can determine that this person and liberals can be determined no common language. Since countless historical facts have proven that such views have endlessly harmed, the "tolerance" of such views has become a principle of indulgence. But under the premise of respecting the political natural law, all different opinions are part of the free community and should be tolerant of each other.

** Three, distinguish the principles and details **Although the political natural law is the standard for judging the right and wrong, not all issues involve such principles, at least most of the problems are not as simple as 1+1 = 2. Negative equality (not discrimination) is an absolute laws of political nature, but positive and equal measures such as correction action are not. This difference is just as simple as "I can't hurt you", which is not the same as "I must do good deeds for you". Of course, negative and positive are not always so clear; historical discrimination may cause long -term harm to the victims, so that it requires certain positive measures to achieve negative equality. This is the original intention of President Kennedy's proposal to "rectify the action". Needless to repeat it, but this does not eliminate the essence of the two. After 60 years of implementation, its social controversy is getting bigger and bigger. A sampling survey shows that most Americans do not agree with the rectification of college admissions. Although most scholars seem to support the big goal of correction action, criticism of specific means such as college enrollment ethnic quotas is still endless. Almost at the beginning, the rectification of college enrollment was accused as the main benefit of the middle and upper and upper -level African applicants, which was mainly a good -looking, and could not help the lower -level black families who were trapped in poverty, drug abuse, and domestic violence. In other words, correction really allows more black students in the university campus, but contributed very much to solving the increasing black problem in American society. In this way, the focus of policies may not be the actions of university enrollment and correction, but to allow students of different ethnic groups to enjoy primary and secondary school education with basic equality and curb the increasingly bad trend of basic education quality and environmental gaps in different regions. Perhaps the economic conditions of the family are more related factors than the ethnic group -why do black people of a wealthy family have more competitive advantages than white people in a poor family? Perhaps family income is a more related factors than ethnic groups. Taking care of poor students can help the bottom black people and realize the diversification of real ethnic groups. In this sense, the simple ethnic quota system definitely constitutes "reverse discrimination".

In fact, the judgment of the Supreme Court did not overthrow any precedent in this field. It has neither denying the importance of the diversification of the university campus nor the constitutionality of considering the ethnic group as the admission factor, but just denies the specific enrollment plan of the two schools of Harvard and North Carolina. As Harvard University responds to this judgment, American universities can still take campus diversification as the goal and consider ethnic factors during enrollment. However, the enrollment scheme requires more stringent constitutional standards for ethnic diversification. Even if the leftists agree, the ethnic quota system is too simple and arbitrarily. For example, the enrollment plan in the "Michigan University Admission Case" in 2003 locks the proportion of black admission to the proportion of black applicants. This is obviously unreasonable. Therefore, the US academic community's response to this verdict is not a negative denial, but mainly because of more concerns that stricter judicial standards may make the campus diversification more difficult to achieve. If the ethnic quota is not desirable, what kind of enrollment solution can truly achieve diversified goals? Since this question does not have a standard answer, why not discuss specific issues calmly and and have to determine a self -conscious position and verbal with different opinions?

The correction action is not absolutely correct, the more the better, because the number of college admission places is limited after all, and too many African or Western descent will inevitably squeeze the places of other ethnic groups such as white people and Asians. Similarly, there is no simple standard answer in the abortion of the Supreme Court and the equal right to belief, because they involve conflicts between different rights. If you go to extremes and protect one party's rights too much, it will inevitably harm the rights of the other party. As long as you do n’t take the extreme, there are more rights and less rights.

# How China is trapped in debt dilemma

Description: According to statistics, the overall debt in China has reached 282%of the annual economic output. How is such a deep debt dilemma formed? What will this impact on the global economy? Is there any solution? Here is an analysis. Pool Photo by Mark Schiefelbein Treasury Minister Yellen tried to persuade China to strengthen cooperation during his visit to alleviate the debt crisis of low -income countries. The picture shows Yellen meet with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang in Beijing.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T05-41-13-08-00/CHINA-DEBT-02-pckt-master1050.jpg)China has provided [nearly $ 1 trillion loan] to about 150 developing countries(https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230328/china-loans-bailouts-debt/)However, it has been reluctant to avoid huge debt owed by countries that are difficult to balance. This is to a certain extent because China also faces debt bombs: local governments, its subordinate outford financing institutions, and real estate developers owe trillions of dollars.

[Minister of Finance Yellen](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230707/yellen-china-companies-meetings/)One of the main issues during the visit to China is whether she can persuade China to strengthen cooperation to solve the continuous evolutionary debt crisis faced by low -income countries. However, China's state -owned banking system is facing a much larger loan loss in the territory and is cautious about receiving foreign loan losses.

** How much debt does China have? **

Because the official data is very small, it is difficult to know the exact number. Researchers at Morgan Chase calculated last month to calculate the overall debt (including family, enterprises, and governments) in China last month. In contrast, the average proportion of developed economies in the world is 256%, and the United States is 257%.

The difference between China and most countries is that debt is so fast compared to its economic scale. In contrast, the growth rate of Japanese debt in the United States and even the debt is slower. The sharp increase in Chinese debt has made management debt more difficult. Since the global financial crisis 15 years ago, China's debt has doubled compared with its economic scale.

Compared with its domestic debt, the loan provided by China to developing countries is small, accounting for less than 6%of China's annual economic output. But these loans are particularly sensitive in politics. Despite strict review, Chinese social media still complained from time to time, saying that banks should lend money to domestic poor families and regions, not abroad. Therefore, the huge loss of these loans will be very unpopular in China.

** How did China fall into such a deep debt dilemma? **

The first is real estate. The industry is facing the problem of excessive construction, price decline, and potential buyers. In the past two years, dozens of real estate developers who have borrowed money from overseas investors have had debt defaults. In recent days, there have been two more. For a long time, developers have been very difficult to repay the huge debt from Chinese banks.

Local governments' debts make the problem more complicated. In the past ten years, many provinces and cities have established special financial institutions. They have less supervised supervision and a large scale of debt. Officials use these money to pay daily expenses, including interests of other loans, as well as the construction of roads, bridges, parks and other infrastructure.

The issue of real estate and government debt overlap. Over the years, the main source of revenue from the local area is to sell long -term lease contracts for developers to sell state -owned land. As many private developers have exhausted funds for bidding land, land sales revenue has decreased. Instead, local financing institutions raised a lot of debt and purchased land that these developers were unable to undertake at high prices. As the real estate market continues to weaken, many of these financing institutions have fallen into trouble.

The debt is more and more accumulated. Credit rating agency Fitch rating estimates that the debt of local governments is equivalent to about 30%of China's annual economic output. Fitch said that the debt owed by these auxiliary financing units is equivalent to 40%to 50%of the nation's output, but because local governments borrow money and transfer their debts to financing units, dual calculations may occur.

** Why is this important? **

For any government or enterprise, if funds are effectively used, borrowing will have good economic significance. A large amount of borrowing but not enough funds to be returned can be in trouble and it is difficult to repay the loan party. This is the case in China. As the economy slows down, more and more local governments and its financing units are unable to continue paying debt interest. Chain reaction means that many places lack funds to pay public services, medical insurance or pensions.

The issue of debt also makes it difficult for Chinese banks to accept the loss of loans to low -income countries. However, many of them, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and [Surinan](https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230628/suriname-china-imf/)Nowadays, they are facing [considerable economic difficulties](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230328/china-loans-bailouts-debt/) 。

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T05-41-13-08-00/CHINA-DEBT-03-hkfv-master1050.jpg)Pakistan is one of the largest borrowing countries in China and one of the countries facing a serious debt crisis. Kiana Hayeri for the New York Times

Nearly two -thirds of development in the world depend on the export of commodities. The World Bank predicts that the price of commodities this year will decrease 21%compared with last year.

In 2010, only 5%of China's overseas loan portfolios were used to support borrowing countries in trouble. Virginia Williamsburg and the executive director of Aiddata University, Bradeli Pax, said that this number has reached 60%today.

China is by far the largest sovereign loan country to lend to developing countries, although Western hedge funds have also purchased many bonds in these countries. These bonds often use fixed interest rates. However, Chinese banks tend to use adjustable interest rates linked to Western interest rates to issue US dollar loans. As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates since March 2022, developing countries are facing the owe of China [debt has soared](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20221008/china-debt-economy-global-slowdown/)question.

If measures are not taken to reduce debt, many of the most poorest governments in the world will continue to spend huge sums of money to repay debts. These money can have been used in schools, hospitals and other services. "The biggest losers will eventually be ordinary people in developing countries. Because the government is carrying unsustainable debt, they will be deprived of basic public services," Pax said.

** What is the solution? **The host of Beijing and the capital of China guards the current economic priority. Yellen will try to learn more about China's economic plan, but it cannot affect these plans.

Last winter, 21 Bank of China agreed to allow a local government financing institution in Southwest China to extend the upcoming loan for 20 years, and stated that it only needs to repay interest in the first 10 years without repayment. However, this arrangement means that the bank has suffered heavy losses, and local financial institutions in almost every province have fallen into a similar dilemma.

advertise

However, it is difficult to solve the debt problem of developing countries. "Yellen persuaded China to have limited ability to accept debt records," said former U.S. Ministry of Finance Mark Sobel. He also said, "The United States and Yellen have little influence."

(Information Picture of the Associated Press) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T06-17-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/ec-07102023061731.html/ap23136234058902.jpg)** Comment: Data reflects the "miracle" of the economic rebound after the economic weak epidemic of China.

Li Zhaobo, a honorary teaching and researcher at the Institute of Asia -Pacific Business and Industry of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that from the decline in the index, it shows that after the epidemic, there is no way to help consumption and industrial production recovery after the epidemic, and promote the dilemma of economic outflowing.

Li Zhaobo: "When the economy is good, a basket of economic data will be all better. For example, monetary strength, CPI, and PPI are mild positive growth, etc., but now you see that there is no miracle. , But there is no consistent, the future economic data goes in the direction of difference, not only the CPI and PPI, but also the RMB down. It is a problem of insufficient confidence. This will lower the economic growth. "

Li Zhaobo said that the growth of Zero CPI is not confident in economic development in the future, the middle class is worried about unstable employment, the high unemployment rate is related to the people who dare not consume.

Li Zhaobo: "Taking Hong Kong as an example, in the past, passengers contributed about HK $ 10 billion to retail sales per month. Now it has been switched for some time. 5 billion yuan, which means that the consumption power of mainland passengers is weakened, unlike the previous visit to Hong Kong, I will buy bags and tables. This type of consumption has been reduced a lot. Consumption is related. "

** Comment: Europe and the United States restrict high -tech exports make Chinese industrial products demand.

The National Bureau of Statistics of China has declined with international oil prices, affecting energy prices, increasing the decline in industrial consumer goods, and explaining the reasons why PPI declines year -on -year and a month -on -month decline.

Commander: "China is a consumer country consumed by a large coal and oil industry commodity. In fact, the decline in cost is a benefit for Chinese industrial products, but why is it that the profit of Chinese industrial enterprises is declining? In the United States and the United States, the high -tech export restrictions in China, the advantages of China have now been by Vietnam, and there are other markets that are not limited by high -tech exports. The dynamics of the year are clear, which exacerbates the depression of China's industrial production. "

Commander said that China's economic growth is mainly driven by a carriage. The data for consumption and production in the first half of this year are worse than market expectations, and consumption, industrial production and capital markets are interlocking. Each link is shrinking. It will make China more difficult.

Commander: "Three -driving carriage that drives economic growth is not only a problem that is not just away, but has gone backwards. For China, it is by no means a good signal for economic growth. If there is a thunder, it will be a systematic, comprehensiveness and nationwide, and it will be difficult to cure in the short term. In fact, it is overwhelming. "

Commander said that no favorable factors or rescue policies can be seen for the time being to solve the difficulties of China's economy in the short term.

Turkey has repeatedly urged Sweden to take more powerful measures on cracking down on terrorism.

But Erdogan has not stated that it will turn on a green light for Sweden.

The NATO Summit is about to be held, and Sweden hopes to get qualifications for NATO member states during the summit.

Erdogan and Biden also agreed to hold a face -to -face meeting at the NATO Summit to exchange opinions on bilateral relations and regional issues.

The two also mentioned the matters of the F-16 fighter to the United States, and the Turkish President's Office said in a statement that Turkey's efforts to get the F-16 fighter with Sweden to join NATO are "incorrect."

In addition, Erdogan and Biden also discussed the issue of Ukraine's expectations to join NATO in the call.

Tibet's armed forces cannot resist the Chinese People's Liberation Army. But Tibet's dangerous terrain constitutes a natural barrier. Therefore, the Chinese army must build a new bridge for entering Tibet. It was not until 1954 that the first highway from the Anto region (now Qinghai Province), which belonged to Tibet, was officially repaired.

In 1949, after the victory of the Civil War, the Communist Party of China began to formulate a preliminary plan to "liberate" Tibet from the old system of politics and religion.

In order to prevent Tibet's independence from being acknowledged internationally, Mao Zedong had long realized that it was necessary to solve the "Tibet issue" as soon as possible and promote China's "unification". On October 6, 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army began to march in Tibet.

On the night of June 23, Moscow's time (the same below), the person in charge of the Wagner Group Purig was a soldier, shocking the world. At 10 o'clock on June 24, Putin authorized Belarus President Lukashenko to negotiate and experienced about 9 hours of tense and efficient mediation. On the night of the 24th, Pricigen announced that he would return to camp and voluntarily exile. The plot was beyond imagination.

** Pricigo Ren: Gong Gong and Pride and Pride **

Since this century, Russia's top leader has been Putin. He has been the Prime Minister for four years. No one will think that then President Medvedev has real power. There are three main factions or hills in Putin's power kingdom: the KGB Gang (representatives such as Russian Petroleum Corporation, former Deputy Prime Minister Xie Qin), St. Petersburg Gang (representatives such as Medvedev), Moscow Gang (representatives such as Hasanu) Essence

Poigo has been in prison for 9 years because of robbery and fraud, and dug from hot dogs and open restaurants to the first bucket of gold; therefore met with Vice Mayor Putin, St. Petersburg, and then followed to Moscow to become the Kremlin catering service provider. The Russian army logistics dining order was dug into the second barrel of gold; in 2014, it annexed Crimea, secretly established Wagner, and dug the third barrel of gold. Since then, he cooperated with the Russian army to participate in the Syrian civil war, mining and civil war in Africa, and fighting the civil war in Wudong.

On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian war broke out. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not let Wagner participate in the war and did not want to let people grab merit. It was more and more passive after three months before allowing the war. Pryigo is not a good stubble. He took the opportunity to expand his person quickly, and his strength increased rapidly from 4,000 to 50,000. In addition, he made great achievements and at the cost of 25,000 casualties. During the strategic phase, he dragged the main force of the Ukraine in Bachmut's blood battles, winning precious half a year of breathing for the Russian army. It can not only calm down 300,000 soldiers mobilized, but also calmly lay out the position defense to welcome the Ukraine counterattack. It can also study the lessons of the previous failure and summarize the new tactics. The counterattack launched on June 4, 2023 was quickly failed.

Don't doubt his loyalty to Putin and Russian countries. He believed that his relationship with Putin was more irony, and he thought he had capital to call the Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff. Due to the failure of the early Ukrainian battlefield, the Russian army was severe and suffered heavy major generals. This dissatisfaction does not point to Putin, but to the Russian Ministry of Defense; not to point to the strategic level of whether it should be, but to how to fight to win and cost less.

He did not understand politics and strategy. Shaygu 35 -year -old deputy minister, 36 -year -old minister, and 38 -year -old army titled Major General Major General by the Reserve Captain. Like the Foreign Minister Lavrov, he is an evergreen tree of Russian politics. Purig can be shaken.

The timing of Porigen's mutiny is not right, if you have a greater chance of starting 9 months ago. In the autumn of 2022, the Ukrainian army suddenly counterattacked, the Russian soldiers defeated the mountains, and the strategic places such as Halkov and Hongliman lost. "The frontline chief commander La Ping was incompetent. Putin satisfied the wishes of them. Those who needed to carry the pot, dismissed the position of Laoping, and renamed the deficiency of the Army. General commander Su Luojin took over as the chief commander. Now that the situation of the battle has improved significantly, the Russian army has passed the difficulties and returned to the battlefield to take the initiative.

The even more terrible political taboo is that the capital of any country can tolerate a Ma Zai to publicly guide the Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff, not to mention the powerful Putin and Russia, and they will not be threatened by their soldiers. If it is successful, there will be a bad precedent, which is a huge disaster to both Putin and the country. Putin's press secretary Peskov bluntly broke: "According to the Constitution, these problems are the exclusive privileges and permissions of the highest commander."

Fortunately, he also knew some military, but sent thousands of people to march to Moscow. At least 20,000 people in the troops stayed on the Rosteov on the banks of the River to watch the changes, deterring the Russian army cautiously, and Putin's mouse taboo. Once the striker was wiped out by the Russian Air Force or heavy artillery on the M4 highway, then he teared his face and occupied the headquarters of the Southern Military Region, the Ukrainian War Frontline Command Center, and the main logistics base for a long time. Fighting a fish to die.

Poriger took office in time. Regardless of whether he is willing, he must exile overseas, which is the minimum and necessary punishment. During his tenure, Putin had no worries of life; as long as he did not interfere with Russian politics, he was no longer as high -profile to bombard the power in the past year, and he also had a good end after Putin stepped down. If it is not normal, the first reaction of the outside world is Russia, either Putin, or the nobles he offended him.

He is 62 years old and can retire in his old age. If he starts to eat, drink and gamble every day, and spend the sky, he will reassure political enemies and be happy. As for Wagner's overseas business, it is not his private property, but on behalf of the Ministry of Defense of Putin and the Russian Defense. Putin disclosed on June 28 that from May 2022 to May 2023, the government paid 86.262 billion rubles (about $ 1 billion) to the Wagner Group for salary and bonuses.

** Putin: Power stability and unreasonable **

At 10 o'clock on June 24, Putin delivered a national TV speech. The qualitative Pleigo's act is a "armed rebellion". Russian armed forces have received necessary orders to eliminate those who organize armed riots. "

After the TV speech, about 10:10, Putin's first international long -distance call was given to Lukashenko, which was both notice and for help. According to Lukashenko on June 27, he had felt the cruel decision of Putin's "destruction" on the phone. That is, he is determined to suppress the rebellion and make the worst plans, which means that he will not be detained by the three generals detained by Pryo (Ye Fukrov, deputy minister of the Ministry of Defense, and Alei, the first deputy minister of the General Staff Kissyev and commander of the Southern Military Region Couvlv) Life and death, will not take care of the life and death of more than 1.1 million people on Rostov on the banks of the River. The Russian nation has a brutal side, Putin also has a cruel side, and his lives do not care. At least not the primary constraints, and what you care about is his death.

Fortunately, Putin's political and military experience is rich enough. It is known that once the civil war is fighting at this time, although the deceased is second. He will force him to use tactical nuclear weapons to save the defeat in Ukraine. I am stinking for thousands of years and the risk of steps has soared. At present, a neutral country will quickly draw the line with him.

Some so -called "experts" analyze that Russia's domestic troops are empty and need to be transferred from the front line to rebel. This is too layman and seriously misjudge. Regardless of the peace or war, there must be a strategic reserve team. The Russian army will not be taken out before the Russian army will not be taken out. The author predicts that at least 10%-15%of elite military strength will never be used.

In addition, the frontline troops have rotated to rest after the rotation. Russia expanded 300,000 last year, and this year it will be expanded by 350,000. Although the combat power is weaker, the Wagner Group has just been withdrawn from the front line, with only about half of about 25,000 people, and the combat power is weak. Besides, there are no fighters and heavy artillery.More media, think tanks (such as the Institute of International Strategy in the United Kingdom), and US officials evaluated that soldiers proved that "Putin's power weakened", "political control is weakening", "weakening the Russian army and cracking down on Russian military morale." The soldiers will calm down for a day. Russia's mainstream public opinion and all sectors of the society support Putin. Instead, Putin's status is stronger. In particular, it is expected that the occurrence of a coup and Putin's steps down are too naive. According to the latest polls released by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center on June 30, 78.6%of the respondents trust Putin, with only 17%of the non -trust, and 74.8%recognize Putin's performance performance. President during the war is easier to unite the people, although this is the war of aggression.

From the perspective of the situation of the Ukrainian war, the situation is becoming more and more beneficial to the Russian army, and the power and status of Putin, Shogu, and Gracorph have more consolidated. With huge nuclear weapons blessings, the U.S. military and NATO have no courage to end; NATO aid about 120 F-16 fighters, trained skilled pilots to form a combat power of not less than 3 months, and compete for air power for no less than 3 months. Then, the Ukraine could not wait or consume.

Even if the F-16 fighter is put into the battlefield, where is the military airport, it is a tricky problem. If the Russian troops that offense in Ukraine in Poland, providing logistical support means that the NATO army directly participates in the war. The Russian army has the right to retaliate and bomb the Polish airport with missiles. The United States dare not take risks, so it is even more likely to set up airports in western Ukraine (such as Lavff). The F-16 has no stealth function. With the monitoring of the Russian army, it can quickly locate the airport and explode the runway. In short, the F-16 is difficult to play combat power, and it cannot change the trend of the war.

After the mutiny, the probability of Putin's 2024 election re -election increased. He himself will not retire, and members of the vested interest group who control Russia for many years are not willing to retire. Even if another person is Medvedev, he will support his relatives. At present, the nobles who reign are not only glory and wealth, but they do not have the highest power shelter.

The United States' response to Russia's mutiny is of course gloating and irritating. On June 28, Biden stated in an interview that Putin had become a "abandoned child" and obviously lost the war in Ukraine; on July 1, the CIA director Berns criticized, "Putin's war against him His society and regime are corrosive. "

The US intelligence agencies have released the wind, and mainstream media such as the New York Times and CNN have repeatedly speculated. Surovijin is Wagner's secret VIP. It knows that Pryigon is going to launch a mutiny in advance. It has been lost for many days. The author analyzes that this is more likely to be the US information and intelligence war. It is more frankly that it can be said to be a separate plan, trying to kill by a knife. In the history of political conflict in the political conflict, in 1937, in 1937, Nazi German intelligence head Heidrichy framed the youngest and most talented Marshal Tuhachesky, who was removed by Stalin.

Surovijin is at best to cooperate with the investigation and be innocent. His daughter's rumor was still in the office, but it faintly hinted that he was reviewed while working under house arrest and was not completely free. On June 28, Peskov refuted the New York Times' report on Saro Vegin's knowledge of Wagner's mutiny is "guess and gossip", but avoiding the current situation of Surovin, but asked reporters to ask the Russian Ministry of Defense.

According to the video judgment released by Surovin on June 24: 1. He has been transferred back to the country from the position of deputy commander of the front line, indicating that Putin obviously prevent him. 2. In his speech, he served as the Qing Dynasty with Pritag, opposed the rebellion, and clearly selected Putin. He is handsome and has two great merits: he quickly stabilizes the defeat and professional preparation defense. It is speculated that he will not be trapped in Wagner.

Putin called the head of the heads to introduce the mutiny of Russia. In addition to Lukashenko, there are also Uzbekistan President Mirchiyev, Kazakhstan President Takayev, Turkish President Erdogan, subtle It did not call the Chinese head. On June 25, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ludido visited China. According to the press release of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the minister Qin Gang met and the deputy minister Ma Zhaoxu on the same day did not listed Russian soldiers as the primary topic. Instead, the above co -organization was the first issue. This is judged that this is a routine work visit that has long been arranged. It is not a special visit to China. It is most likely to prepare for the 23rd meeting of the Board of State Council on July 4 to coordinate the two core countries of China and Russia in advance.

Practical cooperation, "the" mouth benefits "of the Pacific island nation are in sharp contrast to the West.

Since Sogovre became Prime Minister Solomon in April 2019, he joined China's "Belt and Road" initiative to cooperate with China in infrastructure construction.

China Telecom giant Huawei has started to build a mobile network in the Solomon Islands. This plan has $ 66 million in loans from China Import and Export Bank (EXIM), causing Lemen Congress to worry about debt burden.

### Yellen visit to China: Does the US Treasury Secretary China improved Sino -US relations?

* Rupert WingField-Hayes * BBC Asian Affairs Reporter

Yellen (left) was held in a polite atmosphere with He Lifeng (right), the head of China New Cain and Gold.

** U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has just ended a four -day visit to China. The purpose of her trip was to rebuild the bridge between the two countries. **

Is this trip to Beijing this time? If we only look at one most basic indicator, yes.

The United States and China have once again realized dialogue, face -to -face, even if they are not enthusiastic, they can be regarded as polite and respectful.

This is very different from that during the administration of Donald Trump, most of them rely on social media as a cross -Pacific communication, which is very different.

[Yelun visited China: Who did you meet in four days and did you talk about nothing? ](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66147637)* [From the "decoupling" to "risk" the strategic shift of the US and Europe policies or consensus consensus? ](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66117744)* [Bollingin visited China and Biden's "dictatorship" Sino -US relations "one week under the" lip, tongue sword "](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65981589)Both sides' tone and content are more positive and cautious than before. Before Yellen's trip, there was still a major visit to the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June. [Both countries promised to stabilize each other at the time](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65950568)Essence

At the end of Sunday (July 9), Yellen said that the establishment of "strong and constructive communication channels with China's new economic team" will help. This statement cannot be underestimated.

In March of this year, most people at the top of the Chinese government were replaced. The first condition of the newcomers was loyalty to the supreme leader Xi Jinping, and the key figures were He Lifeng, the new economic affairs executive of the country.

On Saturday (8th), Yellen spent most of the time on talks with He Lifeng. She said that the talks between the two were "direct, substantial and effective", but at the same time, they acknowledged that there were "significant differences" between the two sides.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-10T07-52-07.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png)
###  Yellen's deep bow caused discussion

** bbc ** ** Chinese **

Yellen met with He Lifeng, who was the first to meet with the title of "Sino -US Economic and Trade Chinese Leader" in the Diaoyutai State Guest House on Saturday. When the two met, Yellen's limb language caused discussions on social media between China and the United States.

On Twitter, Asian commentators in the United States [Ian Miles Cheong](https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1677863110638718976)Describes Yellen "bowed deeply" to He Lifeng, and this is "never seen before." [Newspaper "New York Post"](https://nypost.com/2023/07/08/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-commits-embarrassing-bow-during-beijing-visit/)Described that He Lifeng retreated a little back at the time and gave Yellen "more room for Kowtow."

Director of the Russian, Europe, and Asian Research Center (CREAS), Belgium, Belgian think tank [TheRESA FALLON](https://twitter.com/TheresaAFallon/status/1678046369934630914)Description: "Yellen has three bows.", Supplemented by the Yan Wen character with "brain explosion". Chinese commentator [Lyric Hughes Hale)](https://twitter.com/lyrichues/status/1678058922144415745)He said: "I think Minister Yellen has greeted the etiquette of greeting Japan and China."

Bonnie Glaser, the Director of the Asian Project of the Marshall Foundation (GMF) in the United States (GMF)(https://twitter.com/BonnieGlaser/status/1678091536842489856)Said: "I hope anyone can tell U.S. officials that when they shake hands with Chinese officials, the station is straight."

The comments of Chinese netizens seem to show that Yellen's move is "not flattering on both sides." On the Shanghai left website [Observer.com's Weibo post](https://weibo.com/1887344341/N9bDmql3S)A Beijing netizen said: "The posture seems low, and the mentality is as arrogant as ever." A Chongqing netizen said: "This bow is in the eyes of the Chinese." A Shaanxi netizen said: "Japanese human style Bow, that's a weasel!"

Yellen reiterated in the opening of He Lifeng that the United States will take targeted measures to protect US national security, but at the same time, China and the United States should not let differences cause misunderstandings.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-10T07-52-07.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png)Throughout the trip, Yellen tried to lobby the host China. Under the governance of the president Joe Biden, the United States was not fundamentally hostile to China.

She said, "We do not regard our relationship as a conflict between the great powers." And "we don't seek decoupling" each other's economy.

The Biden government seems to be trying to prove that its Chinese policy is not simply continuing the Trump administration's open hostility to Beijing. Is she successful? We are still waiting for the Chinese side.

But the so -called behavior is better than that. From the vision of Beijing, some of the recent movements of Biden Politamental Regime are not friendly. The most critical of these is to apply export control for individual American computer chips for the development of artificial intelligence.
###  Beijing emphasizes the positive results of Yellen's visit

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-10T07-52-07.000Z/_130336564_014531.2023-07-09t014458z_1107283753_rc2dz1a7c7xe_rtrmadp_3_china-usa-yellen.jpg)Image source, reuters

Image adding text,

Yellen emphasized that the Bayeng government had no intention of "deciring" the US -China economy.

The Chinese Ministry of Finance issued a news notice on Yellen's visit to China on Monday (10th), and summarized the positive results of the four -day itinerary from four aspects.

[Report description from the Ministry of Finance](http://www.mof.gov.cn/zhengwuxinxi/caizhengxinwen/202307/t20230710_3895227.htm)"Strengthening cooperation between China and the United States is the actual demand and correct choice of the two countries", and said that the two countries agreed that "follow -up to maintain high -level exchanges and communication between high -level exchanges between the Sino -US economic sector."

However, the statement also mentioned: "China once again reiterated the concerns of canceling tariffs on China, stopping Chinese enterprises, treating two -way investment in the two countries, relaxing export controls in China, and canceling the ban on products related to Xinjiang. The United States really takes action to respond to China's significant concern in the economic relations between the two countries. "

[Yellen Sunday said to reporters in Beijing to summarize its itinerary](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1603)She expressed concerns about the United States' "unfair economic means" -such as market access and intellectual property issues -"pressure on China" and recently increased the Chinese company's compulsory actions.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-10T07-52-07.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png)The United States did not intend to relax this ban. Instead, it started to expand and regulate it to other exports to Huagao technology. At the same time, it was drawn from Japan to Germany [to the Netherlands](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66063594), Do not provide China to provide the technology and equipment of the most cut -off chip.

The motivation of the United States is very simple. It does not want China to easily obtain American science and technology, thus gaining advantages in the fields of artificial intelligence, and leading in military technology. One day can be used to counter the United States in conflict, such as in Taiwan.

All this means that although the conversation is restarted, it seems to be ready to accelerate in the next few months, which is still a process of thin ice.

Here is another "balloon incident", or the US -Chinese warships and military planes passing by, which is enough to easily make the progress made in the past few days returning to the original shape.

Even the most optimistic experts believe that this has become a very difficult relationship. It requires cautious and long -term management to maintain stability.

### Ukrainian war: US military aid support bombs trigger human rights disputes

Their role is to explode when impacting with foreign objects, but a considerable part of them is "failed bomb", which means that they will not explode at first, especially when the artillery lands on a humid or soft land.

** The United States has announced that in response to Ukraine's request, it agrees to provide controversial clusterbombs to the country. This move was criticized by the human rights organization because the weapon has been banned by more than 100 countries. **

### What is a bundle bomb?

The bundle bomb is a weapon that scattered a large number of small ammunition from rockets, missiles or shells, and ammunition is scattered in a vast area during flight. Their role is to explode when impacting with foreign objects, but a considerable part of them become "dumb bombs", which means that they will not explode at first, especially when the ammunition is falling on a humid or soft land.

They may then explode when they are picked or trampled, causing the victims to die or disabled. From a military perspective, when used to fight the bunker ground forces in the trench and fortress positions, they may have a terrible effect, make the large area extremely dangerous, and people cannot move around before carefully cleaning up.

###  Why are they prohibited?

More than 100 countries including the United Kingdom, France and Germany signed an international treaty "Convention on Clustermunition"; the convention prohibits the use or storage of these weapons because its use will cause the civilian population not Selective damage.

Because ammunition may be similar to small toys in the residential area or farmland area, it is often picked up because of curiosity, so children are particularly vulnerable to victims. Human rights organizations describe a bundle bomb as "disgust" and even war crimes.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-10T07-55-09.000Z/_130336357_o1ajpxgk.png)Image adding text,

According to reports, the probability of "failure" of Russian clustering ammunition is about 40 %, which means that a large number of ammunition still threatens the ground, and the average failure rate is believed to be close to 20 %.

### What other countries are using them?

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Russia and Ukraine have been using cluster bombs. None of them signed related treaties. The United States has not, but it has criticized Russia to use the weapon extensively. According to reports, the probability of the "failure" of the Russian cluster bomb is about 40 %, which means that a large number of ammunition still threatens the ground, and the average failure rate is believed to be nearly 20 %.

The Pentagon is estimated to have a loss efficiency of its own bundle bomb.

Image adding text,

Jet Bouncing ammunition is a terrible, without selective attack weapon

### Why do you ask them?

The artillery and ammunition of the Ukrainian army is extremely scarce, mainly because they are the same as Russia. They use ammunition at a very fast speed, and Ukraine Western allies cannot supplement the ammunition at the required speed. On the almost quiet and difficult front of Waan and East, artillery has become the key.

Ukraine is now facing a difficult task, trying to expel them from the defense positions set by Russia's invaders along the 1,000 -kilometer front. However, due to the insufficient artillery and ammunition, Ukraine has asked the United States to re -supplement its conclusions of ammunition inventory to combat Russian infantry who served as these defensive trenches.

This is not an easy decision for the White House, and it is extremely popular among many Democratic and human rights advocates. The debate has been performed for at least 6 months.

### What impact will the United States decide?

The impact of immediately is that the moral highland of the United States in this war will be greatly affected.

Russia has been accused of committing many war crimes, which has sufficient evidence; but the United States may attract accusations for hypocrisy of the United States. Because cluster ammunition is a terrible, non -selective attack weapon, for adequate reasons, it is prohibited in many parts of the world. The American actions will inevitably disagree with its Western ally, and any split between allies is hope and need for Putin.

The 15th BRICS Summit will be held in a offline form in Johannesburg, South Africa from August 22 to 24.

Agence France -Presse reported that South African President Lama Tshada Sunday (July 9) said at a briefing that the BRICS Five Kingdoms Summit was about to be held in the form of the meeting. There is no offline physical meeting in the year. This year's summit will no longer be held online, and all parties will be committed to holding a summit with "being able to look at each other".

However, Lamaga did not show whether Russian President Putin would attend the meeting in person. The International Criminal Court (ICC) had previously accused Russia illegally expelled Ukrainian children and issued an arrest order to Putin. South Africa is a party from the International Criminal Court. In this case, if Putin steps into South Africa territory, the South African government will have to implement the wanted order from the International Criminal Court to arrest Putin.

Since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, the South African authorities have not condemned Russia and stated that their country has held a neutral position and is promoting dialogue. There were many public opinion speculation that in order to avoid the arrest of Putin, South Africa may transfer the location of the BRICS Five Kingdoms Summit to China, but South Africa later refuted this statement.

Lamaguya emphasized that South Africa's role in maintaining neutrality and promoting dialogue is very important. "In the case of changing geopolitical situations like now ... countries like South Africa should be able to play its long -term role."

He mentioned former South African President Mandela, pointing out that this is also a way for Mandela to deal with international relations. "He can talk to all parties, regardless of whether they have conflicts."

Laima Tosa led the African leaders to the Peaceful Mission last month and went to Kiev and Moscow to start promotion and dialogue respectively. The grain exports of the Black Sea are not hindered, and the prisoners of war and children are returned to the original country.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T08-15-16-08-00/06Yan1-jumbo.jpg)Last Monday, Yan Mingfu died in Beijing at the age of 91. He was the son of the underground party of the Communist Party of China. He later served as Mao Zedong's translation. As a negotiating representative, he tried to resolve the deadlock between the Chinese Communist Party and the student protesters who occupied Tiananmen in 1989.

His daughter Yan Lan published in China's "Caixin" magazine [article](https://mini.caixin.com/2023-07-05/102072666.html), Confirmed his death. She did not explain the specific cause of death, but Yan Mingfu suffered from multiple diseases in his later years.

"Dad walked calmly and drew an end to his ups and downs," Yan Lan wrote.

In the critical period of the Cold War in China, Yan Mingfu was pushed into the vortex of political situation. During the period when Mao Zedong filed with the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and later, Yan Mingfu was Mao Zedong's Russian translation. In 1989, when the Soviet leader Gorbachev visited Beijing to meet the cracks, he became accompanied by Chinese leaders.

However, Yan Mingfu's most intense and most painful political event may be the democratic protest in Tiananmen Square in 1989, which was shadowed to Gorbachev's visit. Yan Mingfu became a negotiating representative, talking to Chinese intellectuals with protesters and Chinese intellectuals who tried to stop bloody suppression.

"Mr. Yan Mingfu followed the people of the Communist Party in his life, but at the critical moment in 1989, his human nature defeated the party spirit."(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/6-07032023115209.html)Written. "Such people are rare within the CCP."

On November 11, 1931, Yan Mingju was born in Beijing and ranked older among the six children. His father, Yan Baohang, is an official of the Governor's Kuomintang government. In 1937, [secretly joined the hostile Communist Party](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iqLNNtnSCT8J:dangshi.people.com.cn/n/2015/0902/c85037-27542049.html&hl=en&gl=tw&strip=1&vwsrc=0), Become an underground party. His mother, Gao Suntong, is a housewife.

Yan Mingfu wrote in a memoir published in 2015 that with the advancement of Japan's invasion of China, their family kept relocating, and finally settled in Chongqing, southwestern cities in China, and became the Kuomintang's base camp during the war.

When he was young, Yan Mingfu had witnessed the mysterious visitors -the contact person of the Communist Party, secretly slipped into the room on the second floor of his house to see his father.

"On the surface, he was playing mahjong," Yan Mingfu wrote in his memoir. "It's actually a meeting."

Later, their family moved to the northeast near the Soviet border, and Yan Mingfu decided to learn Russian. After the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong in 1949, Yan Mingfu served as a translation for government officials. At that time, China studied the Soviet Union, and Yan Ming resumed the translation of Soviet consultants in the Mao Zedong government.

In 1955, he married Wu Keliang, who was also translated. She died in 2015. According to [Family Memoirs published by Daughter Yan Lan](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-house-of-yan-lan-yan?variant=32207726018594), The two elderly people also have a grandson.

Yan Mingfu accompanied Chinese leaders to visit the Soviet Union, and served as Mao Zedong's interpreter in Moscow's treacherous negotiations in 1957. At that time, the relationship between the two countries had begun to complicate due to ideological and foreign policy tensions.

On the hot day in August 1958, Mao Zedong exchanged opinions with the visited Soviet leader Khrushchev while swimming. Yan Mingfu and another translator also followed the pool, and worked hard to hear what the two leaders said, and then translated it loudly to each other.

"When they swim and go ashore, we are already sweating," Yan Mingfu recalled.

In the following 20 years, with the turbulence of Mao Zedong's revolutionary situation, and officials close to the Soviet Union have become increasingly suspicious, Yan Mingfu was deeply implicated. In 1967, he was accused of being prison for Su Xiu agents and counter -revolutionary.

His wife Wu Keliang was also severely reviewed and put into the countryside. In 1975, with the gradual sound of the "Cultural Revolution", Yan Mingfu was released, and the husband and wife were able to reunite with their daughters.

In 1989, Yan Mingfu served as Minister of the Communist Party of China, and the ministry was responsible for dealing with the relationship with intellectuals and ethnic minorities and religious groups.

When the students occupied Tiananmen Square, shouted democratic reform and the demands of the end of corruption, the reform sent by Zhao Ziyang, the general secretary of the party, sent Yan Mingfu as a mediation person. Zhao Ziyang tried to persuade the students to end the hunger strike and ensure that Gorbachev's visit to Beijing was smooth.

Deng Xiaoping, the top leader of China, asked Yan Mingfu to attend talks with Gorbachev. "For so many years, Mingfu has been participating in these negotiations of China and the Soviet Union," Yan Mingfu described Deng Xiaoping's instructions in this memoir, "this time it also allowed Mingfu to participate."

In the meeting with the student leader, Yan Mingfu tried to persuade them to stop hunger strike, because the hunger strike had pushed the political enthusiasm of the protesters to the extreme. He and other officials also sought help from liberal journalists, scholars and intellectuals, and tried their best to fight for protesters' understanding.

But the CCP's hardliners were anxious to show off their cards and refused to make any major concessions. The enthusiastic democratic protest movement will not be easily soothed by negotiations.

In mid -May, [Yan Mingfu adventure to Tiananmen Square](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKDRq35-L8xev4O7ZqBeLg/community?lb=UgkxuJxCEG1fa-OjnvwvCOYeE9HzC1JWLKD5)For the support of the protesters, many people are unable to get up because of refusing to eat. He assured the protesters that the government would consider their demands and guarantee that they would not settle their accounts after autumn.In the end, he begged: "If the students do not believe my guarantee, you can bring me Yan Mingfu back to school for hostages!"

Zhou Ru wrote that Yan Mingfu's words and deeds made him understand that "the Communists are not a piece of iron."

Deng Xiaoping settled the efforts of getting rid of the deadlock in a peaceful way. Less than three weeks later, the army entered the center of Beijing and fired to the protests and onlookers. Hundreds of them -according to some estimates that are thousands of civilians.

Yan Mingfu was surrendered. In his subsequent political career, he served as the deputy minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and later chairman of the Chinese Charity Federation of Charity in the government background.

After retiring, he wrote many memoirs. His article did not mention the history of the 1980s, and reflected the official discussion on that era was still very sensitive.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-10T08-27-53-00-00/000183747_piclink.jpg)ESG originally refers to a kind of investment concept and corporate evaluation standards that focus on corporate environment, society, corporate governance (ENVIRONMENTAL, Social, and Governance). At present, ESG has attracted the attention of major global capital markets and important investment institutions. When evaluating ESG performance of enterprises, the main method is to target and evaluate the specific behaviors of enterprises under different issues. However, the value assessment of the value evaluation of a company's performance in different issues of ESG is not the ultimate destination of the ESG concept. The author believes that if the value of ESG can be monetized, and the unified measurement unit can be used Investment and financing and sustainable transformation of enterprises have a more profound and extensive impact.

At present, the academic and business circles have not carried out meticulous research on ESG monetization issues. In recent years, the GEP accounting and foreign SROI assessment of GEP accounting is highly consistent with the goal of ESG monetization. GEP accounting and SROI assessment can be used as a reference to provide a good reference for the establishment of the ESG monetization system.

Shen Dong was born in a "black five" family in Shanghai. When he was a teenager, his family moved to Hong Kong. His parents started from scratch and worked hard. He was studying at the cow class of the police children's school, struggling in this weak meat and strong environment. After that, he completed his university studies in the United States and returned to Hong Kong, but Hong Kong could not satisfy his ambitions -only the Jiang Zemin's era and Sheng Ge's boiling China were his vast world of his career. As a representative of the US investment company, he opened a roller coaster -like life in Shanghai and Beijing.

The major turning point in Shen Dong's life is to meet his appearance but also the female businessman Duan Weihong, who is also poor but with greater ambitions -Duan Weihong is the founder and chairman of the Kaifeng Public Welfare Foundation, the founder and chairman of the Kaifeng Public Welfare Foundation, Member of the Standing Committee of the National Youth Federation of China and a Strategic Development Advisory Committee of Tsinghua University. They were couples, relying on the grandson's military law and thick black means, squeezed into the social circle and business circle of several major families of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, and became white gloves of the Wen Jiabao family. The status and wealth were still above Guo Wengui. They easily got the central approval and seized the golden treasure land in the center of Beijing. Not only did they reshape the city's urban style, they also stamped a super -large air freight logistics center at Beijing Airport. As a result, the billions of dollars of wealth rolled, and the princes and nobles of the Arab Petroleum countries were not inferior. Until Xi Jinping came to power, he was in the name of anti -corruption to rectify his political opponents, Duan Weihong disappeared out of thin air, and the commercial empire's soil collapsed. Shen Dong, who has already divorced him, is in the UK. In order to rescue the ex -wife of a business partner, he published a book "Red Gambling" and revealed the inside story of the crazy gambling.

"Los Angeles Times" President Barbara Dimick commented: "Shen Dong's book gives us the opportunity to glimpse the indulgent Chinese power, how to use the relationship with the members of the Politburo to bring it to it to bring it. Assets have accumulated to billions of dollars. This is a world composed of Lafite Winery, Rolls -Royce, and a yacht worth 100 million US dollars. Here, friendship is exchanged from a exchange exchange. " In the book, Shen Dong told the spring of 2011. He and Duan Weihong invited Jia Qinglin's daughter Jia Qiang and son -in -law Li Botan and Xu Jiayin to go to Europe's luxury travel. Several family members took a private jet and gambled on the plane, but each of the private planes owned by each other was still accompanied by aircraft to prevent changes in the owner's itinerary, and they could be called at any time. In France, every meal of Shen Dong arranged top meals to please guests. For example, in the first luncheon of the oldest Doye restaurant in Paris, the light wine spent more than 100,000 US dollars. The wine of the meal was the century -old aging of France's most famous winery. Along the way, guests have no interest in museums and art museums. They do not have humanistic literacy and aesthetic ability. They are only "rich primitive people" who know crazy shopping. Shen Dong wrote: "I never imagined that women's shopping can go all out of the ground. When preparing to return to China at Milan Airport, it took more than three hours to apply for shopping tax refund." These details made the movie "Crazy Crazy Crazy The scene in the Asian Rich "is sad.

Due to the lack of Christian traditions, the "Puritan Ethical Ethics and Capitalism Spirit" that German sociologist Max Weber said -Weber quotes the text of the American Father Ben Jehumin Franklin that the spirit of capitalism refers to a kind of utilitarianism Color, for the purpose of increasing capital itself, accumulates the responsibility of personal capital, and uses the accumulated capital for social reproduction rather than personal consumption. Households can only fill their mental emptiness by relying on a lot of money, arrogant extravagance, showing off wealth and status, and alleviating the fear of wealth and status. Buying a flying pigeon bicycle is lucky. Now we are going home with a private plane. From here, we will realize it in less than half of life. It is really incredible. "

** Zhang Peili is the "Chief of Staff" and the Chief Financial Management of Wen Jiabao **

Duan Weihong and Shen Dong's hair, thanks to the "mysterious Aunt Zhang" -Mrs. Wen Jiabao Zhang Peili. Zhang Peili is the protagonist of the book, Duan Weihong and Shen Dong are only supporting roles. In addition to the wife of Mao Zedong, who acts as his political thug, the vast majority of the Most of the CCP's leaders are usually hiding behind the scenes. What they do is national secrets, and the public knows rarely. Even Mrs. Xi Jinping Peng Liyuan, who was a well -known military singer in China, became a beautiful vase next to Xi Jinping after Xi Jinping. Researchers can write dozens of biography of Xi Jinping, but they cannot write a biography for Peng Liyuan based on the material of the scales and half -claws. In "Red Gambling Disc", the author voicedly described the conversation and manners of Zhang Peili, the "staff leader" and the chief financial manager of Wen Jiabao -if I had the material on Shen Dong's hand, when I wrote "Chinese Film Emperor Wen Jiabao", You can definitely write more flesh and blood.

When Shen Dong and Duan Weihong had the relationship between Duan Weihong, Duan Weihong arranged an interview with him. The interviewer was not the parents of Duan, but a "Aunt Zhang" who played the role of the godmother. At the dinner that met with "Auntie Zhang" for the first time, Shen Dong was elegant and answered, and successfully passed the exam. After many years, he still remembers this dinner. Afterwards, he learned that the "Aunt Zhang" was Zhang Peili, the wife of Wen Jiabao, deputy prime minister of the State Council at the time.Shen Dong has accompanied Zhang Peili many times to travel around the world. "We have accompanied her to the grassland pasture in Argentina, the Gorge of New Zealand, the inland meadow in Australia, and the Rowa Valley in France. In the closed -operated hot spring bath, enjoy the nursing therapy for extended life "," her hot spring bath on Lake Geneva, which agreed to perform facial trimming and injection of sheep prenatin to eliminate old wrinkles ... After a few days, gauze removal, Zhang Zhang, Zhang Zhang, Zhang Zhang, Zhang The aunt was not in the scar left behind her ears, and she continued to travel on the road with a new look. "" She usually gets up at five in the morning, holds the electric cooker from Beijing into the restaurant, and boiled skillfully Cook rice porridge, and then take out Chinese -style pickles "— Shen Dong, who likes to eat French -style vertical bread, has to share Chinese breakfast with it.

Zhang Peili has repeatedly went to Hong Kong to buy various items for Wen Jiabao, and even guided Duan Weihong how to increase interest to their sexual life. Shen Dong chose clothes for Wen Jiabao, and gradually changed his too restrained image in front of the public. "Seeing that he was wearing a suit and tie in and out of public in the public, we were secretly ecstatic." However, Shen Dong still defended Wen Jiabao: "Every member in the family is collecting high -end cars, Wen Jiabao is right The luxurious life of his family lacks alertness. "He believes that until the New York Times reported that Wen Jiabao's mother's account was 3 billion US dollars, Wen Jiabao suddenly realized and lamented that his name was destroyed. But this statement is not in line with common sense. Unless Wen Jiabao is a blind man and fool, he will ignore his wife and children every day.

** Not free capitalism, but exclusive and squeezing oligarchs.

Duan Weihong and Shen Dong are all people who are fighting from the bottom of the society and have a strong survivability. They will not hang on the tree of the Wen Jiabao family, because Wen Jiabao has a day of retirement. Mrs. Wen Jiabao regarded them as white gloves, and they also used Mrs. Wen Jiabao as a key chess piece on the chess game -using this chess piece, and then contacting other chess pieces to establish the wrong relationship network.

Shen Dong mentioned that at a dinner arranged by Zhang Peili, he was at the same table with the imperial prince Xi Jinping, who had just been promoted to the vice chairman. During the meeting, Peng Liyuan was mainly talked about. Xi Jinping basically did not speak, and occasionally showed a less natural smile on his face. Perhaps, Xi Jinping was going to be able to remove Duan Weihong and Shen Dong, such as Duan Weihong and Shen Dong at that time, but he needed to cooperate with Wen Jiabao to deal with the aggressive political opponents Bo Xilai and Zhou Yongkang. However, he has a heavy mind and a soul. This time Zhang Peili's matchmaking was unsuccessful, and Xi Jinping could not follow the white gloves used by Wen Jiabao. Of course, the Xi Jinping family had his own white gloves. This laid the foreshadowing of Duan Weihong's future reinforcement.

When Wen Jiabao was still in office, Duan Weihong established a close relationship with Wen Jiabao's deputy Wang Qishan. "They talk about everything between them. The main purpose of Wang Qishan Duan Weihong is to increase the contact with Wen Jiabao to understand Wen Jiabao and judge the direction of his boss's thinking ... ... Duan Weihong regarded Wang Qishan, who had no children after marriage as a trusted uncle Exchange. "Shen Dong found that Wang Qishan sometimes shows the unique nerve anxiety unique to the upper levels of Chinese power -the seemingly savvy Wang Qishan is actually convinced of a nonsense of the anti -American conspiracy theory in the best -selling book" Monetary War "(the author of the author (his author It has long been moved to the United States), and it can be seen that his willingness to cooperate with the United States in public places is camouflage. Deep in his heart, the United States is regarded as an enemy who does not wear the sky. None of the CCP's ruling class is a true person of pro -beauty or the freedom of the people.

The Duan Weihong and Shen Dong and his wife will be judged that Sun Zhengcai, a new star in politics, will be the successor of Wen Jiabao. As early as Sun Zhengcai was the secretary of the Beijing Shunyi District Party Committee, the two sides intersect at the airport project. Later, Sun Zhengcai rocked in politics, and Duan Weihong bet on huge sums of money. When Sun Zhengcai served as a large official in a foreign country, he would meet Duan Weihong after returning to Beijing activities in the entertainment dinner every time he returned to Beijing. Sun Zhengcai described to Duan Weihong that if his career was not wrong, he would eventually enter the Politburo Standing Committee. Each step of his actions focuses on this highest goal. Duan Weihong provides the funds required for the upper level of operation. However, this has become her most failed investment. She lost not only money, but also the whole career and life. Since Xi Jinping regards Sun Zhengcai as the "political golden boy" of his hostile department, of course, it must be removed. Without the end of the nest, Sun Zhengcai fell off, and the end of Duan Weihong came. She stepped on the line and participated in the upper -level political struggle, and even Mrs. Wen Jiabao couldn't save her. After Duan Weihong's accident, Prince Qishan's Chinese Media Caixin.com published an article entitled "Duan Weihong Folding Wing", which detailed Duan Weihong's series of transactions that cut cakes from state -owned enterprises. "At the most suitable time, win the most value -added assets at the lowest price. Strangely, this article was quickly deleted after publishing.

It can be seen from the cases of Duan Weihong and Shen Dong, and the collusion between China's power elites and commercial elites has reached the point where it is honored and damaged. Shen Dong acknowledged that among the officials at all levels he have contacted, none of them could resist the mechanism of corruption, and the official career of the Qing officials ended everywhere. Scholar Pei Minxin has a deep analysis of this in the book "Selling China": "The economic development under the authoritarian system can easily lead to the fundamental cause of power and noble capitalism. Absolute definition and dominance. Due to the privileges of the political rule of the authoritarian system, they inevitably use these powers to 'self -fat "in the process of economic development. Together to collude and conduct power and money transactions. This process is an opportunity for these two groups of elites. Rule of elites can use the 'rights' that they have, especially the right to dominate state -owned assets. Economic elites, which have a close private relationship with the elites of ruling elites, can obtain low -cost high -quality state -owned assets with a small amount of money through bribes, thereby obtaining huge profits and becoming a wealth of wealth. "

** Why do you get the reflection of the "co -conspirator"? **

"A Note of the Dream of Red Mansions" said: "I coaxed you to sing and me. In the end, I just marry clothes for others." For Duan and Shen, they are not even qualified to marry clothes. To make white gloves for others, it seems that the scenery is infinite, but it is swimming on the blade, and if you care about it, you will break your bones. Shen Dong wrote: "We have not been educated by related cooperation and team spirit. On the contrary, we are guided to divide the world into either friends or enemies. All allies are temporary, and all friends can be abandoned. We can be abandoned. Ready to respond to the party's order at any time, and tell our parents, teachers and friends. The most important thing we teach is to win. Only those who suffer are the moral coward. This is the Communist Party continued to take power since 1949. The guidance philosophy, unscrupulous tricks can be like fish in China. We can learn as long as the results can be achieved. China is a cold -blooded country under the rule of the Communist Party. "He attributed his failure and the reason for the situation to be not hot enough.Shen Dong mentioned two important political events in contemporary China at the beginning and end of "Red Gambling". The first one was the June 4th massacre in 1989. "In Hong Kong, like all Hong Kong people, my father and I sit on a chair to watch live reports on the TV’ s suppression on TV. We can't help crying ... ... When his father saw that the party wanted to suppress his own people, it was expected that the worst moment was still behind. " The latter one was Hong Kong's anti -delivery central movement. The struggle was deeply moved, which inspired me to return to Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in June 2019. I joined the millions of Hong Kong people to march under the thirty -five degrees Celsius and show the will of Hong Kong people around the world. " He hopes to use these two political events as the historical background of publishing the book and highlight his dung behavior. However, for his experience of predation in crocodile ponds in the capitalist of the two political events for more than 20 years, his self -reflection and self -criticism have passed like a dragonfly. It is not easy for anyone to completely deny that you are calling the wind and rain. If it wasn't for Duan Weihong's accident, Shen Dong would definitely not be able to write a book and tell the truth, because he was one of the vested interests, even if he only helped clean the small fish in the seam of crocodile teeth.

Another country is said to have 2.18 million troops, all in China, which is a solid foundation for maintaining 500 red gene families. The leaders of the previous country were called "human enemy" by the media of the latter country. The leaders of the latter country claimed to "lead the world" and also established a "community of human destiny." Don't guess, this is the United States and China.

For more than 240 years, the United States established the President of 46, without exception, all sworn in according to the Bible. Not only is the president, but the presidents of the two hospitals of the United States and all the judges of the United States also announced in office according to the Bible. Why? The establishment of the country in the United States is in the name of "the name of God", and "for the honor of God". Not lying is one of the cornerstones of God's honor!

On the other hand, the heads of Chinese are vowed by the so -called constitution. It is ridiculous that there are four constitutions, and the last 1982 version of the Constitution has been modified five times. Why? Because this constitution is full of lies, it is also to justify all the lies of the CCP. Therefore, it is inevitable to modify it. It can be said that the most important foundation of the CCP is a lie.

Before entering Beijing, the CCP deceived the world shamelessly in order to defeat the Republic of China government, especially to deceive the United States. On July 4, 1943, the Xinhua Daily published the editorial "Elementation of Democracy -Independence Memorial Days Dedicated to the United States" and said: "Every year, every kind and honest person in the world will feel joy and glory; from the world After this new country was born, democracy and science have planted the foundation in a free new world. 167 years, every night, every night, you can also look at the darkest corner of the earth to the free gods. The light of the torch, — it makes all the victims feel warm, and feel that there is hope in this world. "

"In China, every primary school student knows the honesty of Washington. Every middle school student knows Lincoln’s fairness and eloquent, Jefferson's big and sincere. These glorious names are already a symbol of all virtues in our country. They represent their representatives. This is not just the honor of a country and a nation. "" Chinese people learn Washington, Lincoln, and learn Jefferson, so that we know how to build a democratic and free China to bold, fair, and honest. "

But so praise has been confirmed by the history of more than 70 years. It is the biggest lie!

Today's national power of the Communist Party of China, read a declaration written by the German Marx, sang international songs edited by the French, swore to the party flag designed by the Russians, deposited the money to the banks of Switzerland, the United States, and sent his wife and children to the United States and Canada. , Australia, but to the people under their rule: We will never engage in the West. As soon as he turned his head, he went to reunite with the Western family.

A group of celebrities and generals admit: anti -American is work, immigration is life. If human beings tolerate the country where the country is established to build a "community of human destiny", then human destiny will be worried!

[ ![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-10T10-08-00Z/55702323_303.png)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66175731/55702323)(Voice of Germany Chinese) [Quan Hengdao, a senior researcher at the Japanese Institute of Industry Technology, Tsukuba City, Ibishi Prefecture, has recently been arrested for leaking data to a Chinese company](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國籍研究員遭日逮捕-北京嚴正關切/a-65967582)Essence He was suspected of violating laws that prohibit unfair competition.

59 -year -old Quan Hengdao worked in the institute in April 2002. However, according to the Sankei News, in 2006, he also became a professor at Beijing University of Science and Technology.

Beijing Institute of Technology and Nanjing University of Technology that he had studied belonged to the "National Defense Seven Sons", which means that there is a connection with the Chinese military.

In addition, it is reported that Quan Hengdao participated in the Chinese government's ["Thousand Talents Plan"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/调查报道从海德堡走向中国的敏感量子科技/a-65895830)Essence The plan is considered to attract researchers to help Beijing improve its scientific and technological capabilities.

### What are the allegations?

The confidential data of Quan Hengdao transferred the confidential data of the fluoride synthesis technology to a company founded by his wife and his wife in China.

A few months after the data transfer, the couple's company obtained the patent of the technology in China.

Former Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, the largest opposition party, the Japanese Parliament's largest opposition party and the Central Left Party-member Jin Matsubara, said that the data transferred by Quan Heng Road "seemed to be unrelated to national defense or economic security." However, he said that the case showed a loss to the government that might cause losses to Japan.

Matsuna Ren said: "It is necessary to look at the matter from a wider perspective. Japan's laws related to technology have two purposes: one is to avoid leakage of advanced technologies, and the other is to promote international exchanges and invite foreign scholars and talents with special knowledge and talents. Japanese expert cooperation. "

He said to Germany: "Therefore, there are so many China and [Russia](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄超音速科学家受控向中国提供机密/a-65724308)People are in Japan's institutes and universities. These foreign scholars have become so important that some institutions cannot operate without them. "

### Restricted cutting -edge technology sharing

Matsuna Ren said that the Chinese National Intelligence Law requires all citizens to share knowledge obtained from overseas, even before signing a confidentiality agreement. This means that "every Chinese citizen may be potentially become a [spy](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/mad报告俄中刺探德军情报最活跃/a-66153262)"Therefore, there is no choice for Japan, the United States and other countries, and must use an effective security audit system to exclude Chinese scholars outside the institution that handles high -sensitivity economy or security technology. "

### Exclusive Survey: Scholars who cooperate with China National Defense University of Science and Technology

### More spy?

Some people believe that none of the Japanese governments have failed to take necessary preventive measures, leading to state security damage. Yoichishimada, a professor of international relations at Fukui County University, said: "I don't understand how Quan Hengdao has been allowed to stay in this position for 20 years without any review. For me, this shows that it involves Japan involved in Japan How relaxed our vigilance in the future of economy and security. This is unforgivable. "

As known as Shimada, he "confirmed that there are more spies in China and other countries active in" Japan. He said: "I feel that this government and universities are too weak for these problems. This incident only reveals the severity of the problem."

All candidates have already showed their own program. Eight Immortals cross the sea and show their ability. There are those who draw the United States and some who draw Xi Jinping, they all claim that they are for the safety and interests of the people of Taiwan. Who is the most reliable and who is flicker? I will give everyone a closer look.

The most unreliable is that Xi Jinping could not hit Taiwan, and the Kuomintang candidate Hou Youyi. Who do you think you are, Xi Jinping will care about your attitude? In the internal debate and conditions of the Communist Party, no one has considered the pro -China faction. Just as the tiger that Wu Song meets, it is no longer a normal tiger but a tiger who eats people. He is determined to eat your tiger. Is it useful to express it?

The most reliable is the DPP candidate Lai Qingde: While tightening the largest ally in the United States, he stepped up to enhance the defense capabilities. Only the people have the will to defend their own will and turn Taiwan into a poron is not afraid of effective defense measures for strong enemies. No matter how powerful the tiger and leopard wolf is, it is impossible to start when you meet the pigs. If you don't accept it, let's cry with a mouth of poison.

Disclaimer in Taiwan was an independent country, and the name is the Republic of China. This is a wise and realistic policy. Give up the existing name of the country, do you have to change a name, is there that necessary? The so -called Taiwan independence movement was an excuse for the Kuomintang's one -party dictatorship. After democracy, the Taiwan independence movement continues to do the internal divisions of the enemy. This has been secretly abandoned from the age of Chen Shui -bian. It is clear and necessary to make it clear now.

Why does the United States resolutely do not support the position of Taiwan independence? Not only because this is an illusory movement that has no reason and no substantial content, but also because of the Chinese Communist Party's nationalist propaganda brainwashing for many years, most people in the mainland oppose Taiwan independence in name. Change the national name will touch the sensitive nerves and help Xi Jinping mobilize the people to support the war. This is very unfavorable to Taiwan, and it will affect the United States that the United States is involved in a war that can be avoided.

What is necessary to re -explain the Taiwan independence party constitution or abandon the Taiwan independence movement? First of all, it is conducive to unite people to defend Taiwan and narrow the market of pro -communist elements. Secondly, the United States no longer has to worry about a war due to Taiwan's reasons. Secondly, there will be more people in the mainland, and I feel that there is no need to go to Wu Tong Taiwan -the CCP ’s flicker over the years, and it has become a joke. This measure is the "soldier who does not fight" in the military law, which reduces the danger of martial arts and increases the safety of Taiwan. It was a move.

Publicly declare that Taiwan is an independent country, and the timing is also important. In recent years, Xi Jinping's actions have become more and more frequent, and the growth of military strength has also created conditions for Xi Jinping. It can be said that the possibility of war explosion is getting higher and higher. Taiwan's internal solidarity and resistance will be even more important. To resolve internal contradictions with war, it is the life -saving straw of the comrades of Xiao Xi Qian Donkey. It's like you can't explain the lunatic according to normal people.

Coincidentally, Russia had a strange Wagner at this time, which seriously threatened Russia's will to war. Russia is a big chess chess of Comrade Xiao Xi. It consumes Western strength in Ukraine, which can alleviate the resistance of martial arts Taiwan. Sitting on the mountains can collect the advantages of fishermen. Xiao Xi is not as stupid as people think. Unfortunately, Putin encountered big trouble, commented on his own | Wei Jingsheng: Moving stones and smashing his feet. Although it quickly resolved the trouble, it also exposed the weaknesses. It is unknown whether it can continue to create martial arts for Xi Jinping.

What is important is that the opposite remarks of the two senior diplomats of the Communist Party of China have exposed the sound of the internal anti -war. The reason for reducing the war of hardships is just right. So I think Lai Qingde is a more reliable presidential candidate.

[![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T10-23-00-04-00/000001.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenguangchengboke/cgc-07102023102324.html/@@images/image)Associated Press Picture

It is said to be the 102th birthday of the Communist Party of China on July 1, 2023. In the past, at this time every year it was a well -known "sensitive day". In addition to "sensitive" this year, many activists, rights protection persons, and being monitored by "duty" in previous years, the Chinese Communist Party abnormally showed that The number of party members exceeded 98 million ".

The CCP deliberately released this kind of people who want to make the world feel that they have joined the Communist Party a lot(The implication of words, you can imagine that the number of people who enthusiastically applied to join the CCP is more.)The information attracted my attention. After a few days of understanding, I learned a little about the cause of the CCP. I will share with you here. We only hope that we can realize the profound meaning under the superficial phenomenon after careful thinking.

Rural China is still the main body of the CCP's falling area today, and most of the Chinese people live in barren rural areas. With the CCP's rule for decades, the allocation of social resources is seriously dislocated, making it difficult for farmers to maintain their livelihood in rural areas. It can be said that in recent years, the country has reached the level of "there are seven or eight air in the ten rooms", because all farmers who can still do some work can find the opportunity to work in the city. Even women in their sixty -year -olds go to the city as a caregiver to take care of the older people ... Only the old, weak, and disabled are staying in the village to see their households. Now on the road of the countryside, it is difficult to even want to meet a villager ...

Although the countryside is so small, the village party branch in rural China has never stopped operation. However, this year's "Seven One" Party celebration "is a bit difficult to do compared to the past. Because on the one hand, the party's request must have a certain number of party members to participate in the "Seven One" party celebration ", and also take pictures and upload and archive; on the other hand, most rural residents are working out. They asked them to come back to participate in organizational activities like "Party Celebration". In fact, everyone understands that party members have no substantial significance for farmers. Therefore, even if the local party committee threatened the "expels their party" and asked them to return to the village to participate in organizational activities, they would not come back.

In this case, many township party committees in Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei organized various village branch secretaries to meet and came up with the villagers in the left -behind villages to a celebration of the party's birthday, and then took them to nearby nearby. The martyrs' cemetery, the "revolutionary holy place", and the "Xianlie former residence" to visit the way to upload uploading. In this way, the "party member of the National Party Celebrating the 102th birthday of the Communist Party of China" was completed ... It is really "village coaxing the country, the county coax county, and has been coaxing to the State Council." Is this the number of "more than 9 million party members" that the Communist Party of China said? Does the Communist Party's Organization Department not check the photos uploaded and confirm whether the participants are party members?

We all know that there is a "indiscriminate charging" story in the Spring and Autumn Period, but in the face of today's "Seventh One" Party celebration ", the Communist Party organized the number of" organizational "to" organize "the number of" party members ". The party charges is much more powerful than the "indiscriminate charging".

I remember when the Qing government was about to fall, the queen Wan Rong went outside the palace alone. When she came back, Pu Yi reminded her, "This is a violation of the rules of the court to be executed." When people know that a group has no cohesion, and soon when the tree is scattered, all Xiangtang gangs will no longer have substantial binding power.

Although the Communist Party of China has "more than 90 million party members" on the surface, how many of these so -called "party members" are with the "red heart" that the CCP wants? Intersection

Therefore, the "more than 90 million party members" showed by the Communist Party of China in the "Seven One" Party Celebration is just a number that is used to abuse the number, decorate the facade, and deceive themselves!

Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, is preparing to sue the social media company's harm to the young people of Utah.

Politico reported that Cobax said in an interview with the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) on Sunday (July 9) that in the next few months, the Utah State Government may file a lawsuit against the social media company and ask them to give them a right to give it to the social media company. The state of the state is responsible for the damage caused by the young man.

He said that the state government believes that social media companies have realized these dangers, and there are very clear evidence that they know the harm of their products to young people and try to cover up.

Cobax signed the law earlier this year to restrict minors using social media. This law will come into effect next year. Some regulations include a digital curfew on social media users under the age of 18. It is required that minors must get the consent of their parents when registering accounts, and require social media companies to verify the age of Utah.

This is the first such law introduced in the United States. Cobax admits that it will be difficult to implement, and may even face legal challenges. In his Sunday interview, he said that when he was restricting youth to visit social media, the Supreme Court may weigh the decision.

He also pointed out that the purpose of implementing this law is to make the family have more mastery of what happened in social media. "The latest research results show that the use of social media and more suicide, anxiety, depression, and self -harm occurred. There is not only a connection, but a causal relationship. "

He hopes that this method will allow parents and children to control more of their social media experience and promote social media companies to stop using harmful addictive algorithms.

The German Chemical Group is investing in modern factories and green technology -but mainly outside Europe, the largest union in the industry warns.

German Chemical and Energy Industry Trade Union IG BCE Chairman Michael Vasilianis(Michael Vassiliadis)Said: "Investment in new factories and new technologies ... is out of Germany." He added that "since the emergence of energy issues", this trend has accelerated.

Vasilianis said that the main beneficiaries are China and the United States. These two countries provide enterprises with "full sets". In addition to tax benefits, they also include providing green energy and regulatory rapid approval.

European countries compete for foreign direct investment(FDI)Competition is increasingly fierce. German Institute of Economics(German Economic Institute)It is said that because companies will invest in overseas, Germany encountered a record deficit last year, and said that this situation was "worrying."

Last year, the U.S. government announced the "Reduction of Inflation"(IRA)The huge subsidies for various green technology investment are designed to attract foreign direct investment for key areas. Vasilianis said that China also uses the treasury to support certain industries, one of which is the chemical industry.

The Chinese government, which is difficult to cope with the long -term slowdown of the economy, especially welcomes foreign direct investment to enter high -tech fields such as advanced manufacturing, information technology and scientific research, because China is striving to make the industry climb upstream to the value chain.

Wasilianis is both the person in charge of the union and BASF(BASF)Member of the Supervisory Board. He said the German chemical group is a typical example of investing in the most advanced technology in China.

The world's largest chemical company is currently building a petrochemical base that invests 10 billion euros in Zhanjiang. Based on the headquarters of this German group located in the port of Ludwig Port, the base will use "cutting -edge technology" and "maximum ... sustainable standards". At the same time, the company warned it that it would "permanently" reduce its business in Europe.

Vasilianis said that the support of Chinese authorities has made this investment possible. China will build a wind power field near the base to meet the company's requirements for a large amount of cheap green energy.

Kepler Cheuvreux's chemical industry research joint director Christian Fayz(ChristianFaitz)He said he believes that Europe will not build any new ammonia factories. As a raw material required for hydrogen -powered vehicles, ammonia plays an important role in the net zero emissions economy. At the same time, BASF closed one of the two ammonia factories located in Ludwig Port on the grounds of high energy costs.

"I hope (Europe) politicians can realize these trends." He added that this trend may threaten the industrial growth of continental Europe.

VCI of the German Chemical Industry Association said that companies in the industry cannot invest in China, which accounts for about 43%of the global chemical industry market.

VCI added that the German Chemical Group has "expanded" investment in China in recent years, and one -fifth of the foreign investment in the industry has finally flowed into China.

Description: Yellen said that despite significant differences, Sino -US relations have a more stable foothold, and high -level seniors will communicate more frequently, but they have not announced a specific breakthrough or agreement. The outside world believes that Sino -US tensions have not been substantially relieved. Thomas Peter/Reuters, US Finance Minister Jennite Yellen, said at a press conference in Beijing that despite "major differences", the United States and China will seek more high -level communication.

The US -China relations, which have been deteriorating in recent years, have recently lost control. The reason is that the two sides are opposed to several major issues, including the Ukrainian war and China, which leads the U.S. -U.S. airspace [spy balloon](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230206/china-spy-balloon-time/)Shooted down by the U.S. military, and the two countries' mutual [restricting trade](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/business/economy/us-china-chips-janet-yellen.html)The practice is constantly upgrading.

After ten hours of talks in Beijing in Beijing, Yellen said at a press conference on Sunday that she believed that the United States and China had a more stable foothold, although there were "major differences" in the two countries.

"We believe that the world is big enough to accommodate the prosperity and development of our two countries," Yellen said.

Yellen announced that the two sides will communicate more frequently at the highest level. She refers to the relationship between the two countries as "one of the most important relationships in our era" and say that improving the dialogue is to prevent deepening of reluctance and prevent this relationship. Way. A few weeks ago, Secretary of State [Brinken](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)Visit China. Later this month, a special envoy of the presidential climate change affairs [John Kerry](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230707/john-kerry-china-climate/)It will also visit China to restart the negotiation of global warming.

However, economic tensions are unlikely to be substantially relieved. Yellen has returned to Washington on Sunday without announced that it has made breakthrough progress or reached an agreement to make up for the continuous cracks between the two countries. Yellen clearly stated that the Biden government has expressed serious concerns about many business behaviors in China, including China's approach to foreign companies and the policy of being regarded by the United States as economic coercion.

Yellen's trip was the first time in the past four years to visit China. She saw the four most powerful leaders in the leadership of Xi Jinping in the leadership team of Xi Jinping: Premier Li Qiang, Chinese official No. 2, and Yellen The position is equivalent [Deputy Prime Minister He Lifeng](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230328/xi-jinping-he-lifeng-china-economy/), Minister of Finance Liu Kun, and Pan Gongsheng, the new party secretary of the People's Bank of China.

A few hours before Yellen held a press conference, the Chinese official news agency Xinhua News Agency issued a report on her interview, saying that the talks between the two parties were constructive, but also reiterated the key areas that China believed to be controversial. It is reported that China continues to oppose the Bayeng government emphasizing that it is to maintain US national security through trade restrictions.

"China believes that generalization of national security is not conducive to normal economic and trade exchanges," Xinhua News Agency reported. "China has expressed concerns about the US sanctions restrictions on China."

US -China relations have a significant impact on the world. The two countries are the largest and second largest economies in the world, accounting for 40%of the global output, and they are still indispensable partners in many aspects. The two countries buy and sell important products, provide funds for each other's business and business, and make applications and movies for audiences in the two countries.

Chinese officials expressed their concerns to Yellen. Yellen said that they discussed the Trump administration's tariff on tariffs on imported goods in China, and these tariffs were still retained. Although Yellen had criticized tariffs invalid, she said that before the end of the internal review, the current government will not make any decisions on tariffs, which has reiterated the government position after President Biden took office.

She also mentioned that China is about to invest in the United States [restricting investment in China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html)Farewell, and said that she tried to explain that these measures were aimed at certain limited industries, not to have a broad impact on the Chinese economy. Chinese officials and experts are also worried that the US government's efforts to restrict China's efforts may damage the development of high potential industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing in China.

China has been restricting its country's overseas investment since 2015, encouraging Chinese enterprises and individuals to avoid overseas real estate speculation, and promote them [to make larger investment in areas with strategic value](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20190311/china-central-bank-currency/)For example, aircraft production, heavy equipment manufacturing, and network security.

Wu Xinbo, dean of the School of International Relations of Shanghai Fudan University, warned that Yellen's trip will not bring substantial improvements in relations between the two countries unless the Bayeng government changes its policy of China.

"So far, we have not seen any signs that Biden will re -consider his economic policy to China," Wu Xinbo said.

Some analysts believe that the desire to make more dialogues is a major progress. After several months of ignoring each other, the two countries can at least start discussing differences.

Former Chinese Ministry of Commerce officials and now Beijing's global think tank as a senior researcher He Weiwen welcomed Yellen's statement of prosperity and development of China and the United States. "There is a huge difference between China and the United States, so continuous and direct communication is not only constructive, but also vital," he said.

This is especially true during Trump's administration. Before He Lifeng was the vice -prime minister responsible for international economic policy four months ago, Liu He had always held this position. The latter has repeatedly tried to compromise with Steven Manuskin, who has served as the Minister of Finance in the former President Trump's government, reached a compromise on trade and economic issues, but Manuchin could not convince Trump. Trump eventually levied tariffs on extensive Chinese export products for his unfair business behavior.

Many American companies that are connected with China have hoped that the US -China relations will become more friendly after Biden took office, and Chinese officials have such hope. However, US -China relations have not only improved, but also became more tense in the past two years, and in February this year's spy balloon incident, it fell into a complete frozen state.

Although Yellen's interview is considered a positive step, many experts in China and the United States warn that do not expect the relationship between the two countries to change too much.

"Yellen's trip may allow the tense economic relationship to ease slightly, reminding the United States and China that they have some common business benefits -even if they are weakened -no matter what the situation, they need to make a conversation, maybe they can be on the edge. Improve business exchanges, "Mark Sobel, who had been an official in the US Treasury, said.

However, considering that both countries are worried about national security issues, China has a view that the United States tries to curb its economic development, and the tough political language of the two countries, Sobel said, "It is difficult for Yelun to change the fundamental political dynamics and economic relations. Track. "

Although there are differences between China and the United States, Yellen was warmly welcomed in Beijing during the first visit to China as the Minister of Finance.

During the meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the No. 2 Chinese official mentioned that a rainbow appeared in the sky when Yellen arrived at the Capital Airport, saying that this symbolizes the hope of the relationship between the two countries that can be repaired.

On Thursday night, someone saw Yellen a dining in a Yunnan gourmet restaurant. [Chinese official media reported the matter, saying that she could use chopsticks skillfully](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202307/1293945.shtml)It is also said that after seeing Yellen's mushroom dishes on social media, the number of people in the restaurant's seats increased significantly.

Yellen also met with Chinese experts who invested climate and had lunch with a group of Chinese female economists and entrepreneurs. She said that the United States and China can find consensus in many areas.

"Our people have many common things, far more than our differences," Yellen said at lunch.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) North Korea accused the United States offered to invade its airspace on Monday (July 10) and criticized the United States' plans to deploy nuclear missile submarines near the Korean Peninsula.

North Korea claims that the United States has repeatedly provoked and warned that although Pyongyang has maintained restraint, it will still shot down such reconnaissance flights. A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement that the "provocative" military operations implemented by the United States "many times" are making the Korean Peninsula closer to the nuclear conflict.

The North Korean Society quoted the spokesman's statement saying, "No one can guarantee that the North Korean East China Sea will not be shocked by the US Air Force strategic reconnaissance aircraft."

The U.S. military did not respond immediately, while South Korea refuted that North Korea's claim that the U.S. military violated the airspace was not true. South Korea said the United States conducted routine reconnaissance flight around the Korean Peninsula.

The Solomon Islands of China and Pacific Island signed a police cooperation agreement on Monday (10th) as part of upgrading the relationship between the two countries into "comprehensive strategic partnerships". Four years ago, the Solomon Islands broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with Beijing.

According to Reuters, the Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sogovre arrived in China on Sunday, and it was the first time he visited China since the two countries reached a security agreement last year. This has aroused the vigilance of neighboring countries including the United States and Australia.

On Monday, Sogovre signed nine agreements after meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang in Beijing. The police cooperation agreement is one of them. This highlights the opportunity to seek the Foreign Policy of the Solomon Islands.

According to Chinese official media CCTV, Sogovre also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, and the two agreed to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership. Xi Jinping told Sogovre that China supports more Chinese companies to invest in the Solomon Islands and will continue to provide economic and technical assistance of "non -additional political conditions".

The Sogovare's Office emphasized in a statement that "high -quality infrastructure" is a field that the country enhances economic power to eliminate poverty.

China Telecom giant Huawei has now built a telecommunications network in the Solomon Islands. Its funds come from US $ 66 million in loans from China Import and Export Bank, which has aroused concerns about the burden on debt. A Chinese state -owned company will also rebuild the capital of the capital Honeyla.

In this trip, Sogovre will stay in China until Saturday, and unveiled the newly opened embassy in China in Beijing.

In April 2022, the country signed a secret security agreement with China, which caused concern of the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and worried that China would use it to strengthen its military deployment in the Pacific. At present, the United States Biden government is advancing the plan to reorganize the Solomon Islands Embassy to contribute to Beijing's influence.

Ms. Fu, who has been immigrating to Vancouver for 20 years, likes Yan Geling very much, saying that her works have a lot of vertical and horizontal spans, very sense of time, and deeply portrayed human nature. Now that she is blocked by the Chinese authorities because she tells the truth, she needs to express her support for her.

"Historically needed a writer like her, there are many writers in China. They actually dare not write or write, or have to say false words. She has a Chinese experience and the opportunity to speak abroad and her The vast number of readers, so she is a writer worthy of our cherishment. "

Yan Geling hopes that everyone can be themselves: "If every Chinese writer says his own sentence to every incident, he will say a truth, this China will not be as bad as it is now."

(Voice of Germany) Yellen is the second cabinet member who visited China since the Bayeng government came to power. In the 4 -day trip to China, [Yellen had a talks with senior Chinese officials for about 10 hours. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/耶伦与中国女性经济学家共进午餐促决策层性别多元/a-66164057)Comments are generally believed that, like the Secretary of State Broin who visited China not long ago, the trip to China, the US Treasury Secretary Yellen, did not bring breakthroughs to bilateral relations. [As she said](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/耶伦结束访华建立一个弹性有效的沟通管道/a-66168564)"No visit can resolve our challenges overnight. But I hope that this trip will help build a flexible and effective communication channel."

The China Economic Expert SCOTKENNEDY, an expert in Chinese economic issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: "The meeting itself is achievement, not a consensus. Our focus is that the United States and China have been in the United States and China for three years in three years in three years. There is almost no communication in half, and the degree of unbelievable and taunting two sides has accumulated a deep level. "

He said that there are many differences between the United States and China under the background of the epidemic, tariffs, national security, trade restrictions, and dilemma facing the predicament of Huamei Enterprises, and Yellen can still conduct civilized and substantial discussions with Chinese officials such as He Lifeng Significant.

"Global Times", which is quite nationalist in China [through interview expert review](https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4De8IycgkoF)"From the summary of Yelun, it can be seen that her understanding of Sino -US relations is generally pragmatic, objective and calm, and there is a unique insight and balance perspective as an economic expert." ](http://www.china.com.cn/opinion2020/2023-07/10/content_91766898.shtml)The summary of Yelun's visit to China has given the outside world a certain positive expectations, but this expectation is like a candlelight in the wind, not only weak but also uncertainty. The overall pessimistic expectations have not changed. It is believed that Yellen's visit will hardly change the trajectory of economic relations between the two countries, and it is difficult to promote the substantial improvement of Sino -US relations. "

### Expert: The opposition state "brings damage to the US -China economy"

### ** Friendly Three Bow **

Reuters reported that a senior official of the US Treasury who accompanied Yellen's visit to China described the interview as "mutual respect, frankness and constructiveness", "she was warmly received."

The official revealed that Yelun met with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister He Lifeng for two hours on Saturday (July 8), but they talked for 5 hours, and then attended a "friendly" dinner.

At the beginning of the meeting with He Lifeng, a detail was widely concerned. Yellen bowed many times when He Lifeng shook hands with He Lifeng, while the host of the Chinese host stood straight there. Some media and social media said that Yellen gave a gift in Beijing, bowed to Chinese officials three, and let the United States embarrassed and so on. Bonnieglaser, director of the Asian project of the Marshall Foundation in Germany, reposted relevant videos and said, "I hope someone can tell US officials that they should straighten their chests when they shake hands with Chinese officials."

### ** See if Yellen can relax the tariff punishment for China **

Trade experts said after the meeting that it is difficult to see how the Washington and the Chinese government will reach compromise at present. Two parties to hold a conversation are the best ways.

National Foreign Trade Council chairman JakeColvin said "I think Yellen's tone is correct, and the US government and enterprises should make efforts to reduce risks and achieve diversified supply chain. The two countries still need to maintain an important economic relationship, and Yellen has found a balance between the two. "

Hong Yan, chief economist of Grow InvestmentGroup in Hong Kong, said that a possible result is that the United States relaxes part of the punitive tariffs on some of the Chinese goods. Essence

However, Korvi believes that as the presidential election approaches the 2024 presidential election, if China does not take equal action, the Bayeng government unilaterally relax tariffs or other restrictions, which will be "politically difficult to promote."

### ** Yellen, who plays the red face, succeeded **

Germany ’s judge Goerlach believes that under the current framework of the world pattern, Yellen's visit to China is a“ comprehensive success ”.“ She has a Chinese talks with Chinese talks to make communication channels. ”

He also believes that Yellen and the Secretary of State Brosky visited China in front of and in fact a red and white -faced double reed. "Brinton plays' red -faced ', Yellen plays the" white face', which means that Brinton is more difficult and must state issues such as Guoan in Beijing, while Yellen represents a sense of reason, advocating cooperation and joint trade. "

More than 20 Hong Kong district councilors responded to the Ministry of the Commission, condemning the Hong Kong Government's commitment to violating the "Basic Law" to promote democratic elections, asking governments to not acknowledge the legitimacy of the Hong Kong Parliament.

The Hong Kong District Council has been generated from almost completely directly in the past, and has evolved to only 20 % of the next seats in the next district council. Of the 470 seats, 179 seats were appointed by the Chief Executive and added 176 seats generated by regional extermination, fire prevention, and district committees.

Candidates must be nominated for three members of the three types of regional committees, and the nominations of 50 constituency voters are added, and they must be confirmed by the District Council Qualification Review Committee of the Chairman of the President of the Administration Affairs Department.

The co -deployment was initiated by Ye Jinlong, a former member of Hong Kong in Japan. He said that the district council constituted a significant modification, marking the official death of the Hong Kong Democratic Parliament system.

Ye Jinlong: "Under the so -called" Patriot Governing Hong Kong "in the Hong Kong Government, if you go to the election, you must express loyalty to the CCP. When they go to these pro -government people to nominate, they represent them to run for the election. Enter the system, make sacrifices, and make actions that violate democratic value. "

The former Hong Kong District Councilor participating in the co -signed includes Xu Zhifeng, who was wanted by the Hong Kong police. Ye Jinlong believes that they are real public opinion representatives and help strengthen the persuasiveness of the joint departure.

Ye Jinlong: "We are the district councilors selected through the last democratic process. Even if we cannot pass the government's review because of the pressure of the government, we still exist in public opinion. All parts of the world, but the hearts of Hong Kong people are still unchanged. "

Guo Zijian, a former member of Hong Kong, exiled in the UK, also agreed that the current parliament of Hong Kong is just as false.

Guo Zijian: "In addition to the high threshold, you have to get nominations and pass qualification review and political review. Especially for our democratic candidates, it is not easy to pass (threshold). (Hong Kong Government) motivation is obviously obvious It is the principle of hanging the "Patriot Governance Hong Kong" to eliminate the sound of the so -called "anti -China Random Port". "

Guo Zijian: "Many democratic countries in the West may not have a timely understanding (Hong Kong District Council election), including the United Nations Human Rights Council and no one has greatly changed the situation of the Legislative Council and the district council election system and officially discussed at the meeting. We want Continue to speak, allowing the issue of Hong Kong's democratic elections to continue fermenting in the international community. "

According to the "Basic Law", the Chief Executive of Hong Kong and the Legislative Council will eventually reach the general election according to the principle of gradual progress. The former Hong Kong District Councilor participated in the coalition believes that the new district council not only restores appointed apprentices, but also introduces indirect elections for the first time, which violates the commitment to promote democratic elections.

However, until the project was completed on May 5, the salary was still not settled, and it was still owed to more than 300,000 yuan.

Migrant workers' salary representative Ye Xiangming went online [Post for help](https://weibo.com/3068651823/N3ri1BAxD)Said, they "Find Shougang Construction Group for working money, Shougang lets the labor service company ask for, the person in charge of the labor service company calls not to answer, send text messages, and go to the Labor Supervisory Brigade of Fengtai District, Huaxiang. There can be results in a month. " I called Zhang Rui, the person in charge of the project department left by the worker's salary post to express the attention of the media, and said with a sneer and said: Ha, then you pay attention!

Shougang Erzhong Industrial Park Creative Building Project, December 2018 was the Beijing Development and Reform Commission [approval of projects](http://fgw.beijing.gov.cn/fzggzl/yfxz/xzxk_sgs/201912/t20191226_1504840.htm), Construction Unit is Shougang Construction Investment Co., Ltd., [General Contracting Unit](http://m.gxfin.com/article/finance/default/default/2023-01-29/5933683.html)It is Shougang Construction Group Co., Ltd..

According to information on the website of Fengtai District Government, Shougang Eryo Industrial Park Cultural and Creative Building Project site construction site in June last year, a death worker injury accident occurred.

As a result, half a year later, the Beijing Housing and Construction Commission went to the construction site safety inspection, [also found a number of serious safety hazards](http://m.gxfin.com/article/finance/default/default/2023-01-29/5933683.html)Essence

In addition, in February this year, the Workers' Daily issued a report with the title "[Beijing Fengtai Trade Union fully improves the sense of happiness of industrial workers](https://www.acftu.org/ghjj/srtjcygrdwjsgg/gzdt_13659/202305/t20230509_828988.html?7OkeOa4k=qAcZkar_8vN_8vN_8G.D01tW6XcHlZCrhWVvpWGtx6lqqqqqqqqqqqqq8G)"The report quoted Wang Zhenhua, the chairman of Fengtai District Federation of Trade Unions, said," To enhance the sense of gain and happiness of industrial workers, the first is to establish the owner of the industrial workers in the system. " The Federation of Trade Unions specially hired a professional law firm. In 2022, 101 legal aid cases were accepted by the union, 100 lectures on law publicity lectures were carried out, and 25 enterprises also carried out free medical examination services for the rule of law to effectively safeguard employees' rights and interests.

In addition, according to Qianlong.com, in order to achieve "where the migrant workers are friends, where they have their warm home", Fengtai District has established 7 "[Home of Migrant Workers] who moved with the construction site of the construction site.(http://society.yunnan.cn/system/2022/08/26/032249445.shtml)"There are 173 such homes in Beijing.

Wang Zhenhua, chairman of the Fengtai District Federation of Trade Unions, said that "Beijing Fengtai Trade Union is fully improved to improve the sense of happiness in industrial workers." There are their warm home ", and the money of taxpayers has established so many homes." So, the union claims that these work and achievements they have done have nothing to do with industrial workers who have owed wages in the construction site of Fengtai District? In other words, these are the slogans that must be shouted, and have nothing to do with the rights and interests of the construction industry workers?

Please listen to the workers' salary representative Ye Xiangming's conversation with me.

Does the union go to the union to know this?

Please listen to these questions and talk to the Changzhen community staff.

During the two -hour meeting of the United States, China, the press release of the two sides disclosed the common and different issues involved in the relevant talks. First, in the definition of bilateral economic and trade relations. Yellen pointed out that President Biden and her seek healthy economic competition between the United States and China. Yellen clearly stated that "the United States does not seek decoupling with China", diverse or "targeted national security actions" of decoupling and key supply chains, there are important differences between the two. She said, "The described between the two largest economies in the world is disastrous for both countries and will also bring unstable to the world. This is actually impossible. We hope to build an openness, freedom and fairness The global economy instead of cracking or forcing countries to choose to stand by. "Earlier, the US President Biden also expressed unintentional decoupled with China at the Seventh National Industrial Group Meeting (G7), but it must be risky to China relations and diversified the supply chain. Yellen also reiterated its unscrop position again.

However, Ren Songlin, a political commentator in the United States, told this station that it is Beijing what really wants to decompose: "In the past, the CCP did not decompose, mainly to steal intellectual rights and get technology from the United States. Now the United States blocks China through various means. Chinese technology can't rely on the United States, so it must be self -reliance. "

** China concerns tariffs and control measures. The United States focuses on national security **

However, in the face of tariffs and economic sanctions, the two sides are more shouting and reiterating their positions without further consensus.

China stated that during the meeting, China once again reiterated the concerns of canceling tariffs on China, stopping suppressing Chinese enterprises, treating two -way investment in the two countries, relaxation of export control of China, and canceling the ban on products related to Xinjiang. The United States takes action to respond to China's significant concern in the economic relations between the two countries.

The United States has expressed serious concerns about China's unfair economic behavior, including non -market policies, foreign enterprises access, intellectual property rights and other related issues, as well as recent Chinese stress actions against American companies.

When it comes to national security and human rights issues, Yellen emphasized, "It will continue to take necessary and targeted actions to protect our national security interests and the security interests of our allies." She said that the United States will restrict such restrictions in this type of restrictions Maintain transparency, narrow range, and targeting clear goals. The important thing is that the motivation of these actions is direct national security considerations, and the United States has not used relevant measures to obtain economic benefits.

The United States also expressed concerns about the Chinese characters in the Russia and Ukraine. But these contents are not mentioned in the statement of the Chinese Ministry of Finance. Yellen proposed the importance of Russia's cruel and illegal war in Ukraine. She said that while the United States continued to pay attention to the situation in Russia, its support for Ukraine remains unchanged. Yellen reiterated that "Chinese companies must avoid providing material support or escape sanctions to Russia."

** Yellen dining, backpacks become hot topics **

During the 4 -day visit of Yellen, the public opinion of Chinese folks was relatively friendly. The first night of Yellen's arrival in China, the official Weibo account of "Sitting and Forget" issued the information of Yellen's meal in the Yunnan restaurant in Sanlitun, Beijing. Yellen's ordering menu also became the topic. There are also Chinese media very skilled in the posture of Yellen chopsticks, saying that "Yellen may be a Chinese food enthusiast." Even when Yellen greeted and shook hands from the off -down plane to greeting and shaking hands, he can cause the topic of Chinese public opinion and ask the topic of "not leaving the body".

He believes that the biggest result of this trip may be that some investment in Wall Street can also enter the Chinese market.

Ren Songlin: "Now China wants to win Wall Street again to make money, but this is not useful? First of all, it is not as easy to earn money in China, and it is not as easy as before. (USA) will give up sanctions against the CCP, and the CCP will not relieve the control of 镓 and 锗. "

How much is the field of cooperation in the United States and China? **

The U.S. Treasury's Treasury pointed out that from the response to the climate crisis to the solution of the sustainability of sovereignty debt, it is not only a bilateral issue between the United States and China, but also about the responsible global leadership. The world expects two largest economies to work together to solve these global problems and help find solutions.

China responded that international challenges such as global macroeconomic and financial stability, climate change, and debt issues have become increasingly severe. Effectively responding to the solution of global challenges cannot be separated from the coordination of the United States and China, which is in line with the common interests of the two countries and is also conducive to improving the well -being of the people of the world.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-10T11-49-38-08-00/09USCHINA-TAKEAWAYS-tzjv-master1050.jpg)In the past few days, with the US Treasury Secretary [Jennite Yellen](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/09/business/janet-yellen-china-us.html)The severe cold atmosphere between China and the United States has eased in a marathon talks in Beijing and a new group of senior economic policy makers.

Yellen is talking about [US economic strategy to China](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230707/us-china-relationship-facts/)Time uses a gentle wording, abandoning a saying that it is popular in Washington but offending Beijing. Although Yellen's trip to China may bring more talks, neither she nor Chinese officials shrink back from her own policy position. This makes the two parties face more conflicts in terms of trade, investment and technology in the future.

** She connected with Chinese economic leaders. **

Last fall, [Chinese Communist Party Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/22/world/china-xi-jinping-congress)For the President of the State [Xi Jinping](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20221017/china-congress-xi-jinping/)Clear the road and appointed a team loyal to him as a high -level economic position. These officials -including Yellen's peer -to -official official, Vice Premier of the State Council [He Lifeng](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230328/xi-jinping-he-lifeng-china-economy/)——In international experience than their predecessors, and Western policy makers are not so familiar with them. China has gradually reduced the release of economic information and stopped many reports, making it more difficult for people to understand the real situation of China's economy.

One of Yellen's primary goal is to meet the new leadership of China. She also wants to know [China Economy](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230629/china-exports-economy/)The current situation, after China has canceled the strict epidemic measures that have been canceled for nearly three years, the rate of rebound in China's economy this year is slower than expected.

Yellen seemed to have achieved some success on these limited goals. She and the four Chinese highest economic policy makers, especially He Lifeng, conducted a total of 10 hours of talks. Although the Biden government has held several rounds of high -level diplomatic talks with China, this is the first time that the government has held such economic talks.

The US Ambassador to China Nicholas Bernes said that re -opening up economic negotiations "is very in line with our interests, and directly conveys tough information on the issues that we have differences. ","

** She used a new word from "D" on the supply chain problem- "Diversity"(diverse)Essence **

Chinese officials are extremely sensitive to diplomatic languages.(decouple)The appeal. They are worried that multinational companies will transfer their extensive supply chains and tens of millions of employment opportunities from China to other countries.

Usla, Chairman of the European Commission, Usula von Delin proposed a gentle and neutral term in March: "[de -risk](https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230522/decoupling-china-de-risking/) ”(de-risking)Essence Chinese officials and official media initially had no objection to the risk of relief, but one month later, the word of the US national security adviser Jack Shalvin used the word in a speech, and Chinese officials and official media began to condemn the statement.

During the visit, Yellen tried to dispel China ’s concerns about the United States for decoupling, and even avoid referring to risk. On the contrary, she said that the United States wants a diverse supply chain -this happens to be China's long -term public policy goal.

"One is decoupling, and the other is to diversify or take targeted national security actions for key supply chains. There are important differences between the two," she said.

The Biden government insisted that the recent restrictions on China's high -tech exports -especially for the most advanced semiconductor -just for the US military security. The government tries to describe its actions as a high fence around a small part of the technology.

But even after Yellen's visit, many Chinese people still have skepticism. Wu Xinbo, Dean of the School of International Relations of Shanghai Fudan University, said that if the policy proposed by the United States, "just for national security, the question is that the scope of national security is."

** She did not propose a new policy. There is no China. **

In another statement of the press conference held by Yelun Sunday and another statement of the Chinese official news agency Xinhua News Agency, it is obviously not mentioned whether there are any problems among the many trade, investment and technical issues between the two countries have been resolved.

In China last Monday to the two key metal 镓 and 锗 used in computer chips [implemented export restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/business/economy/us-china-chips-janet-yellen.html)Essence The supply of these two materials in the world is almost from China. This export control is widely regarded as revenge on the restrictions on the US semiconductor export of China, although Beijing has not qualitated this measure as revenge. Yelun said in the "Facing the National" program on the Corporation of Columbia Sunday that the move was "possibly" retaliated.

Beijing is also preparing to respond to the investment restrictions on some high -tech fields that the Biden government may make, and this possibility has been discussed for a long time. In 2015, China implemented restrictions on overseas investment. Beijing guides Chinese companies and families not to speculate on American real estate and European football clubs, and promotes them to acquire overseas companies in certain fields, including aircraft production, heavy manufacturing, artificial intelligence, network security and other strategic fields.

Nevertheless, Yellen still tried to show an optimistic attitude towards her visits on Sunday. She tried to refute the unavoidable speculation about conflict.

She said: "The outline of Sino -US relations is not an easy task, but we must never forget that although we face challenges, our path is not destined."

But the relevant content is deleted within 48 hours. Some scholars believe that China's economic situation is not good and the car companies are serious.

Bloomberg recently disclosed that Tesla, a US electric vehicle factory, is cutting some battery production workers in the Shanghai plant. But as of now, it is unclear how many Tesla might reduce how many Shanghai factory employees or specific reasons for layoffs. Tesla did not immediately respond to relevant comment requirements. "World Daily" on July 9 quoted people familiar with the matter and stated that the Tesla battery assembly -assembly phase of factory employees will lay off nearly 500 people.

Sina Automobile Weibo IT House previously quoted "Shifang Zhixing" that the layoffs of the Tesla plant mainly involved employees in the first phase of battery assembly, and 50 % of employees will be cut.

** Tesla layoffs or restricted Chinese batteries related to the United States **

On the 10th, Sina Finance quoted the "Bull Car Network" entitled "The United States Restricted Chinese Battery, Tesla Shanghai Factory" reported analysis that the US government does not subsidize batteries imported from China and requires batteries made in the United States. Previously, Tesla Shanghai's assembly batteries can also be supplied abroad. Now the export channels are blocked by the United States, the orders are cut, and the battery factories will naturally lay off their layoffs.

According to a report from the Taiwan News Agency, Tesla's super factory in Shanghai is the largest and highest production capacity factories, with about 20,000 employees, including employees who produce Model Y and Model3. There are less than 1,000 employees in the two battery assembly lines of Tesla Shanghai.

** Scholars: Tesla affects the price of Chinese electric vehicles down **

Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tomas University, accepted an interview with this station that Tesla hoped to stabilize sales in the Chinese market and reduce employees. The company does not abandon the Chinese market, but hopes to introduce more automation operations.

Ye Yaoyuan said: "From the perspective of Elonmusk (Tesla CEO), I don't think he slowly reduce employees because he wants to abandon the Chinese market. Removing employees. (Production in China) is also high. Many parts factories have been transferred to Southeast Asia and India, which are related to US policies. "

According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, the China Automobile Forum Conference appeared on the 6th. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, the China Automobile Industry Association was responsible for organizing the organization, requiring international automakers Tesla and Chinese local brand BYD, Weilai, ideal, Xiaopeng, etc. The 16 car companies jointly signed the "Promise Book of the Automobile Industry to Maintain the Fair Market in the Automobile Industry", which promised not to disrupt the fair competition order of the market at non -normal prices, and actively stable and promoted car consumption. However, the 48 -hour policy turns sharply, and the promise book deletes the text content such as "not disrupting the fair competition in the market at non -normal prices". The China Automobile Association said that the reason for deleting is "improper expression", which violates the spirit of the "Anti -Monopoly Law" in China.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T12-02-00-04-00/000002.png)Statement issued by the China Automobile Industry Association (China News Network) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T12-02-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hx1-07102023081719.html/tjpitegi2o08tg-noop.jpg)** China Automobile Association delete the commitment to violate the monopoly law or faction internal fighting? **

Wu Jianzhong, an associate professor of the General Professor of the Taipei University of Science and Technology, believes: "Car companies in mainland China saw Tesla's price adjustment on July 1 to adjust the price of all versions, about 35,000 and 45,000 yuan, making Tesla more competitive Power. The car market is very downturn, and the fierce it is. In order to survive the development strategy, various manufacturers cannot tighten the commitment and sign a commitment. Important. This year, some fuel vehicles still have gimmicks to buy fuel vehicles and send electric vehicles. Various different publicitys are to keep the car market continued. At present, fuel vehicles in mainland China are very hard, let alone saying that electric vehicles are more difficult to be a harder state. ","

Wu Jianzhong mentioned that after Tesla's price adjustment, many new energy vehicle companies in China followed up the price adjustment and spread to the field of fuel vehicles. The price reduction was less than 10,000 yuan and as many as 100,000 yuan. On July 7, Tesla's official Weibo upgraded sales and purchasing rewards, rewarding 3,500 yuan, and even the free trial for the EAP enhanced version for 90 days.

Ye Yaoyuan interpreted that this move should be the internal fighting of the Chinese automobile industry. Some people in the Communist Party may criticize the promise book that will make 16 owners other than 16: "These 16 have formed an alliance to some extent, and cutting prices through common pricing methods. Others do not belong to these 16 automotive industries to compete, which is unfair to other manufacturers. Now this situation has nothing to do with foreign companies. It is a bit like a small movement and small circles in the Chinese car manufacturers. "Reporter: Xia Xiaohua Responsible: Xu Shuting He Ping.com Editor: Ruizhe

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Germany currently has [2 million positions vacant shortage and no one asks](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/劳动力严重短缺-德国酝酿最先进移民法/a-65185214)Essence Nursing staff, IT experts, craftsmen, and logistics industry-all these types are facing talent shortages. According to data from the German Federal Employment Bureau, 400,000 technical workers need to be attracted to maintain the stability of the labor market every year. But in 2021, only 40,000 people were willing to apply for work in Germany. The German "baby tide" generation, that is, the high birth rate of the high birth rate in the 1960s is about to retire, and the problem of the shortage of German workers will increase.

In order to reverse this situation, the German government recently [finally adopted a new draft of the reform of immigration law](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国议会通过劳工移民改革法案/a-66021523)It aims to encourage more people outside the European Union to work in Germany. Nancy's Minister of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) NancyFaeser said at the end of June to introduce the federal parliament to the "most advanced immigration law in the world", "This draft law will ensure the prosperity of Germany." Essence

![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-10T12-15-00Z/66011601_401.png)The Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser introduced the Federal Parliament at the end of June that this department will become "the world's most advanced immigration law"

### Regulations on family reunion

In the new bill, the most watched key content includes the rules of family reunion. So far, Germany cannot be regarded as a immigrant country, not only because of the lack of a clear rules. Unlike the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and other hot Chinese immigration countries: even if immigrants can get permanent residence in Germany or apply for citizenship, they still cannot apply for family reunion for their parents.

However, for foreign immigrants who want to attract new technical immigrants in Germany and have long -term residence rights that have obtained long -term residence rights after employment or investment and operation after studying in Germany, how the German new immigration law stipulates that family reunion is important. It will add points to Germany for new immigrants when considering destination countries, or at least let Germany and other technology immigrants stand on the same starting line. For old immigrants who have lived in Germany, the new rules of family reunion will undoubtedly significantly shorten the distance between them and their families, improve the quality of life in Germany, and even retain those who cannot consider leaving Germany because they cannot reunite with their parents. professional.

Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine where the New Immigration Law was passed by the Federal Parliament at the end of June, where the excitement of Chinese immigrants from Germany came from. Many Chinese self -media reports said that the New Immigration Law stipulates that parents can receive their parents' long -term life. "Heavy", "good", and "Xipa Pan" are commonly used words for many German Chinese self -media to pay attention to this matter. However, take a closer look at the specific content of the draft New Law, and you will find that for old immigrants who have lived in Germany for many years, they may be disappointed.

### official announcement of the Ministry of the Interior

After many inquiries from the Voice of Germany, Mehmet ATA, spokesman for the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, confirmed that [family reunion stipulated in the new law](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/073/2007394.pdf)After it is implemented on March 1, 2024, it is first immigrants who have obtained a German residence permit as a professional as a professional. Also with additional conditions, new immigrants must be able to continue to ensure the living expenses of accompanying family members.

In this regard, the draft of the New Immigration Law made clear supplementary regulations in Article 36. It is said that if a foreigner obtained the relevant residence permits including Blue Card on March 1, 2024, his parents can get a residence permit for family gatherings; if the spouse also lives in Germany, the above Regulations are also applicable to their parents. However, the prerequisite is that according to Article 5), paragraph 1, paragraph 1 of the existing residence law: The living expenses of family members must be guaranteed.

At the same time, the draft reform of the new immigration law did simplify some procedures for family reunion in terms of specific regulations. For example, when applying for family reunion before, it is necessary to prove that the applicant has enough living space for family members to use. Applicable. At the same time, foreign citizens holding the EU Schengen visa into Germany do not need to return to the original country to re -apply for a work visa after finding a job. Instead, they can directly change their entry visa in Germany. This is supported by the German government, especially the Green Party. The party claimed that applicants had previously required applicants to leave Germany "ridiculous".

### The problem of unresolved decision

Nevertheless, there are still some key issues related to family reunion. For example, after parents enter Germany with professional immigrants, social welfare insurance such as medical and health insurance is properly arranged. The current situation in Germany is that public medical insurance is overwhelmed, it needs to increase premiums for years, and discuss the expansion of the insured's self -funded payment amount. However, according to the current legal system in Germany, every citizen who owns a address in Germany has obliged to buy medical insurance. Public medical insurance is obliged to incorporate it without insurance without insurance.

In addition, the draft of the German New Immigration Law Reform has also caused fierce discussions in the Chinese community in Germany. Some Chinese are very dissatisfied with the regulations that allow new technology immigrants to handle family reunion in the bill. He said that he contributed to German society through work, business and other activities in Germany. After a few years of performance of taxpayers, the basic life demands of reunion with parents still could not be guaranteed. And new immigrants can have the right to immigrate to Germany before making any substantial contributions to German society. The new law will obviously divide the Chinese and foreigners living in Germany into multiple levels. At the same time, some Chinese said that Germany should currently solve the social and economic problems of a large number of immigrants. There are also some Chinese parents who are unwilling to live in Germany for a long time because of their language, culture, diet, and social environment. After entering Germany to visit relatives for a long time, they "began to count the days to return to China."

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The Hong Kong New Cardinal Bishop (also known as "Bishop of Red) Zhou Shouren said on July 10 that he hopes that the city can give young people more hope." For Hong Kong, (I am (I am, (I am me Hope) This city can have more reconciliation. "Zhou Shouren told reporters," This is the goal I hope (we) can achieve. The Associated Press reported that Hong Kong had previously experienced economic downturn and the authorities suppressed the democratic movement.

On Sunday, Francis, the Pope of Roman Catholic Church, announced that he chose 21 new cardinal bishops, including 64 -year -old Hong Kong bishop Zhou Shouren.

Zhou Shouren said that when he learned that he was selected, he was incredible at first, and felt that this was a new mission given by God through the Pope. The formal appointment of his promotion of bishop will be held in September.

Beijing and the Vatican broke their diplomatic relations after they took power in 1951 and expelled foreign pastors. For decades, the relationship between the Vatican and China is sometimes nervous and sometimes eased. The reason includes the CCP adheres to its right to appoint the bishop and loyal to the priests who loyal to the Vatican.

Zhou Shouren will become the fourth cardinal bishop in Hong Kong and guide believers in this geopolitical area that Vatican is very concerned about. The previous three cardinals were Hu Zhenzhong, Chen Rijun and Tang Han.

### Chen Rijun: I hope the Pope will re -consider the policy to China

In Hong Kong, Zhou Shouren is widely regarded as gentle or political neutral people. In April this year, Zhou Shouren visited Beijing.

Before the trip to Beijing, Zhou Shouren had suggested that the protesters who had committed relatively lighter crimes in the 2019 Hong Kong protest movement but had not yet been prosecuted should be widely treated. [He wrote in the article that this helps to bring hope and positive energy to those who feel injured](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港新主教上任-称愿协助社会修补撕裂/a-60020511)Let them wait endlessly for the recovery of Hong Kong society.

On Monday, when asked if he still hoped to deal with the arrested person, Zhou Shouren expressed his hope that "there can be more reconciliation and give young people more hope." He said, "Especially those who have made mistakes, so that they will have the future. This is very important."

The protests in 2019 were triggered by an unpopular extradition bill, causing hundreds of thousands of people to take hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Hong Kong. So far, the police have arrested more than 10,000 people related to protests, and many of them have not knew whether they would be prosecuted.

[![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T13-18-00-04-00/000001.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx2-07102023080402.html/@@images/image)Reuters picture [AUDIO-LLTTPS: //www.rfa.org/Mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx2-07102023080402.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx2-07102023080402.html/@@stream)After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Honduras and China in Central American countries, recently, it will invest $ 200 billion in China under construction railway projects. Some scholars believe that China's economic situation is not good at the moment, and Honduras has weak repayment, and it is difficult for China to meet the requirements of the lion opening.

*** [Xi Jinping's meeting with President Honduras is willing to negotiate on the Free Trade Agreement as soon as possible](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-06122023131650.html)** *** [Chuan Hongdulas claims to refuse the "extortion diplomatic" from China and Taiwan for the US dollar.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hx-03232023085140.html)** *** [Solomon Islands Prime Minister will visit next week](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-07072023105726.html)**

Reuters reported on July 8 that Fredycerrato, Minister of Economic Development, said that Honduras was seeking investors to fund the establishment of a railway route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Coast in the Hong Kingdom. It is estimated that funds will need $ 20 billion Essence Sarato mentioned that the two countries in China held a new round of free trade agreement on the 7th. Hong direction Chinese officials proposed to build this railway, dam, power generation facilities, and other infrastructure projects that are interested in obtaining financing.

Nobel, a associate researcher at the National Institute of Defense Security, was interviewed and judged by this station: "The situation of this lion's opening is completely impossible, and it exceeds China's ability. China's economic performance is not good now. So much money to Honduras? If Honduras can, why can't the surrounding countries be? "

Shi Jianyu analyzed that even if Beijing wants to invest, it may be more than ten years in stages. The point is that Honduras has owed a lot of foreign debt, and the repayment ability is very poor. Based on the standards of World Bank and international financial institutions, it is basically not qualified to borrow money out. If Beijing borrows money to Hong Guo, it is equivalent to throwing money into the sea, and even the interest cannot be collected, which is a major crisis against Chinese finance.

Shi Jianyu mentioned that for ten years of the "Belt and Road" development, many foreign debts have been collected in China. After Xi Jinping's third term, when the relevant departments were required to re -develop the development of the "Belt and Road" initiative, how China's investment would increase efficiency. Even if you don't make money, it is impossible to collect it completely.

** 20 billion US dollars to build a railway in Beijing? **

Honduras broke her diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on March 26 and turned to the People's Republic of China. Beijing originally promised to buy white shrimp from Hong Guo, but it was not fulfilled. Until June, President Hong Guo, Xiomaracastro, sold it at the interview. After meeting Xi Jinping, the white shrimp was allowed to be sold to China.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T13-18-00-04-00/000002.png)On June 12, 2023, President of Honduras visited China. (Reuters) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T13-18-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx2-07102023080402.html/1.jpg)Lin Tinghui, deputy secretary -general of the International Law Society of Taiwan, accepted an interview with this station that the above transactions were released by international media's attention to Beijing, so as not to jump tickets when they were approved.

Shi Jianyu believes that Beijing considers Hong Guo's strategic basic investment. Earlier this year, before the diplomatic relations between Honduras and Taiwan, it was reported that more than 2 billion U.S. dollars were opened with Taiwan. They even discussed that the foreign debt of Hong Guo was transferred to Taiwan. Taiwan did not agree, and the country was transferred to China. Therefore, China may at least agree that temporarily borrowed 20 or $ 3. billion to Hong Guo.

Shi Jianyu said: "Although he invested tens of billions of dollars for many years, he has a great dilemma in the Hong Congress, which is equivalent to buying this country in China. Honduras may be completely controlled by China to a certain extent. Do China want to control Honduras in complete control? Or will it be troublesome, because Honduras has a US military base in it. "

Lin Tinghui analyzed that Beijing's aid railway in Kenya has become a African demonstration railway. It is expected that the Hong Guogai Railway will also be funded and allows the Hong State government to participate in the shares. Both were given to Honduras, and Hong Guo's finance was liabilities.

Lin Tinghui believes that if China assisted the construction of the Hongguo Railway, it would definitely copy the aid model in other countries in the past: "It is to use Chinese companies and Chinese workers, and the operating rights may be controlled by the Chinese government. China can convert it into creditor's rights. There is no lunch for nothing in the world. The purpose of China to get it is to build diplomatic relations with one country and hollow out Taiwan's diplomatic relations. Why not? "

** Solomon turned to the Embassy for nearly four years with Beijing's establishment diplomatic relations.

After Beijing dug out another AIA Solomon Islands in Taiwan, his prime minister Sagawray visited China a few days ago. The main task of this trip is to unveil the Solomon Embassy in China.Lin Tinghui questioned that Solomon turned to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing in 2019. It was only 4 years later to set up embassies in China. There must be many questions between the two parties. The problem of security agreement was so angry that the Pacific Island country was angry and opposed to signing a security agreement with Beijing. The United States also opened a new embassy in Solomon to have no local activities on the interaction between the nearby monitoring and the PLA? It may also be considered that if you can't get what China promised at the beginning, or what he expects, maybe he will return to the Western camp. The diplomatic issues of the Pacific Island country are not so simple. "

Shi Jianyu judged that Sogovre was going to Guangdong, and it should be a fishery cooperation. Chinese ocean fisheries have criticized fishermen's problems of fishermen, as well as occupying more than half of the ocean fisheries worldwide. There is a base for Chinese ocean fishing vessels in the country. Talking about cooperation must help the economy of both parties.

Essence

I have seen this kind of picture many times. However, this is just a picture that Xi Jinping has come to power in the past few years. Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao did not have such a picture in the era. Xi Jinping did not have such a picture at the beginning of the stage. But this is by no means Xi Jinping's first. Xi Jinping learned from North Korea Kim Jong Un. We often see such a picture from the news of North Korea, or in the room, or outdoors, Kim Jong -un, sitting, or standing, as long as you speak, follow the left and right cultural and military officials. Remember.

Seeing such a picture is very ridiculous. When is it, do you still have to remember? Today, when electronic recording is so convenient, why do you still ask everyone to return to the manual era to use notes? With notes at the scene, it is easy to make mistakes and easily miss. Why not record it? There are big leaders present, do you have no secretary? Recording on the spot, can't the secretary sort out the text? In particular, the Party Central Committee, the Party Central Committee is not short of money. Why not? In the Mao era, in the Deng Jianghu era, the authorities did this. Why did the people use notes in the Xi Jinping era? There must be a reason here.

Xi Jinping gave a speech, and the left and right officials bowed their heads to take notes. This picture is eye -catching. What Xi Jinping wants is this picture. This picture shows that Xi Jinping is speaking and Yingwu, Jinkou Yuyan, and the sentence is truth. The Minister of Culture and Military is uncomfortable, unlimited faith, and infinite worship. Since such a big official of the Standing Committee of the Politburo is respectful of Xi Jinping and admire the five -body investment, others dare not accept it? The US President Biden said that Xi Jinping was a "dictator", and the CCP immediately refuted fiercely. In fact, let's take a look at the picture of Xi Jinping's speech, the Standing Committee of the Politburo, and the members of the Politburo, which is the best illustration of the three words of the "dictator".

In addition to the worship and obedience to the leader, there are other political meanings of this picture.

1. I can't tell you, so you can't tell others. 2. The leader issued instructions that the leadership intention must be fulfilled and followed by the leader's instructions. 3. The incident is done, and naturally attributes to the leader. It is the leader of the leader. 4. If the matter is not done well, the leader instructed to do things to do things. You can't blame the leaders, because the leaders' instructions have not left white paper and black words, and your notes are just written by you. After smashing, you can only blame himself, and the leader is irresponsible. All credit belongs to the leader, and everything is attributed to others. Leaders only take care of them.

Yes, we know that the leader delivered a speech, and the central government often has to print documents or minutes about speeches afterwards. It makes it easier for leaders to take off their responsibilities. At the scene, the leader's speech was likely to be relatively straightforward. Not straightforward, the people below do not understand, and they are unsatisfactory; but it is too straightforward to push off the responsibility afterwards. Therefore To understand the intention of the leadership, on the other hand, the leadership's speech is organized into text, and the documents or minutes are issued, because the issued documents or disciplines have been carefully polished, which makes it easier for leaders Note is just what you remember, you can't be regarded as based on. Because there are no text records and recording videos, outsiders and future generations cannot see the greasy behind this.

Through this picture, we can understand the operating characteristics of autocratic dictatorship.

The Wagner Legion has been active on the front line of the war, such as playing an extremely important role in Bachmum's surrounding war. However, in recent months, Pleigo and the senior officials of the Russian army broke out fierce quarrels. They believed that the Ministry of National Defense did not provide enough ammunition supplies during the Bach Murut Campaign. Husbands should be responsible for the large number of casualties of the Wagner Mercenary Soldiers. Since June, the Russian Ministry of Defense demanded that the mercenaries have signed an agreement to obey the command before the end of the month. This seems to be tantamount to disarm, and the contradictions have been further intensified.

### How many people will follow him?

In theory, he can take his mercenaries to Belarus. Not sure how many people will follow him. However, the business of the Wagner Legion is all over the world. Libya, Syria, Africa, and Venezuela in Latin America are the place where the mercenaries are made. Soldiers who were on the battlefield allegedly could get 5,000 US dollars per month. Porigabin claims that there are still 25,000 troops, and the US intelligence unit estimates that this number should double.

Putin compared the incident at the time of the 1917 Russian revolution that swept Russia's turmoil. Later, he thanked his army and security departments to stop chaos and civil war.

Porigo has stated that the purpose of the mutiny is not to overthrow the government, but to "ride to the law" for the leadership of the army, accusing them of making mistakes in Ukraine and doing unprofessional actions.

Judging from the appearance of the two on the National Television, Putin has so far retained the position of the Minister of Defense Shohgu and Chief of Staff Glasimov and rejected Pritjin to dismiss their requests.

According to the agreement reached by Belarusian leader Lukashenko, Porigo should have gone to Belarus. [But Lukashenko said last week that Porigo has returned to Russia](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/白俄總統瓦格納首腦身處俄羅斯/a-66147076)General Wagner did not move to Belarus, which caused people to doubt the implementation of the agreement.

It has been two weeks by the abortion of soldiers, and the agreement to terminate the mutiny is still secretly. The fate of the Wagner Group is still unreasonable.

A few days ago, there was a Chinese who claimed to be "anti -thief", "scholars", "second -rate photographers", and "currently living in the United States".

"In my photography career, I have suffered a lot of serious attacks and have a close relationship with religion ... ... Another religion full of hostile photography is Tibetan Buddhism. I have never taken it. But many lamas are difficult to understand the hostility of the camera. Because after all, the temple also sells tickets for tourists, and the incense money also has the share of tourists. Lama will face each other's bad words and even launch an attack. "

I don't want to turn his sense of superiority to overflowing the screen of the screen. Could you buy a ticket to visit the temple and you can take something to shoot without recklessness. If you want to shoot a monk, you can shoot monks? He even thoughtfully thought that his (forced) shooting gave the monks a rare luck. After being rejected by the monks, they jumped like a thunderous: "A group of practitioners studying the Dharma, Buddhists, not to mention that for their own owners, they should not do such things for irrelevant ordinary people. Ordinary people are all people. Ordinary people are all people. Ordinary people are all people. What do you learn from the hatred of hatred? What did you learn? "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T13-50-00-04-00/000007.png)Screenshot of Twitter [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T13-50-00-04-00/000008.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-07102023134430.html/76708rfa535a5ba21-002.jpg)Lao Lin Yongsheng on Twitter is both a Buddhist, but also a writer who has published Tibetan Buddhism and about Tibetan culture. His reply under that Chinese tweet is very good. He said:

"I took 27 years in Tibet. Very simple: 1. Ask first, then shoot; 2. The other party is not willing to be photographed, not shot; 3. The other party is willing to be photographed. , The earth does not turn around your camera. Even if you see a beauty who is also a Han in the Shanghai Beijing Metro, you want to shoot, is it this rule, right? You can't help but complain about the beauty. Isn't polite? "

That's right. Lao Lin said that it makes sense. Those who are accustomed to implementing photography violence are actually uncivilized, reminding me of an article "Photography Violence in Tibet" more than ten years ago (published in the book "Invisible Tibet", It was published by Taiwan's large -scale culture in 2008). It seems that it is necessary to repeat it. The article is as follows:

Photography violence in Tibet

** 1. Memory of one photography behavior **

Before the train was driving to Lhasa, the train had not been sent to the Potala Palace before the train had intended to take a "tour here". The professional and unprofessional "Tibet photos" had been as good as hairy. Professional and unprofessional photographers embrace a variety of photography equipment, full of enthusiasm on all kinds of enthusiasm on another beautiful snowy area, capturing the moment of the moment when the face is eager to occupy the exotic exotic Mirror. A few years ago, in the Jokhang Temple, the most prosperous incense in Lhasa, I had a deep memory of a quarrel about a foreign photography behavior.

One is two mainland men in the photography, and the other is the two Chinese dwellings and two Tibetan women who were talking to monks wrapped in red crickets. The former wanted to hunt, and the latter did not let the shoot, so they quarreled. What is interesting is that the two people were even more angry than those who were disturbed by them, and the very flourishing flames burned their faces. Why not shoot? What rights do you have to do not allow us to take pictures? A tone, waving a camera is like waving a weapon. Their reason is that the temple is a public place, so it is our right if you want to take whatever you want; and the reason for the other party is that the temple is a pilgrimage place. We are neither public, nor exhibits.

The claims of rights are not so simple, and the meaning of the words clearly conveys the self -feelings of the power of the power. And this feeling may come from their photography identity, maybe from their own character, and maybe more from their inner empire complex. I looked through this at a glance.

** 2. Speaking nicely is possessive, ugly is plunder **

I heard the story of a photographer. When he walked through Tibet, he was a painter. Tibet more than ten years ago was far more original than Tibet's original Tibetan, which was enough to crazy many artists. Not only the spirit of hard work and hard work, especially, it is even more admirable to put the silver that shrinks the clothing and shrink food. But he also has a hobby. He has to take anything everywhere, such as large and small stones, such as antelope horn wild yak skull, and even a small Buddha statue in a remote temple. He claims that these are his materials.As for photography, it is also the same- "Tibetan cells wearing dirty leather robes, people who are transformed or argued, living Buddhas and Lama, believers on the way of pilgrimage, Mani pile on the shore of the holy lake, heaven and burial platform and Vultures, snow mountains and glaciers, Tibetan dramas and clouds ... ", it seems that it is not enough to prove that it is Tibet. And when shooting these, how did the majority of photographers shoot? In other words, what kind of relationship is between the photographer and the subject? (Serial)

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T14-06-00-04-00/000000.png)In 2022, in the case of a significant slowdown in China's real estate industry, dozens of Chinese real estate companies have violated US dollar bonds, including Evergrande Group, one of China's largest real estate companies. The picture shows the Shanghai headquarters of Evergrande Group. [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T14-06-00-04-00/000001.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/6-07102023135948.html/@@images/image)Reuters information picture

At present, the Chinese economy is depressed, leading to debt problems. According to the New York Times, due to the few official data, it is difficult to know the exact number of Chinese debt. However, according to the calculation of Morgan Chase researchers, the overall debt in China has reached 282%of its annual economic output (GDP), which is significantly higher than the average proportion of global developed economies of 256%and 257%of the United States.

It is reported that China's debt is so fast compared to its economic scale, making it more difficult for management debt. Since the global financial crisis 15 years ago, China's debt has doubled compared with its economic scale. The cause of the increase in China's debt is mainly due to the large -scale debt of the real estate industry and local governments that have fallen prices after excessive construction.

It is reported that according to Fitch rating estimates, the debt under the name of the local government of China has reached about 30%of the national GDP, while the debt under the name of the subsidiary financing unit has reached 40%to 50%. However, because some local governments will transfer debt to financing units after borrowing money, repeated calculations may occur.

The report also said that China has provided nearly 1 trillion US dollars of loans to about 150 developing countries, but has been reluctant to be exempted from huge debts owed to countries that are difficult to balance. This is to a certain extent because China also faces "debt bombs", that is, local governments, its subordinates off -balance sheet financing institutions, and real estate developers owe trillions of dollars.

The report pointed out that the scale of loans provided by China to developing countries is smaller than its domestic debt, accounting for less than 6%of the annual economic output. But these loans are particularly sensitive in politics. The huge loss of these loans will be very unpopular in China. Its debt problem also makes it difficult for Chinese banks to accept the loss of loans to low -income countries.

The report also pointed out that with the decline of the economy, more and more local governments and its financing units in China are unable to continue paying debt interest, and the chain reaction generates is unable to pay public services, medical insurance and pensions.

As for the solution, it is reported that it is difficult for China's domestic debt to solve quickly, and it can only get rid of government construction projects and huge national security expenditures with debt -driven government, and turn to economy based on consumer expenditures and services.

![](Images/rficn/2023-07-10T14-32-09-00-00/000000.png)After 41 -year -old Bogle, after allowing him to seek a re -election in the Supreme Court, he announced that he would be re -elected last September, triggering a fierce debate on whether the move was constitutional.

The New Ideas of the right (New Ideas) holds intra -party elections, and Bogle is the only candidate.

Karen Gonzalez, chairman of the Party Election Commission of the New Concept, told the media that the New Concept Party officially announced that Bug Lei won the qualifications of the presidential candidate. However, he did not disclose how many votes from Buger.

According to Salvador's laws, political parties must hold the party's election to select the 2024 presidential candidate.

Despite the strong criticism of human rights organizations, Big Lei cracked down on street violent gangs to receive more than 90%of the domestic people's support, holding the advantages of high civil tone.

The Salvador Constitution stipulates the restrictions of the president.

In 2021, Bogle and the Supreme Court conflicted with the chief prosecutor's chief, thus replacing five Supreme Council judges and chief prosecutors, as well as one -third of the nation's judges.

"Joining Member Action Plan" requires Kiev to meet various standards before getting invitations to join NATO.

According to the "Photo", until last weekend, France, the United Kingdom, and Poland claimed that once the ceasefire was achieved with Russia, it issued an invitation to the Alliance to Ukraine, but Germany and the United States opposed the claim. Berlin and Washington supported the "Join Member Action Plan" formulated for Ukraine that year. The United States suddenly announced that it was conditioned to abandon the "joining the member action plan". A diplomat said that it provided Ukraine with a Finnish model, that is, once the war ended, Ukraine quickly joined NATO within a few months. At present, the Berlin government is unwilling to leave the impression of providing "Entering the League" to Ukraine, and is still looking for a discount plan.

Coleba hopes to receive a formal invitation to the Alliance at the Vilnis Summit. But whether NATO takes this step is particularly worthy of attention. NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said [there are differences in NATO within this](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/乌克兰何时加盟北约各国仍存在分歧/a-65794083)Essence The German federal government believes that the invitation to the Ukrainian alliance invites to start the specific enrollment procedure, ["The current opportunity is not yet mature"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約秘書長挺烏入會-德國防長還不是時候/a-65393175)Essence Germany, as the second largest country to support Ukraine, is willing to continue to provide military aid and economic assistance to Kiev under the current situation.

According to various parties, on the eve of the NATO summit, representatives of NATO countries held several days of negotiations on the closing statement of the summit. The focus around was to open the door of NATO to Ukraine?

### ** Erdogan: Let's do a transaction **

The NATO Vilnius Summit will also further promote the Sweden to enter the Alliance. Turkish President Erdogan said that he could agree to join NATO in Sweden, but at the same time, the European Union must restart the Turkish league procedure and enjoy the qualifications of nearly EU member states.

Erdogan said in Istanbul on Monday (July 10) that his proposal will be officially put forward at the NATO summit held on Tuesday and Wednesday. He said that it is expected that the European Union will clear the obstacles on the road to the league, and only in this way, Turkey will flatten Sweden to join the road of NATO. The country, including Germany, has a positive attitude towards Turkey.

On the surface, Turkey is still joining the EU candidate, but in fact, the Turkish alliance has been in a freezing state for many years, and Erdogan seems to have no great interest in closer to Europe.

Joining the NATO organization requires all member states. Therefore, Turkey has a vital veto power. Because of the opposition of Ankara, Sweden's desire to join the Alliance with Finland failed to achieve it. [Finland took a step first](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/芬兰的加入让北约如虎添翼/a-65224960), April 4 this year officially joined the NATO organization and became its 31st member states. Turkey believes that Sweden has collected a large number of extremist organizations, including exile overseas including the Kurdish Workers' Party, and requires Sweden to give more cooperation in cracking down on terrorists. The Swedish Supreme Court made a ruling in June this year, and it was not unconstitutional to extradite a Kurdish to Ankara.

NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg has already said on many occasions that he is looking forward to welcoming Sweden to become the 32nd member states at the Vilnius Summit. To this end, he insists on mediation to the last moment. The new Prime Minister Ulfkristerson arranged a direct meeting.

Last summer, Ankara agreed to join NATO in principle at the Madrid summit, but the Turkish Parliament did not pass the resolution. At present, the Hungarian Parliament has not yet held voting to Sweden to join NATO.

The Dutch ruling alliance last week [Different from the opinions of immigration policy](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230708-1411841)Later, the opponent will make a motion of disbelief to Prime Minister Lutter in Congress.

Comprehensive Reuters and Bloomberg reported that the Dutch Parliament will meet at 10:15 am local time (July 10) at 10:15 am (Singapore Monday 4:15 pm). The Dutch Green Left Party Chairman Jesseklaver issued a tweet on Sunday (9th) saying that the opposition will initiate unwilling voting to Luther.

Clarver said that Luther deliberately caused the cabinet to collapse. His behavior was not for long -term benefits, but for his political interests, the opposition made the above decision. He showed that the goal of the opposition was to appoint a technical bureaucrat to be the Prime Minister of the guard until the Snapelection could be held.

Opposition Labor Party leader Attjekuiken accused Lut in the TV show to cause Late to cause the government crisis. "We need an outsider to intervene, avoid stagnation (country), and repair (the government's) trust."

Laut said on Friday (7th) that he [plan to continue to be the Prime Minister of the Detention to the November Election](https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230708-1412050)Essence Under normal circumstances, voting will not threaten Luther because he can rely on the support of the majority of the four -party governments he led by his leadership.

However, according to people familiar with the matter, some members of the ruling alliance blame the cabinet crisis on the entry of children of the cabinet to restrict the entry of the children of war refugees in the domestic war and stipulate that the family must wait for at least two years before they can be reunited. They are considering voting to support the dismissal of Lutter, who has been in office for 13 years,

If all opposition members vote for votes, they only need to support the votes of several members of the governing alliance, and they can step down from Lutra.

In addition, although the opposition advocates technical bureaucrats as the Prime Minister of Detention, constitutional scholars question the possibility of this expectation. If Lutter really steps down, Treasury Minister Sigridkaag may become the first deputy prime minister, and she will also be the first female to lead the Dutch government.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) In the case of confrontation with stubborn high inflation in Western countries, [China is now facing concerns about shrinking](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论中国经济处于通缩之谜/a-65389215)Essence In June, due to weak demand, Chinese manufacturers have reduced prices and have declined to the largest in the past seven and a half years. Producers' prices fell 5.4%compared with the same period last year, the ninth consecutive month, and the largest decline since December 2015. Among them, companies in the energy, metal and chemical industries have been forced to cut prices because domestic and foreign demand is weakening.

At the same time, China's consumer goods prices have also stopped rising for the first time in the past two and a half years. In June this year, consumer prices remained stable as the same period last year. In May, consumer prices still increased slightly. Economists have expected that this growth will continue, but this is not the case. One possible reason for slowing consumer price growth is the slow growth of demand. This change allows analysts to predict that government and central banks may introduce new economic stimulus policies to boost demand.

### The risk and challenge of Chinese shrinkage

The approach to reduce prices in China's manufacturing industry reflects the weakness of domestic and foreign demand. As the Chinese economy resumed stagnation after the epidemic, and the western central bank's interest rate hikes suppressed consumer spending, the Chinese economy faced a double blow. If prices generally decline, it may further weaken China's fragile confidence, causing the economy into a vicious circle of demand and falling price.

### "Red Gambling Disc" author Shen Dong: In Oxford Passover Fear

Although China has relaxed the control policy to stimulate the demand for house purchase, the momentum of recovery in the real estate market is still weakened. [Shen Dong, a businessman who used to engage in real estate development business in China, said to Germany's voice:](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/獨家沈棟將赴美作證中國民企一片荒涼/a-66113718)China's per capita residential ownership is the highest in the world, and about 80%of the people live in the house. Nowadays, these people have seen their wealth shrinking. In this case, "the consumer market cannot be mentioned." At the same time, he judged that the real estate industry in China "has come to an end without a rebound."

According to the data of the Financial Company Barclay, China's current economic environment is facing a "scalability environment." Tong contraction refers to the phenomenon of general decline in prices, which may trigger an economic environment of downlink spirals. Shining may cause consumer expenditure to decline, which may further drag economic growth. At the same time, if an enterprise lays out to lay off the demand for atrophy, it may cause social problems. Therefore, how to maintain social stability while avoiding excessive economic cooling will be a major challenge facing the Chinese government.

In the financial market, this concern is spreading. The exchange rate of the RMB is declining. [China A shares have experienced the uncommon "four -company yin" in the past few months. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论胡锡进炒股告诉了我们什么/a-66149922)Capitaleconomics economists predict that "considering weak credit demand and currency pressure, we believe that most support will come from the government's fiscal policy."

### How to make the next round of economic stimuli?

At the same time, China's exports to the United States such as the United States have also weakened. China does not have inflation after ending the epidemic sealing and restarting the economy like most countries, but instead shows a deflation trend, which reveals some structural problems of the Chinese economy after three years of epidemic prevention and control. Including economists [Shen Ling's unbalanced consumption and investment, and the imbalance in economic growth in state -owned and private](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论国进民退的局面能持续多久/a-65792793)Essence

The Chinese government's goal this year is to achieve an average inflation rate of 3%. However, last year, the inflation rate was only 2%due to the impact of the new crown epidemic. The economic recovery has stagnated at multiple levels. The unemployment rate has soared to more than 20%in May. The manufacturing activities have shrunk for the third consecutive month in June, and they also show weak exports to Western economies.

In addition, the automotive market as an important area for the end of China's strict epidemic control measures, boosting the economy, and showing a weak trend. According to the China Passenger Car Association(Cpca)Data released on Monday, in June this year, China's passenger cars sales fell by 2.9%year -on -year. At the same time, major independent brands and foreign brands in China are still in a state of price hot war.

In this regard, some economists have called for more measures to boost demand and reverse weak market emotions. However, so far, Chinese decision makers have not launched large -scale stimulus plans. Some reasons may be that the debt burden is worsened and the government -led investment returns decrease.

The "Clear Action" of the Internet Information Office rectifies the self -media **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-03132023112515.html)*[** Technician found: WeChat or record computer logs and uploaded **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt-06082023024436.html)*** [Henan six netizens were punished for "rumoring" for sending related wheat videos](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gt2-05312023034734.html)**

In recent years, the Chinese government's measures to control citizens' remarks and restrict self -media development have emerged endlessly. Netizens often lament on Twitter outside the firewall that Chinese speech space is constantly narrowing.

As soon as this new document came out, many netizens immediately felt that this had a direct relationship with the a few days ago that the website announced the offline anonymous function.

The file stipulates that the platform platforms should strengthen registration and plan to change account information to prevent counterfeiting and counterfeiting behaviors of "self -media". This provision seems to be a common phenomenon in the current Chinese social media, that is, speaking from the media from the media, causing many disputes.

China's network technology enthusiast Kawaii thought of the fake account of many pseudonym "Ding Zhen" on the station B. He believes that this approach should be condemned, but if all real names are really realized and anonymous, it may not bring to bring it, it may not bring to bring What great benefits: "Just like the real -name system of the current telephone ten years ago, the real -name system was originally implemented to combat telephone fraud. As a result, information was leaked due to the implementation of the policy. In China Instead, phone fraud has become even more rampant. "

The regulations of the Internet Information Office also specifically emphasized that if the account information contains the names or signs or signs of the party, government and military agencies, news media, and administrative divisions, it is necessary to manually review and find that counterfeiting and counterfeiting shall not provide relevant services.

Such similar regulations seem to have known each other in China and are not new. Liu Lipeng, a former Sina Weibo content reviewer who lives in the United States, analyzed that this regulation has only further strengthened the restrictions of the past: "You can't imitate news agencies to send information about China before, but now control this diameter controlled by controlling this diameter management Even more strict, you just have the meaning of counterfeiting. "

In recent years, as the highest institution of China's Internet content management law enforcement, the Central Cyberspace Office has issued regulations one after another to restrict the content of the Internet platform, and on the other hand, it has continuously remedied the online remarks in the name of combating the news of Internet violations and named them as the "Clear Action". The latest one is the special operation of "Clear · Summer 2023 Summer of 2023 Summer" announced by the end of June. The Internet Information Office claims that the purpose of action is to comprehensively comprehensively reduce the survival space of hidden mutation of harmful information and create a network environment that is conducive to the healthy and safe growth of minors.

In the above provisions issued on Monday, the Internet Information Office also stipulates that the online platform shall require "self -media" not to gather negative information, stir -fry the old things, stir -fry the hot event, and consumer disaster accidents. Liu Lipeng believes that this regulation is confirmed with each other: "Like the regulations such as not stir -fried old news, this time may be clearer. The content is not written into the regulations. "

** Prevent the second "Teacher Li"? **

"Teacher Li is not your teacher" who has more than 1.1 million fans on Twitter reposted the new regulations issued by the Internet Information Office on Monday, which attracted many netizens' attention and hot discussion. He said to the analysis of this station that the latest provisions of the authorities may have a great impact: "Do not go to hot events, do not go to consumer disaster accidents. . Almost nothing can be talked about, because this framework is too big. Only if you don't talk, you can be regarded as 'not 蹭'. "

"Teacher Li is not your teacher" is currently in Italy. During the "White Paper Movement" in China at the end of last year, he forwarded the contributions of netizens from all over the country to reflect the pictures and videos of the epidemic sealing and rally. This has attracted the attention of overseas public opinion.

Although most of the "Teacher Li is your teacher" is not traditionally considered by the Chinese government's political sensitivity, but involves the daily life and reasonable demands of the Chinese people, according to his own introduction, his family in the country has also received the police from the police. Habits.

Liu Lipeng analyzed that one of the intentions of the new regulations of the Internet Information Office may be to prevent the second "teacher Li" in China: "Like the prohibition of anonymous release of such regulations, it is actually to prevent the appearance of the wall from the wall. 'This account. It is to accept contributions to netizens, and then publish it to expose some less sensitive social events. "From the above new regulations, it can be seen that the online information office requires the online platform to strengthen the authenticity management of information, and requires that "self -media" is responsible for the authenticity of the information released by it. When the "self -media" releases information, the website platform shall display the "self -media" account name on the information release page, and shall not be replaced by anonymous users.

"Teacher Li is not your teacher" believes that this kind of regulation will constitute an obstacle to the truth of the netizen's mining incident: "We know that many events are turned on after reversal, so it requires the media to be responsible for the authenticity of the information. In fact, it is actually in fact. Just ask the media to shut up. "

** Possible impact **

The above -mentioned new regulations of the Internet Information Office's information on China's self -media seem to have reached a new height. However, what the actual impact will have the new rules, it seems that there are divergent parties. Network technology enthusiast KAWAII has long been a technical consultant for network security for some websites. He believes that the new rules may not be able to get a good execution: "(network platform) workload is too large, and the platform will not hire so many reviews member."

Liu Lipeng believes that it depends on whether the government will punish some big v: "In the end, you must shut down some big accounts or catch people, maybe it may have some impact on the network. Like this There are several seasons that can be produced in a quarter, so it is unclear what impact will eventually have. "

"Teacher Li is not your teacher" analyzed that the authorities restricted to this extent for self -media, which may affect some people's livelihood: "Many people around me, including many people on the Internet I know, because of the (authorities) to crack down on teaching or training or Back to other industries, and then I have to switch to self -media, but now I want to rectify the self -media concentratedly. I think this is a sad thing. "" Teacher Li is not your teacher "said, just like it was similar to before The incident processing method is the same. Netizens believe that the authorities do so are very outrageous, but the authorities will still do so.

Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" recently quoted sources as saying that on June 30, after the approval of Zhou Yan at the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China as the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office, Xia Baolong had introduced Zhou Yan to the main officials of the Shenzhen Office of the Hong Kong and Macao Office. The two will also go to Zhuhai to introduce to the key team responsible for Macau affairs.

Sources said that Xia Baolong will continue to be the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office at this stage, and will continue to supervise and reorganize the work in the next few months. However, Zhou Yan was assigned as the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office, and Xia Baolong personally launched an entry journey with him in person, showing that Zhou Yan will be the candidate for the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office.

Zhou Yan had no experience in Hong Kong and Macao before, but Liu Zhaojia, a consultant of the China Hong Kong and Macau Research Association of the semi -official think tank, judged that Zhou Yan was more influential within the Communist Party of China and can better promote Hong Kong -related policies in the party organs and government agencies.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T17-03-18-04-00/000000.png)The President of the People's Republic of China Yi Gang Reuters Information Picture [Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhao/gx 07102023100310.html/@@stream(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-07102023100310.html/@@stream)The meeting between the US Finance Secretary and the Secretary of the Party Committee of the China Central Bank marked that Yi Gang, who is still the governor of the central bank, has actually paid the right and waits for the place. Compared with the successor Pan Gongsheng, why this Yi Gang who really has the "international background" has never been able to get the complete trust of Xi Jinping and it is worth exploring.

The US Minister of Finance of the Biden Government in the United States, praised by the Chinese Communist Party's official media for the United States' "Polices of Foreign China" or even "pro -Chinese" Yellen, has just ended Beijing Four -Day Bank to create a lot of "tidbits", such as When he saw the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister He Lifeng, he bowed excitedly and humblely. For example, after meeting with Pan Gongsheng, secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank of China, he announced on behalf of the CCP authorities that Secretary Pan was the de facto central director.

According to the report from the outside world, Yellen, who had a four -day visit to China, saw Pan Gongsheng, who was announced as a secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank of China in a series of meetings with Chinese officials, and left on Sunday (July 9). At a press conference in Beijing, he was called the central bank's supervisor.

According to Bloomberg report: As Yellen started visiting Beijing, US officials caused confusion on Pan Gongsheng's role. U.S. officials called Yellen with the current meeting of the President of the People's Bank of China Yi Gang. On Sunday morning, the (US) Ministry of Finance called Pan Gongsheng as the head of the People's Bank of China. Yelun said in his speech on Sunday on Sunday, "This is determined by China to decide and announce their decision. But I did meet with the current central bank agent, and we conducted very good discussions."

Obviously, the meaning of Minister Ye is that although I met the party committee secretary of the People's Bank of China, Secretary Pan was indeed the administrative leader of the central bank, that is, the power of the president.

In the previous period of this column, we have emphasized to readers and audiences that Pan Gongsheng is about to replace the "administrative leader" position of the Bank of China, and restores the expected realization of the central bank's head and government "one shoulder". Also wait for the end of August this year, because a "full process democracy" process through the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is needed. On the same day when Pan Gongsheng was announced as the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank, the recently of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress just closed, and the next meeting will be held two months later. Today, US Treasury Secretary Yellen is equivalent to replacing the CCP authorities to the public that Secretary Pan Gongsheng has "comprehensively presided over the work" in the central bank.

Yellen himself did not mention the details that he was fortunate to be met by the Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. The details that the central bank had specifically introduced the central bank's official website to the central bank's official website to accompany Secretary Pan to meet Yelun. The full text of this news is: "On July 7, 2023, Pan Gongsheng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the People's Bank of China and director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange met, met with the visiting US Treasury Secretary Yellen and exchanged opinions on the issue of economic and financial issues that was concerned about. Vice President Xuanchang can participate in the meeting. "

There is no place to meet in the article, but from the photo, it is at the central bank headquarters. The CCP Minister of Finance Liu Kun and Yellen are not "meeting", but more formal "talks". The relevant report of the official website of the Ministry of Finance of the Communist Party of China is: "On the evening of July 8, 2023, the Minister of Finance Liu Kun and the Minister of Finance of the United States and the Minister of Finance of the United States held talks at Diaoyutai State Hotel. Topics such as fiscal policy and cope with global challenges have been exchanged. Liao Yan, deputy director of the Central Finance Office and deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance, accompanied. "

However, compared to the news hotspot caused by the meeting of the party committee secretary of the People's Bank of China, Yellen, a "talk" between the US Finance Minister and the Chinese Finance Minister, was completely ignored by external media or completely. Or just take it.

Since the US Treasury Minister Yellen declared that what she met was the "supervisor" of the Chinese People's Bank of China after meeting Secretary Pan, I believe that China introduced to her at the time, or "actual person in charge" or "the main person in charge. "" ". As for Yi Gang, although it was the so -called "informal" meeting of Liu He, who was arranged to accompany the "retreat" as the governor of the central bank. Like Yellen's banquets, they could not move on the official news of the Communist Party of China.

Pan Gongsheng has fully replaced Yi Gang, who is still fully replaced in the central bank, and has a stronger proof of the stills of Yi Gang.

The author noticed that in the previous article of this column, the introduction of the leaders of the CPC Central Bank's official website is still in order to order Guo Shuqing, Yi Gang and Pan Gongsheng in order. After that, the leadership introduction column of the central bank's official website finally changed. The new sorting is: Yi Gang, Pan Gongsheng, Liu Guoqiang, Qu Jishan, Zhang Qingsong, Yichang Neng.

At the same time, the introduction of Yi Gang and Pan Gongsheng has been updated. The introduction of Yi Gang's position is to remove his title of deputy secretary of the party committee. Director of Foreign Exchange Bureau.

Yi Gang was also announced to be exempted from the party's deputy secretary of the party committee because Pan Gongsheng was appointed as the party committee secretary of the central bank, so he ranked before the party committee of the party committee. Of course, this is just an excessive form. In fact, Yi Gang was already on the official website of the central bank that "when people go, tea is cold."

The introduction of the event on the official website was fixed on June 30, which is the day before Pan Gongsheng was announced to replace the post of Secretary of the Party Committee of Guo Shuqing, the content was "June 30, 2023, the President of the People's Bank of China Yi Yi Yi The visited UN executive deputy secretary -general Aminna Mohammed and his party.

The introduction of Pan Gongsheng's activity is the content introduced in our previous article, that is, after meeting the two foreign central banks who visited Beijing after being promoted to the party committee secretary of the Central Bank, they also increased the US Treasury Secretary. The content of Yellen met. Although Yi Gang also met Yellen before Pan Gongsheng, the central bank's official website was also consistent with the pace of the CCP ’s central media, and it was not mentioned.When I read and hear some political reviewers, I mostly believe that the background of Yi Gang's former American university professor made him not completely assured by Xi Jinping. However, Liu He also has an American degree, and is it the background of Harvard University in the United States? What's more, Yi Gang was an official student who was originally liberalized by the Chinese Communist regime. He was a member of the backbone of the U.S. Underground Party that year, and he did not immediately return to China to "organize arrangements" after obtaining a degree.

It may be because not only staying in the United States at that time, but also became a professor of university professors in the United States. Yi Gang seemed to have deliberately avoided his own party in his resume, so as not to be criticized as the "underground party staying in the United States." However, in the memories of his college classmates, he revealed that he entered Peking University at the age of 19 and "actively requests progress" after entering the school. The second grade of college joined the party. At the age of 20.

Compared with the resume of Secretary Pan Gongsheng Pan, this person was born in 1963 and joined the party in 1999. He is only 5 years younger than Yi Gang, but the party age is 20 years shorter than Yi Gang.

Compared to the former Chuan Xiaochuan of the President of the Central Bank of Yi Gang, this public is 10 years old than Yi Gang, but it is 8 years later than Yi Gang. He joined the party in 1986. At the age of 28, he was 28 years old.

After Yi Gang was appointed as the central bank governor of Zhou Xiaochuan 5 years ago, many media in mainland China had scrambled to repost a report entitled "President Yi Gang's President: From Peking University High School to Lifelong Professor of the United States" to introduce Yi Gang at the age of 60 was an "old central bank." If he started to serve as deputy secretary -general of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People's Bank of China in 1997, and on the day he took over as the central bank governor, he had "dealt with" the central bank for more than 20 years. For more than 20 years, he has served as the director of the Monetary Policy Department of the People's Bank of China, assistant to the president of the People's Bank of China, and the director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Starting in March 2016, he has served as Deputy Secretary and Vice President of the Party Committee of the People's Bank of China. Essence

At a press conference in March 2016, Zhou Xiaochuan stated that when he introduced the division of various vice presidents, Vice President Yi Gang was responsible for the work of the People's Bank of China and competed in charge of monetary policy and international business. In other words, since then, he has been clearly the executive vice governor who preside over daily work.

In addition, on April 25, 2014, Yi Gang's three titles of the three titles of the Central Finance and Economics Leading Group Office, Vice President of the People's Bank of China, and director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange appeared at a conference in Fujian. Please note that at this time the leader of the Central Finance and Economics Leading Group was already Xi Jinping.

This report quoted Yi Gang's classmates in Peking University, and in the future, he remembered by Professor Haiwen, who returned from the United States at the same time, and said: "Yi Gang was younger at the age of our class, and he required to advance and perform positive. Not to mention hard work. As the first college student after the recovery of the college entrance examination, everyone is very hard. "

Haiwen also said: Yi Gang learned English in his early years, English was very good, and he actively participated in class activities. He was the earliest student who joined the party in the class. "The school's requirements for the party are very strict, and Yi Gang is the best performance among outstanding people. Later, it was recommended to study abroad. Everyone thinks that Yi Gang is excellent, ideal, and passionate. Students. After reading doctoral professors in the United States. Come back, we founded the China Economic Research Center together. Two years later, we went to the central bank. He used the policy to formulate the policy. "

According to the report, during the study of the United States, Yi Gang was an enthusiastic organizer of student activities. From 1985 to 1986, Yi Gang served as the chairman of the Chinese Student Scholars Association of the University of Elino. From 1992 to 1993, he served as the chairman of the Chinese Society of China in the United States.

In the United States, Yi Gang has become "Professor Yi". From 1986 to 1994, he served as teaching assistant and associate professor in the University of Indiana University in the University of Indiana, and in 1992, he received a lifelong teaching position.

So, since it was the international student of the state, wouldn't it be a manifestation of not being patriotic if he did not return to China in time after his studies? Especially as a Communist Party member?

Don't worry, another first published in the "North American Student Daily] that year's" North American Student Daily](https://www.zhihu.com/column/collegedaily)"Report" He once came to the United States with two dollars, brushed the bowl and read the blog, and now become the governor of the central bank!"It revealed a Central Plains Committee.

The article says: Yi Gang, a scholar -type official who is also a doctorate degree, is the "New Three College Students" after restoring the college entrance examination. In 1977, he was admitted to the Department of Economics of Peking University. He did not satisfy the status quo after graduation. Selected to the United States to study for further studies. He completed the study of business management at Hamlin University and went to the University of Illinois to study economics at the University of Illinois, and finally obtained a doctorate degree in economics.

It is worse than the gloriousness of most Chinese students in the stereotypes of everyone. Chinese students in the 1980s lived abroad. In an interview, he said: "I was holding two dollars in my pocket in 1980. I had to work for my own work to eat and pocket. You can earn 20 meals and pocket money in a week. "

During the 14 years of staying in the United States, he not only completed his doctorate degree, but also served as teaching assistant and associate professor at the University of Indiana in the United States. When he finished this "two dollars", he had obtained a lifelong teaching position of the Department of Economics of the University of Indiana.

Yi Gang once wrote in an article: "I have always rewarded society with a mood of rewarding, to repay my student ... repay my family, people around me, repay my alma mater, repay the People's Bank of China, so as Repay the country. "

When Yi Gang's first plan to study in the United States, Yi Gang returned to China immediately after graduation, but the principal of Peking University told Yi Gang that if he did not work in the United States, he could not understand the real United States, so until 1994, Yi Gang obtained the University of Indiana in the United States. Lifetime faculty returned to China.

The article also introduced: Although Yi Gang was in the United States at the time, he never really deviated from his country. His research topics are related to China's economic issues. During his teachings at the University of Indiana, he published a number of articles about Chinese currency and spent more than ten years of research. Published a variety of books, and his "China Monetization Process" was finally published in 2003.

However, although the above report confirmed that Yi Gang in the United States was always a "party", he did not explain how he and his family rested in the United States.

After the author came to the United States, a person who met with Yi Gang from Peking University was sent from Peking University. He also returned to teach China in the future: Our group, except for the batch of people who had returned to China before 1990----------------------------------------------- Only a small part of it, staying in the United States around 1990, 90 % of them took the "June 4th Green Card". The "welfare" sent by Americans has no exchange conditions. Why not take it?

Of course, Yi Gang, who returned to China in the future, must have given up the identity of the permanent residents of the United States ---- No matter what his family is, but after completing his studies in the United States, he also took a "June 4th Green Card" What about the car? The detailed analysis content will be one of the contents of the next article in this column.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

However, in recent years, the Chinese government has adopted a policy of suppressing and ignoring the private economy, which has greatly hit the confidence of private enterprises. At the end of last year, after China ended the epidemic sealing and entered the channel of economic recovery, the confidence of private enterprises has not been effectively recovered, and it has even dragged down the overall performance of China's economy. This reporter Wang Yuncai wrote three series of reports to reveal the dilemma of China's private economy with the experience of many private entrepreneurs. In the following reports, the current situation of the three services, trading small and micro enterprises will be mainly described.

[** Dancing from the times to Huang Zhong destroy abandonment ｜ The fear and love of Chinese private entrepreneurs (1) **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/minying/wy-06142023142320.html)When the Shanghai epidemic was closed in April and May last year, Zhang Kaiyu thought about dying with his two cats.

He has raised these two cats for 10 years, and he said that cats are their own weaknesses. When the news of many people's pets was dispelled by the controlling staff, Zhang Kaiyu was particularly scared. "I can't stand them to death, or I will strangle them by myself. , Just keep them in a cage and open the gas, they will suffocate to death slowly, then I can also use the same way. "

This is the most perfect solution that Zhang Kaiyu can think of, but maybe because there are still sisters and mothers, maybe there is some longing for freedom, and Zhang Kaiyu did not start in the end. But at this time, he had put down his business in his heart.

** Disclosure and defeat ** **

Zhang Kaiyu operated a fashion boutique in Shanghai, and it has been 16 years by 2022. His client is the rich class in Shanghai. On the list of thousands of customers he is in contact, many people have more than tens of millions of net worth. However, after Shanghai was closed in April, these customers gradually disappeared. "Especially in those two months, when talking to friends, they all wanted to leave, and they wanted to leave, including customers and friends, especially customers. Leaving, those who have money are like this. "

Here, you see them, you may have only one, two pieces, or even cheaper, and it is relatively cheap, and it is necessary to think about it, not like buying it like before. "

Zhang Kaiyu quickly figured out a truth, "You see the two months in the past two months, almost everyone seems to be locked in a large prison. There is no freedom. At this time, you feel that the business has no meaning." At the end of the year, Zhang Kaiyu turned his business out.

It was also in 2022, Mr. Mo, in Chengdu (for safety reasons, used a pseudonym) in May in May, and decided to leave the catering industry permanently.

Mr. Mo invested in the catering industry in 2014. It was best to have six restaurants in Chengdu, but by 2022, there were only two fast food restaurants. The fast -food restaurant he finally turned off was still making money, but he finally decided not to do it. "It was unknown at the time. The epidemic in May 2022 was not over. When will it be closed to Chengdu again; in a case, it is two or three months, and you can't do it anymore. Your inventory, your labor, your rent still have to pay. But as soon as the work is stopped, if these money has been invested in, it is completely meaningless. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T17-38-30-04-00/000002.png)On September 8, 2020, after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in Chengdu, a Sichuan opera actor was waiting for customers in a restaurant in Jinli Ancient Street. (Reuters) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T17-38-30-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/minying/wy-07102023123033.html/2020-09-08t102839z_1351177520_rc2aui9fj9fy_rtrmadp_3_health-coronavirus-china.jpg)The consulting company founded by Ge Ping in Hangzhou managed to survive the cool city in 2022, and still chose to "break the business" for its subsidiaries in early 2023. For the sake of safety, "Ge Ping" was interviewed with a pseudonym.

According to the "Regulations on the Registration and Management of Market Estatement", which was implemented in March 2022, the so -called break -out means that if an enterprise encounters a natural disaster, epidemic, etc. Essence However, Ge Ping did not think how many benefits it brought to himself. "Later, it was found that the basic expenditures, financial expenses, taxes of taxes, and renting studios for the expenses of the business are found. For the purpose of protecting the main body, it is not allowed the market to exit too much. The government has this consideration. "

Ge Ping speculated that the government's implementation of this "break" system is to look better on the report, and there are too many companies that do not let the stop or cancel it.

** Love freedom **However, services, trade with Mr. Mo and Mr. Mo encountered difficulties in small and medium -sized enterprises, but not only because of the epidemic and control measures. Before the epidemic began, they had smelled the economy of economy.

Zhang Kaiyu's shop opened in the golden area of the French Concession in Shanghai. The surrounding neighborhoods were large sycamore trees. In his words, it was very "old Shanghai". Before starting a business in 2006, Zhang Kaiyu also worked in the fashion boutique industry. The reason why I opened the store by himself was for freedom. "After opening the store, I basically wake up naturally every day. I go if I love it. I don’t want to go. It's very free. "

With the keen smell and accumulation of the industry, Zhang Kaiyu's store ushered in his peak period ten years later. It is 40%. "But in 2018, Zhang Kaiyu's shop began to go downhill. First, the customer base changed. "20%of the former foreign companies living in Shanghai were foreigners, but 18 years later, these people almost disappeared. At that time, we all felt weird."

At the same time, he found that there were also problems with friends around him. "Several friends were in those two or three years. They actually failed and went bankrupt, and one of them ran out to hide their debts. One of them had done a very good job. Successful, there are nearly a hundred chain stores across the country, and it has failed in those years. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T17-38-30-04-00/000004.png)During the epidemic, the Chinese authorities ordered the closure of non -necessary businesses and asked people to work outside a closed fashion shop after working at home.

Mr. Mo, in Chengdu, also felt that the customer base consumption in his store began in 2018.

Like Zhang Kaiyu, Mr. Mo used to be an office worker. In 2014, due to accidental reasons, Mr. Mo came across the catering industry that he was not familiar with. He opened a buffet restaurant next to the university in Longquanyi, Chengdu, and sold 70 yuan a buffet. Meals, Western food, etc., there are many types, and the price is relatively cheap. It is mainly for young people. You can eat everything. "

This restaurant's positioning is very successful, and it goes smoothly all the way. In the 2016 peak period, the sales of one month can reach 600,000. Mr. Mo quickly opened the second store, the third store ... Mr. Mo said that the day of that time was very comfortable. Basically, every store is profitable. You don't need to make up holes everywhere. At that time, the idea became active.

But in 2018, the business in the store began to decline. Mr. Mo first discovered the change from the consumption of college students. "The store is next to the university. You clearly feel that the pocket money of college students is less. Sometimes I chat with them, they say that the pocket money given by the family is reduced. It is constantly decreasing, so they must reduce their consumption, and you are not just needed when you come out for a meal. "

** Go to the watershed **

But for the reasons for the changes in business in 2018, Zhang Kaiyu and Mr. Mo both felt a little later.

"In 18 years, I didn't feel much, because the business of business is good. The traditional industry has a decline when there is rising, but in 2019, it is not good. I also talk to some colleagues. The feedback is such a situation, "Mr. Mo looked back and found that it was mainly a problem of the economic environment.

"I always feel that there is something wrong, but watching the news network and watching China's official media feel that everything is good," Zhang Kaiyu began to learn research on economics. The answer he found was a problem with the economic structure. "Later, I realized that the real estate tied the economy. The people took most of the money to buy a house, so it caused domestic demand to decline."

In many aspects, 2018 is not like the year of defeat. This year, China's political situation is stable, and Xi Jinping has just started the second term as the leader of the Communist Party of China and the country; five of the new members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are newcomers, including Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang and Wang Huning, etc. Do not think that they will have the potential to replace Xi Jinping in the future.

The Chinese economy in 2018 was not particularly worse than other years in the 2010s. The saying about the inflection point of the Chinese economy appeared as early as 2012. In 2018, the Chinese economy still achieved the target of 6.6%of the scheduled GDP (GDP), which seems to be unsatisfactory.

But maybe 2018 is the forty years of reform and opening up in China. People are particularly sensitive to the economic performance of this year. The media pointed out that the growth rate of 6.6%was the lowest economic growth rate in China since 1991. In the separate quarter, the economic growth rate has gradually decreased. , Then 6.7%, 6.5%, and 6.4%.

Economists think that this is the signal of China's economic slowdown, but their explanation of this is so sincere. Some people have the impact of the Sino -US trade war that started this year on China's external economy. Some people think that China's political system is no longer adapted to an increasingly complex economic pattern. In the early 1990s, he predicted that the rise of the rise of China's Economic Harvard University, Dr. Williamoverholt, published a new book "China's Crisis OFSUCCESS" in 2018, and believes that the Chinese economy has gone to the watershed corridor. It can maintain success unless it is transformed into a more market -oriented economy.

"One month calculates various costs, including rent, employees, and the cost of pressing goods and the cost of management. It is estimated that it can save 30,000 to 40,000 a month."

Mr. Mo began to close the shop, "it was closed one after another, because there were more than one, from 2019, until 2022, the final closing was May 2022."

Although the economic situation is not good, the two bosses feel that their business environment has passed. Although the government authorities are disturbing their operations from time to time, they generally feel that regardless of Shanghai or Chengdu, they can be regarded as friendly cities in China.

Mr. Mo said that he had been a restaurant for a few years. Although he also encountered difficulties from the government authority, he could basically avoid it. Just go flexibly and don't be sticking to them. Generally, I think it's okay, and it's not too embarrassed. "

He said "not too embarrassed" several times: once, the restaurant was issued by 600,000 penalties because the fire protection facilities had not passed, but they were actually not fined; In this case, I just scare you and scare you. I do n’t want you, I may find some trouble, but in fact, I do n’t. ”

But at the same time, Mr. Mo has also received benefits from the Chengdu government's policy. Mr. Mo's buffet restaurant has won an award at the Chengdu Food Festival in 2018, and has been preferentially treated in loans, and has received a loan of the expansion brand.

At the same time, Zhang Kaiyu, who is in Shanghai, will worry about unnecessary administrative intervention in the store from time to time. "His intervention will be a lot, such as asking your signboards to be unified, and the design of the store should be done according to his aesthetics, but you Knowing that their aesthetics are bad, it is a very beautiful store, which will be very ugly by them. "

Chen Kaiyu said sighingly that his bottom line was relatively low. "The Chinese have basically come back to the habit. For this kind of thing, we all think that as long as it does not care about you, we are grateful."

Zhang Kaiyu and Mr. Mo were afraid of avoiding the government, and Ge Ping of Hangzhou began in 2018. His business has close ties with the government.

** All the heads are head companies **

Ge Ping started a work in the enterprise before starting a business and conducted management consulting. After starting the business, it also mainly took the contract business from the enterprise and the government in this field. The business he did for the government also includes consultation with a stability maintenance mechanism, that is, to prevent the government's response mechanism consultation from social vicious incidents.

Ge Ping knows the doorway of the government business, "Especially for government consultation, in fact, it is still power to find rent. The reason why this business is for you may be because you know a certain official. He has your professionalism. Objective evaluation, and then you can also give him some benefits and exchanging benefits in private. "He emphasized that there are also bidding on the surface of this business government, but all such bidding is internal.

With the accurate grasp of the network and the wind direction of the industry, Ge Ping's company quickly reached a height of the industry in 2019. "The best time, about 400,000 contracts signed a year, which refers to pure income. We are the income. It belongs to a small and micro enterprise, and it can reach the top ten in this area. "

But whether it is Ge Ping, a consulting company that has a certain binding with the government's interests, or Mr. Mo's catering company, or Zhang Kaiyu's fashion boutique, in normal times, he must handle the relationship with the government trembling. Under the government's one -size -fits -all sealing policy, it is difficult to get necessary help from the government.

Ge Ping's biggest complaint is that his enterprise was too small to rescue from the Hangzhou government during the epidemic. "The only policy I got by my company was after the outbreak of (the epidemic), there were ten consecutive months. Fees reduced the operating cost of the enterprise. "

During the epidemic, Ge Ping's consulting company's contract was reduced; because of the lack of money in the local government, some of the company's government contracts could not be renewed. Due to the consultation, Ge Ping understands the mentality of different enterprises in the market. "For small and micro enterprises like us, from the perspective of the market, where does this confidence come from? From the perspective of most enterprises, the epidemic situation In three years, (government aspect) has not had any communication with our business owners. "

The government's assistance seems to be far away from the Ge Ping, but it is closer to some other companies. It can be seen in the "A solid and stable Economic Policy" released by the State Council of China in early June 2022 that it can be seen that in terms of financing, re -production and re -production policies, the central government supports key enterprises.

The "Measures" also mentioned that it has handled the tax refund of small and micro enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households and increased its assistance. According to the China Official Media People's Daily Report earlier this year, in 2022, small and micro enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households increased tax cuts, fees, and tax refunds and slowing fees exceeding 1.7 trillion yuan, accounting become. But these policies have not felt the actual discounts in the three policies.

Ge Ping keenly noticed the logic behind these policies. "My personal perception is that the government has not installed it in the past two years. The company is a listed company in A -share, and the government comes based on this level. "

** Bone injury to bones **

In fact, different local governments have some preferential policies for SMEs. Mr. Mo's Chengdu has a policy of stabilizing enterprises before the epidemic. Each employee of Mr. Mo's restaurant has received a subsidy of about 100 yuan a month. This policy continued during the three years of the epidemic.

However, these cultivation and supplementary policies seem to be difficult to save the predicament of the epidemic seal that makes it unable to operate normally.

Mr. Mo remembered the three years of the epidemic, and it was no longer the meaning of Shu Tan during the peak of 2016. "I stayed at home for two months. It is estimated that this level must be a bit sad. Then I also gave the family back to the family. I said that I did n’t know what the situation was.

Even with such determination, Mr. Mo still feels stressed all the time. "Because you have to pay wages every day, there are so many employees, they still have to eat, right?" And even if Mr. Mo's rent is in the epidemic situation During this period, it is still increasing at a rate of 6%per year.

Mr. Mo is currently in California, USA. He has a clear contrast to the epidemic measures of both China and the United States. "It's been too long. I thought it was almost let go of the three months at that time, but I really did not expect these three. After the year, people are hurting their bones. Anyway, many people in my circle fall in this place, that is, a fatal blow. This blow is knocking on the brain!"

** Society in the eyes of the owner **

Under the control of the scary epidemic, Mr. Mo saw not only the downside of the businessmen around him, but also the fission of the entire social atmosphere. "The riders were uncle aunts and the like before, and later they were very young. The beautiful little girl came to takeaway, and when I talked, many of them were from the beginning of the high education to send takeaway, which means that the entire employment status is not very good. "

From the takeaway rider, Mr. Mo directly realized the true emotions of Chinese society. "I feel that they have suffered a lot of social pressure. If you come quickly, you can urge it. I often quarrel with my employees and conflict. "Mr. Mo had to always appease his employees so that they must hold back and do not work with the takeaway.Mr. Mo said that the situation he saw was particularly serious in 2021-2022. Actually, after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in early 2020, as the economy fluctuated, the employment situation of Chinese society experienced ups and downs. In 2021, many places resumed work and re -production, and the unemployment rate fell, but from the second half of that year, China's unemployment rate has risen again. As far as the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in April 2022, on the eve of Mr. Mo's closure of the last restaurant, the national urban survey rate was 6.1%, especially the youth group (16-24 years old) surveying an unemployment rate was as high as 18.2% (In April 2023, this number has risen to 20.4%).

Facing the forced economic space and the worsening social situation, there seems to be more ways to go. Zhang Kaiyu observed from the rich class that he was in contact with himself, "The most dynamic and richest people in the whole society, what I said is those who have done very successfully through legitimate operation. These people are actually engines of the entire economy. People are the most capable of leaving, and they are the most consciously left. I think these people are leaving, or they have left. "

But in his opinion, this is only the choice of very few people. "For most ordinary shopkeepers, or small and medium entrepreneurs, they can't leave, they can only struggle here and struggle to survive."

Zhang Kaiyu and his cat moved to California, USA in March 2023. Although China had ended the clearing policy at that time, he was still full of disappointment. "He has not learned this policy because he has learned from the world what lessons have learned from the world from the world. "He seemed to be glad to say this secret, laughed twice, and said," He just can't persist because he can't hold on, or the common people resist too much; Pay attention to the health of the people, or the right to survive the basic rights, etc. "."

The society that Ge Ping saw in Hangzhou was the resistance of the people. On the evening of November 27, 2022, the white paper movement was spreading the most widely in the country. Ge Ping ran to the scene of the Hangzhou White Paper Movement, near the Apple computer store near the West Lake, "to the back, those young people, including those, including Some girls are completely a "Chongta" posture. Before eight o'clock, all the siege circles of their (police) had been arranged, including their leadership at this time, and there was a car. I could see it. It is clear, but there are still some young people to rush the tower. "

In this social movement that has not been seen in China for many years, Ge Ping saw the hope of society. At the same time, he had a new discovery from the perspective of maintaining the stability system: local governments were lying flat when dealing with this incident, "Why white paper The revolution occurred in dozens of cities. In fact, in this and in the stability maintenance mechanism, they had slacks at that time, and we could see that we can see the online security data in the background. "He believes that this also reflects the progress of a certain society.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-10T17-38-30-04-00/000010.png)On November 27, 2022, the protesters raised white paper on the streets of Beijing to oppose the Chinese government's epidemic prevention policy. (Federation of the Associated Press)

** "Investigate 11 years" ** **

After the White Paper Sports swept the country, the Chinese government quickly ended the epidemic sealing policy at the end of last year, and it has been more than half a year to this day. Chinese society seems to be slowly moving towards the right track, healing the harm caused by the three years of sealing the epidemic.

Three small business owners from Chengdu, Shanghai and Hangzhou have made arrangements for their destiny. Mr. Mo said that when he ran to the United States, he came to hide his debt. He was reluctant to talk about the future of the catering industry. "To be honest, when I can recover, I don't want to care about this. Secondly, I am not in the country, and care about care. "

Zhang Kaiyu was a little worried. His mother was in a domestic stroke not long ago. He could not speak in the intensive care unit, but his sister warned him not to go back. Ge Ping said that he would take a step in a step, and he is currently not available for the time being; his company still has six employees. Although he loses money, he also pays them.

The confidence of domestic private enterprises has not recovered. The Chinese government also seems to understand the situation of private enterprises. In recent months, local governments have successively held seminars with private entrepreneurs. In early July, Zheng Zujie, director of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, negotiated with the heads of five private enterprises such as Sanyi Group and Nongfu Spring.

But what the small owners are actually watching in private enterprises. "Anyone who is a bit rational knows that this environment has reached a very bad level," Zhang Kaiyu sighed.

At the end of 2020, Ant Financial's listing plan was stopped at the last moment, which is generally considered to be a sign of the Chinese government's round of suppression of private enterprises. On July 7 this year, the Chinese financial regulatory authorities announced that the Ant Group's fines and confiscated illegal income were 7.1 billion yuan.

In the second quarter of this year, the Xiamen Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation pursued the tax evasion of local Taoxiang Catering Co., Ltd. from 2012 to 2015. Netizens spread the news on the Internet with the title of "11 years of inspection", which is full of warning.

These practices seem to have legal and policies, but Zhang Kaiyu said that he could not see the border with various governments. "The key is that he can use his power arbitrarily, want you to give birth, and let you die if you want you to die. Dead, there is no legal boundary. "

Ge Ping, who often deal with the government, believes that for small and medium -oriented private enterprises, it is difficult to change the business environment. "It is now a government platform for the head of the header, but after the platform, can these heads survive? For example Real estate companies, can their problems be resolved? If the head enterprises are not good, then you expect that small and medium -sized enterprises will become better. There is no scientific basis for this. "

Ge Ping also provided entrepreneurial counseling for college students in college, but he held a negative attitude towards the current entrepreneurial environment. "The current market environment, I want to give a suggestion, that is, the risk is too high, the policy support is too small, just like the epidemic situation, just like the epidemic situation. During this time, what support do you have to entrepreneurs? Without any support, it is to let them die. "

** Our living method and our expectations **

However, after experiencing the white paper movement, Ge Ping has a different kind of optimism about the power of Chinese society itself. "At present, the people's wisdom has been opened, just to know more about history, especially to know the country of the Communist Party of China How does the machine operate. "

He hinted that for each individual, to recognize his class and expectations for life, "the second or rich two generations have their living law, but we ordinary people, whether it is technology, Still work or be a businessman, we have to have our living law, we have to have our expectations!"

#### Levi Strauss & Co (New York Stock Exchange code: Levi)

LEVI Strauss & CO, the old -fashioned denim clothing manufacturer LEVI Strauss, lowered the company's profit forecast for the company's entire year after July 6, and the company's stock price fell 7.7 % immediately on Friday. The performance report also fully reflects the rising cost caused by factors such as inflation, which has hit its profit margin, and the company is now in the dilemma of the decline in sales channel sales.

According to Levi Straus's second quarter performance report as of May 28 this year, the Group's turnover decreased by 9 % year -on -year to $ 1.34 billion, and the adjustment of each share was $ 0.04.

Levistraus' direct sales channels with high profit margins have achieved a 13 % increase in turnover in the second quarter. However, because wholesalers tighten the inventory of goods in North America and Europe, the company's wholesale channels have fallen by 22 %. On the whole, its American market sales fell 22 %, and the European market sales reduced by 2 %.

Refinitiv previously went online and offline for Levistrauss performance. The average prediction of analysts collected was a turnover of US $ 1.34 billion and a profit of $ 0.03 per share. Judging from the performance of this quarter, Levistrauss is barely reached. But the fatal injury of the stock is the prediction of its executive on the next performance.

These executives are now expected to make a profit from US $ 1.10 to $ 1.20 after this fiscal year, which is lower than the $ 1.30 to 1.40 US dollars they previously predicted. The adjusted gross profit margin is expected to decrease from 57.6 % of the last fiscal year, about 90 basis points, which is severe than the previously expected decrease of 50 basis points.

The executive of this clothing manufacturer also said that the Group's annual net turnover is expected to increase by 1.5 % to 2.5 % over the same period last year, and it has reduced the range of 1.5 % to 3 % of the previous forecast.

Levi Strauss CEO Chipbergh said at the online explanation meeting after the performance report was released: "The company will reduce the prices of about six products sold in retailers Macy's and Nordstrom, in order to attract more Consumers with more 'price sensitive'. "

![](Images/zaobao world/2023-07-10T20-01/000001.png)Levistrauss now attracts more consumers who are "price -sensitive". (File photo)

These products will include core denim products, such as Levi ’s 502 jeans that can be sold across seasons.

Perhaps because the retail industry is unclear, the eight analysts of Tipranks are also different. Four "buy" rating of Levistrauss shares, four given "holding" rating, the average target price of the one -year period is 16.75 Dollar.
