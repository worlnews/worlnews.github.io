"Oh my God, this is Vladimir Putin!" People shouted.

The Kremlin played with Putin's meeting with the masses in Jerbon, trying to describe the scene as the enthusiasm of a president to resist supporters and responded to improvisation.

"On the one hand, there are strong suggestions from experts," the Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters at a routine press conference on Thursday that he seemed to mean that doctors suggested that Putin maintain a social distance.

Tatiana Stannovavar, a senior researcher at Canegy Russia's Eurasian Center, said that after the Wagner Incident, Putin has been trying to return to the "comfort zone".

She said that the information he conveyed was, "He didn't hide in the castle, he was with his people."

Article 23 has always been a political "hot potato" (information photo).

** The "Hong Kong National Security Law" has been implemented for three years, and this official claims to be "Dinghai God Needle" and "only a group of people" laws. As of now, the crime rate is 100 %, which has been accused of causing a cold effect in Hong Kong society. **

The Beijing and Hong Kong Government stated that Hong Kong has "from chaos, governing and promising", but still to beware of "soft confrontation" and national security risks. Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao's preview on the eve of July 1st has a timetable for Article 23 of the Basic Law involving national security.

The authorities have not yet announced the content of the draft, but the analysis believes that the 23 articles compared to the National Security Law as "symbolic significance than reality", and at the same time marked Beijing to further tighten the ideological work of Hong Kong.

In 2003, the number of Hong Kong citizens went to the streets to demonstrate, opposing 23 legislation and request, then Chief Executive Dong Jianhua's steps down (information photo).

Article 23 of the "Basic Law" in Hong Kong is the terms of national security. It stipulates that the SAR government shall prohibit the seven categories of acts that endanger the national security.

The "seven sins" of Article 23 include: rebellion, division of the country, inciting rebellion, subverting the Central People's Government, stealing national secrets, foreign political organizations or groups to carry out political activities in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's political organizations or groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups. Foreign political organizations or groups have been established.

In 2002, Dong Jianhua, the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong, launched local legislation, but the consultation period was insufficient, and the draft of the regulations was accused of blurring and harshness. The public worried about the freedom of speech and human rights. Later, the institutional liberal party, which represented the interests of the business community, made the government fail to obtain sufficient votes in the Legislative Council, and eventually withdrew the draft.

Since then, 23 have become political "hot potato", and the four special capitals have failed to complete the "constitutional responsibility."

However, Professor Chen Wenmin, Dean of the School of Law, the University of Hong Kong, publicly refuted the statement that has not fulfilled the "constitutional responsibility", saying that 23 articles did not explain what the way to use, but only said "self -legislation", and the country required by Article 23, and 23 countries required to require Security law has always existed in the current laws of Hong Kong, but it is scattered in different provisions.

He pointed out that on July 1, 1997, the Interim Legislative Council passed the "Hong Kong Return Regulations" and changed the "Emperor" and "United Kingdom" and other places to "the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China".

The current "Criminal Crime Regulations", "Official Confidential Regulations", and "Association Regulations" all have crimes such as incitement, rebellion, and spies, which have already covered 23 requirements.

### 23 What is the difference between the crimes of the National Security Law?

The Li Zhiying case is one of the iconic cases of the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the details of the use terms and procedure rules have always received much attention (information photos).

Chinese said.

In 2019, Hong Kong broke out for the "anti -sends" campaign due to the revision of the "Fugfeng Regulations". Beijing was regarded as "anti -China -China chaos" and "color revolution". In order to split the country, subvert the state power, organize terrorist activities, and intervention in foreign forces, the first two overlap with 23 parts.Song Xiaozhuang, director of the National Hong Kong and Macau Research Association, wrote in the "Bauhinia" magazine in the "Bauhinia" magazine that 23 legislation does not have to repeat the two crimes that the "National Security Law" has covered, and can be concentrated in the remaining five sins.

It is worth noting that the definition of 23 articles on the crime of "subversion" is different from the National Security Law.

### With the "National Security Law", is there still an urgency of 23?

The June Fourth Candlelight Gala, which has a history of more than 30 years, was also unable to hold it after the implementation of the National Security Law. The picture shows the Hong Kong police stationed in Victoria (data photo) on June 4, 2022.

Hong Kong's current laws have included 23 requirements to a certain extent, but some laws have been accused of outdated.

For example, the "Official Secret Regulations" covering the crime of spy are localized the laws entered into the United Kingdom in 1919, and the rebellion under the Criminal Crime Regulations still retain the words "Her Majesty of the Queen".

Guild member Tang Jiazheng said in an interview with BBC that the laws passed by these Hong Kong -British governments have been more than 30 years or even 50 years. " "Inconsistent, so now there is a very urgent need to modernize these laws into the needs of 23 articles."

Professor Chen Wenmin of the former School of Law of the University of Hong Kong has pointed out that the existing legislation needs to be reform and time to advance, and it can be discussed by the Legal Reform Commission. It is not necessary to force 23 legislation for political convenience.

He also said that the current law is not only insufficient, but is too harsh. For example, there are three people in the past cases that have been placed in bombs, which have been regarded as a war against the Emperor (Chinese government). Today's Basic Law and the guarantee of human rights.

Dr. Li Enzhen, a visiting researcher at the Law School of the University of London, also told BBC in Chinese that the annual outdated legislation has its necessity. "The problem is, now want to update to more stringent and infringement of human rights, or is it more in line with human rights protection? "

Li pointed out that the "National Security Law" is currently a legal weapon to control society. There is a long -term influence that has achieved great deterrent effects. He questioned the urgency of 23 legislation.

"Is it an objective and reality, or the urgency of political propaganda, and slogan? From a government perspective, constantly establishing new national security laws, further extending the power of the national security system in Hong Kong society, are more beneficial to the government's tough governance. ","

### 23 "Political Task" is imperative?

Analysis means that national security has become the core idea of Xi Jinping, so that 23 legislations in Hong Kong have more important political symbolic meaning

Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao recently stated that 23 legislations are priority work, emphasizing "faster the better" and "not a mess".

Current affairs commentator Lin He Li pointed out to the BBC in Chinese that the current "National Security Law" is enough to maintain the "stability" needed by Beijing. Two times. "

Chen Jingxiang, a senior media person, previously wrote in the Ming Pao and analyzed that the previous government in Hong Kong several times has "unmoved", but this time it is bound to complete the legislation during the first term of Li Jiachao, because Hong Kong is now by the Party Central Committee of the Party Central Committee. Leading directly, maintaining national security is the core idea of Xi Jinping's era.

He pointed out that after Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he established the National Security Council and proposed the "overall national security outlook" for the first time. The 20th National Congress also said that "national security is the foundation of national rejuvenation." In this context, the 23rd legislation in Hong Kong is no longer as simple as the "constitutional responsibility" that was said to be in the early stage of return, but the primary concern and major political tasks of Zhongnanhai.

He cited the precedent of Macau. Even if the local national security law version of the "mild" national security law was established in the early years, more than ten years later, they must catch up with Beijing's political situation and revise the provisions more. National ", there is no" two systems ", related laws must be aligned with mainland China.

Zhong Jianhua, a Hong Kong social policy and public administrative scholar who has moved to the United Kingdom, said that Hong Kong's sovereign transfer has been transferred for 26 years. Article 45 and Article 68 The political system reform, that is, the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council have a method based on universal selection.

"After the legislation in 2003 is unsuccessful, the general understanding is to wait for the third chief executive election method in 2007, and then promote a more reasonable election before 23 legislation is carried out. This (implementation of general elections) is actually constitutional responsibility. Now Beijing Speaking of part of it does not talk about part, no one can stop him from castrating the Basic Law and the breakdown. The SAR government seems to want to use this (23) to express loyalty to Beijing. "

### 23 Is there a conflict with the National Security Law?

The National Security Law has a driving position and is accused of infringing human rights and freedom (data photo) that guarantees the Basic Law.

Article 23 is local legislation. The National Security Law is a national law that implements in Hong Kong. The Security Director Deng Bingqiang described it earlier that the two were "complementary."

In 2020, the number of overwhelming votes of the National People's Congress of China with 2878 votes, 1 vote against, and 6 votes abstaining passed "the decision and enforcement mechanism (draft) of the establishment and improvement of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to maintain national security." Chang Wang Chen mentioned at the time that 23 people with ulterior motives were seriously stigmatized and demonized, and it was difficult to approve at the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Therefore, it was necessary to "establish a legal system from the national level.

Beijing directly includes the National Security Law into the Annex III of the "Basic Law" in Hong Kong and announced its implementation in Hong Kong. This is regarded by the outside world as an bypassing local legislative procedures in Hong Kong, which is equivalent to "illegal legislation" to destroy the Hong Kong and two systems, two systems and high autonomy.

According to the official explanation, although Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Government should "legislate" on national security, it does not rule out that the central government has legislative to maintain national security, but also refers to the national security surpassing the scope of autonomy of Hong Kong. Article 18 of the Basic Law "National Defense, Diplomacy, and Other Laws in accordance with the Basic Law that does not belong to the scope of the autonomy of the Special Administrative Region in Hong Kong."

Public administrative scholar Zhong Jianhua said that because the "Hong Kong National Security Law" has been criticized in the international community, many countries and international institutions require the cancellation of relevant laws. After the Hong Kong Government is expected to complete 23 legislation, it will reduce the use of the "National Security Law".

Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao said in an interview with the official News Agency that the National Security Law and the 23rds of Article 23 plus "even if it is not overlapping, it is 11". See the big witch. "

The guild member Tang Jiazheng also told BBC in Chinese that the most controversial crimes have been handled in the National Security Law, and the remaining five sins believe that the controversy is not great. "The remaining, such as the crime of betrayal, how can there be controversy in the crime of betrayal? There are crimes in the world in the world.

Legal scholar Li Enzhen pointed out whether there are 23 disputes in addition to seeing the legal provisions "how spicy it is", but also depending on the procedure regulations, such as "whether the Hong Kong court has the right to review whether 23 is unconstitutional."

Li said that if the criminal procedures of Article 23 are aligned with the National Security Law, for example, there are chief executives designated judges, no jury, and bail arrangements for the National Security Law, etc., will still be regarded as destroying the principles of general law and judicial independence "At that time, the international community will believe that now it is the credibility of the Hong Kong government to destroy the judicial system by hand."

Hong Kong is currently strengthening national security education (information photos).

The Hong Kong Government has not announced the draft regulations on 23 articles, but the chief executive Li Jiachao told the official China News Agency that preventing the risk of national security must "be vigilant of the influence of ideology", and 23 legislation must take into account the "new method of appearing on the Internet world."

Public policy scholar Zhong Jianhua estimates that 23 articles may be added to the control network, and the provisions may be more widely written than the National Security Law, and it can be explained at will.

Hong Kong current affairs commentator Liu Ruishao, who is familiar with Chinese affairs, also expects that 23 will strengthen norms in terms of speech, publishing, and popular culture.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China recently reviewed the "Draft Patriotic Education Law". For the first time, it was mentioned that it was necessary to strengthen the recognition of "Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan", and "consciously maintaining the unity of the motherland and national unity."

Liu Ruishao pointed out that although the National Security Law has been abnormal in the past three years in Hong Kong's implementation, Beijing still feels that the situation is not as ideal. "His ideal is that everyone is actively patriotic, not passively obey." He continued that the CCP had a long -term consciousness of struggle and the devil of foreign forces.

"Even if Hong Kong has set up 23 articles, it is difficult for the demon to be unlocked, because this is their natural psychology and response, and they are also their needs and strategies -only in this way can we continue to create political tension."

It is reported that the Netherlands intends to control some equipment from companies such as ASML, and the United States will use its influence to further restrict specific Chinese manufacturers' semiconductor equipment.

A source who are familiar with the United States plan explained that the new specifications will require enterprises to apply for a license in order to reach about 6 Chinese factory export equipment from a SMIC semiconductor factory, and these applications may be rejected.

[ Netherlands ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/荷蘭跟進美國-祭半導體技術出口管制/a-64926059)The government plans to announce the new regulations on the 30th of this month, requiring the export permit for the export of top products in the ASML "Deep Ultraviolet Light" (DUV) semiconductor equipment. DUV is the second advanced instrument of ASML, and the most advanced "Euv" light carved machine has been restricted and never shipped to China before.

Sources said that the new regulations in the Netherlands are expected to take effect in September; the United States stipulates that it may be announced at the end of July that it is expected to apply to ASML because its products contain American parts. In July, the United States is also expected to make other updates on comprehensive rules announced in October last year.

It is reported that the United States has also had a case that revised the proposal before approval. Therefore, the sources described only the plan of the United States in late June, and the time and restrictions of the case may still change. ASMINTERNATIONAL, a Dutch semiconductor equipment company, may also be affected by the new regulations of the Netherlands; the company's spokesman refused to comment before the official release.

The Dutch government and ASML rejected Reuters' comment requests, and the US Department of Commerce, responsible for supervising export control, also refused to comment.

For many measures to restrict the export of chip equipment in the near future, Nvidia (Nvidia (and Huida) COLETTEKRESS said on the 28th that this approach will cause the US industry to lose the opportunity to compete and lead in the Chinese market.

Chen Nanxiang, chairman of the Chinese chip manufacturer "Yangtze River Storage" (YMTC), said on the 29th that the security concerns of geopolitics and some countries are threatening the globalization of the chip industry and its future growth; It reached a sales of $ 1 trillion in 2030.

Chen Nanxiang said that the chip industry is facing many government interventions, and many political contents are also miscellaneous. He completely agreed that Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC (TSMC), speeches in March, arguing that "chip globalization is dead." He did not point out what countries he said from the "government".The Yangtze River Storage was one of the 10 Chinese artificial intelligent chip companies facing the US export control last year. The reason for the United States is to worry that the Yangtze River Storage may transfer American technology to a Chinese technology company that is included in the blacklist.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-30T04-28-17-08-00/30ambriefing-asia-nl-scotus-master1050.jpg)When I was still studying for graduate students a few years ago, I used the work of making money in the summer vacation to help Asian children get rid of Asian characteristics. At that time, I was a self -employed home for helping high school students who prepared for college admission. I lived in only a few kilometers of Chinese and Chinese -American settlements in Flushing Chinese and Chinese Americans. In a sultry summer afternoon, my first job was to go to a forced apartment to listen to the needs of minors: she asked me to check her university application carefully and make sure she should not be too Asian.

I remember my embarrassing laughter is like an old air conditioner who is about to be scrapped; I thought she was joking.

But she continued to tell her requirements seriously. She felt that high -quality universities were unwilling to recruit Asians because there were too many Asians -if she looked too much like Asians, she would not be accepted. She listed the Asian and Asian and American friends in her church in one breath. Their extra -curricular resumes were very eye -catching and the test results were impeccable, but she said that even the school school rejected their application.

In the following years, almost every college enrollment counseling work has been accompanied by the same requirements. Both Chinese and Korean children want their application materials to less Chinese or Korean characteristics. White children of rich families want to not show their wealth, not so much as white. Black children want to ensure that they can leave enough black impression. The same is true of Latin and Middle Eastern children.

Whether the skin is white or brown, whether the conditions are rich or poor, whether it is a student or a parent, everyone who I do in contact with the tutor seems to think that if you want to enter the top school, you have to participate in what I said. change. For these students, the admission process of university has become a kind of behavior art. Their task is to minimize their identity to the minimum or maximize the reward -the ideal envelope sent by the ideal school. It didn't take long for me to be forced to play this game myself: a few years later, as a black doctoral candidate, I was distressed when I was looking for the first professor, because I didn’t know what (and whether it should) talk about it. My race can make me the object of diversified recruitment. If you do this, it feels like cheating; but if you don't do this, it seems to harm your own interests.

Regardless of whether it is for admission notice or for a lifetime professor position, the incentive measures of the Elite Institute encourage and reward such racial games. Now, the Supreme Court has rejected the equality bill in college admission, which will only make this situation worse. The rise of the Activity Act has inadvertently spawned the culture of race issues, and encouraged countless students and parents to study how race can improve admission opportunities, or complicate the admission chances. Conversely, the end of the Agreement Act will only make the situation worse, because students and parents will definitely start more brains.

I can clearly say that I do not oppose the equality bill. If there is no equality bill, I think I will not be able to study undergraduate at the Haval Ford College, and should not be a doctoral program at New York University. Now I have obtained the position of Professor of Bitz College. I believe that the Activities Act is useful. It is necessary to correct the historical malignancy of real estate slavery and the countless sequelae it triggered. In the preferential treatment, many students who are mediocre (and wealthy) are relying on their parents, or they are just good at rowing.

But I also believe that although the equal rights bill is necessary, it also indirectly helps a distorted, racial university culture. When students have not officially entered the campus, they have been encouraged to regard racial identity as the most important side of their own personality, which is inseparable from their personal value and advantages.

Many well -known institutions have promoted the game of enrollment due to racial issues, and they try to maximize diversity without affecting donation income. For example, some colleges and universities will recruit ethnic minorities students who have the ability to pay full tuition fees to improve diversity data at a very low cost. Even the schools known as "Blind" have recruited a large number of ethnic minorities students who do not require economic assistance. (Some statistics states that more than 70 % of the blacks, Latin -speakers, and aboriginal students of the Americas have been educated in university, and their income is higher than the national middle digits.)

Although the measures of elite institutions do not always meet the spirit of the equality bill, that is, to help groups that need help, the current system is still trying to ensure some ethnic diversity in higher education, including minority ethnic minorities from the working class. Exim applicant. I am one of these members. ) But in the world that is revoked by the equal rights bill, the morbid system of racial problems will be intensified, and all the good fruits of the true structural correction brought by racial justice and equal rights action will disappear.

Don't worry, the diverse trend of thought will continue to spread, the reason is very simple. Most students said that they want to see diversification. "American News and World Report" will come from students who are representative in the university. At the same time, considering that the extremely rich institutions such as universities, banks, and technology companies have selfishly devalued the diversity, fairness, and tolerance into a realized brand strategy. It is cheap to talk about troops on diversity paper. Change the teaching outline or announce the establishment of DEI (diversity, fairness and tolerance) special working group composed of employee workers.

In the age when the elite college and university can rely on the equality bill to increase racial diversity, this show -like expression is generally harmless. However, in the new educational pattern banned by the awareness of the racial consciousness, the promise of DEI will only exist because of inertia thinking and economic interests in the moral. Students' elite higher education system.

Just as my undergraduate alma mater is [abandon](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/06/27/haverford-college-shifts-need-blind-need-aware-admissions)Blind Admissions Policy (a school newspaper author [抨](http://haverfordclerk.com/why-we-need-need-blind/)This is to discover the cost of minority students with low -income ethnic minorities in order to realize the "financial and feasible diversity"). After the court abolition the equal rights bill, even this diversity will no longer exist. The rest is the only financial and feasible enrollment.

Although class -based rather than ethnic equal rights action policies have recently appeared, I have skepticism about whether this can increase racial diversity. In the state where the racial equality bill has been banned, the enrollment policy based on wealth [basically cannot](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html)Prevent minority students from prestigious schools decrease. There is no reason to expect them to work suddenly.

The gaming of racial problems will not disappear.advertise

In fact, what he said is already becoming a reality: just as the sociologist Aya Waller-Bell's published in "Atlantic" [Wonderful but frustrated](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/affirmative-action-supreme-court-college-admissions-essays-trauma/674314/)In the article, applicants for ethnic minorities are very clear that their darkest life experience will make them more likely to be admitted. At the same time, many white, Asian, and rich applicants will continue to work hard to make them look less like white, Asian or the rich, because they believe that this is the best way to enter the extremely picky elite campus Essence

It is expected that there will be more anti -racist action plans, more empty -cave de -colonization, more compulsory training, more blew consultants, more empty reports, and more people who can tell their work clearly Manager, more [cheap indigenous land recognition](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/against-land-acknowledgements-native-american/620820/)("Sorry, I stole your house!")), More white self -whipping for others, more [minority teachers used to install facade](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/06/02/opinion/wrong-kind-of-black-professor/)Essence

In the tornado of this racial topic, if you block your ears and look around, you may start not to notice that there are fewer and fewer brown and black children reading in the yard. In the future, [in the obstetric ward](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html)There are fewer and fewer brown and black doctors. Facts will prove that all these measures have almost no relationship with the real crackdown on structural racism. We are likely to find out that we have a whiter and richer classroom in the year and a year -old classroom.

What should I do? If famous schools really care about diversity, what actions should they take in the next step?

First of all, they should exit diversity, equality and tolerance industry complexes(D.E.I.-industrial complex)This complex is preferred to consider cheap repair, improvement of consciousness, and one -time speaking activities, but it turns out that these activities have little effect. If you are engaged in related work or participating in related activities, whenever people claim that they are acting on anti -racism, you can ask them to explain clear They provide material help. (Tip: If you do not spend a lot of time or money, it is likely to be nonsense.) If "success" is a cultural change that you cannot quantify, record, and make meaningful assessment, then it is likely to be likely It's nonsense. Therefore, there is no dependence, and the other party is required. If things are involved in public relations scams, to provide a guise for those racial policies that ensure that the school is rich and white enough, then it is better to do anything and help.

Secondly, elite colleges should unite and strangle the "American News and World Report" ranking system. This infamous university ranking has been attacked for many years. It depends on a series of indicators, such as the graduation rate. These indicators actually reward colleges that recruit more white students who enroll richer, and mistakenly linked the scale of excellence with the scale of donation. Essence Because poverty and ethnic minorities are more likely to withdraw from school because they cannot control environmental factors, institutions that implement enrollment policies for these groups may be adversely affected in this ranking. Some famous law schools have stopped participating in the ranking system, and Columbia University has recently become the first Ivy League undergraduate college.

advertise

Exit this system -the principals of elite colleges should collectively announce that they are doing this -it will enable them to re -conceive the enrollment process without worrying about being punished.

As for students? If I do a tutor again, there are brown or black children sitting on the opposite side. They are worried that the Supreme Court will make them more likely to be rejected by the dream school. What suggestions will I give?

Remember, gaming racial problems is just a game, but so. Do not care about those people, they want you to believe that the donation amount of the Ivy League -it is equivalent to the nominal GDP of a not small country -the only path to happiness, success or race equality. Civil rights leaders endure the cold baptism of police dogs and fire water pipes. They do not want their descendants to become a risk capitalist and managers who graduate from Fujin School one day. Remember, Martin Luther Kim did not dream of establishing a multi -ethnic oligopoly politics. The "treasure trove of opportunities" he said was not just hidden behind a golden door at Yale University. There are other roads that do not need any games in life. Remember, I hope where you find yourself.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-30T05-49-27-00-00/000186102_piclink.jpg)Ten years ago, when I first sent the boss to elementary school, the day of picking up the child to the child was so far away. When I went to study in the UK in 2004, the part -time job of a Chinese doctoral student at that time was to help British families pick up and drop children to school. At that time, how could I think this was so important? Unexpectedly, I became a full -time mother, and this became my daily life in the past ten years.

The reasons worth recording in the past ten years are because my educational thoughts have gradually begun to change. The Chinese mothers who have never lost on the starting line. Mom -because I gradually got rid of the life of being held in responsibility, I entered a new life that enjoyed personal rights. Please note that this is not selfish. At the same time, British Primary School is more helpful for the writing of British society's fairness and justice in the past. Because the elementary school itself is a social institution full of love, especially care for disadvantaged groups, and equality.

Hong Kong director Zhou Guanwei, the documentary "Revolution of the Times" filmed when the Chinese Movement broke out, was welcomed at the Cannes Film Festival (Cannes Film Festival, Kangcheng Film Festival) and won the 58th Golden Horse Award for Best Documentary Award. However, the political risks brought by this have caused many investors to withdraw money. Zhou Guanwei had to use a new financing to complete the new film "1 Wedding".

Since 2021, the Hong Kong government has injected a total of 1.54 billion Hong Kong dollars to the Film Development Fund. In February 2023, the Hong Kong Cultural and Sports and Tourism Bureau emphasized that if the film violates the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District, the government will not allocate funding.

### U.S. equal rights bill: High court overthrowing the university's enrollment considerations of the cause of racial factors

June 30, 2023![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-30T07-20-53.000Z/_130200850_gettyimages-1504468742.jpg)Image source, getty images

** The US Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution banned universities from considering the applicant's racial factors during the enrollment process. This ruling has a milestone significance and has subverted the "Affirmative Act" (AFFIRMATIVEACTION, also known as support). **

This is one of the most controversial issues in the American education community. The Pingquanity Act was first included in the policy in the 1960s and was considered a measure to improve diversification.

The ruling of the High Court is suitable for all public and private universities in the United States. However, the most affected may be the famous Ivy League schools such as Harvard University, and tens of thousands of applicants are competing for hundreds of admission places each year.

The Supreme Court did not directly say that this ruling has overturned the legal rules of 20 years -that is, universities can consider racial factors in the overall efforts of establishing a diversified student group. But the impact may be very significant.

"The impact of this decision is much greater than the court's ruling." Stevevladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas, said, "In terms of all intentions and purposes It is impossible to consider racial factors. "

[Support or against Chinese people who are struggling to face Harvard's "discrimination against Asians"](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-45930984)* [The game of Yale University and the Ministry of Justice of the United States: Passion for enrollment and "reverse discrimination"](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-53775146)
###  Why do Asian people disagree with college enrollment?

Image adding text,

Harvard's admission data in 2018 shows that 22.9%of the freshmen are Asian students, and the proportion has increased year by year.

The two cases targeted at the US High School involved the recruitment of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. These two universities considers the racial proportion when enrollment. There is fairness. But opponents believe that this is a reverse racial discrimination.

The lawsuit of Harvard University was filed by a group of Asian American students. They claimed that Harvard's enrollment policy discriminated against Asians and underestimated their academic achievements and high scores.

Among the Asian groups in the United States, the "Equation Act" is one of the most controversial topics for a long time. Especially among the Chinese Americans who value the next generation of education, they often become their debate.

Supporters believe that the "Equation Act" can ensure that schools and companies avoid discrimination against minorities during the admission process, and Asians are also the beneficiaries of them. However, the opponents said that when Asians and African -American, Latin America and other ethnic minorities entered the candidate list at the same time, the bill tended to support the admission of other ethnic minorities such as African descent. However, many young generations of Asians believe that even so, the bill is to ensure the diversification of the student group, because Asian families generally only pay attention to children's scores, not diversified development.

Zhao Yukong, chairman of the Asian American Education Alliance, told BBC that he welcomed the high court's ruling. His organization believes that the equality bill has a negative impact on the probability of Asian and American students entering the elite school. "This decision will retain elite politics, which is the cornerstone of the American dream."

Judy Chu, a member of the California House of Representatives and chairman of the Asia -Pacific core group of Congress, said the cancellation of the equality bill "not victory."

She said: "For a few communities such as Asians, the admission of racial consciousness is unlikely to change the net number of Asians and Americans admitted to elite colleges, but from low -income, refugee or indigenous Asian students It will encounter more admission obstacles. This is why most Asians in the United States expressed support for racial consciousness. "

According to the study released by the research institution Pew Researchcenter on June 8, most (53%) Asians and Americans recognize the concept of "equal rights". But at the same time, the vast majority (76%) Asian people oppose colleges and universities in the process of enrollment as a consideration factors. Another study released on the same day showed that 50%of Americans opposed universities to consider race when enrollment. But 47%of African -American support this policy, and only 29%of white people also expressed support.

### Why is the US High Court ruled that the "equal rights bill" involved in race discrimination?

The ruling of the US High Court follows the ideological route, and a few liberal judges have different opinions.

The Supreme Court once again appeared sharp differences in ideology. The six conservative judges announced that this decision has taken a step towards a societyless society, and the quality of students will be measured by their achievements rather than race. The three liberal judges believed that this ruling ignored the discrimination of the United States for a long time.

In most opinions, John Roberts, the chief judge, will be directly linked to the university admission opinion in 1954 with a milematic Brown V Board Office. The case of Brown Education ended the racial isolation in the field of education.

"Elimination of racial discrimination means eliminating discrimination with racial factors," the Chief Justice wrote.

He said that universities cannot formulate an indefinite timetable for solving the problem of discrimination in the past. He refuted the explanation of Harvard University and North Carolina University to defend its policy. related.

Chief Justice wrote that the admission decision of university must be based on the applicant's personal experience and qualifications. But for a long time, many universities have the opposite.

"They mistakenly believe that it is not to defeat challenges, master skills or learn lessons, but their skin tone. Our constitutional history does not allow this choice."

The ruling once again reflected that the Supreme Court was exerting its strength to major social and political issues dealing with previous courts. Last year, the Supreme Court overthrew the protection of abortion and environment for a long time. Now, conservative judges have targeted the goal of college enrollment.

### In Liberal Judge, what reason does it oppose?Image source, getty images

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson published a harsh word.

The three judges appointed by the Democratic President condemned these rulings in the opinion, with a total of nearly 100 pages.

Soniasotomayor, a judge, wrote that this ruling "has always been important and continued to have an important impact, consolidate the superficial racial discrimination rules as the principles of the Constitution." She warned that this "the rules and major progress have been overturned for decades."

In history, Ketanji Brownjackson, Ketanji Brownjackson, the first black female judge in history. Regardless of race, it does not mean that the same is true in life. "

She also said: "Because the court and the country's actual experience are disconnected in the past and current experience, the court is now seduced to interfere (North Carolina University) and other colleges and universities to solve the problem of the real world of the United States."

After the High Court announced its ruling, US President Biden said "strong" opposition. "We can't make this decision a final conclusion," he said, "discrimination still exists in the United States."

### What will happen to American education?

Image adding text,

Harvard University in the world is one of the most competitive schools in the United States. Of the more than 40,000 applicants each year, only about 2,000 lucky children are admitted.

Although the court's decision is applicable to universities across the United States, nine states have taken measures to prohibit racial factors from considering the enrollment process of public universities. This may indicate the upcoming changes.

For example, California prohibits race -based "preferential treatment" in all government projects including public education 25 years ago.

Throughout the University of California, the number of representatives of ethnic minorities has declined, but the efforts of increasing diversity in other ways are still effective. The proportion of African -American and Spanish students currently recruited by the University of California Los Angeles is higher than that of the equal rights bill.

The Supreme Court stated in his opinion that applicants can still quote their race and discuss how the race "affects his/her life, whether it is discrimination, incentives, or other ways." Universities can find ethnic alternatives -such as economic disadvantages or geographical origin -to build a diversified student group.

However, how universities do this may be different from the state, depending on the conservative laws that the local politics and Republican "Red State" are passing, these laws prohibit the diversified promotion and participation projects of universities.

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The US Pentagon analyzed after several months that in February this year, the Chinese balloon that was shot down in its airspace did not collect information. Patryder, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense on Thursday (June 29), said: "Our current assessment believes that when the balloon passes through and fly over the United States, there is no collection (emotional)."

Rai De said the United States has taken action to avoid information collection of the balloon. "Of course, our efforts will help this." Lai De said that the United States knew that the balloon had the ability to collect intelligence.

On February 2 this year, the US Department of Defense notified the North American Air Defense Command detected [a flying object from Alaska invaded the United States and Canada's lead](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登-成功击落气球-北京-美方反应过度/a-64615212)Essence The United States suspected that the balloon detected the balloon in the high altitude of the balloon. After the predecessors, the air was in China. The Chinese side acknowledged that the floating objects are from China and are a civilian unmanned airship. On the afternoon of February 4, the U.S. military shot down the Chinese spy balloon over the sea in South Carolina. After salvage, several American intelligence agencies were tested and analyzed.

### US Media: U.S. technology used by Chinese balloons

In addition, Lai De did not confirm the previous reports of American media's use of American technology. However, Laide said that in the past, drones made in China have used ready -made American products purchased on the market.

According to a report published by the Wall Street Journal, several US defense intelligence agencies have found that this spy ball from China uses commercial equipment made in the United States on this spy balloon, and some of them can be purchased online. In addition, Chinese professional sensors and other devices are installed on the balloon, which can collect photos, videos and other information to be returned to China.

The report pointed out that these discoveries show that this balloon is performed on a spy activity, not a meteorological balloon used to observe meteorological as in China.

Officials participating in the investigation said that the balloon used ready -made and special equipment, which was a creative attempt by the Chinese government in monitoring.

The report pointed out that US officials believe that this spy balloon seems to be transmitted back to China for 8 days of data collected in Canada and the United States for 8 days](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國氣球能實時回傳信號美無法證實/a-65222124); Officials refused to disclose whether the aircraft failed.

The balloon incident exacerbated the further deterioration of Sino -US relations. The United States has condemned China to violate the aims of violations of international law. US Secretary of State Broskerer also canceled plans to visit China.

Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters. The U.S. military is trying to salvage more wreckage in order to more accurately understand the actual use of this flying object.

###  upgrade

After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the over -the -world of the US -Canada border.

He said in an interview: "We do what we need to do to protect our interests. We said what we need to say, and we also clearly expressed the content that should be expressed clearly to ensure that this situation no longer occurs. Therefore As long as it no longer happens, this chapter should end. "

However, on the same day, the US President Biden's campaign in California called the Chinese President Xi Jinping as ["Dedicated"] at a campaign fundraising event.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登称习近平为独裁者-北京公开的政治挑衅/a-65987541)Essence In his speech, he said: "The reason why Xi Jinping was particularly angry was that when I shot down the balloon filled with two spy equipment, he didn't know where it was. This was particularly embarrassing for dictators. What happened, it should not be its destination, because the wind has deviated from the route. "

This expression of Biden aroused great dissatisfaction in Beijing. The next day, Mao Ning, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference, "The United States' remarks are extremely ridiculous, irresponsible, seriously violated the basic facts, seriously violated diplomatic etiquette, and seriously violated Chinese political dignity. This strong dissatisfaction, resolute opposition. "

Brinken emphasized: "I told my Chinese colleagues during this trip that we will continue to do what you don't like, saying what you don't like, just like you will continue to do what we don't like, saying that you don't like what we don't like, saying that If we don't like it, the same. "

### Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

Blingken arrived in Beijing on the morning of June 18, arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in the afternoon to talk with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang. However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."

The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.

As can be seen from the photos, the US delegations led by Brinken were led by the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and a member of the Central Political Bureau and the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee. The personnel were wearing a mask, and the US personnel also put on the mask "with the customs" in addition to Blink. In March of this year, the picture reached by Beijing AIDS reached an agreement showed that in the three -party talks, all officials did not wear a mask, which was in sharp contrast to the picture of Beijing officials now meeting with Bollingken.

Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be on the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.

####  What details are eye -catching?According to usual, the US Secretary of State visits China, and Chinese leaders will meet with it. However, there are exceptions, such as when Plingken's former Pompeo visited China in October 2018, Xi Jinping did not see him. At that time, the Sino -US trade war had debuted, and US Vice President Pence had just delivered a tough speech on China. The relationship between the two sides was very tense. Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.

### Li Jiachao's first anniversary: The Pioneer and Inaction of Hong Kong Chief Executive

A year ago, Li Jiachao became the first Hong Kong Chief Executive from the police forces.

[July 1, 2022](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-61999062)**, in the Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition Center, before the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the President of China Xi Jin, Li Jiachao swore to serve as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and officially became the first chief executive from the police system. On the occasion of his full year, he has recently published an exclusive interview with Li Jiachao and the signature article of Li Jiachao. **

Most of these reports from the official media listed the "achievements" of the Li family in the past year. Zheng Yanxiong, the highest representative of the Chinese government in Hong Kong and the director of the Hong Kong China United Office, even said: "The former familiar and lovely Hong Kong is back."

However, the discussion of the people's geometry does not seem to be very enthusiastic. Yang Jianxing, a senior news editor of Hong Kong, recalled that in the past, every time the regime was transferred, there would always be a variety of civil society groups and other press conferences to comment on the administrative skills of the SAR government in the past year and put forward demands.

With the emergence of the new crown epidemic in 2020 and the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, the street struggle was almost extinct. In the following years, the Hong Kong Government continued to "transform" all aspects of society.

### Starting from Li Jiachao, all kinds of slogans

One year ago, Li Jiachao took multiple slogans to the stage, such as "targeting results". "There are many problems, but one day is solved, 365 in one year", talk about KPI (key performance indicators).

On the weekend of the first anniversary of his office, the Chief Executive's Office in social media [Published a two -episode review video](https://www.facebook.com/johnleekachiu/videos/1699987887114574/)And two more slogans.

Li Jiachao said: "I don't treat it from time to time, (the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government) is to chase time, results, and grades, so that the public feels that our policy is really benefited, and he has happiness and hope."

At the end of the film, Li Jiachao said with Huang Yiyuan, a special assistant to the Chief Executive's Office: "So we must fight for trust with action, draw closer distance, and condense mutual trust with grades."

Li Jiachao's "Bauhinia" in the Chinese central enterprise publication "Published a signature article](https://bau.com.hk/article/2023-06/25/content_1122537961240973312.html)It is said that its government has "focused on improving the level of governance" in the past year, "continuously enhanced development momentum", "effectively resolving the problems of the people's livelihood" and "common maintenance of harmony and stability", including the "minimalist public housing" plan, set up a "introducing key enterprises to introduce key enterprises "Office", "Talent Service Window", and launched the "High -end Talent Pass Plan" and so on.

In the past year, the Hong Kong Government has launched campaigns such as "Hello Hong Kong".

Zhong Jianhua said to BBC in Chinese: "Welfare can be said to have been mentioned, and workers can say nothing. The remaining is some large -scale development projects -'Tomorrow Lantau", the northern metropolitan districts- In fact, I can't see that there is any breakthrough progress, even the financing plan is still blowing. "Current affairs commentator Yang Jianxing feels that in order to take stock of the substantial political achievements of the Li family for more than a year, "not many things can be counted."

About a year and a half ago, Yang Jianxing, who was still the main author of "News", told the BBC Chinese: "In the past 12 months, the SAR Government has many actions, many slogans, many new things, many architectures, and many 'more' 'increased many' '' increased. Working group ', engage in many sports -the category of "Happy Hong Kong" -but very real things, for example, the economic recovery after the epidemic is slower than expected, and the stock market finance is not ideal. "

On the day before the establishment of the "July 1st" Special Economic Zone, the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index closed at 18916 points on June 30, down 17 points from the previous day, but fell 864 points from the first trading day in 2023, a cumulative decrease of 4.37%.

From the perspective of polls, Li Jiachao's support rate is not particularly high: Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Planning Monthly announced the monthly officials of the officials who announced in mid -June show that Li Jiachao's support rate is 44%; the polls announced by Sing Tao News Group at the end of June showed that the polls announced at the end of June. 57.6%of the citizen satisfied the work performance of the SAR government; the online poll released by the end of June at the end of June, "Hong Kong 01", with a full score of 10, Li Jiachao scored 5.2 points in the first year of administration.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-30T23-55-25.000Z/816)Li Jiachao said in an exclusive interview with the Hong Kong News Agency, which is affiliated to the official China News Agency: "The score is given by others."

Li Jiachao also said that he proposed in the first "Policy Report" published in October 2022 to recruit 35,000 overseas high -quality talents. The plan to come to Hong Kong for 49,000 people has been approved within five months after the plan. Beyond the indicator. According to Zhongtong News Agency, "data has confirmed the attraction of Hong Kong."

Li Jiachao also said to the official China Central Television: "In fact, after the customs clearance, 10 million (visiting Hong Kong) passenger customs clearance has broken through the first five months. Especially now the atmosphere is good, the consumption is particularly active, restaurants, tourist attractions are good, restaurants, tourist attractions The crowds are surging and very lively. And I see that citizens are much happier than before. "

However, there are also pro -establishment remarks that have questioned Li Jiachao's first year of administration.

Tu Haiming, deputy director of the Chinese CPPCC Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Overseas Chinese Committee, and the deputy dean of the "one country, two systems" of Guangzhou Jinan University, and the deputy dean of the Institute of Basic Law Research, in the "Letters" column, the Li Jiachao government said when the introduction of talents and recently announced the opening of some industries to introduce foreign workers: " Do not entangle the fine branches, focusing on the overall interests and long -term interests of Hong Kong, decisively decisively, and guilty.

However, Tu Haiming also said: "The current government improves people's livelihood to highlight the 'urgent sorrow of expectation', there is a remote move, and there is no dare to compliment, and it is necessary to add another force." It makes people "dare to compliment."

The article "Straits Times" column author and the convener of the Hong Kong Academic Research Institute Dai Qingcheng said: "If Hong Kong wants to maintain the advantages in international competition, it must continue to run or even double the pace, otherwise the original advantage will be lost. The film describes the world very fast, and if it does not enter, it will retreat, so "Hong Kong can't be slow, can't wait", is about the idea. The question is: What are the tricks of the Hong Kong government? "

### 凡

Dr. Zhong Jianhua said: "In the past year, I think the most prominent thing is to suppress civil society, and everything talks about Guoan."

"The more detailed it is, now even the school bidding meals must be added to the national security terms. What Li Jiachao does the most is to join the national security clauses in different links."

Li Jiachao said in an interview with Zhongtong News Agency: "I am a anxious person, but we must also be cautious ... Hong Kong is not just a problem of the epidemic. Our problems have accumulated more than any government. In 2019, the "Counterattack" demonstration), the Legislative Council dragged down the government's administration, and doubled. "

He also said to CCTV: "Our Hong Kong society is of course generally stable and very safe, but the destructive power will not relax in the context I mentioned just now, and they will continue."

On June 20, Li Jiachao said before attending the Executive Council's "July 1st" anniversary situation: "If anyone uses this opportunity to ride, or create a bad atmosphere or conduct destructive activities, we will definitely investigate The legal responsibilities of the relevant persons are not allowed to have similar things that are worth celebrating. "

Since the Chinese People's Congress promulgated the "Hong Kong National Security Law", the official public opinion of Beijing and Hong Kong repeatedly emphasized that Hong Kong has entered the stage of "Governance and Xun".

In the past few months, the Li Jiachao government put forward the saying "soft confrontation" from time to time to describe it as threatening China ’s national security acts. He also said that" not ingenious does not mean that it can not cause damage. "

In this context, it is commonly known as the "23 legislation" to the agenda again. Shen Chunyao, the director of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the National People's Congress, has stated at the time that Hong Kong must still complete the local national security legislation in accordance with Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, and to harm other national security acts in China.

Representatives in Beijing in Hong Kong expressed their recognition of these thinking: Zheng Yanxiong, director of the Liaison Office of the Chinese Central Government in Hong Kong, said on June 30 to attend the "July 1" celebration of the pro -government civil society group: "In retrospect, a few years ago, the grim facing the severe time before, The situation, compared to the new weather that guests gathered today and vitality, everyone has more soberly realized that Hong Kong can no longer be able to make mistakes, disrupt themselves, and can no longer be used and blinded.

"Everyone also sees more soberly.

As the "mask order" was completely canceled on March 1st, Hong Kong's restrictions on the implementation of COVID-19 in 2019 came to an end. The parade rally recovered, but there were also members of the original democratic group tried to apply for the "May 1" Labor Day parade, but withdrawing the application after being investigated by the police officer by the police of the police; The pro -government community rented a carnival meeting, and the police took many people away around Victoria.On the 34th anniversary of the "June 4th" incident, the Victoria Park in Hong Kong did not hold a candlelight rally for the fourth consecutive year. Many people were taken away by the police around the Park.

He also pointed out that on the eve of the "July 1st", private groups competing for the public in the media that the atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the government's governance is no longer existed. "In fact, it can reflect the low expectations of society (to the government)."

Another change of the political atmosphere may also be reflected in the polls of the Institute of Public Opinion: Civil Research announced in early June that "in response to the advice from relevant government departments after risk assessment", the "June 4th June 4th June 4th June 4th year of June 4th "Public opinion investigation, and then announced that it will cancel about four -piece regular investigation issues, and some of the remaining poll projects will also be switched to internal reference and paid services.

The Hong Kong Civil Research Announcement stated: "Relevant topics have initially included regression series, identity, cross -strait issues, world vision, June 4th incident, parliamental scores, troops civil hope, and some social indicators."

Zhong Jianhua, who was former president of the Hong Kong Civil Research Vice Administration, told BBC Chinese: "The investigation of the Democratic Research Office was persuaded by the National Security Department not to publish it, nor is it the first time." He was unwilling to further talk about the status of the Civil Research in Hong Kong.

Chen Jingxiang, a former editor -in -chief of the "letter" and a professor of the Department of Journalism of the School of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, also worried about this situation when he wrote a commented on Hong Kong's competitive advantage in the Ming Pao: "From 2020, what we see is The government's public power is continuously expanded, and the public's civil rights and freedom spaces are constantly narrowing. Obviously, this is a trend of driving on reversing, anti -modern civilization, which is very disturbing. "

Chen Jingxiang said: "In the past year, there is a saying that Hong Kong has begun to be" from governance and prosperity '. It is undeniable that since 2022, Hong Kong has gradually stepped out of the dilemma of social turmoil and people's hearts. The closed three years of closedness and international transportation have also been fully re -opened. But these are just 'rehabilitation' (recovering normal), everything starts from scratch; it is still far away from the flourishing and comfortable 'and unstoppable' Xing "."

### Social depression unsolved

Li Jiachao said that Hong Kong citizens were "more happier than before", and non -building commentators did not agree.

Yang Jianxing believes that since Beijing emphasizes "the power of comprehensive governance" in Hong Kong, Li Jiachao is the Hong Kong head of Hong Kong, who is "compared with Beijing".

Zhong Jianhua also said, "He is not performing, it is the performance that he should have as the chief executive in this situation now."

For Li Jiachao's "soft confrontation" with officials and officials, Zhong Jianhua believes that it does exist.

"You call on people to donate organs, people go to sign and no longer donate; you call people to stay in Hong Kong for consumption after getting 'consumer vouchers', which stimulates the Hong Kong economy. People take this money to travel to Taiwan and travel to Japan. Fighting 'is the headache of Li Jiachao. "

"Because the government has no appeal, it cannot re -establish people's trust in the current government."

Professor Zheng Guohan, the president of Lingnan University in Hong Kong, will retire. He recently asked media reporters that the SAR government "the most responsible" leads the society to "take the recovery road and promote social harmony". Should be immigrated to others.

Many Hong Kong media quoted Zheng Guohan and said, "You are unhappy here, you can't engage in" Hong Kong independence ". So he goes to a place that is more suitable for him and make the society less tension. You can change people. A lot of people who feel suitable come in. "

Zhong Jianhua, who is in the UK, believes that the "immigration tide" of Hong Kong, which has been continued for a while, will be the next wave of Hong Kong people who are older or even retired to leave with savings. He told BBC in Chinese that several friends who have recently received several friends who have come to Britain "travel roads".

Chen Jingxiang wrote in the Ming Pao: "After a big turbulent, the first government should do the first to rest with the people to restore the society to return to vitality. The return to Hong Kong in the second half of Hong Kong is very different in all aspects of politics, economy, society, and international connections. In the past, the successful equation is no longer used, and we need a new social contract. "

"The so -called new society contract is to deal with the current series of topics to be resolved, such as the gap between the rich and the poor, the stagnation of the government, the stagnation of the economy, the contradiction between the identity, and the relationship between the land and port. It can be solved that the government must lead intervention to make society distribution more fair. The government must work to build a society that is more stable and tolerant and can interact benign. "

Different from the official call, Yang Jianxing believes that Hong Kong is still in a state of depression. If the Li Jiachao government can make one or two real economic and people's livelihood development in the next year, it may improve the feeling of society. "But at present, you can not see such an atmosphere."

The Brazilian Higher Election Court voted on Friday (June 30) that the former President Bosonaro abused political power during his term, and prohibited him from competing as a candidate to compete for the Brazilian Federation, state and municipal elections as a candidate before 2030.

Xinhua News Agency reported that the ruling was mainly aimed at the relevant remarks and behaviors of Bosonaro during the election last year. In July 2022, the then President Bosonaro delivered a speech when he met a number of foreign ambassadors at the presidential residence, publicly questioning the credibility of the Brazilian election system, and said that there were fraud in the 2018 elections. The official Brazilian media broadcast the event that day.

Demois, chairman of the Brazilian Election Court and the Federal Supreme Court Justice, said that Posonaro released false news during the meeting and the 2022 election. Attacking the Brazilian election system, there are acts of abuse of political power.

#### Bosonaro considers appeal

After the results of the ruling were announced, Bosonaro said in an interview that this did not mean the end of his political career and would consider appealing to the Federal Supreme Court. He also criticized the High Election Court to restrict him, and said that he had been observing the constitution during his term.

In the presidential election held in October 2022, former President Lula defeated Bosonaro to be elected president again. In January of this year, a large number of Bosonaro supporters did not accept the results of the election, and they broke into the Brazilian national power institutions and conflict with the military police.

### Right -wing parties rose around Europe

** France is on the edge of crisis. **

This week, a 17-year-old boy from the French-Algerian family was shot and killed by the police near Paris. The riots spread to all parts of the country. From the suburbs (usually ignored by society), people held their breath.

This type of riots are not unheard of in France. But strong emotions swept the whole country, whether they were sympathized with the police or sympathy for the suburbs and the family members of the victims. Since the summer of 2005, this emotion has never appeared in France.

Although President Macron is obviously working hard to control the situation, his right -wing political opponent Marine Lepen has a tough position and anti -immigrant theory on security issues, which is likely to eventually benefit from polls.

Looking at the south, north, east, and west of Europe, you will see the extreme right -wing parties of different styles -nostalgia nationalism, populist nationalism, extreme conservatives with a new fascist source, etc. -are clearly recovering.

In 2016, the French National Front leader Marin Le Pen gave a speech at the National Front political rally held by Frejus.

It can be traced back to the ancient taboos of the devastating war of anti -Nazi and anti -fascist Italy in the 20th century -most voters believe that you should not vote to the right -wing, and the mainstream party refuses to cooperate with the extremely right -wing organization. This taboo is gradually eroding.

In 2000, I lived in Vienna. At that time, the right -wing for the first time with the Freedom Party of the Freedom Party. Become a headline news from all over the world. The European Union even imposed foreign sanctions on Vienna.

Now, the third -largest EU economy is led by Giorgiameloni, a leader in Giorgiameloni, who is a leader of a new fascist party. In Finland, after three months of debate, the Right -wing nationalist "Finnish Party" recently joined the United Government.

In Sweden, the "Swedish Democratic Party", which resolutely oppose immigration and multiculturalism, is the second largest party in parliament and supports the right -wing joint government.

Last Sunday, in Greece, three extremely right -wing parties won enough seats to enter the parliament. In Spain, the controversial nationalist party "VOX" (VOX) -since 1975 fascist dictator Francisco Franca The first successful right -wing party in Spain since the death of Franciscofranco -the performance in the recent regional elections exceeded everyone's expectations.

On May 21, 2023, the chairman of the "Sound of the People's Republic of China" San Diego Abaskal participated in a political rally in Laer City, Spain.

There are rumors that they may form a joint government with the Conservative Party after three weeks later.

Then there are Poland and Hungary's extremely conservative and dictatorship governments.

The list goes on.

Even Germany, which is so sensitive to its fascist history.

Police surveys show that the German "Alternative Selection Party" (AFD) in Germany is ahead of Prime Minister Schultz ’s“ Social Democratic Party ”(SPD), or it is on the same way. Last weekend, a German alternative selection of party candidates won the local leadership position for the first time. The Social Democratic Party calls it a "political dam."

In the end what happened? Is the millions of European voters really turned to the right wing? Or is this more like a protest vote? Or a sign of polarization between urban liberal voters and other conservative voters? What does it mean when we describe political parties as "extreme right wing"?

On June 25, 2023, in eastern Germany, Robert Sesselmann of Robert Sesselman of the East of Germany, RobD, was given a speech at the election activity.

Take a look at the tough attitude of some mainstream politicians, especially before the election, on the issue of immigration, such as Markrutte, the right Dutch Prime Minister of the Right -wing, or a security issue. Er Macron.

Mark Leonard, director of the European Foreign Relations Commission, said we are facing a huge paradox.

On the one hand, in recent years, many mainstream politicians have grabbed slogans or positions from the extremely right -wing hands, hoping to snatch their supporters. But by doing so, they helped the right wing look more mainstream.

At the same time, some of the extremely right -wing parties in Europe are intending to move closer to political centers, hoping to attract more intermediate voters.

Take an attitude towards Russia as an example. Many right -wing parties, such as the Italian Alliance Party, Marine Le Pen, France, and the Austrian Liberal Party, have traditionally have close relations with Moscow.

After the Russian President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, this situation became even more embarrassing, which led these party leaders to change their words.

Mark Leonard quoted the relationship between the right wing and the European Union as another example of their "centralization".

You may still remember that after the Brexit referendum in 2016, Brussels worried that there would be a Domino brand -French Brexit, Denmark Brexit, Italian Brexit and so on.

Many European countries had a populist party who had a strong doubt about Europe at the time, but over the years, these political parties have been obliged to stop advocating to withdraw from the EU and even withdraw from the euro.

For many European voters, this seems too aggressive.Image source, PA Media

Image adding text,

Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a speech at the Conservative Party Conference held by the Manchester Conference Center.

They studied Brexit's influence on the social and political influence of Britain (not to mention the heated economic impact). Many people concluded that withdrawal from the EU will lead to further unstable world of unstable world.

Think about it: The new crown epidemic is popular, and it is adjacent to the aggressive and unpredictable Russia. Worried about China, struggling to survive the cost of living, millions of European families are still undergoing the sequelae of the 2008 economic crisis.

Police investigations have shown that the EU is currently more popular among Europeans than in the past few years.

So far, the extremely right -wing party is talking about reforming the EU instead of leaving the EU. They are expected to perform strongly in the European Parliament elections next year.

Georginawright, director of the Institut Montaigne in Paris, told me that she believed that the rejuvenation of Europe's right wing stemmed from dissatisfaction with mainstream politics. For example, in Germany, one -fifth of voters say they are not satisfied with the coalition government.

Wright said that many European voters were attracted by the outspoken right of the extremely right -wing party. The three key areas of traditional politicians seemed to have no clear answer in the three key areas of life, which made people feel obvious:

1 \. Issues related to identity: Fear open borders and national identity and traditional values are eroded

2 \. Economy: The rejection of globalization and the descendants cannot guarantee that there is a better future resentment

3 \. Social justice: a national government cannot control the feeling of managing citizen life

You can see that these problems have also infiltrated European debate on green energy.

In the Netherlands, the "Farmer-CitizenMovement" of the right-wing populism this year, after the provincial election, he won the most seats in the parliament and became the headlines of major political parties.

In France, Macron tried to increase the price of gasoline to prevent people from driving, but it was opposed by the so -called "yellow vest" protesters, including extremely right -wing groups.

In Germany, the public's concerns about fiscal conditions and anger hindered the environmental reform that ruling the Green Party promoted its commitment.

"

On June 15, 2012, Xi Jinping ushered in his 70th birthday. Life is seventy years old. According to the unwritten rules of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Politburo formed by the Politburo formed by the Jiang Zemin era, Xi Jinping should have lived on the first birthday after retirement. We must take power for life until the dead. What is intriguing is that although the CCP's personal worship of Xi Jinping in recent years is no less than the personal worship of Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution, Chinese officials have hardly held any public events to celebrate the longevity -Xi Jinping seems to be unwilling to pay too much attention to people too much attention His age.

On the other hand, Xi Jinping was the leader of the Communist Party of China, the largest power of Mao Zedong. No veterans and factions can restrict him. It seems that he has power and do whatever he wants, but he is already internal and external. It is said that he broke his taboos and ran to the Wanshou Temple of the Royal Royal Temple of the Ming and Qing Dynasties to celebrate his birthday. This is probably a "rush" method when he was burnt. However, since no emperor can realize the dream of "longevity", Xi Jinping cannot "have no different birthday." Even if the name of Wanshou Temple is pleasing, it is also golden and brilliant, but the troubles that Xi Jinping encountered could not disappear without a trace on his birthday. Xi Jinping knew that his ruling crisis was heavy. In the political report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on October 16, 2010, he presided over the 20th Central National Security Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 30, 2010 In a meeting of a meeting, and in the speeches of Inner Mongolia on June 7, he repeatedly spoke three times on the same theme: China must guarantee that the national economy can run normally under the "extreme situation", and be ready to survive " The major test of the wind and waves and even the stormy waves. It can be seen that China, under Xi Jinping's rule, is not quiet for years, but the blind people ride blind horses and come to the deep pond in the middle of the night, and may break their bones at any time.

The official Chinese media did not dare to express it, but many Chinese netizens posted photos of Jiang Zemin's flood in the floods that were drowned in the disaster area on the day of Xi Jin's birthday. Jiang Zemin's clown is not worth nostalgic. This way of using Jiang to use Jiang is not brave resistance, but he can also be a little disgusting to learn. Interestingly, those who really care about Xi Jinping's birthday are not the 1.4 billion slaves under his rule, but the "father emperor" Putin, the most respectable "father". As early as four years ago, the day Xi Jinping and Putin met, it was Xi Jinping's birthday. Putin thoughtfully prepared a birthday cake with "Six Six Great Shun" in advance. Xi Jinping saw a gift, a flattering expression. On the same day of four years, Putin did not send cakes, but there was a congratulatory message: "Dear friend, I sincerely wish you good health, happiness, happiness, happiness, happiness, happiness, Repeated achievements: the national economy has grown steadily, citizens' wealth has increased, and Beijing's position in the world is getting stronger. "

Xi Jinping does not have to be affirmed by others. It only needs to be affirmed by Putin, a Russian dad. He only cares about Putin's evaluation of him alone. In the world, Xi Jinping and Putin are the same type, as British political critic Katie Straud said in the book "totalitarian gene": "Putin and Xi Jinping have been destroyed forcing them to end at the end of the term of office. The legal obstacles to step down, whether they retain the formal title, their rest of their lives will have power in Russia and China. "

Tao is voted for peaches, reporting to Li, three days later, Father's Day, there are tens of thousands of people on the Internet of China. They know that blessing Putin is blessing Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping and Putin are two grasshoppers on one rope. The Chinese Internet is covered with fake news that the Russian army is like a bamboo and winning in Ukraine. Such news may be more than in Russia. The Chinese learned that Russia had a "victory" and was even more happy than the Russians. Putin and Xi Jinping are embarrassed, and the Chinese pinks are recognized as the father.

** Mao Zedong is the emperor of Stalin, Xi Jinping is also the emperor of Putin **

Xi Jinping's worship of Putin is well known. Although Russia has declined and China's strength has risen, Xi Jinping has always bowed his knees and nodded in front of Putin. In fact, in front of the Soviet Union, not only Xi Jinping fell so much, "counting the characters, but also looking at the present" Mao Zedong.

In the book "Mao Zedong: Real Story", a historian Alexander Panzofu, who moved from Russia, quoted a large number of Soviet -Russian secret archives and revealed a historical fact that the CCP tried to cover up: the reason why the CCP can seize the regime is not because Mao Zedong Zedong The correct route or talent, but has paid money, contributes, and provides weapons from beginning to end. Panzov pointed out: "In the early 1930s, the Communist Party of China could not talk about independence and independence. Financial relying on Moscow completely. They may be at most that they may oppose the representative of the Communist International in China, but they dare not offend the Kremlin itself."

Mao Zedong stood out in the cruel internal fighting of the Communist Party of China, and the key code was still in Stalin. Panzov wrote: "Only by transforming the Communist Party of China into a Russian -style party (Stalinhua) centered on the leader, can the civil war with the Kuomintang in the future ensure victory. And completely suppressing the opposition in the party. In these respects, Stalin has rich experience and can help Mao Zedong. "Therefore, Mao Zedong knew his power sources and respectfully respect Stalin. He regarded it as a great mentor and seriously pursued Stalinism. In the early days of the Chinese Communist Party, the appointment and removal of Beijing's important personnel must be nodded by Moscow to take effect. Russia and China had no room for discussing. After the Communist Party of China was in power in 1949, Mao Zedong visited Moscow for the first time. Stalin didn't care about it for 30 days. Although Mao complained, he dared not go away. Panzov pointed out: "Stalin intentionally do this. He wants to humiliate Mao Zedong and give him a lesson, don't be high -toe. In fact, he is telling Mao Zedong that I can speak here. I am the great leader of the World Communist Movement. How do you follow the green onion? You are a elementary student under me. You have to do things according to my words. "Although the Communist Party of China challenged and attacked the Soviet Union with the aggressive "nine reviews" challenges and played the role of "uncle", the relationship between the master and servant between the two is still broken. Xi Jinping regarded the new thinking and democratic Gorbachev as a traitor, lamenting that when the Soviet Union disintegrated, "none of them were men", and Putin had a heart about this. When Putin began to regain the empire's heroic style, Xi Jinping also followed. Putin launched the war of aggression against Ukraine, and Xi Jinping stared at the foreplay of Chinese attacking Taiwan. This war helped Xi Jinping's pressure on the Western world, and Xi Jinping was grateful to Putin.

Putin was unfavorable and was trapped in the quagmire. Xi Jinping had a sense of sorrow of rabbit fox. Putin looked around the world, and the only allies of small fish and shrimp are only one of the few people such as Iran, North Korea, and Belarus, and the big allies are only China. As a result, Putin took the initiative to throw his winks at his fan Xi Jinping, celebrating Xi Jinping's birthday to show that the relationship between the two countries was like paint, and the two dictators also cherished each other. However, the two seem to be on the honeymoon. In fact, they have already been having ghosts. The palace under their feet has begun to fall apart. The day when the tree is scattered is coming. As scholar Feng Ke said in the "Road to the Division": "Those dictators surrounded by personal worship often enter their own world, and the followers around them make them more obsessed. They finally make decisions by themselves; they regard everyone as enemies in both domestic or abroad. It becomes pride and is suspicious, and wants to seek more power to protect the power in the hands. But because all this depends on their own judgment, a small misjudgment will also lead to the government's shake, bringing fatal consequences In the end, in fact, the biggest threat of the dictator not only comes from the people, but also from themselves. "

[ ![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-01T12-30-00Z/62313536_303.png)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66089541/62313536)This Friday is the third anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law. The law was approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on June 30, 2020 to announce the implementation of the day

(Voice of Germany Chinese) After the implementation of the controversial national security law for three years in Hong Kong, the city's appearance and feeling are very different. Prior to this, Hong Kong was known for his high autonomy and freedom of citizenship.

Since 2020, more than 100 people have been arrested and imprisoned for national security crimes. Many democratic parties and large -scale civil organizations have been dissolved, and the authorities are considered by the authorities as sensitive books and films.

The latest example is that the Hong Kong government applied for prohibiting the dissemination of the [protest song "Wish Glory Back to Hong Kong", which was popular during the 2019 campaign. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/願榮光歸香港禁案延后-全球港人串連合唱/a-65888826)The Hong Kong government, which is consistent with Beijing, insisted that after several months of protests in 2019, the National Security Law brought "stability" to Hong Kong.

However, some overseas Hong Kong activities told Germany that the law "completely destroyed" the freedom of all forms of Hong Kong and the freedom of most citizens.

"We have lost the freedom of legislation, we have lost the freedom of judicialness, we have lost the freedom of the chief executive officer. Now all formal protests are designated as crimes, and even soft expression such as movies and arts is now designated as Crime "Xu Zhifeng, a member of the former Democratic Legislative Council of Hong Kong and Xu Zhifeng, an exile in Australia.

![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-01T12-30-00Z/65124623_401.png)Chen Jialuo, a political scholar of Hong Kong Baptist University, told DW, "The Hong Kong Government has delineated a new red line to further strengthen control of all aspects of the city."

This huge change in Hong Kong began in arrest and detained well -known political activities and civilian activists, including 47 democratic activists and well -known media leaders such as Li Zhiying, the founder of Apple Daily.

The suppression has also expanded to other areas of civic society, including forced closure of independent media such as the Apple Daily and "Position News", as well as books on sensitive topics such as the Tianjiu Anmen massacre.

Maggie Shum, a political scholar at Pennsylvania, said: "This suppression is the autocraticization of the second level of daily life for civic society and penetrates into daily life."

KennethChan, a political scholar at the Hong Kong Baptist University, told Germany to commemorate the June 4th or non -governmental organizations or political groups, which have been banned in Hong Kong. He said: "The Hong Kong government has defined a new red line to further strengthen control over all aspects of the city."

Although the National Security Law was widely criticized, Lin Dingguo, the director of the Department of Justice of Hong Kong, said in a recent interview that the law did not affect the freedom of assembly of citizens.

Last month, when Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao was asked at the press conference, when the individual could publicize the June 4th and whether the candle of Yuwei Garden was driven away, it did not respond positively. Everyone must be responsible for their actions.

### "Back to China for the second time"

Chen Jialuo, Hong Kong Baptist University, said that with the rights promised by the "one country, two systems" in the past and the freedom to disappear quickly in Hong Kong, Hong Kong is now "the second return" China.

In 1997, Britain transferred Hong Kong's sovereignty to China.

Chen Jialuo said that Hong Kong's major institutions are full of members of Beijing, and Hong Kong judicial systems known for a long time are also facing increasing pressure. He told Germany's voice: "We are losing the power balance and democratic guardrail that have been possessed before Hong Kong, and replaced it with more top -down control networks."

In 2021, Hong Kong passed amendments to the election system, allowing the agencies of pro -Beijing to appoint most members of the Legislative Council, and also required all candidates to pass the review procedures controlled by the pro -government committee.

In April of this year, the Hong Kong government announced that the scope of election reform expanded to most seats by direct elections to produce district councils.

In terms of judicial, the new interpretation allows the Guoan case to be tried by the government's appointed judge. The Legislative Council passed the amendment in May to give the Hong Kong government's power to prohibit overseas lawyers from dealing with national security cases.

Maggieshum, a political scholar at Pennsylvania, believes that China's "tough movement" and "very successful" in China's suppression of any signs of objections in Hong Kong. She told the Voice of Germany: "The Hong Kong government now expressed that she hopes to fill in the loopholes in the law through the completion of the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law."

(Voice of Germany) ** "Frankfurt Report" ** (["How do Germany need Germany?](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/wie-sehr-braucht-peking-berlin-kommentar-zur-chinapolitik-18985983.html)"For the title, publishing comments pointed out that [Germany was dealing with China](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中关系/t-62235618)Don't be too humble, because Beijing still needs to be in Berlin in many aspects.

"In view of the high -spirited gesture of the Chinese government, governments of various countries are facing a problem: how much may there be to protect their own interests when dealing with China. There are many possibilities in theory. For example Falling enough bread dandruff to preach the results to the people of the country. Faced with such a approach, Beijing will be treated with a friendly attitude. "

"If anyone thinks that they have enough ability, they can also actively criticize China's worthy of piloting and ask Beijing to change. Although China will say" extreme dissatisfaction 'and fight back in words, it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting, but it will be fiercely fighting. The strength of the counterattack depends on the critics itself has multiple weights in the balance of international politics. Of course, Beijing cannot make concessions to critics, because once the Communist Party allows the pace of transition to democratic systems, it may lose the foundation of governance. . For Xi Jinping, the disintegration of the Soviet Union is a nightmare. He must stop similar events at all costs to happen in 'own'. "

### Interview: By separation of risk? The key depends on how to define

"German diplomacy always avoids aggressive and active gestures. This strategy can usually work. How to deal with China has existed at least when building diplomatic relations in Germany. What is the feet? Stupid provocation of interests? Compared with many other countries, Germany has the advantages of economic powers. Germany can still provide a lot of things to China. At least in theory, Germany has the ability to impact Beijing It depends on the specific situation. "

"Today, [Some people are calling for a large -scale decoupled with China](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国幻想的破灭/a-66033341)And pointed out that it is to Russia's energy [dependence](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/智库-德国在某些领域严重依赖于中国产品/a-65986796)Similarity. Some people think that the risk of diversified operations is sufficient. In this dispute, people ignored one thing: China is actually trying to decompose. Beijing hopes to achieve independence in the field of as much as possible and want to control all key technologies in the economy and military fields. To some extent, it can be said that Xi Jinping is making a very difficult decision for the German government: how to build a relationship with China? When talking about the reason for independence, the Chinese like to emphasize the history of being forced to rely on colonial power in the past, and said that all this must not be repeated. In Germany's public opinion, this kind of argument about colonial imperialism is also very understandable. "

"However, when dealing with China, the German political circles don't have to worry about another common risk. Many other countries governments will play 'Nazi cards' to Germany when they encounter trouble, because this always stimulates the sensitive nerves of Germany. The German political circles have carried the "never reappear Nazi history '' in their bones. But in the clearing of the historical issues of the Cascus, the Chinese regarded Germany as a model country, because Beijing often compares Germany and the" Hohhuman "Japan. The latter is indeed indeed. There is a lot of room for improvement. "

Although the Indian population has surpassed China to become the world's number one in the world this year, this South Asian country has lagged behind in the economy and military fields in the past 30 years, so that relying on allies must be strengthened to ensure its own safety.

"Russia was a traditional military alliance in India during the Cold War, but after a series of incidents such as the Russian and Ukraine War, Russia had severely weakened to depend on China, so it was almost unlikely to help India again. Therefore, India is inevitably unavoidable Seek to the United States. "

"The United States also needs to be in India. Washington is trying to withstand China's dominant demand, which depends on regional allies.

In addition, this is not the first time that the United States has "retired" on the issue of climate change. In 2001, Bush also announced that the United States had withdrawn the "Kyoto Protocol" shortly after taking office.

### "Retirement Group" behind

The United States has repeatedly withdrawn from international organizations and agreements, and analyzes are summarized as "exitism", and a question mark on Washington's diplomatic sincerity. However, this attitude of "not being an international organization" and "priority to the United States" have received the support of many domestic voters in the United States. After all, even if "retreat", the United States is still the number one economy in the world, and it is global multilateralism.

Milly, chairman of the joint meeting of the United States Staff, said that with the continuous development of war technology, the U.S. military must accelerate the pace of modernization in order to compete with China and let Chinese leaders feel that the time has not arrived when considering the attack.

Mili said on Friday (June 30) at the National Journalist Club in Washington that China is seeking to rewrite the rules -based international order and build a powerful army. The century surpassed the United States.

He emphasized that the U.S. military must accelerate the pace of modernization, because the fundamental situation of the war is changing significantly. If the U.S. military does not make adjustments, it will not be able to have a army that can respond to the future combat environment. He believes that as long as the United States and allies can maintain their military advantages and improve and modernize when necessary, Beijing can promote Beijing not to make decisions of invading Taiwan.

#### Two World War is about 150 million people died in the war

Milly said that the rules -based international order was established by the generation of paratroopers to ensure that the war of great powers will not happen again. From 1914 to 1945, about 150 million people died during the war during the First World War and World War II.

"This is the most violent 30 years in human history. It is a war initiated by the great power."

"In the past 30 years, the two continents were destroyed and millions of people were killed. The number of refugees was more than at any time in history. The systemic races of the entire nation and religious communities were extinct. Of course, there were two nuclear weapons. This is a global war. No matter what standards measured, this is a slaughter field. In 1945, the world collectively stated that this kind of thing must not happen again. "

The peace established by this framework has been maintained for nearly 80 years. Milly said it has proved its value, but the rules -based international order is now facing tremendous pressure. He said: "Especially in Russia, it illegally invaded Ukraine, which is a direct positive attack on rules -based international order." "The invasion has lasted for more than a year. The courage and tenacity of the Ukraine people really inspired all of us. "

Countries around the world are united on the side of Ukraine and have been providing it with the ability to defend the country. "We said that our political leaders have said many times that our task is to ensure that Ukraine needs support to maintain freedom and independence. We do this to ensure that the rules -based international order can be maintained."

Milly said that China is seeking to rewrite these rules around the world, although China may be the biggest beneficiaries of these rules. "As we all know, the Chinese economy has been growing rapidly in the past 40 years, and now it is using its financial strength to establish an extremely powerful army."

Milly said that Chinese leaders have stated that they hope to "become an overlord in Asia in the next 10 years and hope to surpass the global military strength of the United States in the middle of this century." "The history of the geographical strategy of this century is likely to depend on US -China relations, and whether the US -China relations continue to compete or trigger a great country war."

Markmilley Chairman Markmilley said on Friday that there is still time to discourage Beijing not to use force to force Taiwan and mainland China to unify. He said that although a well -known plan is to ask the Chinese army to prepare for invasion of Taiwan before 2027, there is no sign of indicating that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made such a decision.

Comprehensive international media reported on the 1st, Mili in Washington National News Club(NPC)To the audience, this allows the United States and other countries to have time to show Xi Jinping's use of force will be a bad idea. He said, "Make sure that President Xi wakes up every day and said that it is not(Attacking Taiwan)On that day, the decision would never come. "

However, some officials and analysts expressed concerns that Russia's invasion of Ukraine would promote Beijing's risk of war against Taiwan. Others warned that China may learn lessons from Russia's failure.

Milly said on Friday that as long as the United States and its allies can maintain their military advantages in China and upgrade, update and modernization when necessary, they can convince Beijing not to attack Taiwan. This military advantage in the West is constantly shrinking.

"The faster our movements, the faster we can maintain the military advantage, so I believe that the theory of this situation is that we are more likely to stop war. If the war really happens, we will win Essence

He also refuted how the United States currently handle Chinese and Taiwan affairs, saying that the United States and its alliances have the ability to support Ukraine and Taiwan, although some demands overlap in weapon systems and ammunition.

"This is not a zero -sum game. That's not the case," Mily said. He also added, "There are other allies and partners to help Taiwan. It's not just the United States."

What makes the situation more complicated is that the Chinese military leaders refused to talk to the U.S. military.

Earlier this week, officials in the Chinese Embassy in Washington called on the United States to abandon sanctions against China as a prerequisite for negotiations between the two armies. Pentagon officials rejected the request on Thursday.

U.S. officials said they will continue to retain the possibility of talks between the United States and China forces and say that this communication is critical to prevent misunderstandings that may cause conflicts. Mily also mentioned this on Friday. He said, "The geographical strategy history of this century is likely to depend on US -China relations, that is, whether the two countries maintain a competitive state or fall into the war."

The local disaster management department said that the factory had a fire instead of explosion, and acknowledged that the fire police involved chemicals, and the cause of the fire was unknown. It is reported that Qiantai New Materials Co., Ltd. had found a "administrative penalty" by the Yingtan Municipal Emergency Administration because of the supervision and inspection of administrative law enforcement officers at the scene in 2022.
