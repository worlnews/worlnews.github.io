Can't see the development trend of diversification of import channels at all</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In 2022, Germany imported from China to the highest level of history. "In some products areas, this is quite dangerous -because China is almost dominant in the market of these products." The latest research report released by the German Institute of Economics (IW) pointed out that especially some raw materials, chemical raw materials and electronics Components, almost no other suppliers can be found except China.</p>
<p>The German government calls for <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国对华经济依赖持续加深-问题出在哪/a-65259582">German Economic Circles to reduce dependence on China</a>Essence But for many industrial enterprises and export -oriented enterprises, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国市场不可替代/a-65198442">China is an extremely important market</a>Essence Chinese Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567">Li Qiang visited Germany this week</a>And the Prime Minister Salz and his cabinet members held a German -Chinese government consultation.</p>

<p>However, according to the observation of the German Institute of Economic Research, in recent years, new development trends have appeared in Germany and China trade exchanges: "More and more commodities from China to Germany, but in the contrary, Germany's export growth has almost fallen into it. Stagging. "Researchers at the agency found the types of products imported from China.</p>
<p>Taking the data of 2021 as an example, in the 298 products worth more than 10 million euros, more than 50%of the imports from Germany came from China. In 2022, 211 of these products increased significantly.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Institute of Economic Research, in the fields of laptops, magnets, keyboards, and vitamin C, magnesium and caffeine, products imported from China occupy particularly high. "Generally speaking, in the fields of some raw materials, chemical raw materials, and electronic components, the influence of China's influence can be observed." In these fields, the development trend of diversification of import channels is currently not seen.</p>

<p>Researchers pointed out that when certain products are indispensable for enterprises, and in the visible future, it is almost impossible to be replaced by other suppliers' products, such a development trend is quite dangerous. In this case, Germany will fall into a dangerous dependence.</p>
<p>The author of the research report of the German Institute of Economic Research also said that it is not a topic that is completely decoupled with China or farewell to China. "As for which areas exist in such danger, the company should find them out with the support of politics now." Otherwise, the so -called risk of de -risk is just empty words. "</p>

<p>Description: A new research report shows that due to the warming of the climate, by the end of this century, 75%of the total glacier volume in the Himalayan mountain area of Xingdu Kush/Himalayan may be discharged. This will cause the local 240 million residents to face the threat of floods and droughts.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Studies by a team of international scientists show that ice and snow in the Himalayas are accelerated. According to the assessment of the International High Mountain Development Center (ICIMOD) located in Kandu, Nepal, in the 2010s, the melting speed of ice and snow in the region increased by 65%compared with the previous decades.</p>
<p>"We are losing glaciers, and these glaciers will no longer exist after 100 years," said the center's environmental scientist and reporter Philippus Wester.</p>
<p>Xingdu Kush/Himalayas stretch 3,500 kilometers, crossing 8 countries in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that if the temperature increases by 1.5 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees Celsius compared with the previous industrialization era, by 2100, the glaciers in the entire region will lose 30%-50%of its original volume.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球冰川消融速度正在加快/a-57375682">Glacier melting</a>The most depends on its specific location. If the temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius -this is the result of the current global climate policy, if it continues to continue, the eastern section of the Himalayas, the glaciers in Nepal and Bhutan to the end of this century will lose 75%of its volume.</p>
<h3>The flood of the Himalayan Glacier Fracture and Roaring Broke in the Indian Dam</h3>
<h3>The source of water from 200 million people in Asia</h3>
<p>There are 240 million residents living in the Kush-Himalayas. The glaciers of this area are also the origin of the world's top 10 rivers, including the Ganges, India, Mekong, Yellow River, Yangtze River, Ilova River, etc. The total population of these large river basins is as high as 1.65 billion, agricultural irrigation, food, energy and energy, and Economic development depends on the above rivers.</p>
<p>Izabella Koziell, deputy director of the International Gaoshan Development Center, said that the water source of 200 million people in Asia rely on these glaciers and snow. Once this ice circle is lost, the consequences are "unimaginable".</p>
<p>The report pointed out that the flow of 12 rivers that originated in the region may reach its peak in the middle of this century. "Although it sounds more water, because the melting speed of glaciers is accelerating ... However, water often appears in the form of floods, not stable water flow." West said that after the peak of traffic passed, the flow of traffic passed the past past past passed. The amount of river water will become less and less.</p>
<p>At present, many residents in high mountain areas use glacier water and snow melting to irrigate crops. However, the time of snowfall becomes more unstable and less and less. This situation is also very unfavorable to the animal husbandry. Some locals have moved from mountain villages to other places to make a living. The melting of the two large amounts of ice and snow constitutes a danger to the settlement of downstream.</p>
<p>Experts said that this situation highlights "the need for emergency action to protect the climate," West said. "Each small increment will have a huge impact. We really need to make efforts in slowing climate warming ... This is our urgent request."</p>

<h3>Bula Maptera River</h3>
<p>China and India are facing the dilemma of reduced water resources. In October this year, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Indian Prime Minister Singh jointly signed the "Memorandum of Understanding of the Cross -border River Cooperation for the Ministry of Water Resources of the Sino -Indian Water Resources". But this memorandum of understanding obviously does not solve all conflicts. The Brahmapra River is called the Yarlung Tibetan River in China. China plans to build multiple dams in the upstream section of this river, which may pose a threat to Indian fisheries.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The longest river in China has become a drainage ditch in some stream sections. Industrial wastewater, agricultural wastewater, and various types of garbage were dumped into the Yangtze River. The Three Gorges Dam built in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River can prevent flood disasters, provide electricity and energy, and provide convenience for shipping and transportation. But this huge project caused nearly 2 million immigrants.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) El Niopy is a natural phenomenon that changes the global weather model. After a lapse of four years, the soil coming back, which may exacerbate the high -owned food inflation.</p>
<p>Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Forecasting Center stated that the El Nino phenomenon already exists and is expected to "gradually strengthen" in the next six to nine months, which will bring a new extreme weather period to most regions of the world. Essence</p>
<p>"(The phenomenon of Qiang El Niini again) is quite likely.")) Professor Ququ(Harald Kunstmann)Said, "If this happens, it can be expected to have extreme climate and abnormal phenomenon that is usually accompanied by this phenomenon."</p>
<p>The Name of Elnino's phenomenon comes from Spanish Elniño (boy), which refers to the phenomenon that the East Pacific seawater will be abnormally heated every few years. It has promoted the floods of the Americas, tropical storms in the Pacific Ocean, and brought drought to many parts of the world, including southern Africa.</p>
<p>These natural disasters have severely damaged fisheries, agriculture, and other economic departments, and they also exacerbate the impact of climate change. In 2016, the El Nino phenomenon caused the hottest year since the record, and scientists worry that it may lead to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界气象组织警告未来五年将创下最热记录/a-65668526">global temperature reached a new high</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-25T-19-24-00Z/50271414_401.jpg" />The El Nino phenomenon brings flood disasters to some areas</p>
<p>Earlier this month, researchers at the EU Copenie Climate Change Service Center found that the global surface temperature increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the first time before industrialization, and this was the future temperature limit of the 2015 Paris Climate Summit reached a consensus.</p>
<p>"In June, the heating of 1.5 degrees Celsius is not the same as small." Questerman told Germany. "We may soon exceed this threshold, not only for a few weeks, but also a longer period of time."</p>
<h3><strong> El Nino phenomenon brings huge economic losses </strong></h3>
<p>Even after the most extreme weather passed, the economic impact caused by El Niopy's season will often continue.</p>
<p>According to the study of Dartmouth College, after 1982-83, the economic impact lasted for five years, with a total loss of approximately $ 4.1 trillion (3.7 trillion euros).</p>
<p>Researchers said in a paper published in the American "Science" magazine that after the El Niopy season in 1997-98, global economic growth has suffered $ 5.7 trillion.</p>
<p>Cricaham, a doctoral student of the ecosystem and social project of Datmouth College(Christopher Callahan)Said: "We can say certain that social and economy will never recover quickly after being hit." He said that after the El Nino phenomenon, growth may be affected by 14 years or even longer.</p>
<p>Researchers at Datmouth College found that the El Niopy phenomenon from 1982-83 and 1997-98 led to the GDP of the United States in 1988 and 2003(GDP)A drop of about 3%. Agriculture such as Peru and Indonesia accounted for 15% of the country's GDP, and the GDP in 2003 dropped by more than 10%.</p>

<p>In northern China, the temperature in many places has exceeded 40 ° C in many places, making many people "so hot to doubt life." Ren Gaorong, deputy director of the China National Climate Center, stated on June 2 that the highest temperature measured by 446 meteorological stations in China in May has reached or broke through the historical pole value of May. The demand for air conditioners has increased, and the country's power grid is under tremendous pressure.</p>

<h3>Bangladesh: Water can carry boats and can cover the boat</h3>
<p>Bangladesh is one of the countries with the worst affected by climate disasters in the world. The children in the picture are in the Buriganga to reduce heat.

<p>"Economic impact is firstly fisheries. The industry suffers huge losses due to the rise in ocean temperature." Qukinsman told Germany, "Then it will attack large agricultural areas in Africa, South America and even North America. If the harvest is not good and the infrastructure is damaged due to the storm, the insurance industry will be affected. "</p>
<h3><strong> Food and energy prices may rise sharply </strong></h3>
<p>The model released by Bloomberg Economic Research Company this week found that the previous several times of El Niopy led to nearly 4 percentage points in the price of non -energy commodities, and oil prices rose 3.5 percentage points, which weakened global food safety.</p>
<p>Bloomberg found that the inflation rate in Argentina and Brazil was about 0.75 percentage points higher, and the inflation rate in the Philippines and India was half a percentage point.</p>
<p>Worried that the El Nino phenomenon may be the most warmed and caused the highest loss in history. Analysts believe that it may also extend the high inflation of food.</p>
<p>The peak of prices after the new crown epidemic may have passed, but it may take several years to return to the 2%inflation target set by the United States and the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>Germany's largest private loan institution Germany said in a research report last week that more and more warnings about the phenomenon of Elnino have led to a significant increase in the prices of coffee, sugar and cocoa in recent weeks. As the harvest is affected by bad weather, other food prices are expected to follow up.</p>
<p>"(Price increase) may have a particularly negative impact on emerging markets. In emerging markets, foods usually account for at least one -third of consumer expenditure. The geographical location of them is more vulnerable to climate change such as floods, and their geographical location El Nino increased this possibility, "Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.</p>
<p>In India, agriculture is the cornerstone of the economy, and the annual monsoon is essential for grain production. Indian Reserve Bank President Das(Shaktikanta Das)Recently, it said: "Close and continuous attention ... absolutely necessary, especially when the expectations of monsoon and the impact of the El Nino phenomenon are still uncertain."</p>

<p>In terms of military, Ukraine has not achieved the expectations so far. Before the end of the war, it was confirmed that Ukraine could not join NATO, because it was necessary to avoid dragging all countries in NATO into the war (see ["Can Ukraine join NATO in the future: Can Ukraine join NATO?"(https://www.ftchinese.com/story/001099910?archive)To.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) polls can transmit public views and intuitively reflect public opinion in real time, but reflect the "instantaneous" state at the time. The Voice of Germany compared the results of the polls involved in the "American people on the Chinese view of China", which has been conducted by Gallop for many years. The results may reflect how American society views the international status of China and its geopolitical impact on the US geopolitical impact on the United States. Essence</p>
<h3>overall observation</h3>
<p>Gallop has investigated the overall view of the United States in China in the questionnaire since 1979. This year, the two countries have just established diplomatic relations. At that time, 64%of the respondents held a positive view of China and only had a negative view of only 25%. However, in the next few years, the situation has changed. In 1985, the proportion of Americans who held positive views on China fell to 38%, and the respondents with negative views rose to 51%. From 1984 to 1985, the heads of state and government head of state and government visited for the first time. Since then, the official interaction and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides have become more active, and the Americans have significantly improved China's perception of China.</p>
<p>After the Tiananmen incident in 1989, the US officials imposed sanctions on China, and the people's perception of China also reversed. During the year, the proportion of respondents holding a positive view of China fell from 72%to 34%of the negative views from 13%to 54%. Over the years, the proportion has been kept in a stable range, and 45%to 60%of the respondents holding negative views.</p>
<p>In recent years, the US -China relations have declined, and the image of China in the international community has been created, which is also reflected in polls. Since 2018, interviewees with negative perceptions in China have continued to rise sharply, reaching a new high of 79%in 2021, and the proportion of people with a positive perception of China has fallen to 20%. The questionnaire results in 2022 are consistent with 2021.</p>
<h3>Who is the largest enemy in the United States</h3>
<p>Another long -term survey results show that in the past 10 years, since Xi Jinping's main administration, Americans have increasingly felt that China has pose a threat to the United States.</p>
<p>For "Which country is the largest enemy in the United States?" In this issue, 18%of the respondents thought it was Russia in 2015, and 15%thought it was North Korea. %And 9%.</p>
<p>After 2018, the proportion of people in the United States as the number one hostile to the United States began to rise steadily, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/盖洛普美国人对中俄好感度创新低/a-56761933">2021</a>Increased to 45%, surpassing Russia (26%), and for the first time before other options. In 2022 and 2023, 49%and 50%of the respondents believed that China was the largest enemy in the United States.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Strait conflict risk awareness increases</h3>
<p>In February this year, the Associated Press and the Chicago "National Public Opinion Research Center" (NORC) in the United States <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/民調多數美國人嚴重關切中國影響力/a-64806510">polls</a>Also show that Americans have serious attention to China (60%of the respondents) have more concerned about Russia (53%).</p>
<p>Specific to threatening methods and degrees, Gallop's questionnaire in 2023 shows that 66%of the respondents believe that China's military power constitutes a "key threat" to the United States. The relevant proportion is 39%and 46%, respectively. In 2023, 64%of the respondents believed that China's economic power constituted a "key threat" to the United States, and 30%believed that they were "important threats", and in 2015, 40%and 44%were respectively.</p>
<p>For the "Taiwan Strait conflict threatens the interests of the United States?" In 2023, 47%of the respondents believed that this would be "key threat" (23%in 2004). "(51%in 2004).</p>

<h3>wreckage</h3>
<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters. The U.S. military is trying to salvage more wreckage in order to more accurately understand the actual use of this flying object.</p>

<h3>tool</h3>
<p>The U.S. military uses special equipment such as underwater drones to search and salvage balloon wreckage.

According to the U.S. military, the search area is about 2.25 square kilometers.</p>

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the over -the -world of the US -Canada border.</p>

As the two major economies in Asia, China and Japan are both similar in economic development and essentially different. The analysis of the same and difference of the Sino -Japanese economy is not only the academic hotspot that the theoretical world is concerned about, but also helps market players and policy makers to optimize long -term strategic choices.</p>
<p>From the entry of the empirical relationship between population structure and economic growth, China and Japan exist in the historical evolutionary stage: Japan in 1990 and China in 2020 in 2020, in terms of the static ratio and dynamic direction of the population structure, they are also high. With a long -term challenge of population aging. From the historical data of major global economies, including Japan, there is a non -linear correlation between the population structure and economic growth. The aging of the population structure will cause economic growth to slow down. However The characteristics of evolution, the ratio of labor to the elderly population has two important data barriers. When this proportion drops to about 7.5 and 4.8, the economic growth rate will move down twice. With the key indicators of China's population structure crossing these two data barriers in turn, China's economic slowdown will be a natural objective trend. Although the deceleration is irreversible, it is still available.</p>

<h3>Wagner's rebellion ended Russia and Ukraine and even the world?</h3>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Yofgen Nihogojin</p>
<p><strong> Russia has experienced chaotic and dramatic episodes. In more than a day, Wagner's mercenaries launched a rebellion and marched towards Moscow, and then the rebellion ended unexpectedly. </strong></p>
<p>Let's briefly review what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Friday (June 23), Wagner's leader Yofgeni Porigin (Porigen, Yevgeny Prigozhin) accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu, saying that he launched the Ukrainian war. It is to obtain military merit. * Subsequently, Poriger vowed to say that he would march for "justice" and accused the Kremlin of launching missiles to his troops on the same day. * After Porigo's announcement of armed rebellion, Moscow strengthened defense measures in the evening on Friday. * On Saturday, Porigo said that his 25,000 troops under the Emperor Ukraine crossed the border and entered Russia in the early morning. Mayor of Moscow announced that it is taking counter -terrorism measures to strengthen security. Rostov-on-Don, Rostov-on-Don, a city of southern Russia, was about 100 kilometers away from the East border), and residents were told to stay indoors. * Shortly before 8 am in Moscow time (1 pm Beijing time), videos circulating on the Internet show that Priegojin appears in the headquarters of the southern Military Region of Russia. * Russian President Putin delivered a TV speech at about 10 local time to condemn the "adventure of sin" and warned that punishment should be punished. * On this day, the Wagner Force promoted to Moscow along the M4 highway, and also seized the military facilities of Voronezh. * Just at 8:30 pm in Moscow time, Porigin said on his Telegram channel that he had agreed to "stop" the operation of his troops. * Belarus revealed that the country's leader Lukashenko has been holding talks with Pleigo, and Putin also agreed with the dialogue between the two. * At around 11 pm (4 am Beijing time), the Russian official media reported that Pryigin will leave Russia and go to Belarus. Criminal allegations against him and his troops will be revoked</li>
</ul>

<p>24 hours after chaotic, Moscow ushered in a new day. On Sunday, the military rebellion against Moscow had passed.</p>
<p>The BBC reporter interviewed on the streets of Moscow on Saturday. Several people said that they were not worried about the Wagner Group, although they were still on the way to Moscow.</p>
<p>A Moscow told the BBC that they "haven't seen any tanks yet, so we won't worry."</p>
<p>Another person said that in 1991, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and during the Constitutional crisis in 1993, they experienced tanks on the streets of Moscow, so "we will survive no matter what happens today."</p>
<p>A woman named Galina told Reuters that "this is not scared of this. I have confidence in our president and our people."</p>
<p>But another resident Nikolai said the incident was "fearful". He told Reuters, "This is very disturbing, and this is the case for you and your loved ones."</p>
<p>At present, the threat to entering Moscow has passed, but the safety situation is still tight. The order that residents stayed at home on Monday this Monday were still executed.</p>
<p>The Institute of War (ISW), located in Washington, said that the rebellion of Porigjin may have disappeared, but the Kremlin is now facing a "extremely unstable" situation.</p>
<p>ISW analysts wrote: "The rebellion exposed the weakness of the Russian security forces, showing that Putin was unable to use his troops to eliminate internal threats in time, and further eroded his monopoly on military forces."</p>
<p>This analysis also pointed out that the soldiers of the Wagner Group were warmly welcomed by the Rostov residents on the Rosteov on the River on the River.</p>

<p>As a part of the transaction, Porigerin has been allowed to go to Belarus, and the Kremlin said he would revoke all his allegations to him.</p>
<p>Lukashenko's news office said the negotiation was under the consent of Putin.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, the Kremlin agreed to revoke his prosecution against the leaders of the Wagner Group, and also provided security guarantees to the Wagner soldiers.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has been using Belarusian territory to attack Ukraine, which has effectively harmed Belarus's sovereignty.</p>
<p>The weakening of Putin's control of power has threatened Minsk's Lukashenko regime, which seriously depends on Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin News Secretary Dimitri Peskov said that Wagner's mercenaries can sign the Ministry of Defense Contract, and soldiers participating in the rebellion will not be prosecuted.</p>

<h3>Is this the ending of the Pryopin and Wagner Group?</h3>
<p>A expert told Broadcasting Corporation that Porigerjin moved to Belarus, and the Wagner soldiers were absorbed to the Russian army, which may mean the end of this infamous mercenary organization.</p>
<p>Andrew D'Anieri, headquartered in the American Think Tank Atlantic Council, said the information from Russia was chaotic and unclear, and it was difficult to say what would happen in the end.</p>
<p>But he also said that Wagner's retreat did not mean that all private military companies in Russia were "out".</p>
<p>"Even if they are illegal in Russia in the strict sense, in the past year, we have seen the surge in such organizations."</p>

<p>James Nixey, head of the Russian Eurasian project in the Chartham Institute, said Ukraine will benefit from the Russian crisis.</p>
<p>Nixi told BBC that Ukraine is likely to continue to "poke Russia" and try to make internal manufacturing in its domestic manufacturing.</p>
<p>He said that Putin was the worst day for President President for so many years.</p>
<p>"He was losing the war," Nixi said.</p>
<p>"This is not to say that Ukraine feels very easy to win ... But this is not what Putin expects after President's president for so many years."</p>
<p>The Kremlin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said the Wagner rebellion would not affect Russia's military offensive in Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Western allies in Ukraine close attention</h3>
<p>The New York Times quoted people familiar with the matter and said US security officials received information as early as Wednesday, saying that Prittjin was preparing to take action.</p>
<p>What they care about most is how this will affect Moscow's control over its nuclear weapon library.</p>
<p>The US intelligence agencies have been paying close attention for several months, and the tension between Wagner's leaders and Russian Defense Secretary Shoshugogu and others has continued to intensify.</p>
<p>After this incredible 24 hours, the European Union, the United States, and allies are paying close attention to Russia.</p>
<p>The Pentagon issued a statement earlier, saying that the Minister of Defense Austin(Lloyd J.Austin)In the past few hours, the Minister of Defense from Canada, France, Germany, Poland, and Britain discussed this situation.</p>
<p>The statement said: "With the continued development of the situation, the United States will maintain close coordination with allies and partners."</p>
<p>Austin also said that the United States' support for Ukraine will not change.</p>
<p>At the same time, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau met with senior government officials on Saturday to discuss the situation where Russia was happening.</p>

<p>After the </p>
<h3>incident, Putin is no longer strong</h3>
<p>_ Steve Rosenberg_</p>
<p><em>Bbc Russian Editor</em></p>
<p>Wagner's rebellion is a watershed, which is a very dangerous moment for Putin.</p>
<p>When you take power for so long, you will think that you cannot defeat, and you can survive in any case.</p>
<p>16 months ago, Putin launched a "special military operation" in Ukraine to "safer Russia."</p>
<p>But in recent months, the Kremlin has been attacked by drones, and western Russia has also been shelled.</p>
<p>And now the mercenaries launch an armed rebellion, marching to Moscow, demanding the withdrawal of the National Defense Minister appointed by Putin, and then they decided to retreat.</p>
<p>This is a surprising 24 -hour. In these 24 hours, Putin faced the biggest challenge to its authority since he came to power more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The mutiny was over -after reaching an agreement after the Kremlin and Wagner's mercenary group. The Wagner soldiers can return to the base and will not be prosecuted, but their leader Pleigo must leave Russia and move to Belarus.</p>
<p>As for President Putin, after this incident, he was no longer strong.</p>
<p>See what happened in Rostov -Wagner, a private army has been able to obviously easily seize the control of military facilities in a major city in Russia, and then advance north to Moscow.</p>
<p>As a person behind the rebellion, Porigo can still retreat. Although he tried to overthrow Russia's military leadership, allegations against his armed rebellion had been revoked.</p>

<h3>potential influence far beyond Russia and Ukraine</h3>

<p><em>BBC reporter, once reported that Ukraine and African affairs</em></p>
<p>Porigo may have retreated from the edge of the cliff, but the incident in the past 24 hours will fundamentally change his relationship with the President of Russia.</p>
<p>Pricigo has been known as the "Putin chef" for the catering industry. For many years, he and his Wagner's mercenaries have played a key role in Russia's foreign policy, although it is hidden.</p>
<p>In Putin's unable to publicize or unwilling to do publicly, Wagner was used to conduct military intervention.</p>
<p>For example, supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad and trying to interfere with the 2016 US elections on the Internet, Wagner has played an increasingly important role in some of the most chaotic places in the world.</p>
<p>But the place where the mercenary footprint is the most is Africa.</p>
<p>For example, in Mali, a coup in 2020 and 2021 witnessed the establishment of a military power, and Wagner participated in a large number of long -term Islamic rebellions. Although they thought they were there under the instructions of the Russian government, Wagner was really going to the local area.</p>
<p>In the Central and African Republic, it is said that they are helping the government, resisting the rebels, and defending the capital. Wagner is accused of having an invasion of human rights.</p>
<p>Given Vagna's may now seem to be excluded by the Kremlin, what will their soldiers in Africa and their government support?</p>
<p>In addition, Wagner also controls a large number of mineral resources, which is the source of most wealth of the organization.</p>
<p>Since Progojin has fallen out of favor, can he still maintain control of these resources?</p>

<p>The official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on Sunday with the headline position of the "Minister's Activity". State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ruden Ke on the same day. " Opinion".</p>
<p>Although the Russian mercenaries, the leader of the Wagner Group's leader of the Wagner Group, Saturday has withdrawn the armed soldiers marched to Moscow on Saturday, this obvious mutiny move has undoubtedly adversely affected the political authority of Russian President Putin and the Russian and Uchia war. China's official news did not explain the specific date of Rudenko's arrival in Beijing, and the outside world could not know whether the visit to the important allies of Russia China was related to the Wagner incident.</p>
<p>According to Agence France -Presse, Moscow, the Russian capital, is still maintaining a "counter -terrorism action mechanism" this Sunday, and Pleigo, which was announced to be sent to Belarus, is currently unknown.</p>
<p>The outside world noticed that Putin severely condemned Wagner to launch a rebellion and threatened Russia's "survival" on Saturday, and Chinese officials have not yet made public comments. Song Zhongping (transliteration) of Chinese military experts and commentators told Reuters: "China will support Russia and emphasize not to interfere with its internal affairs." The official "Global Times" criticized the illusion that Western media created Russia's "building is about to collapse".</p>

Some netizens have connected Russian soldiers to the history of Chinese, pointing directly at the Anlu Mountain in the Tang Dynasty, but the goal has changed from Changan to Moscow; and netizens suggested that China should take the opportunity to ask Russia to return to the Northeast territory and other Northeast territory. Huang Anwei, a diplomatic reporter of the New York Times, said through Twitter that if Chinese President Xi Jinping was considering attacking Taiwan, the only incident in the Russian and Ukraine War that re -considered him to attack Taiwan was the change of Wagner.</p>

Last week, at a stem cell meeting held in Massachusetts, researchers revealed that they did not use eggs nor sperm, creating "synthetic" human embryos. These structures, more accurately, are embryo models, which are cultivated from a single alive cells separated from real human embryos.

<p>(Voice of Germany) last year, Germany's exported cars and engines exported to China accounted for as high as 20%of the total exports of China to China.</p>
<p>According to a new study from the Institute of Economics of Germany, in the first quarter of this year, the motor vehicle and components exported to China by Germany fell by 26%year -on -year. Big landslide. According to data released by the German Federal Bureau of Statistics in May, in the first quarter of this year, Germany's exports to China fell 12%year -on -year to 24.1 billion euros.</p>
<p>Research from the German Institute of Economic Research pointed out that in view of <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国电动车在中国市场步履蹒跚/a-65359971">China ’s strong chase in electric vehicles</a>This trend may be the beginning of the long -term weakening of Germany's exports to China. "The previous advantages are increasingly likely to become a disadvantage." The prospects of Germany's exports to China may be further dim.</p>
<p>About a quarter of the car currently sold in China is already an electric car. But the German brand is at a disadvantage in the competition of electric vehicles so far.</p>
<h3>Shanghai has become a city of electric</h3>
<p>Volkswagen Group has dominated in the Chinese automobile market for more than 20 years, but with the expansion of China's local electric vehicle manufacturers, Volkswagen's market share in China is shrinking. According to the IT home report in April this year, the danger on the terminal shows that in the first quarter of 2023 <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/比亚迪欲在德国市场加速扩张/a-65948560">BYD Passenger</a>The cumulative risk of the car surpassed the sum of FAW -Volkswagen and SAIC Volkswagen, and officially reached the first brand of Chinese car sales.</p>
<p>The German "Business Daily" also reported that according to data service providers Marklines and the current insurance data from China. In the first quarter of this year, the sales volume of China BYD Group was about 13,000 more than Volkswagen. BYD sold a total of about 441,000 vehicles, equivalent to an increase of 68%over the previous year. Volkswagen's delivery has dropped by 14%to 428,000 vehicles. Data released by Volkswagen Group on May 4 showed that in the first quarter of this year, Volkswagen Group's delivery in China dropped by 14.5%. Among them, the delivery volume in Huachun electric vehicles was 21,500, a year -on -year decrease of 25.4%.</p>
<p>According to data released by Volkswagen Group (China), the Group's delivery in the Chinese market in 2022 was 3.18 million units, a year -on -year decrease of about 4%, and a market share of 15.1%.</p>

The author believes that the overdraft consumption of the property market has increased China's economy's dependence on exports.</p>
<p>It is believed that the growth of foreign trade is obviously not a lot of good, especially when the export structure cannot be improved, such as the increase in the proportion of high -tech products. For the high growth of China's foreign trade in history, many people in the market and society believe that the environmental problems and resource consumption in China in the past are also caused by excessive exports, especially a large number of exports Ordinary products that cannot reflect the cost of all factors such as environmental and resources -but when the global value chain is in an unfavorable position, the exporting country can only get a small amount of benefits; if it continues to be at the bottom of the "smile curve" of the international value chain It will accumulate the cost of external society to deteriorating.</p>

<p>Description: The rebellion of the private legion Wagner not only highlights the vulnerability of Putin's power model, but also reveals the lack of Russian army and intelligence systems. Putin is no longer impeccable, but does this indicate that his rule is close to the end? The German media gave preliminary analysis.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳烧俄厨子撤退然后呢/a-66025628">The mutiny initiated by the Wagner Legion in Russia</a>It has attracted widespread attention from the international community. <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/russland-revolte-wagner-100.html">Tagesschau column in German TV published an analysis article on this</a>Summarize the four important cognitions that the Wagner Army can get from the incident from rebellion to retreat within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The article pointed out: First, Putin's private military model has failed. In the past, Putin successfully expanded Russia's global influence with the help of private troops such as Wagner, and at the same time, he was able to deny his participation in international conflicts. However, the rebellion of the Wagner Army showed that this model of reliance on the private army has long lost control and greatly threatened the stability of the existing system.</p>
<h3>Wagner Group "Rebellion" Head: What is the significance of war?</h3>
<p>Second, the rebellion exposed the weaknesses of the Russian army and intelligence systems. Within less than 24 hours, the soldiers of the Wagner Army allegedly approached 200 kilometers from Moscow. In the process, the substantial resistance they encountered was minimal. Although it is not clear whether they can continue to move forward at a similar speed, important military bases, such as Rostov, can control the rebels without effort. The Russian army deployed most soldiers in Ukraine or border areas may be the cause of this. The rapid offensive of the rebels exposed Russia's serious deficiencies in intelligence collection and early warning.</p>
<h3>Putin is no longer irreplaceable?</h3>
<p>The third point of the "Daily News" column in Germany TV is: the leader of the Wagner Army <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/普里戈津何许人也他有多大影响力/a-66020810">Porigoin</a>May be a substitute for Putin. To this end, the article reviewed history and pointed out that in 1992, when some Soviet troops opposed President Gorbachev, the public expressed his opposition to the uprising. But now in Rostov and Vornesh, people have not heard similar situations. The videos circulating on Twitter even showed that some people welcomed Wagner to hire mercenaries and expressed support to them.</p>
<p>The article pointed out that although these videos are initially confirmed, it may be just an individual situation, but this may indicate that the Pleigo and the Wagner forces have become a substitute choice for Russia's dissatisfaction. One possible factor is that Porigoin always goes on the front line, which is in sharp contrast to those military leaders who have rarely participated in the war.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-25T14-19-00Z/66026089_401.jpg" />The Wagner Corps soldiers shake hands with the people when evacuating southern theater of Russia</p>
<p>The author said: Successful, cruel soldiers and extreme nationalists, this combination obviously resonates with more and more people in Russia because it is largely in line with Putin's long -term information. Although Russia has persecuted the opponents, nationalism is accepted. This opens a door for people like Porigjin, as long as they follow the established rules. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳身上有多少希特勒/a-39919985">Rebellion of the Wagner Force</a>It reveals the internal risk and limitations of this model.</p>
<p>In the fourth revelation, the author of the article believes: "Putin's unpredictable image has been ruptured. The hesitation and decisiveness he showed in this conflict is in sharp contrast to the image of his consistently shaped leaders." At the same time, for Putin This rebellion really made his possibility of ending his rule was also obvious in front of each citizen. Germany's Kerba Foundation(Körber Foundation)Russian -issue expert Leslieschübel said to a "Daily News" to German TV: Today, the idea of being president except Putin may have been formed in people's minds. This topic is now now. It will definitely be the discussion of Russian tea after dinner.</p>

<p>Ning Jizhen, member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and deputy director of the Economic Committee, warned at the China Macroeconomic Forum on Sunday that the current foundation of economic recovery is not firm, the production and operation difficulties are relatively large, and there are problems such as unstable market expectations and insufficient market confidence.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that China's economic data in May showed that domestic and overseas demand was weak. As the world's second largest economy, China was faltering after the new crown epidemic. The State Council of China recently held a meeting to discuss relevant measures to promote economic growth, and promised to launch policies in a timely manner in order to take more powerful actions to cope with changes in the economic situation. At the same time, China has also lowered the quotation rate of the benchmark loan market for the first time in 10 months. Although economic analysts generally believe that the People's Bank of China will further take measures to reduce loan interest rates, but because private enterprises and families are unwilling to borrow, the relevant financial easing policies may damage bank banks that are already in response to the pressure of profit margins.</p>
<p>Ning Jizhen pointed out that macro -control must grasp the rhythm, and the first half of the year is about to end. The most important thing is that in the third quarter, the relevant "policy can come out early and come out early, and it can be coming out soon."</p>

<p>Vietnam's Finance Minister said that Vietnam needs to take radical measures to achieve this year's economic goals. He warned that in the context of the sharp decline in orders, it is difficult for Vietnam's export -oriented manufacturing economy to maintain strong growth.</p>

<p>Although the National Television Station promotes the unity and "maturity" of Russia, the conclusions of the independent commentators who evaluate the loss are that Putin's impeccable and invincible halo has been pierced. Some people questioned why most of the Russian leadership did not show up nor sounded.</p>
<p>In addition to Putin, the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigugu and the Chief of Staff of the Russian Army Valley Glasimov have been from Friday night <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/russia-prigozhin-putin-war-ukraine.html">Bingchang</a>Since the beginning, there have been no public appearance.

<p>On the weekend, the leader Pleigo, who was called the mercenary, launched a mutiny against the military leadership, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/24/world/europe/prigozhin-putin-russia.html">nearly 24 hours</a>He eventually ordered the cancellation. But the damage has been caused, especially because he violently criticized the incompetence of military leaders, and also questioned the reason for the Kremlin to invade the neighboring country first.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T02-10-22-08-00/25russia-ledeall02-vqtf-master1050.jpg" />On Saturday, the Wagner soldiers evacuated from the headquarters of the southern Military Region of Russia and returned to the station. Reuters</p>
<p>Steinnova pointed out that in Putin angrily, it was Poliger, who was "behind the knife behind", stopped as his long -term ally. She wrote that Pritigon "found that he was not ready to play a revolutionary role."</p>

<p>Filterlabs found that the public's support for Porigon and Wagner fell significantly.</p>

<p>As a result, the two sides reached an agreement.</p>
<p>The Wagner troops will retreat, and Perigon can go to Belarus in neighboring countries and avoid criminal charges. Wagner soldiers will also be pardoned.</p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the agreement was reached to "avoid bleeding, avoid civil war, and avoid unimaginable conflicts." He did not hint that the mutiny would cause any changes in the Russian military leadership -as Porigo's request -and said Russia would continue to advance military operations in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Agreement to resolve hostile operations is considered to be the credit of Putin allies and Belarusian leader Lukashenko. If Putin falls, Lukashenko is certainly difficult to protect himself, so helping his supporters are also helping himself.</p>
<p>"Putin lost, because he exposed how fragile his system was, how easy his authority was challenged," said Pavel Slunkin, former Belarusian diplomat and analyst of the European Foreign Relations Commission. "Porigo challenged, and the attack was so bold. Then he chose to retreat and looks like a loser. Only Lukashenko is a profitable person."</p>

<p>With the re -evaluating Putin's authority in China and other allies, even if the rebellion was suspended, it may still affect Russia's international status.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Pritigo kept silent. The day before, people saw him driving away from the military headquarters of Rostov on the Rosteov on the southwest city. His troops occupied there during the rebellion. A Russian independent broadcasting company sought a comment from the spokesman for Porigo. The answer was that he had no time for the time being, but he soon began to respond to the media.In addition, as a military leader, the ambition of Porigo may conflict with the intention of Lukashenko, and the latter has always tried to avoid Belarus from being involved in the war.</p>

<p>"Porigen is a" Z "patriot," Borkines said. The "Z" letter has become a symbol of the Ukraine conflict. "He supports this war and wants to create an empire, but Lukashenko is afraid of such an empire."</p>

<h3>Gates and Musk why are they received in China in China</h3>
<p>At 2:17 am on June 26, 2023<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-26T02-17-09.000Z/_130171971_whatsubject.jpg" />Image source, getty image</p>

<p>Beijing Street TV is playing Xi Jinping to meet with Gates.</p>
<p><strong> In half a month, Tesla's CEO (CEO) Elon Musk and Microsoft founder Billgates visited China successively. High -standard receptions aroused attention -Musk, in the 44 -hour visit to China, densely met with Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Qin Gang, Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong, and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. </strong></p>
<p>Reuters quoted people familiar with the matter and said that Musk also met with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Ding Xuexiang before leaving China, and the meeting did not appear in public schedule and foreign reports. Ding Xuexiang has long been considered Xi Jinping's chief of staff. After the 20th National Congress, he ranked among the Standing Committee of the Politburo and served as the executive vice prestigious of the State Council.</p>
<p>Bill Gates sat with Xi Jinping and talks face -to -face. Xi Jinping said to him, "You are the first American friend I met in Beijing this year." Previously, Xi Jinping met with Gates twice in Boao, Hainan. The first visit to the United States in 2015 also met with him in Seattle.</p>
<p>Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, visited China in March. At that time, he met with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and was officially elected from Li Qiang at the "two sessions."</p>
<p>But on the other hand, well -known foreign companies such as Deloitte, Micron, Bain, Mingz, and Anstela Pharmaceutical in Japan have been densely suppressed by the Chinese government this year. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also issued a report saying that it is increasingly worried about the negative impact of geopolitical disputes on the business in China.</p>
<p>So why do Gates and Musk enjoy super -standard treatment in China? Why do the Chinese government treat different foreign companies differently? Under the increasingly tense relationship between China and Europe and the United States, do Chinese and foreign companies still need each other?</p>
<h3>"Catfish Effect"</h3>
<p>"Tesla and Apple are like 'catfish". "A scholar who has been teaching in business schools in China and Hong Kong for a long time introduced to the BBC in Chinese that the sardines in the fishing boats were almost dead. They were all alive, because the captain threw a catfish inside to stimulate the desire to survive, but survived. This is the "catfish effect", that is, in an ecosystem, a strong man is introduced, which will inspire the weak to become stronger.</p>
<p>[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65981944/P0DVV8F5/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65981944/p0dvv8f5/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-26T02-17-09.000Z/p0dvvbh9.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Tesla's price cut twice in March to protest</p>
<p>Tesla is particularly the same. As the earliest and fastest companies in this industry, after entering China, the entire industry chain has been required to be low -cost. Zeng Yuqun in the Ningde era complained that Tesla is radically requested that they have fallen cost. It also dropped again.</p>
<p>This "catfish" has made China's entire electric vehicle industry chain less cost and higher efficiency. Although the domestic market competition has intensified, its external competitiveness has strengthened.</p>
<p>"In the process of in -depth participation in globalization, China has won the title of 'World Factory' very early. However, China has very few self -owned industrial manufacturing products occupy a place in the international market. Of course, there are many, but this is all home appliances, and it cannot be regarded as a large industrial manufacturer. "Anbang think tank said in an analysis sent to BBC in Chinese that the problem reflects that although China is a manufacturing industry with large -scale manufacturing capabilities Big power, but not a real manufacturing power.</p>
<p>"This situation has begun to change now, and it first appears in the automotive field," said Anbang Think Tank.</p>

<p>Musk arrived in China by his private jet, and this trip was highly confidential.</p>
<p>In fact, China has become the world's largest exporter of electric vehicle. According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), about 35%of the global exported electric vehicles in 2022 came from China, and this ratio in 2021 was 25%. This year, the volume continued. In April, the export of new energy vehicles in China reached 91,000, an increase of 1028.5%year -on -year, an increase of 29.4%month -on -month, accounting for 31%of the passenger vehicle export volume.</p>
<p>Similar examples also occur in the smartphone industry. In 2007, Apple launched a cross -era smartphone iPhone. At that time, Cook was the core trader behind the Apple's supply chain system. Apple continued to send top technicians from China to buy customized devices for billions of dollars for suppliers to buy billions of dollars for billions of dollars for suppliers, so as to drop billions of dollars for suppliers to buy more than billions of dollars for suppliers, so as to throw billions of dollars for suppliers to buy more than billions of dollars for suppliers to buy customs billions of dollars for suppliers, so as to throw billions of dollars to supplie Developing some exclusive technologies; even in order to achieve the integration of laptop shells, Apple bought almost all of the world's most advanced CNC machine tools in the world, and they appeared collectively in Chinese factories a few months later.</p>
<p>When Cook first appeared in the CEO position in 2011, only eight Chinese companies in the 156 suppliers of Apple. Under his governance, in the top 200 main suppliers of Apple in 2020, 96 Chinese manufacturers reached 96.</p>
<p>These companies involved in the Apple supply chain system are called "fruit chains" companies. They cover important components such as screens, antennas, sensors, and cameras. After the Apple buying period, they can sell technology to Chinese companies.</p>
<p>Although the saying "Apple eats meat and drinks soup" in the industry, under the blessing of this supply chain, China's smartphone companies reached the pinnacle of 522 million units in 2015, accounting for 40%of the global market.</p>
<p>Under the influence of Apple, this "catfish", Chinese mobile phone manufacturers have used half -years in a relatively high -end field for eight years. China hopes Tesla can also achieve similar effects.</p>

<p>Cook visited China in March. In addition to Prime Minister Li Qiang, he also met the Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao.### "Stolen Fire"</p>
<p>"For China, Bill Gates is more like a 'stolen fireman'. There may be exaggerated components, and many people may disagree. But he comes earlier enough, and when he comes, it is the giant posture." The above Scholars say.</p>
<p>"Fire stolen" comes from Greek legends, that is, Prometheus, stolen fire species from the sun god Aparta for human beings.</p>
<p>In 1994, Bill Gates arrived in China for the first time and promoted Windows 95 into the Chinese market.</p>
<p>In China at that time, computers were fresh stuff. They even heard the Internet. Until 1995, Ma Yun, who was 31 years old, first came into contact with the Internet. At this time, Bill Gates was 39 years old. The position of the richest man in the world has been maintained for 13 consecutive years.</p>
<p>Just two years later, the Microsoft Asia Research Institute settled in China. This is the second basic scientific research institution opened by Microsoft overseas. It is the largest research institution in Microsoft outside the United States.</p>
<p>This decision has benefited the Chinese science and technology industry, because this research institute has later become the "Huangpu Military Academy" in the Chinese science and technology industry, and has produced a long string of well -known scientific and technological talents: Li Kaifu, Zhang Yaqin, Shen Xiangyang, Zhang Hongjiang, Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning, and Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,, Wang Jian, Li Shipeng, Lin Bin, Zhu Wenwu, Tang Xiaoou, Sun Jian, etc. Behind them are Baidu, Alibaba, Shangtang Technology, Viewing, Xiaomi, Tencent Science and Technology News, and other Chinese cloud computing and artificial intelligence fields Essence</p>
<p>But when these occurred, Bill Gates retired from Microsoft in 2008 and turned its main energy to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to start charity.</p>
<p>The outside world rarely noticed that Gates still retained a title at the time, the chairman of the US Tyra Energy Corporation. There was a contact with Chinese leader Xi Jinping through this company.</p>
<p>In 2014, the website of the National Energy Administration of China published an article entitled "Bill Gates Talking Nuclear Energy". In this interview, Gates said, "It is Tyra Energy Company ... … This company has an innovative design that can greatly improve the safety performance of nuclear energy, so that nuclear energy can be a very exciting way, which can provide large -scale, safe, and clean energy. "Gates said that this nuclear energy technology is doing the line. The wave reactor and hope to successfully build a demonstration heet by 2023.</p>
<p>[Video-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65981944/P09742vj/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65981944/p09742vj/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-26T02-17-09.000Z/p09743q0.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Bill Gates: Reaching the global greenhouse gas zero emissions "will be the most powerful thing humans have done."</p>
<p>Less than a month after being elected as the President of the State in 2013, Xi Jinping attended the Hainan Boao Forum for Asia and met Bill Gates during this event.</p>
<p>In 2015, Xi Jinping talked with Gates again in one -on -one in Boao. In the same year, Xi Jinping visited the United States for the first time after he came to power. One of them was Gates's Big Camp Seattle. There, the two had private talks. According to the documentary "Decoding Bill Gates", this talks were a breakthrough, and the two sides signed a contract. In September 2017, Gates and China Nuclear Group set up a joint venture with Global Innovation Nuclear Energy Technology Co., Ltd., each holding 50%of its shares. It seems to be bound to build the first fourth -generation nuclear reactor in China to build the first fourth -generation nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>However, after Trump came to power, the Sino -US trade war also started at this time, and the bilateral relations between China and the United States deteriorated rapidly. On October 11, 2018, the U.S. Department of Energy announced the "Framework of the United States' Nuclear Energy Project for China". In the ideal fetus of the fourth -generation nuclear reactor in China, Cat, in this regard, Gates' partner in Tyra energy said, "We have always knew that there will be a political impact, but never thought it was from our own. government".</p>
<p>Visiting China in 2019, Gates did not meet Xi Jinping. Since then, the new crown epidemic broke out. In February 2020, Xi Jinping replied to Gates and thanked him for his support for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia.</p>
<p>In the following three years, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China experienced strict control, "white paper revolution", and economic turbulence; Gates was trapped in a scandal of associated with sexual criminals, as well as divorce with his wife Melinda.</p>
<p>In 2023, the two met again after a lapse of four years, but in public reports, they did not mention energy cooperation again.</p>
<p>"I put a Microsoft Research Institute in China in the 1990s. In the past few years, I wanted to put a new type of nuclear power plant in China, so I called him 'stolen people'." The above scholars said that in the final analysis, China wants to be a big country, whether Cook, Musk, or Gates, can help China get rid of the low level of the industry and complete the "big country dream", and can be received by hyperpost.</p>

<p>Unlike many peers, Apple has a huge market share in China.</p>
<h3>Demand and vigilance under Sino -US relations</h3>
<p>It is not difficult to observe that not all foreign capitals can get water like American companies such as Tesla and Apple.</p>
<p>Colmraffrty, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM China), told the Chinese media that the global anti -risk capabilities of SMEs and US -funded enterprises are relatively weak, so many of the epidemic have closed Chinese business; coupled with strict control in recent years In the following, it is even more difficult to enter China on the spot. New decisions to enter China or expand production and investment are even more difficult. Few new enterprises enter China.</p>
<p>Foreign companies seem to be worrying in China. According to data from the Statistics Bureau of China, the total profit of industrial enterprises above designated size in the first two months was 887.21 billion yuan, a significant decrease of 22.9%year -on -year. Among them, foreign companies, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan business investment enterprises decreased by 35.7%, the largest decline.</p>
<p>In addition, since this year, Deloitte, one of the world's four major accounting firms, has been severely punished in China; the Shanghai office of Bain, the world's three major management consulting companies, has been assaulted by the police; on May 21, China announced the blockade of the Meiguang chip. Order; March, the Beijing police raided and closed the US Survey Corporation Mintzgroup in Beijing.</p>
<p>The "AMCHAMCHINA) recently released the" 2023 Annual Business Survey Report in the United States and Chinese Enterprises in the United States "shows that 49%of member companies believe that they are more" unpopular "in China compared to the previous year. The consumer industry is as high as 56%.</p>
<p>Some are active choice; some are passively suppressed.</p>
<p>"Some people leave, and some people come, such as Musk's Tesla, large -scale investment in the Chinese market. This represents a very different understanding of Western entrepreneurs in the Chinese market." Chen Gong, the founder of Anbang think tank, said to BBC in Chinese.<a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-64734537">China Promoting State -owned Enterprises Disable the "Four" accounting firms or decouples with international investment</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-65501034">Foreign capital faced by foreign investment from Volkswagen to Delois Bein's epidemic in China</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-62698733">Several things you need to know in China and the United States signing audit supervision and cooperation agreement</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science-65854500">Why does the US -China Semiconductor War entering the artificial intelligence AI chip in Deepwater District become the key</a></p>

<p>The picture shows the Tesla factory (information photo) under construction in 2019.</p>
<p>"China's attitude towards different foreign investment is also 'clear love and hate'. The foreign investment that is not waiting is to sum up: the natural monopoly industry, involving security." "In the natural monopoly industries such as oil, telecommunications, banking, electricity, and aviation to build a huge state -owned enterprise group, the others completely withdrew. In these industries, there are very few private enterprises in China, not to mention foreign companies.</p>
<p>And financial security and communication security, and there is a controversy in China and the United States involving audit drafts. The consulting company has been identified by the Chinese side to play the role of commercial spies, so that more and more foreign companies are involved in the increasingly tense confrontation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Tian Yumiao, a professor at the University of West Prudential Liverpool University, told BBC in Chinese that the Chinese government may be the most pragmatic political institution in Chinese history, and "Sun Tzu's Art of War" pays attention to "divide and rule". Therefore, for some American companies and individuals who are positive for China's economic and social development, China will distinguish between companies and individuals who have taken the "sanctions".</p>
<p>"Sino -US economic decoupling is actually a very small event. The Chinese side can choose to decide with, how to decide, and when will it be decoupled." Tian Yumiao said.</p>
<p>There is also a voice in Chinese social media that, for investors, risks are not Sino -US relations, but confidence in Chinese policies and economy. Chinese leaders may solve the confidence of individual enterprises through high standards, but the confidence of overall foreign capital needs more policies in good faith.</p>
<p>Musk's visit to China may just prove this statement. On the first day of his visit, Tesla's stock price rose 5%, and the market value increased by nearly $ 25 billion, making him return to the world's richest man. But at the same time, there was no big improvement in China's A -shares, and the RMB against the US dollar was still falling.</p>

<p>SY told the Peninsula TV at the home of Guangzhi Province, "I discovered it last Thursday." He also said that he immediately informed local officials. "Sometimes I also find other objects. After the war, I started to work in waste collection and discovered many types of explosives. As early as 1975, when I was 20 years old, I would use a metal detector to find larger explosives and I would use a more explosives and and I used a metal detector to find greater explosives and and I used a metal detector to find greater explosives. Sell it. "</p>
<p>Behind SY's house is a crushed ruins of a church. During the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese soldiers had hid there. The building became the goal of continuous bombing of the US military. The United States supported the South Vietnam government of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City).</p>

Wu Qiang, a Beijing current affairs commentator who focused on the situation in Russia, said in an interview with Radio Asia on Monday (26th) that although the coup in Wagner Group has not been successful, it has had three aspects of the Russian situation. The foundation foundation has been shaken:</p>
<p>"Deep cracks occurred between his private country and the private army, which not only exposed the nature of his private country, but also exposed the nature of the war. It was launched by the private army in 2014, violating the aggression of international law, extreme Relying on the Wagner Group, and this kind of mercenaries have abducted Russia's defense army, the Russian country and people, and the fate of Russia. "</p>
<p>Wu Qiang said that when this mercenary inverted Ge Putin means that the war has ended, and it has also begun to sound the funeral clock of the Russian private state system: "War, in fact, has entered the final state. Make full preparations. The impact of this unsuccessful coup on China is huge and far -reaching, just like this war began to fail in Russia and the dilemma of lasting war, its shock was a series of shocks. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T03-36-00-04-00/000002.png" />On June 24, 2023, on the streets of Rostov on the Russon River, the founder of Wagner's private mercenary group Porigin (right) sat in a military vehicle to take a group photo with the local civilians. (Associated Press) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/gt1-06262023033527.html/ap23175792347357.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T03-36-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>In the past few days, the Chinese people are discussing the causes and evolutionary process of this mutiny. Some netizens have left messages to support Putin, but more netizens have issued documents to comment on Putin. The WeChat public account "Thinking Totovir" wrote in the article that Wagner's rebellion ended within one day. Wagner's entry speed exceeded expectations, and the Kremlin's response was exceeded expected. Faced with the forced palace of the warlords, Putin was first -day rebellion and then revoked all the allegations. Poliger's appointment below retreated all over the whole body after the capital of the soldiers. What is even more terrible is that Pryigo moved for more than a thousand kilometers within a day, but he did not encounter any resistance. The Russian army and the people along the road watched without any sleeves. In the critical moment, no one came forward to defend the government. This shows that the Russian government is losing people's hearts.</p>
<p><strong> The image of Putin's strong man is the most tense to destroy China </strong></p>
<p>Current affairs commentator Cai Shenkun said that although the military coup of the Wagner Group's military coup was dramatic, it did not really end. The image of Putin's "strong man" has been greatly challenged: "If there is a military leader to continue challenging him in the next step, what should he do? Until this war, this situation is very unfavorable to Putin. As for the impact on China, whether it is Chinese leaders or military, it should be highly nervous. Both people and the military will be very nervous. "</p>
<p>Cai Shenkun believes that once the Taiwan Strait has a crisis, Chinese politicians should have no confidence in responding to the new situation.</p>
<p>"New York Times" diplomacy reporter Huang Anwei posted on June 24 in his Twitter, quoting the Xinhua News Agency reporting about the Wagner's mutiny incident, "If there is a single incident in the Russian and Ukraine War This is the incident. "He believes that it is not a mercenary issue in China. Assuming that Xi Jinping is watching how a long -term war has a mental impact on a country," now we know that he has about the Chinese PLA The loyalty problem is sensitive, and his anti -corruption extends to the PLA.

<p><strong> The current international environment of the Chinese army has no confidence to win the battle </strong></p>
<p>Former Chinese Naval Command Lieutenant Colonel Yao Cheng told this station that before the Russian mercenary mercenary Wagner Group's mutiny, Chinese officials had strengthened their control of the army, including new regulations and prohibiting military and local governments exchanges. He said: "The generals of the army are still sober. They believe that the start of war to the outside world is surrounded by the world, no matter where they fight, there is no chance of winning. Sorry for the soldiers who were sent to death. Second, the general would lose the black hat if the general would not win, so the Chinese army is generally reluctant to fight. Xi Jinping has seen this problem. "Reporter: Ancient Pavilion Editor: Chen Meihua Xu Shuting Jiayuan.com Editor: Ruizhe</p>

Since June, the Russian Ministry of Defense demanded that the mercenaries have signed an agreement to obey the command before the end of the month. This seems to be tantamount to disarm, and the contradictions have been further intensified.</p>

<p>Description: The heavy rain in Central China has caused severe damage to wheat harvest, highlighting the risk of climate shock to Xi Jinping's self -sufficient self -sufficiency to promote Chinese food supply. Analysis states that China may be forced to import more wheat this year, leading to further increase in global food prices. Lu Boan/Xinhua, Via Getty Images this month, rural areas south of Guangxi were affected by heavy rain. Chinese officials warned the increasingly serious threat of extreme weather.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T03-52-56-08-00/00china-food-zhwj-master1050.jpg" />In Central China, the pouring rains began in late May and poured the wheat field. As more and more wheat grains begin to black in the rain, it is no longer suitable for human consumption. The government mobilizes the emergency team to do its best. In a wide range of circulation <a href="https://weibo.com/7467277921/4906849176916669">video</a>Among them, a 79 -year -old farmer in Henan Province wiped his tears while checking the damage.</p>
<p>This abnormal heavy rainfall highlights that the climate impact is threatening President Xi Jinping's goal of promoting China's food supply self -sufficiency. Local officials said the rainfall caused the wheat harvest for ten years <a href="http://ha.people.com.cn/n2/2023/0530/c351638-40436421.html">the most serious damage</a>Essence</p>
<p>Ensuring that China has the ability to feed 1.4 billion people is the key to Xi Jinping's leading China to move towards the super nation. In recent years, the tension with the United States, the popularity of the new crown virus, and the war against Ukraine have caused greater fluctuations in global food prices, which has exacerbated the urgency of Chinese crops in China.</p>
<p>Food prices in China have not reached the level of other major economies, but officials are worried that their food supply is vulnerable to global impact. Last summer, the prices of Chinese pork, fruits, and vegetables soared, prompting the government to <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202210/1277647.shtml">putting strategic reserve pork</a>To stabilize the price. Subsequently, the leader reiterated that the safety of food was the top priority.</p>

<p>According to local news reports, in recent weeks, thousands of pigs in the rice fields in the rice fields in Guangxi Province have died of extreme high temperature due to extreme high temperature. The Tianjin fire department received a notice to spray water on the stroke of the truck. Officials warned that extreme high temperature and floods would damage wheat crops in northwestern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>In a country, which has caused the dynasty to be turbulent due to famine, the Communist Party in power also realized that meeting basic needs is a prerequisite for political stability.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T03-52-56-08-00/00china-food-02-zjvf-master1050.jpg" />In early June, farmers are harvesting wheat in Zhumadian City, Henan Province, China. Josh Arslan/Reuters</p>
<p>Last year, in order to control the spread of the new crown virus, the government had a severe blockade on Shanghai with a population of 25 million, and food shortage became an important reason for riots. Online videos show that residents fight for food to grab food in streets and grocery stores. In national protests against China's "clear zero" policy, protesters shouted "Don't have nucleic acids, have to eat".</p>
<p>Chinese farmland is already shrinking because of rapid urbanization pollution large soils, and the government sells rural land to developers. The uneven distribution of north -south water resources in China has caused some crop planting areas to easily suffer drought, while others are easily attacked by floods. The Ukrainian war threatened China's wheat and fertilizer imports. The trade war from the United States in 2018 has made China buy soybeans and other foods from the United States <a href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/record-us-fy-2022-agricultural-exports-china#:~:text=Corn%2C%20Sorghum%2C%20and%20Alfalfa%20Hay&amp;text=China%20is%20also%20a%20major,volumes%20of%20feed%20grain%20imports.">higher cost</a>Essence</p>
<p>Xi Jinping regards food self -sufficiency as a issue that is related to national security. He often says, "Chinese people's rice bowls must be firmly brought in their hands at any time." He set the "red line" that the country must retain 1.8 billion mu of cultivated land. , And <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20200824/china-food-waste-xi/">Waste the food to declare war</a>, Especially food waste in restaurants. The Chinese government often pointed out that it has to support one -fifth of the world's population with less than 10%of the world's arable land.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T03-52-56-08-00/00china-food-jzfp-master1050.jpg" />This month, in Luohe City, Henan Province, farmers fertilized in the just harvested wheat fields, and corn is now planted in wheat fields. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>In order to create more stable food supply, China has reserved crops and purchased more overseas farmland. It has been developing <a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202208/22/WS63033006a310fd2b29e73946.html">heat -resistant rice variety</a>, GM soybean and new seed technology, this effort has triggered the United States to propose allegations of intellectual property theft.</p>
<p>"People's Daily" article on Monday said that Xi Jinping had "special emotions" for farmers and focused on increasing farmers' income. Last month, he visited a wheat field in Hebei Province, where farmers were trying to improve grain output by planting drought -resistant wheat varieties.</p>

<p>In the official Xi Jinping inspection video, local officials demonstrated bread and noodles made with new varieties of wheat. "President Xi wants us to be happier and happier," a local farmer in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrruIlP87yU&amp;ab_channel=NewChinaTV">Said</a>, "Let's work harder."</p>
<p>But the impact of food supply related to the weather is a more difficult challenge.</p>
<p>"You can implement more regulations to curb local governments to sell cultivated land. You can subsidize farmers," said Liu Zongyuan, an international political economy researcher at the US research institution of the US research institution. "But extreme weather will not only cause damage, but also the cost of solving this problem is also very high."</p>
<p>This month, the record of recorded records led to [Beihai City] in southern China <a href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23410524">Beihai City</a>Floods occur. In some areas of China, including major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, this month has experienced high -temperature weather that is abnormal this month. This month, some regions have temperatures exceeding 41 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>However, floods in Henan Province and the surrounding areas of central China constitute the latest concerns about food safety. These areas produce more than three -quarters of wheat in the country.On Wednesday, a farmer in Luohe planted soybeans in the just harvested wheat field. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>"In the harvest season, wheat growers are most worried about continuous rainfall," said Zhang Hongzhou, a researcher at the Nanyang University of Technology in Singapore. "This happened at the worst time."</p>
<p>When rainfall comes, farmers are preparing for the start of this year's harvest, and rainfall causes some wheat to germinate. This reduces the quality of wheat, is not suitable for processing flour, and is usually sold as animal feed at a lower price.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>It is unclear the degree of crop damage this year. Analysts say that the decline in wheat gantry may force China to import more wheat this year, thereby raising global food prices.</p>
<p>China is the largest wheat producer and consumer country in the world. People in the city are increasingly purchasing Western bread and desserts, and the demand for wheat has increased with income. The soaring of Chinese meat consumption also requires more wheat to be used as animal feed.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the rainfall in Henan, the Chinese government <a href="https://h.xinhuaxmt.com/vh512/share/11536408?d=134b1cd">funding</a>200 million yuan is used for disaster relief, helping to dry the harvest tide food, and arranged the flooded fields.

<p>The official media said that the government's efforts have minimized the losses of farmers. The recent "People's Daily" promoted harvesting progress in the front page. National Television CCTV played a 15 -minute video clip, showing that government officials remind farmers to harvest as soon as possible.</p>
<p>China has a global impact on food security. It is largely because it has a large amount of food inventory, including the US Department of Agriculture estimated that about half of the world's wheat reserves. Last year, US officials accused China of accusing of food inventory, which led to rising global food prices, especially in poor countries. In response, China <a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202207/20/WS62d7e810a310fd2b29e6d78a.html">accusing the United States</a>Inciting the global food crisis, saying that the US sanctions against Russia have damaged the export of wheat in African countries.</p>
<p>The exact quantity and quality of Chinese crops inventory are regarded as national secrets, so it is difficult to measure the stability of China's grain supply. For example, although the official data of the country often shows a record high of wheat output, analysts <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/Chinas_Interests_in_U.S._Agriculture.pdf">question</a>Data reliability.</p>

<p>But in January 2022, the government revealed some rare information.</p>
<p>In response to the accusations of China's hoarding food in Western countries, the official newspaper "Economic Daily" <a href="http://paper.ce.cn/pc/content/202201/06/content_228322.html">published a comment article</a>It is revealed that China's wheat and rice reserves are sufficient to meet the food needs of the people across the country at least 18 months.

<p>In the past weekend, Russia's stability has nowhere to find, and Putin himself does not know where to go. Facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/world/europe/russia-wagner-prigozhin.html">the biggest challenge encountered by personal authority in Russia 23 years</a>After issuing a brief statement on Saturday morning, Putin disappeared from the public vision.</p>
<p>During his disappearance, the stunned Russians wondered how the quasi -military organization leader Yefgen V. Pleigo launched an armed rebellion on Saturday and even threatened Moscow's security. This is also the uneasiness of the future of the Russian president: what does the failure to stop the rebellion from the security of Russia and the stability of his personal power?</p>
<p>On Sunday, Russians who were related to the Kremlin were relieved, because the rebellion in Pleigo did not trigger a civil war. But at the same time, they also believe that Putin looks weak in this matter, and to some extent it may become a lasting impression.</p>

<p>The Moscow newspaper editor Constantine Remurkov, who has mastered the Koya Line Newspaper, said in an interview that what seemed to be unimaginable is now possible: that is, Putin's confidant may try to convince him not to participate in the Russian president of next spring next year. Election to seek re -election. He said that considering the situation of Saturday, Putin has completely lost its position as a wealthy wealth and security guarantee.</p>
<p>"Putin's power can bring the concept of stability and ensuring security on the 24th," said Remachukov. "If I was sure Putin would run a month ago, because it was his right, then what I see now is that the sense of security of the elite class is no longer sure."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T04-51-57-08-00/25russia-analysis02-clgj-master1050.jpg" />Photos provided by official Russian media show that Putin delivered a TV speech on Moscow on Saturday. Sputnik, via reuters</p>
<p>"Stability" is the Cremlin in the referendum in 2020 <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2020/07/03/stabilno/">the slogan of shouting</a>The referendum continued to be re -elected for two times until 2036. Putin also claims that Russia's national security is his main motivation for his invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Even during the 16 -month war, the Kremlin palace will focus on maintaining the normal normal state of China. Putin rejected the request of the hardliners to announce martial law or close the Russian border. For the elites, the new business opportunities of Russia's economy during war, and the domestic market that suddenly got rid of many Western companies has become a compensation for Western sanctions.</p>
<p>But such an abacus was broken by Pryigon's provocative provocation of the Kremlin last weekend. As the leader of the quasi -military organization Wagner, Pricig appointed people to seize a military headquarters in southern Russia, and sent troops to Moscow north to vowed to enter the capital. The crisis was resolved on Saturday night, and Perigon agreed to withdraw the army, which caused him and his troops to be relieved.</p>
<p>The imminent crisis was lifted. But during this period, Putin lost more than just his reputation of maintaining stability: the fact that Poigo and his troops have not been punished have weakened Putin's decisive and unwilling leadership image.</p>

<p>Russian military bloggers' reports on Parigen's troops shot down the Russian combat aircraft also deepened this impression. After Poligon's appointment and questioning the legitimacy of Putin's launch of the Ukrainian war, Putin also called him a traitor. But as the two sides reached an agreement to end the crisis, these sins seemed to no longer exist.</p>
<p>Experts say that Putin does not look at the country as firm as before. The external opponent quickly seized this pain point.</p>

<p>State Secretary of State Brillin said on Sunday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/24/world/europe/prigozhin-putin-russia.html">Poliger's rebellion</a>It was exposed to Putin's control over power. "This is a direct challenge to Putin's authority," Brillin's "Facing the People" in CBS(Face the Nation)The show said.</p>
<p>One of the confusing questions about this crisis is why Putin allows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/25/world/europe/russia-putin-prigozhin-wagner-ukraine.html">Poligon's open conflict with the Russian Ministry of Defense</a>Fermented for several months without solving. Porigon had no choice but to criticize and degrade the Russian military leadership.</p>
<p>Two Kremlin insiders said that fundamental speaking, this crisis is a product of an disordered and nearly chaotic rule. The word "Bardak" (chaotic) of Russian vividly summarizes this situation. Due to the discussion of political sensitive topics, the two insiders asked anonymous.</p>
<p>They said that the decision to dispose of Porigen's reconnaissance was made in a hurry on Saturday. For a few months, Putin and its core power circles have been delaying time, and have not found ways to deal with the disobedient mercenary head.</p>

<p>"This problem can be said to be ignored," Putin's unified Russian Party country Duma senior member Constantine Datuylin said in an interview. He also said that the risk brought by Pritigo "failed to deal with timely -maybe it was hoped to let it resolve itself."</p>
<p>Zatulin believes that Putin finally stabilized the situation because he approved the end of the rebellion and avoided a fierce battle outside Moscow. But he also acknowledged that this incident made everyone embarrassing- "No powerful figures can benefit from it."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T04-51-57-08-00/25russia-analysis-05-qpfk-master1050.jpg" /></p>
<p>"This is a proof <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/world/europe/putin-prigozhin-wagner.html">something wrong</a>"Zutuylin said." The problem was exposed so much during the war, which was of course harmful. "</p>
<p>Political analysts, who had served as a consultant for the Kremlin, said that for Putin himself, this mutual mutual change may trigger a "crisis of survival."</p>
<p>"He has always been proud of Russia's national unity and political stability," Markov said. "This is why they love him. But all the results have become mirror flowers and water."</p>
<p>The newspaper editor of Romchkkov said that the uneasy mood caused by the rebellion of Poriga had permeated the entire capital. He said that he knew some Russian celebrities that fled Moscow on the day of the rebellion. Romchukov said he did not leave, but on the day of Saturday, he did not drive Mercedes or Bentley, because the troops that were afraid of Porigon would be confiscated if they really arrived in Moscow.</p>

<p>Putin's system does show amazing toughness in some ways. The sanctions did not defeat Russia's economy, nor did it promote the transfer of Russia's leading commercial tycoon and opposed the Kremlin. Despite the huge casualties of the war, the propaganda machines and iron -fist suppression of the dripping water generally suppressed the public's objections to the war.</p>
<p>Therefore, some experts believe that it is too early to predict that the collapse of this system is too early.</p>
<p>"In the eyes of us Western observers, the situation of yesterday was serious disability, and it was very severe," said Hannah Nort, a very senior researcher at the Center of Strategy and International Research. "But it turns out that this disorder state can be quite durable in such a system."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-26T05-02-22-00-00/000185564_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>The State Council of State Council Li Qiang's European trip last week was another strengthening of Europe's diplomacy, which became the focus of attention of world public opinion. There are no exceptions: the major mainstream media in the United States concentrated the "de -risk" of China's "de -riskization" of China, while the European media are relatively objective, and there are fewer phenomena of one side.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiang's trip to Europe has opened a brand new content of Chinese diplomacy. This is: the "de -risk" wave of China's "de -risk" wave for Western public opinion. It is particularly noteworthy that this authentic name is not a propaganda or diplomatic department that starts in China, but was initiated by politicians such as Chinese Prime Minister. The significance is naturally different.</p>
<p><strong> Reveal and break "de -risk" </strong> **</p>
<p>First of all, Li Qiang clearly revealed and criticized the essence of China's "de -risk" view in various important occasions in various important occasions in various important occasions. After the EU Chairman Feng Delin officially put forward this position in the European Union in April this year, this was the first time by Chinese Prime Minister to express his position.</p>
<p>According to Germany, Li Qiang said when he visited Germany: "Implement discrimination measures in the name of risks to restrict or exclude other countries, which violates market principles, fair competition rules, and rules of the World Trade Organization."</p>
<p>In addition, he also specifically stated at the closing ceremony of the China -German Economic Cooperation Forum last Tuesday that he opposed the reality of "de -risk" and the "detachable break chain".</p>
<p>For example, Li Qiang said: German cars have taken the lead in the Chinese market. He has worked in the local area for a long time. The official car that the official provides him is a German car. "We don't think there is any risk." Li Qiang also introduced: In China, he went to the hospital for a computer tomography (CT) inspection, and also used Siemens's instrument.</p>
<p>According to Xinhua News Agency, Li Qiang said on Monday with representatives of German enterprise representatives such as Siemens, Volkswagen, Mercedes -Benz, BMW, and Bathf, and said that understanding that all parties have their own safety concerns. It is important to reasonably define and prevent risks. " Can't artificial exaggeration 'dependence', and even the interdependence and unsafe simplicity. "</p>
<p>Li Qiang's above -mentioned statement in Germany has a serious statement of stance, and there is also a peaceful side of facts and reasoning.</p>
<p>European and American media said that when "de -riskization" became the mainstream of Europe and the United States policies in China, Beijing tried to persuade Europe. Economic globalization and interdependence were inevitable to prevent "de -risk" evolving into "de -China".</p>
<p>When visiting France, Li Qiang's expression of "de -risk" is different.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported: On June 21, Li Qiang mentioned at the Sino -French business community in Paris that China and France's good political mutual trusts see stability, certainty, and common development opportunities in mutual dependence, while. Not risk.</p>
<p>He praised the French government against the confrontation and decoupling chain of camps, and called on Sino -French entrepreneurs to firmly support economic globalization and jointly maintain the stability and toughness of the China -French, China -Europe industry chain, and supply chain.</p>
<p>The reason why Li Qiang's expression of "de -risk" is different from France and Germany because the two governments have different policies for China. The key to this difference is that the French policy of China is relatively independent and has an independent tradition. Some political parties within the German government are deeply influenced by the United States' policy on China. This difference reflects a concept that China's official has always emphasized, that is, specific analysis of specific issues.</p>
<p>In addition to Li Qiang's position explained in European diplomatic activities, international public opinion also has a point of view of Li Qiang's position.</p>
<p>On June 20, the World Newspaper Industry Sidica website published an article entitled "Risk of Risk", the author is Karl Bern.</p>
<p>The article states that the word "de -risk" is attributed to the abandonment of the word "decoupling". "Delayed" said it was a long time until the facts proved that almost no one supported a complete break between China and the West. It is neither desirable to cut off all connections with China, or even feasible, so everyone has chosen a much vague concept.</p>
<p>The article pointed out: But this new political speech has a deeper meaning, and it implies that there is inherent risks in trade with China. Western leaders are increasingly worried that China will use trade or other economic ties to put political pressure on Western enterprises or countries.</p>
<p>The article asked: When the election still exists, is the risk of losing trade in the future, is it a reason to avoid trade now? People usually do not commit suicide in order to reduce their fear of death.</p>
<p>The article believes that Chinese officials have pointed out that there is no substantial difference between "de -risk" and "decoupling". They make sense. Unless Western strategists get rid of the routine of only one new popular word, and instead clarify what it contains and does not contain, this kind of speech may be greater than benefits.</p>
<p>This means that the "de -riskization" view is not widely recognized by the European and American public and public opinion, and it still has the opportunity to eliminate the impact of this view. In addition, the view of "de -risk" investment in the United States is actually established, and it will definitely have a market in South Korea and Japan in Europe and even Asia.</p>
<p><strong> European and American differentiation has an exacerbation trend </strong></p>
<p>In addition, in the past week, major European and American countries focusing on economic and trade relations with China, and there has been a trend of exacerbation of positions.</p>
<p>First of all, the European Commission announced a new trade principles on Tuesday on Tuesday, which aims to curb China's ability to squeeze the European economy and prevent European companies from exporting to China with military -related technology and may bring advantages to China. The policy is still in the early stages, highlighting the EU's sought of consistency with the United States in restricting China to enter the sensitive market and obtaining industry secrets.</p>
<p>However, according to the New York Times report: Diplomats said that in terms of important economic relations with China, Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, which have the largest economic power in China, are not in a hurry to accept the EU may have destructive intervention. These concerns may cause the European Commission's proposal to be diluted.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said: The meeting held on Tuesday was relatively low -key and avoided obvious problems: the German economy depended on China. That is, more than 1 million German jobs directly depend on China. Almost half of German manufacturers rely on some parts of its supply chain.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the "Voice of Germany" was quoted from Germany's "Mirror Weekly" reports that not only in the European Union, but even in the German government, there was a major analysis in relations with China.</p>
<p>It is reported that according to the "Ming Mirror Weekly", it is learned that the German Green Party Chairman Roberthabeck has been appointed by the German Economic Minister since the end of 2021. The government guarantee amount invested by German enterprises in China has reduced 5 billion euros. (Same as the same, about 7.38 billion yuan).</p>
<p>"Mirror Weekly" believes that this is part of the Habeck and the Economic dependence on the Green Party. At the open level, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Habeck and the Federal Economic Affairs of Economic Affairs emphasized that over the past few decades, the government provided by the government has excessively concentrated in China, leading to "excessive concentration of federal budget risks." But all this is also likely to be based on the ideological orientation of the Green Party: the ruling party strives to promote the foreign diplomacy and economic and trade policies dominated by values, and is no longer dominated by economic benefits.However, the German Chamber of Commerce told the author that large German companies in China do not care about the German government's investment guarantee subsidy, and small and medium -sized enterprises may care. This means that it is difficult to limit German investment guarantee subsidies in Chinese companies in China, and it is difficult to limit German companies to increase investment in China.</p>
<p>Another thing that is worth noting is that the German government's new strategy for China has not been released. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Prime Minister's Palace and the Green Party still have significant differences in many issues. Sources in the government circle said that the long -awaited document was unlikely to be released before the summer vacation.</p>
<p>All this happened last week was obviously related to the visit of European Prime Minister's visit to Europe. While Li Qiang faced Habeck during Germany, he hoped that the German would not adopt "discriminatory means", otherwise it would only damage the "healthy economic development". This shows that the view of "de -risk" itself is very fragile, because it has a large gap with facts.</p>

If the location of the machine tool is moved, the sensing device will be launched, and the machine will be locked, causing inability to use it, and the factory authorized representative to unlock. This incident caused heated discussion among netizens.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-01042023102633.html">Foreign Minister: Large enterprises should reduce dependence on dictatorship China</a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hx-11112022121808.html"><strong> Germany successively prevented Chinese enterprises from acquiring two semiconductor companies </strong></a>Recently, DMGMORI, the third in the world, issued a notice that requires RMS (machine tool relocation security) device for each machine tool from April 1, 2023, especially for all Chinese machine tools in China. Add position sensor.</p>
<p>The above news caused a heated discussion. A videos of Douyin.com said that the machine tool in China increases the position sensor, as long as the movement machine cannot be used: "After the machine is moved or disassembled, the RMS will automatically start the machine tool and stop the machine tool. After use, it can only be restarted by DMG or its authorized representatives. If the machine tool is found to be due to unauthorized technical exports or violations of export restrictions, it may be rejected. One means of two supplies. As an industrial parent machine, the machine tool can be a civil product or a military product. Therefore, the imported high -end five -axis machine tool can be said to be handcuffed. "</p>
<p>The netizen said that before, the selling machine tools would send people to the door from time to time to understand whether the machine tool was still in situ. Later, a perception sensor was installed. Once it was moved, it could not be used. He said that the use of these high -end machine tools in China is restricted, and it can't help but sigh whether it is too bullying.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T06-35-00-04-00/000002.png" />Demagi was sold to Chinese machine tools, and once it moved, it was locked.(Network picture/ancient pavilion provided)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt2-06262023062707.html/m0626-gt2p2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T06-35-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Most of China's imported high -end machine tools are used in military industry </strong></p>
<p>Mr. Chen, a mechanical engineer who was unwilling to disclose his name in Gansu, China, told this station that German companies are afraid that China will use its machine tools for military products: "For military industry, early civilian imports are more. More, because the precision processing car tools used in China basically use one or two companies in the world, because this kind of machine tool is different from ordinary machine tools, and it is so used in so many. Basically, others know what you bought Use. The business address of the purchased enterprise and the lathe must be written in the contract and register with the other party. "</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said that most Chinese companies purchased high -end machine tools in the purchase contract must explain to foreign companies as civil products and do not process military products. For example, he said, "Take the Russian and Ukraine War, Sweden purchased the F16 fighter, and the property rights belong to you, but if you want to sell it to Ukraine, you need the United States to agree. The United States does not agree that you cannot sell it."</p>
<p>The explanation of Demagi in a notice is "to prevent the machine tools from being illegally transferred to an individual or country that may threaten international security." It also wrote "If it is found that it is determined that the machine tool is an unauthorized technology export or violates the applicable application The export restrictions have the right to refuse to restart the machine tool. "</p>
<p><strong> Panasonic high -end household production line will evacuate before the end of the year </strong></p>
<p>Professor Yang Haiying, a professor at Shizuoka University in Japan, said in an interview with this station that in addition to worrying about these lathes in the production of military supplies, German companies are also worried about the production of products that are restricted by international implementation of China: "Used on unmanned planes, aircraft carriers are waiting for upside down Now that foreign countries want to be dangerous in China, but on the one hand, they want to do business in China. Because there was a high -end product before, China has always wanted, and the West has never been given. "</p>
<p>In addition, Japanese companies are accelerating the evacuation of China. "Japan Economic News" reported last Friday that Japanese multinational electrical manufacturer Panasonic Holdings decided to move the middle and senior domestic air -conditioning production lines sold in Japan from Guangzhou, China before 2024. Panasonic, the president of the research and development and production of Panasonic, said, "In order to provide products near the market, it was decided to return to Japan to produce. Of course, it was also aware of the risks of geomorphology (geopolitics) of the United States and China. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-26T06-58-51-00-00/000185539_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Do you want to choose the news major and have been searched many times during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.</p>
<p>Among them, the controversy is the famous saying of the Internet Red Education Expo. Who is Zhang Xuefeng? His people set up a professional "postgraduate master" for the majority of parents of parents. In late June, the scores of the college entrance examinations across the country, how to choose volunteers and other issues of college entrance examinations will not decrease. What information does not expose the dispute over the college entrance examination? In the era of inner scrolls, ordinary people are under great pressure, and the most precious of the victims, perhaps the possibility of the next generation.</p>
<p><strong> Professional priority: the result of the inner volume society </strong></p>
<p>The college entrance examination is large, especially for the Chinese, most people have heard the most from a young age, "thousands of troops and thousands of horses squeeze the Duguqiao" or "one test for life". Under such circumstances, the volunteers of the college entrance examination can probably expose the most authentic emotions and demands of the Chinese people, and also expose the trend of social thoughts. Which of the trend is preferred? According to the investigation of China News Network in 2023, "Fill in the College Entrance Examination Volunteer Priority" survey, 36%of netizens believe that priority should be given to specialty, and only 16%of netizens believe that the school should be given priority.</p>
<p>Behind the emphasis on professionalism, on the one hand, the result of the perfect division of labor in the market economy, on the other hand, the more important reason is the result of employment orientation. The economic trend has declined, employment pressure is the first, and the employment problems of young people are exceptionally prominent. The unemployment rate has exceeded 20%, which means that one of the five of the young employment population in 16-24 is unemployed. This change is inseparable from the macro background. When the economy is high, everyone has a lot of room for mental space. You can think about interest and professional possibilities. When the economy slows down, the stock competition becomes the main line. Most people put their livelihoods first. At this time, professionalism is preferred to become the mainstream choice for most people.</p>
<p>In such an upsurge, Zhang Xuefeng, as the postgraduate instructor of the professional background of Zhengzhou University for water drainage engineering, is popular because he can hit the pain point of the times -he knows his positioning, that is, the most suitable suggestion for ordinary family children to recommend The professionalism, the so -called appropriate, is very clear at the moment, is a good life. Regarding the controversy of the outside world, Zhang Xuefeng once responded, "If the family is excellent, choose more, there is no wrong problem!But most families, the conditions are not so good, choose the one that is suitable for you, and let yourself eat it. Fan!Instead of based on the discipline, I do n’t consider the actual situation. I do n’t target anyone any major. I just give suggestions based on the employment situation!The child cannot find your job and is not your teacher, but your parents and your mother!"</p>
<p>Just like most education and training industries, employees seem to be children. In fact, the key to seizing marketing and positioning is to win parents. So what is the group he faced with a group? The children of the college entrance examination are basically post -00s, and their parents are mostly post -70s and 60s. Deng Xiaoping resumed the college entrance examination as soon as possible. Many people's fate was rewritten. The post -70s and 60s were one of the biggest beneficiaries. The post -70s and 60s are also a generation of traditional education, but they often experience the conservation, not the result of the planning, but the helpless natural result -their own parents are often struggling to live and food, and there are many children in the family. Unable to carry out "chicken baby" or dense education for children today.</p>
<p>As for their own professional reports, because they and their parents' parents are extremely lacking background knowledge and professional guidance. Many times they are confused. Many people are actually quite ignorant about how employment their majors are. However, the era when the post -70s and 60s and even the post -80s growing adults are exactly the era when China's economic growth is the fastest. Therefore, their professional choices may not limit their choices. Whether or not they choose their favorite majors, they are mostly in the tide of market economy tide. Floating and heavy, divided into a cake.</p>
<p>As a result, they constitute the backbone of the middle -income group that rose in China's reform and opening up, that is, the middle class in people's mouths, that is, the so -called soft class. The educational philosophy they receive is also different from the former generations. It is more imported products. "Happy education", "respecting children's interest", and "being friends with children" may be the most guidance for parents of this generation.</p>
<p>What is ironic is that when they managed to get used to this set of educational rules that have nothing to do with themselves, even after they invested heavily, when their children reached the college entrance examination, they faced a severe test of survival and faced tremendous competition pressure. They may inevitably feel the sense of shuttle between time, and everything seems to return to their young times -the pressure of making a living is so huge. Even when children fill out the college entrance examination volunteers, personal interests often become the earliest factor.</p>
<p>In this way, a generation of people, their children not only faced the decline in the class, but even the freedom of choice seemed to be much less than they were. Who is this?</p>
<p><strong> Good professional is likely to be pseudo proposition </strong></p>
<p>"In the future, what major is good?" For choosing professional matters, many people come to consult me every year and ask too much, so that I don't want to talk more. The problem is that professional priority is really a good strategy in the future? not necessarily.</p>
<p>Looking back on the various booms and waves we have experienced in these years, there are professional pits, and the more popular majors, the more likely it is to be eliminated in advance.</p>
<p>For example, in the era of the 21st century, the 21st century is biotechnology. Many students have learned biology. As a result, the biology is really counter -work. Many times they need to study for a PhD and it is difficult to graduate. Before and after the WTO, I said that the era of international trade is coming. Many of them study international trade. As a result, I found that there are not so many international trade waiting for you to talk about it, not to mention that the foreign trade industry is not so glorious. For a while, the myth of the popular insurance actuator was popular. After reading it, it was found that it was difficult to say that the development of China's insurance was not as popular as expected. For another example, the topic of cyclical, if the stock market is good, the major of finance and economics is popular. The scores of first -class financial colleges are even better than the unpopular major of Tsinghua University of Peking University; when you encounter a bear market when you graduate, it will be miserable. The construction industry that used to be popular is now the most difficult industry to find a job.</p>
<p>Earlier, in the 1980s, "learning mathematics well, not afraid of traveling all over the world", but there are also saying that missing missiles are better to sell tea eggs; in fact, liberal arts have also been popular. It is even more popular. Today, you may think that the data related to the data is good, but the related majors may soon be replaced by the machine.</p>
<p>What is the conclusion? It is basically unlikely to predict a good professional. There is a basic law -a popular professional, and the possibility of popularity in the future is very low.</p>
<p>In the past thirty or forty years, China is basically a process of continuous stirring of society, so it has changed too quickly; now it is not easy to predict future professional paths to predict future professional paths. In an era of changes, it is difficult for us to predict well, and in the era of generation artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT, prediction is even more difficult. Not to mention, the professional settings of Chinese universities are often the heritage of Soviet universities, excessive refinement, and serious lag.So the question is, how to choose the college entrance examination volunteer?</p>
<p><strong> The volunteer of the college entrance examination cannot be sorted by the triangle: school, city, professional </strong></p>
<p>In the volunteer reporting of the college entrance examination, similar to economics, there is also an impossible triangle, that is, good professional, good schools, and good cities. In this case, then I will tell the conclusions first, the first choice of the school, the second choice of the city, and finally a good professional. why? Because who you learn from, in fact, what you learn, more important, and good professional, many times are false questions.</p>
<p>Back to a fundamental question, choosing a good profession is actually choosing a relatively reliable future. Doctoral doctoral academics are a very few people, which is another gameplay; for most people, choosing a major is to find a good career future to graduate.</p>
<p>The importance of a good school is beyond doubt, so why should you put the city in a very important position? Looking for a good job, in fact, like buying a house, the location is the most important. Therefore, consider the city you want to graduate. From graduation employment considerations, it is not just to think about it, but to be suitable for you. In fact, if you are from small and medium -sized cities, you can go to the coast and big cities to see it, which is more eye -opening; even if he is a person in first- and second -tier cities, you will go to work in your hometown in the future and change to a city to see it.</p>
<p>Changing the city is actually to understand different lifestyles, which is equivalent to half of studying abroad. Westerners emphasize that young people travel to study, but they are not all burned by money, but let young people come into contact with different civilizations in different world -a bit similar, such as Japanese scholars studying Chinese history, and found that many founding emperors of China were born in The place where the regional dividing line is so easily grasped naturally. If you are from Zhejiang, even if you want to work in Hangzhou in the future, it is also an experience when you come to Shanghai to school; if you are from Shanghai, go out of Shanghai and study in Beijing, even if you work in Shanghai in the future, you have to work in Beijing. Not more knowledge.</p>
<p>A friend used to say a case before. If you are a Shanghai native, "If you are going to elementary school in Fuwai, the middle school to the talent is in Shanghai New University, then the square is not more than 1 kilometer. You think this day How boring? "Friends who are familiar with Shanghai should know that Foreign Foreign Language School is the Foreign Language School of Fushan, and Jincai Middle School and Shanghai New York University are all in Pudong. He also has a classmate of Zhejiang University, that is, Wen San Road Primary School Middle School and then Zhejiang -Daxi Campus.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, they are cities, not schools, nor professional. why is it like this? Because finding a job, where is it, what is more important than learning. Big cities have more high -quality job opportunities. If you are near the water tower, it is easier to locate them.</p>
<p>Whether it is useful or useful, especially when entering the industry, the major is knocking on the stepping tiles. But most of the thresholds in the world are for people outside the threshold. If you are within the threshold, your professional is no longer important; if someone recognizes you within the threshold, the threshold is not so important -this may not necessarily say that the relationship is pulled. In other words, many times, good jobs do not require professional counterparts, comprehensive abilities, and framework vision, which is more important.</p>
<p>For example, the financial industry, many people think that they are financial backgrounds, at least economics -related, but after deep understanding, they find that there are all one line, and it may not be worse than the science class. As for the media, let alone say that the news was born, and this wave of disputes also revealed shortcomings. What is the problem? Most jobs are dry middle schools. The knowledge of university is just a background board. A piece of white paper may be better than the unsuccessful semi -finished product. The conclusion is that who you are, what you learn is more important. In the final analysis, everyone's destiny is a self -choice.</p>
<p><strong> Future education </strong></p>
<p>In this era, the rules in the past are being broken, and education must also change their thinking.</p>
<p>Exploring the essence of education, whether or not it is added with duck education or packaging of quality education, I personally think that the essence of education is to screen, screen qualified persons, and screen people who do not fall behind. The core is that we must strive to become a few people in the fierce competition market. To win in the internal competition, it is not more obedient. First of all, you should avoid repetitive and low -level competition. Listening to other people's words to choose a static professionalism, it is a way that seems easy to be eliminated. Of course, this suggestion does not apply to everyone, for people who are interested in expanding their growth and achievement.</p>
<p>I will deal with different people in my work. I have seen people and experiences of so many circles, and I found that who is, what is more important than learning. This is not to say that a person can change his life against the sky, but a personality, luck, and starting point. It often determines the path of a person. They are becoming more and more important than personal abilities. The ancients talked about life and said, "One life, two games, three feng shui, four accumulation of yin and virtue and five reading." You see, reading is behind, what is even more so. In a soft class society, the possibility of counterattacks in the class is decreasing, and the possibility of decline in the class increases. What does this time mean to individuals? Survival is easy and developed. The key to why the words such as inside rolls, small towns, and 985 waste are now popular. The key is that when you have a good profession, you cannot guarantee smoothly as in the past.</p>
<p>You may ask if there is an opportunity to overtake the curve, so, but there are people who have such abilities, and no one needs to have an idea for him. A netizen of a public name "Xu Jin Economic Man" concluded- "The top candidate has their favorite majors, secondary candidates for their own suitable majors, high -ranking candidates, and other people to choose to choose majors." This sounds a bit too strong, but it makes sense.</p>
<p>Back to the professional problem, since everything can be wrong, it is better to be a little more than the Buddha. For parents, let children choose a major that they can at least accept.

<p>On the second day when the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group rebelled the drama, the Russian President Putin and <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230624-1407486">Wagner's head Priggen Ren</a>None of them appeared publicly, increasing the uncertainty and confusion of the Russian situation.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported that after Putin made a short TV speech on the country on Saturday (June 24) in the morning, Sunday did not appear publicly on Sundays, and Pryigo's whereabouts were still unknown.</p>
<p>On the other hand, official Russian media have accused and degraded Pleigen, but some criticisms on Putin and others have begun to surface.</p>
<p>The Kremlin Sunday's "This week", the official position was clarified at the beginning, saying that "the launch of armed rebellion in Russia will not get social support." Dmitrykislyov, an anchor and senior cultural propaganda director, said in the show: "During the war, the crime of tradition was serious crimes."</p>
<p>The show followed up <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230624-1407496">National TV Speech on Saturday morning on Saturday in Putin</a>Putin said, "splitting unity is a knife behind Russia", but he did not mention Pleigen's name.</p>
<p>More than eight hours after Putin's speech, all Russian news media suddenly issued a statement of Palace spokesman Pedkov, saying that President Whitelle Lukashenko came out to mediate under the consent of Putin. Criminal proceedings that launch armed rebellions in Ligo](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230625-1407576); To recognize Wagner's previous services to Russia, the government will not take any action on the Wagner soldiers participating in the incident.</p>
<p>Peskov also said that although Putin had previously vowed to punish those who participated in the mutiny, the "higher goal" of the mediation agreement was to avoid confrontation and bleeding. The Wagner soldiers who did not participate in the mutiny will sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>Kie Lavv's Sunday report showed that the Uprising of Pryigo did not receive the support of the public. In short, it concluded that Perigon was a traitor, and his rebellion was meaningless to Russia's unity.</p>
<p>NTV, another state -owned channel of Russia, also echoed the position of Ke Palace's "This week" in a summary report. It also mentioned that <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230625-1407610">the American intelligence department has already mastered the Wagner's brewing of a mutiny</a>But remained silent, implying the participation of foreign forces.</p>
<p>Russian state -owned television stations are the main source of news from the older generation, but young Russian young people mostly use social media to apply Telegram, but the news and comments on this platform are not all reliable.</p>
<p>A group of influential and war -supporting Russian bloggers were in a dilemma. On the one hand, they admired Pryigon and Wagner mercenaries, but on the other hand, they were frustrated by Porigen's rebellion.</p>
<h4>Where is the Russian military leadership when a mutiny occurs?</h4>
<p>A blogger named Yuri Kotenok shouted loudly on Telegram and asked where the Russian military leadership disappeared when the mutiny crisis disappeared.</p>
<p>The Russian Minister of Defense, who has been violently criticized by Pryo, and Grassimov, chief of military staff, has not appeared or delivered after the mutiny.</p>
<p>Although analysts outside Russia believe that the rapidly calming mutiny has greatly damaged Putin's standpoint reputation, and the Russian official media did not expect to regard this day as a comprehensive victory of Moscow.</p>
<p>However, there are still a few people in Russia that the problems exposed by the one -day mutiny need to be resolved urgently.</p>
<p>At 11 am on June 23rd, the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group's head of Perigo released a series of stickers on the social media platform, questioning the Kremlin's motivation for launching the Ukraine War, and accused Russian Defense Minister, Shi Yigu ordered a fatal fighter aircraft to be fatal. Air strike. At midnight on the same day, the Russian Federal Security Agency launched an investigation against Pritigen for armed rebellion.</p>
<p>The Wagner forces controlled Rostov on the River on the 24th at 7:30 on the 24th, and went north to Moscow to Moscow all the way. Putin made a TV speech nationwide at 10 am, calling on the country to unite the war in Ukraine and its allies, saying that "split our unity is to stab the knife behind our country and the people."</p>
<p>At 8:30 pm on the 24th, a dramatic turning point in the Russian mutiny, <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230625-1407836">Under the mediation of President White Ros, President Lukashenko</a>Poligon agreed to stop the army of Moscow and exile in exile. As a exchange, Pryigon and Wagner soldiers were guaranteed to be safe. According to the analysis, although Putin quickly resolved the crisis, the armed rebellion had exposed his fragile situation.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体创纪录的青年失业率令北京头疼/a-65913772">China's unemployment rate is high</a><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国青年失业率208再创纪录/a-65936894">In May, a 20.8%historical high</a>Essence In order to alleviate the dilemma of "graduation and unemployment" of fresh graduates, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security) announced that it will implement a half -year employment counseling plan from July to December to assist in college that has not yet found jobs that have not yet found jobs. Graduates and unemployed youths jobs.</p>
<p>Chinese official media CCTV reported on the 25th that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that this plan called "2023 college graduates such as college graduates such as employment service tackling operations" will strengthen policy implementation, service guarantee, rights and interests, difficulties and help, and strive to allow let "Unlimited graduates with willingness to employment" and "registering unemployed youth" have achieved employment or employment preparation activities before the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Weibo netizens hold skeptical attitude</h3>
<p>However, Weibo netizens did not pay for this policy promoted by China. DW tried to search for related news on Weibo and found that the netizens left a message below the relevant reports were mostly suspicion of this "tackling operation".</p>
<p>Some netizens said that the employment situation of Chinese youth has been sluggish for a while. The government did not launch the rescue plan until recently, so that he had a feeling of "waiting for a long time and waiting for this?" And Chinese netizens said: "You don't have a look at it either Do you still recruit people now? "And think <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济疫后复苏乏力/a-65889478">China's economic environment is not optimistic</a>The management has no need for talent, and the government has more employment media activities. It is also unsuitable. The gap between the government's policy and reality made netizens sigh: "Can you open your eyes and see us and float in the sky every day?"</p>

<p>In addition, there are many messages pointed out: "What is the number of people in the postgraduate entrance examination this year?"

What do you think of people? Do you have so many opportunities in the market? Do graduates want to work? Two weeks later, if you have unemployment, do you get an accountant to clear zero? "</p>
<h3>China Youth Employment is unprecedentedly difficult</h3>
<p>In the past 20 years, the rapid growth of China's economy has created a large number of job opportunities, but with the shift from China's dense manufacturing to a high -tech export -oriented economy, the rising rate of the youth unemployment rate is far more than other population groups; the Chinese government is in the current government; the Chinese government is in the market. During the epidemic period, he vigorously suppressed science and technology and education, causing a large -scale layoffs to hire enterprises with higher education young people, which even worsened the situation.</p>
<p>In response, the "Asian Labor Review" researcher and executive editor Kevinlin recently told DW: "For young people in China, it may now be the most difficult period for re -employment or finding the first job in the past 20 years." [[[[[[[[[[[<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率居高不下-靠孔乙己脱长衫解决/a-65732307"> Part of analysis</a>It is believed that the Chinese employment market meets a large number of graduates every year, and its real scale of its youth unemployment rate has been covered by the government for decades. At the end of the 1990s, China's university enrollment rate increased significantly, and the number of new students increased by more than 40%within a year. By 2021, there were about 44 million undergraduate students in public colleges and universities in China.</p>
<p>The British "Guardian" reported that such a dilemma has made young Chinese people make many special actions, such as taking "lying" and stuffing the diploma into the trash can, etc. The Chinese people poured into the temple for soul comfort. The report quoted the data of tourism websites that the visit rate of temples in some scenic spots has increased by 367%compared with the same period last year, and about half of them are "post -90s" young people.</p>

<p>A research report published by the American Institute of Foreign Affairs of North Korea compared the current military tensions of the region to the eve of the Korean War (1950-1953), and criticized the Washington and the Seoul simulation of anti-Communist military confrontation and speech threats.</p>
<p>In an English report released by the official Central News Agency of North Korea, the Ministry stated that "this kind of aggression in the United States has further intensified the military tensions of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. The edge of the war. "</p>
<p>The report believes that the United States "has more resolutely adopted a shocking hostile action than ever this year, arbitrarily violated North Korea's sovereignty and security, and has reached the point where it can no longer tolerate."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-26T08-58-39/42-1687769325.jpg" />On the occasion of the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, Pyongyang held a demonstration against the United States.(European News Agency)</p>
<h4>World War</h4>
<p>The report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea warned that the Korean Peninsula War "" will quickly expand into the global war and the world's non -precedent thermal nuclear war, which will cause the most disastrous consequences to peace and security in the region and other parts of the world. "</p>
<p>According to the report, Pyongyang "will continue to speed up efforts to enhance self -defense capabilities to protect its sovereignty, unless the United States abandon its outdated hostility policy and continuous military threats to North Korea."</p>
<p>On Sunday, June 25th is the 73rd anniversary of the Korean War. The main North Korean newspaper "Labor News" stated that "the United States has continuously deployed strategic nuclear assets such as nuclear submarines and strategic bomber on the Korean Peninsula, which exacerbates the tension of the Korean Peninsula."</p>
<p>The newspaper focused on the "ambition to invade North Korea in the United States", emphasizing that military exercises between the United States and its allies are similar to the situation before the outbreak of the Korean War.</p>

<p>On the 73rd anniversary of the war, the Pyongyang authorities organized large -scale demonstrations to condemn the United States.</p>
<p>According to the North Korean Society, about 120,000 workers and students participated in the rally organized by the capital.</p>

<p>A Chinese female owner of a women's clothing store in the capital of Grandan Dan Prefecture, Malaysia, was issued a ticket by law enforcement officers in the Belong Balu City Council, because she wore T -shirts with shorts and shorts in the store.</p>
<p>Xingzhou.com reported that the incident took place at 11:10 am on Sunday (June 25). The female owner named Li who received the ticket said that she has been in a women's clothing shop for more than two years. She has always worn T -shirt shorts for business. In the past, she worked like this in a barber shop and had not received a ticket.</p>
<p>"My women's clothing store, customers are mainly Chinese women."</p>
<p>At that time, she begged the law enforcement officers, and the other party did not merge, and issued a ticket directly instead of a warning letter first.</p>
<p>According to the penalty, the Council of Boalu City Council quoted the 2019 Gejulu City Council Commercial Trade and Industrial Government Regulations.</p>
<p>Lin Guangsheng, a member of the Gejulu city, confirmed that the law enforcement officer of the city council was confirmed. The Jilandan Hall of China will plead with the Grandan government for the woman who receives the ticket.</p>
<p>Huang Baojun, Datuk, Datuk, Datuk of the Jilandan Hall of China, said that the city council should not issue a ticket immediately, and should be given a warning first. He did not agree with law enforcement officers to issue a ticket because of the owner wearing shorts. However, he also suggested that female owners should not wear too short pants when they are in business.</p>
<p>"Jilandan is the belonging to the Islamic Party. Although everyone enjoys freedom of dressing, we must also respect each other. Respect the different cultures and customs of each state."</p>
<p>In any case, Huang Baojun said that it would affect the impression of tourists' impression of Jilandan. He reminded everyone to pay more attention to avoid re -acting similar to unpleasant incidents.</p>
<p>Rosenatz, the chairman of the Gejulu City Council, said that if the female owner wore ordinary shorts, there was no problem, but her wearing that day was completely different from the photos of Facebook.</p>
<p>A photo passed to Starzhou.com on Rosnatz, showing a woman wearing a pink T -shirt, the length of the T -shirt to the thigh, covering her shorts. A female law enforcement officer next to me is watching some documents.</p>
<p>When asked how short shorts were "not dignified", and the specific content of the 34th (2) (b) of the regulations of the Battle of Balu City Council's commercial trade and industrial local governments in 2019, he said lightly when he avoided the matter. Will be handed over to the city council secretary to follow up.</p>
<p>According to other channels from Xingzhou.com, the relevant provisions can also be applied to non -Muslims, that is, owners and employees must be "dignified", but the provisions do not clarify the specific definition of dignity.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-26T10-32-58-08-00/24dc-russia-1-kmqv-master1050.jpg" />For more than a year, the minds of US officials lingered around a question they dare not publicize: Will the war that Russia messed into Ukraine in the end will eventually cause President Putin to collapse?</p>
<p>In this chaotic weekend, it seems that the above concepts are no longer so incredible. However, although the direct threat formed by Yofgeni Porigo's mercenary rebellion seems to have ended, this short -term mutiny shows that Putin's control of power is more vulnerable than at any time since he took office 20 years ago. Essence</p>
<p>This may be the most turbulent moment since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The consequences of the mutiny have made President Biden and US policy makers facing both opportunities and dangerous. Just as the Ukrainian army is launching a long -awaited counterattack, domestic chaos may lead to the failure of the Russian war. Essence</p>
<p>"For the United States, the attention of the Russians is dispersed. This is beneficial. This will weaken their military plans in Ukraine and make them unlikely to continue to provoke new problems in Syria and other places," McCane's international leadership Executive Director of the Institute of Li and former US Department of Defense, Ivelin Fakas, said. "We are most concerned about ensuring that professional soldiers maintain control of all nuclear facilities."</p>
<p>Although the armed conflict that moved to Moscow this time was short, it was the most eye -catching power struggle in Russia for more than 20 years. Before, the attempts against Mikhail Gorbachev had previously occurred in 1991, as well as In 1993, Boris Yeltsin and the last show of the parliament. But unlike those two, Washington did not have a special favorite party in this power struggle. Purig is no more friendly than Putin to the United States.</p>
<p>Biden's response to this crisis did not respond, he chose to be cautious instead of publicly. Public development sounds may provide Putin with a handle that allows Putin to blame foreign conspiracy. Whenever Russia encounters trouble, this is the common saying of the Kremlin. Biden delayed the departure to the David Camp. At a restaurant in the White House (Wardroom, is now used as a temporary war room, the actual war room is being renovated) with senior consultants The leader called.</p>
<p>President's national security adviser Jack Shalvin, in order to accompany Bayeng to David, canceled the trip to Denmark to fight for support for Ukraine, and held a meeting that was originally scheduled to be held in Denmark through a video. General Mark Milly also canceled visit to Israel and Jordan. However, in addition to reiterating the support of Ukraine, the US government has maintained silence. While watching the development of the situation, officials have studied information to understand what is happening.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. government has been drafting the emergency plan for a long time, it has been the same as others on Saturday. In addition to the traditional source of information, it also relies on social media and other online resources to obtain solid information from Russia. , Interpret it.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are particularly concerned about Russia's nuclear arsenal, and they are anxious about the unstable countries that have the ability to destroy most regions on the planet and feel anxious. But a senior US official said that the government did not notice any changes in Russian weapons layout, so it did not change the US nuclear situation.</p>
<p>"Things have developed quite fast, so it is difficult to know where it is, but for the United States, the two major problems are the command and control of nuclear weapons, and the impact of more territorial efforts on Ukraine's liberation." Russian expert James Goldgael said.</p>
<p>Andreia KFC-Taylor, who has now worked at the New American Security Center, has long been Russian intelligence analysts. She said that the United States has limited ability to influence the Russian incident and should focus on preventing violence and chaos.</p>
<p>"Washington should avoid promoting the deep -rooted fear of Russia, that is, the United States or NATO will seek to use this confusion," she said. "This will be very important for Moscow to prevent excessive reactions, and in the long run, it is important to do this to do this with a stable relationship with a future Russia."</p>
<p>Regardless of what US officials think, they have regarded Russia's incidents as evidence of Putin's status. For a few months, they have been following the quarrel with the continuous upgrading of the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defense on the management of the Ukrainian war. Like others, they want to know why Putin tolerate such an open objection. They guess this Whether the President of Russia is for his own political purpose, it secretly encouraged this quarrel.</p>

<p>But last Saturday, the White House and US national security agencies have basically not doubted Pleigo's arbitrary damage to Putin. Porigon was an important assistant to Russia's president. He planned to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. Now, he has publicly refuted all the reasons for Putin's launch of the Ukrainian war, and denies that the invasion is Russia's legitimate response to the so -called Ukraine and NATO threat.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the launch of the crisis last Saturday, Putin compared the situation to 1917 when he gave a speech nationwide. It was the last year of the last Tsar government's collapse in a bad war. This comparison only encouraged people to grow people. The image of the leader of the Kremlin's out of control to the country. Putin threatened to destroy Perigo, but reached an agreement with the latter a few hours later, which strengthened a reality: Putin no longer greatly permits Putin for the use of force on Russia.</p>
<p>"It is very clear: Putin looks very weak," said Arina Polyova, director of the European Policy Analysis Center in Washington, but she added that the collapse of the Putin government will also bring its own danger. The United States and its allies "should focus on supporting Ukraine, and at the same time formulate plans for all possible situations, including the collapse of Putin regime, the government is replaced by the right right, this faction is more cruel and more restrained in the Ukrainian war."</p>
<p>Even if Putin continues to be in power, policy makers are worried that if Putin feels that he is forced to the corner, he may become more elusive. "Weakness can trigger Putin's more dangerous behavior," Hong Bopei, who had served as the US ambassador to Russia during the presidential period of Trump(Jon Huntsman Jr.)explain. "Putin's" Winning "has a new turmoil, which can be used from all angles."</p>
<p>Russia's civil strife has brought unbeatable comfort to Ukraine. Ukraine has been working hard to drive the invaders out of its territory with American weapons suppliers and intelligence officials, but its long -awaited counterattack progress has slowly.</p>
<p>The Wagner Group's mercenary organization led by Porigon has been regarded as the most effective Russian power on the Ukrainian battlefield. However, as the organization has appealing leaders in exile in Belarus, the mercenary is being absorbed by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The group may no longer be the fierce combat troops.Indeed, Kurite Walker, who was the U.S. Ambassador to NATO and Ukraine, said that Pleigo's citizenship marked the beginning of the end of the Ukrainian war and Putin's term, although the agreement reached by Putin and Pleigo was interrupted The march to Moscow.</p>
<p>"Don't believe in retreat," he said. "This is preparing. Pricigen wants to be regarded as a hero of Russians while fighting for more support and putting forward requirements. The Putin government will not let him go. Express. "</p>
<p>In Walker's words, there will be "more boots falling down."</p>

<p>North Korea pointed out that the recent situation in the Korean Peninsula is similar to the 625 war (that is, the Korean War) period, and North Korea will continue to promote nuclear military strengthening policies.</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reported that the North Korean Society said on Monday (June 26) that the North Korean Institute of Foreign Affairs and the US Institute said in a report that affected by the anti -Korean military confrontation and threats of the United States and South Korea, The military political situation is the same as before the Korean War broke out in the 1950s. It means that the United States' good behavior will push the military tensions of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, which has been pushed to the edge of the nuclear war.</p>
<p>The US Institute of Foreign Affairs of North Korea also said that this year the United States has focused on infringing the autonomy and security interests of North Korea, and the severity and risk of the situation have reached a situation where they are no longer tolerated. Only the strong self -defense nuclear deterrent power can fully protect the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, guard the peace and stability of the region, and prevent the war from erupting again.</p>
<p>The Institute said that the United States' anti -era of the enemy's policy and military threats will not be eliminated for a day, and North Korea will accelerate the implementation of self -defense national defense to strengthen policies and continue to exercise the state's legitimate self -defense rights.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that North Korea's above advocacy aims to push the responsibility of improving military forces to the United States, and find excuses for further provocation in the future.</p>
<p>On June 25th, the 73rd anniversary of the Korean War broke out, and anti -American rally was held throughout North Korea on the same day.</p>

<p><strong> Taiwan disaster defense expert: eliminating hidden dangers must come from front -line safety precautions </strong></p>
<p>The price of the king said: "Whether there is enough risk awareness for the education and training of the front -line staff. Once the situation is encountered, how to notify and start the entire strain disaster procedure in the limited time, all rely on the ability and energy of the front line. If this risk is on this risk. The signal cannot be read, and there are only crisis treatment and emergency response in the back. "As for the flashing accident of the Lanzhou Petrochemical Factory, 80 % of the king's prices were judged that 80 % of them were artificially negligible, involving the source of explosive items, transportation, manufacturing, equipment, etc., and whether the manpower and capabilities were sufficient: "All public security incidents will not suddenly explode suddenly There must be signs and spiders that can be followed. It is likely that the monitoring team of the factory or the safety strain group does not consciously or ignore these signals, and it will accumulate to a certain energy to cause incidents. These negligences are links that must be improved. "</p>
<p><strong> Original firefighters: Bringing of the industry, security, water release, etc. must be eliminated </strong></p>
<p>Gong and Jian, a person in China, said that he had done a contract -based firefighter in China: "The fire protection power is very large, and the fire prevention inspection of the Fire Department has serious problems in corruption. For each inspection, just a soldier like me, you can receive high -end smoke that is directly stuffed to you at one time, and sell about 1,000 yuan for second -hand stores. You can imagine how much the higher -level bribes are responsible for the inspectors. ? I have seen it with my own eyes. Those who were inspected were publicly stuffed with red envelopes to fire inspectors. It was thick and stacked, at least 10,000 pieces. "</p>
<p>Gong Yujian said that most of the public safety accidents were caused by human disasters because they did not check in strict accordance with fire regulations. If the ranking is truly implemented, it can reduce the disaster.</p>
<p>Gong and Jian also revealed that China's fire brigade is equipped with full -time fire correspondents and the missionary center to handle press releases. The news that can be on the media is very small rescue. The disaster is either pressed down to silence or only the size of the tofu block. The traffic bridge collapsed in his city, and the authorities organized the province to rescue the province. However, how many people who were killed under the bridge were still national secrets, and local media had almost no reports.</p>

Wu Zhisen said that after the National Security Law, there is almost no time to comment in Hong Kong. It is difficult for the media to play the role of the "fourth power" to supervise the government. Overseas reviews can fill this gap.</p>
<p>Wu Zhisen: "There are still many Hong Kong people who are very concerned about the development of current affairs and Hong Kong. They are not willing to be covered in the drums and want to continue to understand the environment in which they are. "Watchdog", but many Hong Kong media have been cut off, because everyone knows that now it is just 'and thin mud', news and comments will only be brought gently, the media can no longer speak, in Hong Kong, in Hong Kong, in Hong Kong, in Hong Kong. We cannot hear these news and interpret these news, and we have room for comments according to facts. These Hong Kong people think that it is worth listening and can provide them with real information. "</p>
<p><strong> Zeng Zhihao: The mainstream of the online evaluation program is Mandarin Hong Kong Cantonese Review Demand in Cantonese Rating increases development space </strong></p>
<p>Zeng Zhihao said that although there are many different comments on the Internet, there are not many hosts who use Cantonese and Hong Kong styles.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhihao: "YouTube of the Chinese World, many of them talk about mainland China, may be Xi Jinping, Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping every day. Hong Kong is relatively small. I also need to pay attention. That needs are still there, so overseas comments are a bit like the concept of foreign purchasing. I am in Hong Kong, but my vision is not absent in the world. You can buy some comments. I hope that it is funny, or I want to listen to the bed division. I feel that this can really have a lot of market demand. "</p>

For the first time, they lived on the scene in Taiwan for the first time, attracting dozens of Hong Kong people from different places to participate in Taipei. There were thousands of people watching online.</p>
<p><strong> Wu Zhisen: When overseas continues the "Headline News" style, it commented on the channel for Hong Kong people to miss Hong Kong. </strong>Wu Zhisen: "You can't estimate how far the audience is from. A listener had been played in Croatia for many years. He wanted to say the Croatian's cultural conflict on the show. Because they did not have the opportunity to be locally, they could share them in Cantonese. In the alien life, they want to share on our programs and platforms before they have the opportunity to find their identity. This platform can create this effect, which is expected. "</p>
<p>Zeng Zhihao said that there are not many online programs that arrange audiences to call and share. Their shows used the popular program mode back to Hong Kong to make the audience find the feeling of Hong Kong people.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhihao: "When we do a show every week, everyone's favorite is my call in(See the phone) link. Later, we found that the audience had a lot of opinions to express, or they had a lot of emotions in their respective life fields, and they needed to be vent. There was a callin link. They cherished, warmed, and communicated. Overseas needs to find themselves from Hong Kong people. We are really so -called 'weconnect' to give them virtually(connect)Essence "</p>
<p>** Zeng Zhihao: There are too many red lines under the national security law.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhihao said that in overseas, it is difficult to escape the influence of the National Security Law. If you want to continue to make time -judges, you can only make a decision between Hong Kong and freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhihao: "Continue to continue, that risk is getting farther and farther from Hong Kong. I still retained the space in the Ming Pao in Hong Kong. When you are supplied overseas, you are really free to write down. You will encounter some red lines in Hong Kong. As a result, you will make a choice. If you have this psychological preparation, the risk of returning to Hong Kong will increase. connect."</p>
<p>Wu Zhisen said that the red line of the National Security Law is uncertain, political review is pervasive, and the issue of people's livelihood issues involves politics, so that everyone’s risk values are different every day. It can only be said that they do the same work in Hong Kong overseas and do the same work in Hong Kong. The risk is relatively low, but no one can accurately evaluate.</p>

<h3>New crown traceability: The American intelligence report shows that the internal differences of Huafu, the "zero patient" vote for the disease</h3>
<p>11:07 am on June 26, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-26T11-07-16.000Z/_130207219_121120.2023-05-16t121029z_747391960_rc2gc0a6nem4_rtrmadp_3_global-pandemics-bats-origins.jpg"></a>Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The new crown traceability problem has been arguing in the United States for a long time, and it is also an important part of affecting the deadlock of Sino -US relations. The Wuhan Virus Research Institute is one of the focus of controversy.</p>
<p><strong> A decryption report in the United States shows that the intelligence circle failed to find direct evidence, which proved that the 2019 coronary virus (COVID-19; Neo-Crown Virus disease) originated from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but at the same time, it cannot be ruled out. </strong></p>
<p>The report from the Office of the National Intelligence Director (ODNI) stated that the American intelligence agencies agreed that the new crown virus was neither genetically modified nor the laboratory domestication. But the possibility of viruses from nature or laboratory still exists.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the report, the Wall Street Journal quoted the Washington Intelligence Circle that the three researchers of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute were the new crown "Zero Patient", and the two of them actively came into contact with the well -known American academic magazine "Science" and denied the relevant statement.</p>
<p>The new crown traceability problem has been arguing in the United States for a long time, and it is also an important part of affecting the deadlock of Sino -US relations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (June 26) states that the United States should "disclose the situation of Detrickburg and the biological laboratory set up around the world, giving the people of the world a responsible explanation."</p>

The authoritative scientific conclusion is accurately reflected in the joint research report of the China -WHO's traceability, and has also been widely recognized by the international and scientific communities. "</p>
<p>"The United States should immediately stop the politicalization, toolization, and weaponization of traceability issues, stop planting discredit, dazzling the pot, and dumb the doubts of their existence, and respond to the reasonable concern of the international community as soon as possible ...

<p>June 2021: BBC's "News Night" investigated the theory of leakage in the Wuhan Laboratory, interviewed a number of experts, and analyzed the reason.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the intelligence agency, what are the new discoveries</h3>
<p>In March, the US Congress passed the bill to order information about the intelligence agency to decrypt documents about the Wuhan Virus Research Institute within 90 days. The Office of the National Intelligence Director published the decryption document last Friday (23rd).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Report-on-Potential-Links-Between-the-Wuhan-Institute-of-Virology-and-the-Origins-of-COVID-19-20230623.pdf">This 10 -page long report said</a>: "Because two assumptions (natural or laboratory) relied on a large number of assumptions or facing contradictory report challenges, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other agencies still cannot determine the accurate source of COVID-19."</p>
<p>The report pointed out that four U.S. government agencies believe that the virus is infected with humans from animals, and the other two organs -the Energy and FBIs (FBI) -still believe that the virus is leaking the laboratory.</p>
<p>According to the survey report, the US intelligence circle has not been able to exclude the new crown virus comes from the laboratory, but all intelligence agencies agree that the new coronal virus does not originate from the development of biochemical weapons.</p>

<p>However, the report also proposed that scientists at Wuhan Virus Research Institute built different coronary viruses "chimelas" and used the Reverse GeneticCloning technology, which made the hidden intentional modification possible.</p>
<p>According to the report, some researchers may not take sufficient biological safety guarantee measures during the operation experiment before the new crown epidemic.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Lab "Patient No. 0" refers to "fake news"</h3>
<p>However, according to the report, the U.S. Intelligence Institute had unknown laboratory accidents that have occurred in the Wuhan Virus Research Institute.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that the accident occurred in the fall of 2019, and several researchers were infected. However, the report also believes that they are infected with other diseases, and some symptoms do not match the new coronal virus disease.</p>

According to the official website of the Institute, its research direction includes new pathogens of bats and rodents.

<p>Yu Ping described the allegations as "fake news". "Science" magazine quoted her: "In the fall of 2019, I have no illness nor any new crown symptoms."</p>
<p>The two also denied any living virus experiments.</p>

<p>April 2021: David Nabarro, the WHO New Crown Special Envoy, said that from the past experience, the traceability of the virus rarely finds clear road signs.</p>

<p>"Science" magazine said that Shi Zhengli confirmed the magazine's statement via email, and said that Hu Ben, Yu Ping and Zhu Yan had only used RNA to extract genetic sorting, and did not contact the living virus.</p>
<p>The magazine also quoted the French National Science Research Center (CNRS) researcher Dr FlorenceDébarre, a researcher at the National Science Research Center (CNRS) who has participated in the virus data of Wuhan South China Seafood wholesale market.</p>
<p>Wuhan South China Seafood wholesale market is the first place where the new crown virus cluster is infected. Supporters of laboratory leaks pointed out that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute is only a 40 -minute drive from the South China wholesale market.</p>
<p>Dr. Dabare said that she had an open attitude towards laboratory leaks. Now she believes that the new crown virus comes from nature and take the initiative to play with the laboratory leaks on the Internet. <a href="https://twitter.com/flodebarre/status/1632422117173067778">Zeng Yujia is one of the targets of Dabre's public counterpart</a> 。</p>

<h3>American politics to send artillery to the Biden government</h3>
<p>John Ratcliffe, who served as the director of the National Intelligence, responded to the latest decryption report during the president of Donald Trump, responded to the latest decryption report, accusing the current president Joebiden and its government "continuously confusing audiovisual".</p>
<p>Ratclyve said in a statement: "Laboratory leakage is the only theory that is supported by science, intelligence and common sense."Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>In the bill of Biden (left) signed a Congress requesting the decryption investigation report in March, he said that his expectations were consistent with Congress, and the more information he could distribute, the better.</p>
<p>The joint investigation conducted by the Chinese government and the UN World Health Organization (WHO) in early 2021 believes that the laboratory leakage theory is "extremely impossible." <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science-56587444">This conclusion caused the WHO to suffer violently</a>Many experts believe that such a conclusion cannot give enough answers, and only more questions are derived.</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Corporation of the United States reported that the Republican House of Republican House Intelligence Committee chairman Miketurner and the President of the Special Group Committee of the New Crown Virus Brad Wenstrup, the President of the New Crown Virus. The decryption report increases the credibility of the laboratory leakage theory.</p>
<p>"The Communist Party of China and the Chinese PLA must be explained solemnly with the Chinese PLA."</p>
<p>"While we are grateful for the report of the Office of the State Intelligence Director, the search and survey of the source of the new crown virus disease must continue."</p>
<p>However, some experts believe that for the new coronal virus disease that leads to nearly 7 million people around the world, its real source may never be known.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-26T11-07-52/1-1687773051.jpg" />Iraq's new budget may be greater than favorable</p>
<p>The Iraqi National Assembly passed the federal budget in 2023, 2024, and 2025 on June 12. At this time, it was established for nearly eight months from the new government of Prime Minister Mohammed Sudani.</p>
<p>This year's budget was the largest in Iraq, reaching 19.89 trillion in Iraqi, and was calculated about $ 153 billion at an official exchange rate. The budgets in 2024 and 2025 will remain unchanged unless the cabinet requires any modification and is approved by parliament.</p>
<p>The government uses the 2019 Financial Management Law for the first time, which allows the law to formulate a budget for up to three years. Iraq has not only progressed slowly through budgets, but also has not passed the budget at all in the past nine years -in 2014, 2020 and 2020, and 2020, respectively 2022.</p>
<p>Although the budget in 2023 is only half a year, people can rest assured that the budget will be covered in the next two years to ensure that the government will hold the next federal election at the end of 2025 and have a budget before the provincial parliament elections in this year.</p>
<p>The federal budget also allows the government to provide funds for local investment projects and hire hundreds of thousands of public sector employees, which has a positive impact on the Prime Minister and its governing alliances and increase their ability to elevation in the two upcoming elections.</p>
<h4>ambitious but at stake</h4>
<p>However, Iraq's economy and budgets are seriously dependent on oil, which has caused both of them to be unstable, and almost all national income comes from oil sales. In 2022, Iraq earned a record 115.6 billion US dollars from oil, but oil is an unstable commodity. Although Iraq is the second largest member of the output, it does not control the global oil market, nor is it not, nor is it not Relevant decision makers of OPEC.</p>
<p>This makes Iraq easily affected by the unstable oil market and the output decision -making decisions of other OPEC member states, especially because the budget is based on the ambitious oil prices of $ 70 per barrel. If the price falls, it may cause a series of economic dilemma and Public anger.</p>
<p>The budget requires hiring more than 500,000 Iraqi this year. This is not the first budget to recruit large -scale public sectors. At least 4.5 million employees in the public sector in Iraq are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The government's office is overcrowded, and the organization is chaotic, which further slows down the speed of bureaucracy. This year's large -scale recruitment will also bring a pension burden on the future government.</p>

<p>If the government wants to increase more employment in 2024 and 2025, it only needs to vote for parliament. Therefore, it may increase more jobs in the next two years.</p>
<p>Like many countries in the region, Iraq's social contract is based on the recruitment of public sector. Citizens are expected to work in the public sector when graduating from college. Article 22 of the 2005 Constitution of Iraq stipulates the right to work. But people generally think this means government positions.</p>
<p>Since 2003, the public sector has increased four times, and current salary accounts for more than a quarter of the budget of 2023.</p>
<p>The way Iraqi Hussein formed after the steps of Sadam Hussein in 2003, as if the country can still afford this arrangement, and this is for political interests. In the Kurdish region of Iraq, we use the asylum network to establish contact and legitimacy with the people of the New Iraqi country.</p>
<p>Therefore, the millions of Iraqi people were hired to the public sector. This is something they have used to, but fortunately, there is a new political sponsorship.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is for the right to vote or the belief in the right to work in the public sector, even independent candidates and new political parties have advocated the recruitment of public sector, and even the improved political movement after the protests in October 2019, and is unwilling to implement it. No matter how important these reforms are.</p>
<p>The reforms that are often discussed by experts but rejected by the public are restricting the recruitment of public sectors and stricter taxes.</p>
<p>The protests that occurred from October 2019 to March 2020 called for economic opportunities, ending corruption and political reform, which led to advance election and new election law, but the political system itself did not have systematically changed.</p>
<p>What makes things further complicated is that the protesters continue to ask for employment. In some cases, a few independent members have participated in these protests.</p>
<h4>Reconstruction of the country</h4>
<p>Infrastructure expenditures are the focus of new budgets, and the budget distributed the development and reconstruction funds to specific fields.</p>
<p>The Sindal and Nini Plain Reconstruction Fund provided 50 billion Denal ($ 38 million) to rebuild in areas that were destroyed in Islamic State (ISIS). 76 million US dollars) for Kah's service items, the west bank of the Dagris River will build the Darvesh Bridge, laid streets, and repair public space and parks.</p>
<p>75 billion Denal ($ 57 million) is used to revitalize the swamp land in the southern provinces in the south.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a reconstruction fund for the most poor provinces, with a amount of 500 billion Denal (US $ 381 million), which aims to improve infrastructure, medical care, electricity and education services such as health care, electricity and education services. This is a "Islamic State". It affects the supplement to the existing reconstruction funds in the area.</p>
<p>However, Iraq's records of federal budgets are not the best. The latest budget execution rate passed in 2021 is 79%, and wages and pensions are given priority.</p>
<p>Iraq's foreign exchange reserves reached a record high, and no longer need to pay Kuwait's compensation in 1990, but there is no vision for how to invest in these wealth, and the budget still has deficit.</p>
<p>Expanding the public sector actually helps to further slow down Iraq's bureaucracy, which hinders the implementation of development projects. In order to solve this problem, economic reform is necessary, but these reforms have not been carried out in the budget.</p>
<p>For example, the economic policy department of the Prime Minister's office did not allocate funds. Therefore, although Iraq has just passed the biggest budget ever, its director is still seeking external funds.</p>
<p>The current government may only perform the recruitment commitment of the former government, but there are no obvious reasons not to include economic reform into the budget algorithm.</p>
<p>If the public recruitment is frozen or the upper limit is written into the law, it is not forced by the administrative order of the Prime Minister's office, it will be more difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>The huge budget scale makes it difficult for Iraq to seek foreign aid for development aid or economic reform. The improvement of Iraq's security situation and stability may attract foreign investment. For example, the TOTALENERGIES transactions in Iraq are worth $ 27 billion, of which Qatar Energy Company owns 25%. Stocks.</p>
<p>However, if there is no economic reform and the budget is not much different from before, it is difficult to prove to foreign investors that Iraq is a good choice.This budget covers three years, which is forward -looking and emphasizes infrastructure and reconstruction. This is positive, but its indifference to economic reform will increase pressure on future budgets and government.</p>

This attitude of Zhongnanhai shows that the Chinese Communist Party wants to continue to expand the army and further challenge the international order, and military dialogue will undoubtedly hinder the planning of the Communist Party of China. It can be judged that the Cold War between China and the United States will not be relieved due to diplomatic dialogue; on the contrary, the Cold War between China and the United States will continue to upgrade in the expansion of the army and intelligence warfare confrontation. But does this mean that the war comes? This article analyzes the true meaning of the Taiwan Strait area and the war with the war. Why can Taiwan be able to gain peace in the Cold War of China and the United States, but it will inevitably destroy peace about the CCP.</p>
<p><strong> 1. What stage of the Cold War between China and the United States? </strong></p>
<p>Although the Chinese Communist Party has always criticized the United States to have the Cold War thinking, and US Secretary of State Brillings also emphasized that China and the United States are not currently in the "Cold War" relationship, but coexisting competition and cooperation, but in reality, the relationship between China and the United States has become increasingly upgraded by the Cold War to upgrade towards the Cold War. Move the direction. The initiator of the Cold War of the China and the United States is undoubtedly the CCP; the upgrade promoter of the China -US Cold War is still the CCP. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party's position in this regard is that international rules and international order must be arbitrarily decided, "I can provoke it, you do not respond; I can foul, you are not allowed to resist", otherwise you have "cold war thinking"; This is just a copy of the international relations of "only the officials of the state officer to set fire and not allowed the people to light", which is a declaration of the new red power hegemonism in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I published an article published in this station on June 16 this year, "The Cold War in China and the United States", introduced the process of igniting the CCP's ignition of this Cold War, and from early 2020 to the present. Confrontation, quickly extended to the level of diplomacy and high -tech; once the Sino -US confrontation was locked to the high -tech level, this new cold war was finally shaped into a standard comprehensive cold war, so the CCP could not withdraw.</p>
<p>Recently, the Cold War upgrades made by the Communist Party of China have once again become the center of international attention. On June 3rd, a military confrontation between China and the United States had another military confrontation. Normal routes created a risk of collision, which is a threat to often play with Soviet submarines in the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union. In terms of intelligence war, the Communist Party of China imitates the Soviet Union's practice during the Cold War of the Soviet Union, set up a long -term electronic listening station in Cuba near the United States, and blatantly steal the military telecommunications intelligence on the East Coast of the United States. At this level of standard Cold War Intelligence War, the CCP's approach is also the "homework" of the Soviet Union in the Cold War of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Why are the CCP not afraid of their own expansion and preparation activities and repeated violations of international regulations at sea and air, and the way to create dangers and frictions, will they "wipe the guns and fire" and cause a hot war? The reason is very simple. The CCP knows that the red power of a large country with a nuclear weapon to the United States will not cause the United States to fight back, because in the cold war state, the two sides "wipe the gun without fire" are the highest criterion; Once a big country of nuclear weapons occurs, once a hot battle occurs, the nuclear war and the earth can be destroyed. Zhongnanhai uses this cold war hidden rule of "wiping guns without getting angry" to continuously test the bottom line of the United States and step by step. Brosky repeatedly told Xi Jinping that the two sides should set up a "Guardrail" at the military confrontation level, and to ensure that "the gun does not go away."</p>
<p><strong> 2. China's true intention to seize the international waters of the South China Sea </strong></p>
<p>Why did the Chinese Communist Party prevent the US military from conducting normal patrols in the international waters of the two Gonghai in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. What are the underwater in the South China Sea, the CCP does not want to let the United States investigate? A report from the National Security Media "Multidimensional News", which was closed last year, published a report on March 4, 2020, the title is "Decoding China Strategic Nuclear Submarine South China Sea Sea", and the underwater is silent ". Due to Xi Jinping's anti -Xi Xi forces in the Ministry of National Security, "Multidimensional News" has been closed, and now only one of the articles reprinted by a Chinese website in the United States can still be seen.</p>
<p>This article has clearly stated the strategic purpose of the CCP's strong occupation of the South China Sea Sea area: "The key is that the South China Sea belongs to the 'Fortress Sea in China' ... After the mid -1970s, the Soviet Union proposed the 'Fortress Sea District' Strategy, that is, the strategy of the sea area, that is, In a certain sea area, we heavy soldiers have defense and create a sea fortress. The launch position of the ballistic missile nuclear submarine is set in the fortress area to enhance the 'secondary nuclear strike' capability ... China has chosen two legs to walk, which will break through the island chain blockade and enter to enter. In the Western Pacific, it is also necessary to establish the 'Fortress Sea District' ... The Chinese military has made the South China Sea into China's "Fortress Sea" -The ballistic missile nuclear submarine launch position. The deep water depth of the South China Sea Basin is from 3,400 meters to 3,600 meters, which is very suitable for large submarines such as ballistic missile nuclear submarines. China ’s control over the Xisha Islands, Zhongsha Islands and the reclamation of the Nansha Islands have greatly strengthened China’ s control over the South China Sea Basin. ""</p>
<p>It can be seen that the CCP occupies the reef in the South China Sea and builds seven artificial islands in order to protect the strategic nuclear submarine that protects from Yulin Army Port in Sanya City, Hainan Island. Intercontinental missiles carried by this strategic nuclear submarine can attack the western and central and western regions from the deep -sea nuclear warheads, constitute a nuclear threat to US national security. It is because of such a strategic nuclear submarine "Fortress Sea Area", the CCP provoked the United States one after another to provoke military threats.</p>
<p>The first direct movement of the CCP's military cold war in China and the United States was the direct naval fleet to the United States to perform a exercise near the Pacific Midway in early 2020, and the "Sword refers to Pearl Harbor"; while the Chinese Communist Party built a strategy The Nanhai "Fortress Sea" of the nuclear submarine dispatched nuclear submarines from there, crossed the bus strait, entered the Western Pacific and even the Central Pacific, which was the second major action that the CCP threatened the United States. The "Liren" of the CCP's "rising southward"? "Introduced in".<strong> Three, and battle: Whether there is a Cold War, the opposite meaning </strong></p>
<p>Because the Chinese Communist Party has never clarified the key hidden rules of "wiping guns without fire" in the cold war state internally, so that for the Cold War in China and the United States, Chinese "pink" are often a war. As a result, sometimes the CCP. Will have to let go of the wind to destroy the "fire" a little. For example, I pointed out in the article "The Communist Party's long -term strategy of Taiwan and the current" forced uniform "intention published on this station on May 30 this year. To face the "four -line operation", must our army be cautious? ", Indicates that the PLA cannot lightly start the war in the Taiwan Strait. It has been more than two months after this article was published. When I wrote this article, it was still spread on domestic websites. This is the "fire extinguishing" action of the CCP's internal promotion.</p>
<p>Although Taiwan is located at the front line of the Cold War in China and the United States, there are many misunderstandings and misunderstandings in Taiwan. The most typical of these is the selection slogan such as "votes for votes and youths on the battlefield"; its related publicity also emphasizes that "votes are voted in the wild party, and there is no war." This slogan is a misunderstanding or deliberate interpretation of the current situation, because this type of slogan completely reads the international situation in Taiwan, and it is completely ignorant of the Cold War of China and the United States. However, in the face of such deliberate misleading, many young people in Taiwan have "eaten" it, so that the pre -election polls have obvious tendency to identify with this statement.</p>
<p>The author feels that it is necessary to analyze the peace and war under the Cold War, so as to clarify the righteousness. When it comes to the threat of war provoked by the Communist Party of China, everyone only sees the threat itself, but it is often impossible to see that the military threat itself does not mean the war, and the war is different from the hot war and the Cold War. The Cold War is a war. Is there peace under the Cold War? For decades of the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union, the World War I did not break out; it was precisely the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union, which brought up to 40 years of peace to the earth after World War II.</p>
<p>Many people only stare at the words in the Cold War, and when they hear the Cold War, they think of the hot war, so they feel that the Cold War is also a battle, not as good as peace. In their minds, the word Cold War has a total of two characters. It is a virtual word. However, the facts are just the opposite. The word of the Cold War is just a word, and the cold is the core concept. Because the purpose of the Cold War is to avoid the war and avoid the world's hot war, which is said by General Yu Beichen, a member of Taoyuan County and Major General Yu Beichen. The history of the Cold War in the United States and Soviet Union proved that the Cold War did successfully curb the popularity, so it brought peace to the world. Therefore, when it comes to the Cold War, the important core is to put the vision on the cold characters of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The Cold War has always been launched by the Communist powers with nuclear weapons. Since the United States still cannot discourage the Communist regime to stop the threat of war, Taiwan ’s opposition party is not qualified to talk about peace and talks. The Chinese Communist Party launched the Cold War. Like the Soviet Union, it was not Taiwan, but the United States; in the Cold War of the Sino -US Cold War, it was not a third party on both sides. If there is no Cold War in China and the United States, there will be no international obstacles to Taiwan's martial arts; in that case, war will destroy peace. However, after the Cold War in China and the United States has taken shape, the United States has to take the security of East Asia, especially Taiwan as its own strategic goal. To this end, it will support Taiwan with the allies. Both have begun to adjust the deployment to achieve this strategic goal. In this way, Taiwan under the Cold War of China and the United States has the possibility of peace, just like West Germany in the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><strong> Four, American characters in the Cold War of China and the United States </strong></p>
<p>Since the CCP thinks that the military strength has increased, it has the ability to launch the Cold War between the United States and the United States, so in this world, only the United States can hold it up. The United States, which has nuclear weapons and is the number one military power, has no other choices except to stop the war threat of the Communist Party's regime; otherwise, the world will repeat the mistakes of the Pacific War, and once again face the Indo -Pacific region caused by the Greater Japan Empire's southward strategy. War.</p>
<p>For the United States, the only strategy that can confront the CCP's ambition to expand its external ambition is to force the Communist Party to fall into the international confrontation under the Cold War. In the end, this pattern will allow the Communist Party to gradually fall behind in the process of expanding the army and the economy. In this regard, the disintegration and disappearance of the Soviet Union gave us the clearest conclusions.</p>
<p>In fact, after the CCP ignited the Cold War of China and the United States in early 2020, the United States' attitude towards the CCP's military threats at the beginning was as slow as the early Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union. President Trump first initiated a trade war on tariffs on the CCP, while using diplomatic means, hoping that the CCP would change the practice of large -scale theft of American smart property rights. The Chinese Communist Party has not greeted the United States and the Snake in the United States.</p>
<p>After Biden took office, the United States faced the increasing military threat of the Communist Party of China and had to deal with it. This has the saying that the US military may explode the war on the Taiwan Strait. At this time, the CCP believes that it is necessary to rely on increasing military threats to let the United States retreat. As a result, the Communist Party of China has stepped up the threats of military aircraft and martial arts, and expanded its threat of the Pacific Water Fleet in the Pacific Water. This allows the United States to speed up military layout and diplomatic mediation, and to stabilize the stability of East Asia with the allies, including Taiwan.</p>
<p>In the cold war, the CCP not only poses that it will never give up, but also facing the United States. For example, the CCP ’s intelligence war on the United States has recently been upgraded to a military monitoring station in Cuba, and there are large spy balls through the United States. In terms of military confrontation, the CCP has completely denied international marine regulations and forcibly announced that the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea are its. To the sea, for this reason, it also deliberately threatened U.S. warships with warships by warships in the Taiwan Strait. All these provocations can only increase the advancement of the Cold War in the United States.</p>
<p>Just as I mentioned by my article "The Cold War in China and the United States" published on this station on June 16, the upgrade of the Cold War will inevitably lead to a scientific and technological war. Blocking tactics in key technology, such as cutting off the CCP's way to expand the army from the West to expand the army. This is the origin of the US -China chip war.</p>
<p>In terms of security in Taiwan, the formation and upgrading of the Cold War in China and the United States is crushing the CCP's attempt to attack Taiwan. The current situation is, "There is something in Taiwan, that is, there is something in the United States, Japan has something to do, and the country has something to do."</p>
<p>This situation is actually the possible kind of hot war that the CCP tries to attack Taiwan, which is transformed into a long -term cold war. Of course, this Cold War is not the Cold War between the Communist Party of China and Taiwan, but the Cold War of the China and the United States. The main burden of the most important burden in the Cold War of the China and the United States is because the United States uses huge military and nuclear bomb reserves to compete with the CCP, forcing the CCP to not resort to force. In this sense, the United States has a huge risk for this second Cold War, and Taiwan has become a beneficiary country in the Cold War of the Sino -US Cold War. Back behind and economic dilemma, it was no longer unable to maintain the scale and speed of the expansion of the army. In the end, the Cold War between the United States and the United States ended with the victory of the United States.</p>
<p><strong> 5. Taiwan: Cold War Insurance peace, seeking peace and destroy peace </strong></p>
<p>The above analysis shows that Taiwan facing the Communist Party's threat of force, in fact, there is only one kind of peaceful opportunity, that is, in the state of the Cold War of China and the United States, to keep Taiwan with the help of this Cold War, stabilize Taiwan's economy and society, and obtain a relatively peaceful peaceful peaceful peace, to obtain a relatively peaceful peaceful peaceful peace, and to obtain a relatively peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful peace, to obtain a relatively peaceful peaceful peaceful peace, and to obtain a relatively peaceful peaceful peaceful peace, to obtain a relatively peaceful peaceful peace, and to obtain a relatively peaceful peace, living environment.In the early days of World War II, the nuclear weapons had not yet been born, so the Japanese Empire dared to launch the hot war at sea and land without any fear. Today's Cold War between the United States and the United States is a comprehensive confrontation between the two nuclear powers. In the war end of the East Asian light -up popularity. The CCP tries to create the chaos in the international order in East Asia and the Indo -Pacific region. In Taiwan to seek survival in troubled times, it is impossible to seek peace from the invaders. It can only defend East Asia's peace with the United States and its allies who maintain India and the United States. Therefore, today's Taiwan has no idea that the Chinese Communist Party, who is inconvenient to subvert the international order of the Pacific region, attempts to annex Taiwan, and the United States and its allies who resist the intention of the CCP's aggression to maintain the so -called "equivalent". Because if Taiwan goes to Beijing to "seek peace", it will only be forced to join the CCP's camp against the United States and its allies. It will be the biggest betrayal to Taiwan, and British Prime Minister Chariot is a hundred times more dangerous than Hitler's signing of the Munich Agreement before World War II.</p>
<p>Since the CCP cannot attack Taiwan forces for a period of time, it wants to use Taiwan's existing political forces to strive to achieve the goal of "peaceful liberation" as soon as possible. Therefore, as long as it is a person who is good at shaking hands with the CCP, he wants to use it. The good nature of the red power has never changed. Regardless of how soft Taiwan puts its posture, the CCP will only be pressing and threatening Taiwan to seize Taiwan as the ultimate goal. In the face of a red regime such as the Communist Party of China, Taiwan cannot "move" and cannot escape. Only the allies are relying on allies to protect peace.</p>
<p>In the context of the Cold War in China and the United States, Taiwan's self -protection and peace can avoid the popularity or "peace liberation" from the Communist Party of China. If Taiwan kneels to the CCP for mercy, gives up national defense, and accepts unification, then the CCP will inevitably take the opportunity to occupy Taiwan; and further use Taiwan as a forward base to squeeze the United States out of the first island chain. After the short -term "peace" of the unified process, Taiwan is very likely to be pushed into the sea of fire caused by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Taiwan is proud of its own democracy and freedom, but the historical juncture such as the Cold War of the Sino -US Cold War is the first "springboard" and the first forward base that was locked by the Chinese Communist Party in this Cold War. Election at the beginning of the year. Since the democratization of Taiwan, there has been no election as this election, which is so important to Taiwan's life and death. In the previous elections, voters could care about "party rotation", because different political parties' internal policies would not let the country hurt their bones; this election still played "party rotation" or "change the party to change the party to look at it. The slogan ", but covering the fact that each voter must care about. The foreign policy of different political parties may directly be related to the existence of the country in Taiwan. If you are in a big deal, you can't treat it anymore.</p>

Some comments believe that this is aimed at strengthening brainwashing education for adolescents and facilitating Xi Jinping to crack down on dissidents politically.</p>

<p>According to Xinhua News Agency, the draft of the "Education Education Law of the People's Republic of China" was first submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review on June 26. This draft incorporates patriotic education into the national education system and highlights the education of schools and families with young people and children; On major festivals and other activities, patriotism education is carried out by rituals such as lining the national flag, singing national anthem, and constitutional oath, and specific provisions are made.</p>
<p>Zang Tiewei, a spokesman for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, stated at a press conference on the 25th that the "Draft Patriotic Education Law" was guided by "Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era", and adhered to the patriotic, loved party, and socialism. Unity, take the main point of maintaining the unity of the motherland and the unity of the nation, and the Chinese dream of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as a clear theme.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Zhongshi News Network pointed out that in recent years, there are many public opinion incidents related to patriotism in China. Zhang Zhanhan had taken photos at the Japanese Yasukuni Shrine and was blocked after being exposed; the Chinese government set up a "Patriotic Education Demonstration Base" in the country, and has reached 585 as of 2021.</p>
<p><strong> Hu Ping: Legislative Patriotic Show the CCP's conscious type bankruptcy </strong></p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reports that the formulation of patriotic education law is of great significance to inspiring the spirit of the nation and uniting the people's forces.</p>
<p>Hu Ping, an honorary editor -in -chief of the "Beijing Spring" magazine living in the United States, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and pointed out that the Chinese authorities have been internally and outside the Patriotic flag for a long time, showing that the CCP ’s consciousness has completely bankruptcy. The purpose of the above legislation is to combat and suppress various political opinions in China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T11-27-00-04-00/000002.png" />China Celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (Reuters) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hx2-06262023075842.html/2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T11-27-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Hu Ping said: "Of course, love party loves Xi Jinping and 'not to be discussed", and you have to claim all the thoughts he don't like to be patriotic, saying that you sell the country and traitors. "</p>
<p>Hu Ping mentioned that in the past, the magic weapon that the Communist Party crashed with aliens was to deduct the "counter -revolutionary" hat, but the word counter -revolutionary is no longer popular, and the Chinese Communist Party has canceled it to subvert the state power and provoke trouble. The extensiveness of the form is simply adding the so -called patrioticism.</p>
<p>Hu Ping analyzed that another role of the Chinese government's patriotism education law was brainwashing tools: "Authorities are still promoting Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping theory, emphasizing Xi Jinping's thinking, and the vast power of the Mao era, so take it. Patriotism is a supplement to strengthen the control of young people in this way. "</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan scholars: China is afraid of setting up color revolution internally </strong></p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong, Secretary -General of the Society of Taiwan Tao Lue, accepted an interview with this station and said: "This is the first patriotic education law in the world. Obviously, for the CCP, it is urgent to maintain the national unity of the country. China) The State Council has promulgated the "Outline of Patriotism Education in the New Era".</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party is facing economic and political turmoil internally, and the prospects for the war of the Russia and Ukraine of Foreign Russia are very worried that the color revolution has occurred. Even if there are already patriotic education demonstration bases in various places, it is still not enough, and they must be accepted by legislation.</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong said: "There are many Chinese threat theory and Chinese collapse theory on the public opinion Internet, which threatens the CCP and must condense such a consensus through patriotic education regulations. For example, the Dragon Boat Festival just passed, the Chinese Communist Party made Qu Yuan as a patriotic poet's thinking. Propaganda, this is a thought education for the Communist Party. "</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong said that the Chinese Communist Party believes that students' understanding of patriotic education only stays in books and has no practice at all, so she has enhanced patriotism in social education. However, when students enter the society, they face actual problems. If the economy can be sufficient, whether the judicial can be fair, the authorities tried to make up for the so -called "patriotic consciousness" after young people left the school.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Officials of the election management agency announced on Sunday (June 25) that the right -wing option party (AFD) won the district council election for the first time in Germany.</p>
<p>Sonneberg, located in the central town of the former East, East, chose the option party (AFD) candidate RobertSselmann, and gave up the current region of the right -wing Kimino (CDU) Jürgen KöPper.</p>

<p>Turinen Minister of the Interior, the Central Left -Wing Social Democratic Party(SPD)Member Mel(Georg Maier)Describe the results of this election as "alarm signal issued to all democratic forces".</p>
<p>He called for the interests of the party to work together to defend democracy together.</p>
<p>Josef Schuster, chairman of the German Jewish Central Committee, said that although not every option party voter has a very right -wing point of view, the party itself is the case.</p>

<p>As the Social Democratic Party, environmentalist Green Party and the Liberal Liberal Democratic Party composed of the China Left -Wing Federal Federal Government showed signs of internal signs, the option party received a new wave of support. However, even so, the main challenges from the Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Party, the main challenges of the Social Party, still comes from the right -wing CDU. Former Prime Minister Merkel's public opinion support rate was slightly lower than 30%.</p>

<p>Last week (June 22), the Nineteenth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Youth League just closed announced that it would deeply understand the decisive significance of the "two establishment". "Two establishment" refers to the establishment of the core position of Xi Jinping's Party Central Committee and the core of the entire party, and establishing the guiding position of Xi Jinping's new era of socialist thought with Chinese characteristics.</p>
<p>Immediately after, this Monday (June 26), Xi Jinping talked collectively and delivered a speech collectively in the new leadership team of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in Zhongnanhai. He demanded that the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has thoroughly implemented the CCP's requirements, better condensing the young generation of the young generation around the party, and continuing to promote the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>These messages are obviously not treated among netizens. Outside of China's online firewall, netizens left a message under the tweets of the relevant news. Some people say, "Scared, brainwashing methods have been upgraded again." Others said, "Two people who have cheated their corpses and return their souls." Some people say, "How did the last" two "? There is not much more one more!"Some people said," Employment can't be solved, let's send it to the mountains and the countryside. "This immediately reminds the news that the unemployment rate of youth unemployment in recent months has continued to rise.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The investigations made by Germany in June of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese EU Chamber of Commerce showed that they ended <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体清零令外企叫苦不迭/a-62207086">Zero Policy</a>After that, the hope of China's strong rebound in the economy has been shattered. More than half of the German companies are expected to develop this year's development this year's level last year or even lower than last year.</p>
<p>Although business expectations seem to be dim, more than half of German companies (55%) intend to continue to invest in China in the next few years. However, during the new crown epidemic in 2020 and 2021, more than 70%of German companies who were willing to continue to invest in China. 62%of the companies that insist on investing without considering all issues, saying that this is mainly to maintain its competitiveness in the Chinese market. However, almost one of the four companies expressed their hope to reduce investment, which is significantly higher than the epidemic period.</p>
<p>60%of the interviewed companies expect the market environment to deteriorate, and more than 40%of companies are worried that geopolitical tensions will lead to consequences such as sanctions or export control. For the Ukrainian war and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国企业为北京武统未雨绸缪/a-65871883">potential Taiwan conflict</a>The uncertainty brings <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体在华德企气氛低迷/a-51229999">low industry emotions</a>Essence Almost a quarter of companies believe that Beijing's efforts to become more independent of foreign markets, which is also a reason for reducing investment.</p>
<p>One -fifth of companies hope to invest more in countries outside China. And more than 16%of companies have set plans to completely withdraw from China in the worst case.</p>
<h3>negative record of business environment</h3>
<p>A survey made for 570 companies showed that most European companies believe that China has lost its glory as a business place. Yanci, President of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China(Jenskelund)It is said that China's business atmosphere is "the lowest stage we feel."</p>
<p>Although the clearing policy has ended, foreign capital <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济遭重创-在华德企商业信心探底/a-64092035">confidence in China's economic prospects</a>It is fading. At the same time, profits are also declining. In the face of increasing risks and unpredictable environments, 64%of European companies interviewed said that doing business in China became more difficult. This proportion set a record. Limited market access is a major problem encountered in Chinese foreign -funded enterprises. The restrictions set by the government are also another difficulty in complaining of enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition, Chinese domestic companies and foreign companies often lack fair competition. A quarter of European companies complained that forced technology transfer was encountered.</p>
<p>Jeargwuttke, former chairman of the German and EU Chamber of Commerce, confirmed in an interview with the Voice of Germany in BASF's long -term executives, Germany and the EU Chamber of Commerce, which can clearly feel the increasingly fierce nationalist line promoted by Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>He said, "There are strong nationalism in some areas: we no longer need foreigners, so we will not let them enter the market."</p>
<h3>World Economic Engine Make no longer foreign companies want to evacuate the Chinese market?</h3>
<h3>China Lost its original glory</h3>
<p>Yan Ci, the current president of the Chinese EU Chamber of Commerce, said that no one expected the supervision environment to be improved in the next five years, and the crisis of confidence has not ended.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Voice of Germany, Wudk said that China now emphasizes retreat and self -defense compared with previous open policies. However, there is a fundamental problem that Xi Jinping wants to implement the isolated policy- "China must be independent of the world as much as possible, but at the same time I hope that the world depends on China. Of course, this is not commensurate with globalization."</p>
<p>However, what role can Europeans play in trade and industrial policies?</p>
<p>"Of course, the Chinese will continue to cultivate big companies that bring them technology and employment opportunities. This is the case in the fields of automobiles, chemicals, and mechanical engineering."</p>
<p>He emphasized: "In 2022, EU companies' exports to China were 23%higher than the exports of Switzerland. More than 6.4 million containers were shipped from China to Europe, but only 1.6 million containers were transported back to China from Europe. In many sense, China's dependence on our market is much higher than our dependence on the Chinese market. This is a very depressed thing, because the market is already large enough. "</p>
<p>In recent years, China has been walking forward with hand brakes, which is not just the influence of clearing the zero policy. "There are still many problems with market access restrictions on market access," said Western companies are difficult to operate. "</p>
<h3>Federal MP: "Chinese characters are complicated"</h3>
<h3>渐 gradually rose</h3>
<p>Stanleydruckenmiller, a well -known hedge fund manager and a billionaire investor, has previously known for its firm conviction in China's economic growth. But in early June this year, he scratched China from the list of investment destinations. Drucken Miller believes that following Xi Jinping's political route, China may miss the lofty goal of catching up with the economy and surpassing the world's largest economy and the United States. At the Bloomberg Investment Conference, Druckenmire depicts a dim picture of China's future.</p>
<p>He said: "If (China) does not have high -level power change, the economy will lose vitality." He said that even if there is any obvious improvement in China this year, it is just a sudden and short -term energy explosion, just like you Edible high sugar things are the same. "We expect that sugar has increased and some strong growth in the next 6 to 9 months. But in the long run, I don't think they (Chinese) are the main challenges to the United States in terms of economic strength and growth." Germany Rukemler said.</p>
<p>And Wudick described a more diplomatic description of China's economic policy dilemma. He said that in an economy that strives to overcome serious aging problems, and in the case of major problems in the real estate industry, under the circumstances that local government liabilities and small banks may face the threat of bankruptcy, China may try to restore its previous open opening up Sexual, and then re -execute the idea of "priority to ideology". He said that for European companies, this is not the worst of all options.</p>

After the overseas drugs are blocked through traditional channels, the number of cases of smuggling drugs are used to use the truck with customs clearance or use throwing and digging. Drug conditions are intensified.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the export of drug supplies from other countries from China is increasingly valued by the international community. The U.S. Department of Justice sued four Chinese chemical manufacturing companies and eight individuals last Friday (June 23), accusing them of illegal trafficking for pre -chemicals to make Fentany. However, the Chinese Embassy in the United States issued a statement on Saturday, accusing the United States of stemming in China on the problem of anti -drug, illegally sanction Chinese companies, and seduced and prosecuted Chinese citizens.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The Wall Street Journal published an analysis article saying that the end of a brief change in Russia made Beijing relieved. This crisis marks the worst challenge that Putin has encountered in Russia in the past 23 years, and it is also a "uncertain moment" for Chinese leaders Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>The author pointed out that Xi Jinping shaped Sino -Russian relations into a fortress against the United States in the world, and placed his personal relationship with Putin at the center of the fortress. Now, Russia is chaotic, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格納叛亂曝普京弱點-有利烏軍反攻/a-66028854">Putin's authority seems to be weakened</a>It's right. "This is exactly the risk of the Chinese government's most worried about the Russian and Ukraine War."</p>
<p>Carnegie Russia Eurasian Center(Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center)Temurumarov, a researcher, said: "This is the pessimistic situation that Putin is worried about when he starts to attack Ukraine, that is, Putin's decision will eventually destroy the stability of the Russian regime."</p>
<p>The article quoted Wang Yili, a professor of international relations of Renmin University of China, said that among the Chinese people, many people worry that Putin's political status is unstable, and Russia's political turbulence may affect China.</p>
<h3>Wagner Group "Rebellion" Head: What is the significance of war?</h3>
<h3>Nationalism -Moving Stone and smashing your feet?</h3>
<p>Pei Minxin, a professor of political science at Claremont McKennaCollege and a Chinese issue, compared with Putin, Xi Jinping's power control is more stable, and the CCP's ruling system and the Russian ruling party are even more indispensable. On the same day. However, the Wagner mutiny still highlights a few risks that cannot be ignored, which will make Xi Jinping be vigilant:</p>
<p>"First of all, the most important thing is to ensure the political loyalty of the Chinese army, especially the senior commander." Pei Minxin wrote a column of articles written by Bloomberg that Xi Jinping compared with his two predecessors, in consolidating the control of the army's control of the army's control of the army, It has been far away. "Although some preventive measures will reduce the combat effectiveness of the army, Xi Jinping may think that this cost is worthwhile and can prevent infidelity in the crisis."</p>
<p>Secondly, Beijing will prevent competition between different departments of the army as soon as possible. According to the article, because the Chinese Communist Party's control of the press and the army is deeper than Putin, the risk of public political struggle between high -levels is much lower. Nevertheless, this is another danger that Xi Jinping is unwilling to face in the conflict.</p>
<p>In addition, this incident reminds Xi Jinping that "nationalism is a double -edged sword", because extreme nationalists can use more radical and good words to overtake the political strong man in power, "just like <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/普里戈津何许人也他有多大影响力/a-66020810">Porigo</a>"What you do for Putin." The author believes that Xi Jinping has begun to reduce this risk by restraining his subordinates: the new foreign minister Qin Gang generally avoided the "wolf" statement, although he faithfully executed Xi Jinping, did not have no Xi Jinping did not have no such thing as Xi Jinping did not do not. Complex foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Interview: The Russian and Ukraine War will not change the consideration of China ’s attack on Taiwan</h3>
<h3>may lead to "extreme situation"</h3>
<p>Feng Yujun, director of the Russian and Central Asian Research Center of Fudan University, told the South China Morning Post that an isolated incident would not have a direct impact on China -Russia relations and even China itself, but the overall international situation, including the direction of the Russian and Ukraine War, the future development of Russia's future development. Determination and geopolitical challenges will have a profound historical impact on China.</p>
<p>Some Chinese scholars believe that Beijing will learn from politics and military lessons from this incident, especially on the issue of Taiwan relations. "South China Morning Post" quoted a mainland researcher who was unwilling to be named, and pointed out that if the frontline of the unified Taiwan actions failed in major military operations, such as the unified Taiwan operation, it may encourage the rise of unofficial military organizations. "Chinese leaders must be for it. Prepare this risk. "</p>
<p>However, he added that, given that there is no mercenaries in mainland China and a unified leadership of the army in the army, a "extreme situation" that Chinese leaders must consider are whether the failure of large -scale military operations will lead to the division of military forces.</p>
<p>"New York Times" Edward Wong also posted a post saying, "In the entire Russia -Ukraine War, if one thing can promote Xi Jinping to re -consider the attack, that is, the Wagner Group's anti -water." Huang Anwei It is said that it is not a mercenary issue in China now. "I think Xi Jinping is observing how a protracted war brings unexpected consequences to a country." "We know that he is sensitive to loyalty in the PLA. Anti -corruption extends to the PLA. "</p>
<p>Huang Anwei also pointed out that people who are in this position in Xi Jinping often think about the people -whether it is the grassroots of the society or the elite class, how to view the potential weakness and legitimacy of their power. This is related to the attributes of this system, "I speculate that the white paper movement makes this problem more prominent."</p>

At the beginning of the development, many self -media and netizens were too excited and expected. As a result, it turned into a farce and made the outside world a shock. There are already a variety of comments on the incident itself. I won't go into details here. I only talk about my opinion on a few related issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The international political storm changes, we must be calm, and it is not appropriate to draw conclusions prematurely. I have a "36 -hour law", which is willing to encourage you for ingeniousness. That is, I suggest that everyone can calm down for 36 hours before judging. Sometimes we make mistakes, that is, putting our wishes at the first position of the basis for judging, which can be understood but absolutely unprofessional. Let the bullets fly for a while, it will always be the only rule for us to judge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The head of Wagner, Priggin, has now gone to Belarus. It seems to be calm, but in any case, this is a heavy blow for Putin, and this blow from his past loyal followers Pricigjin is a very playful thing. Because this once again proves: Any dictator will have a dilemma or nightmare that cannot get rid of, that is: he can never determine who is the most trusted person. For dictators, there are no eternal allies, and those who are most likely to betray them are often those who think they are most trusted, especially those who behave like their slaves. Prigjin's betrayal of Putin was a warning to the dictators including Xi Jinping: Don't believe in those slaves, the most likely to rebellion is slaves.</p>

<p>Now, some public opinion cares about a question: Once Xi Jinping has a war against Taiwan, will China have the same change? Under my Twitter and Facebook, the mainstream opinion will definitely happen. I personally have different opinions, and I think the probability will not happen. Why?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First: Wagner Group is an independent military force, and China has no independent military power. China's military forces do not have its own financial source, and the army is highly dependent on the central government, and even local governments cannot use military crickets to affect the army. In addition, personnel mobilization is frequent, and it is difficult to form a political influence. Although the army is not nationalized, it has been dynamic, which is different from Russia. At the time, Yeltsin could mobilize the army to bombard the parliament. In 1989, Zhao Ziyang was the first vice chairman of the Military Commission, but he could not mobilize a soldier. During the Cultural Revolution, the marshals of the army were extremely opposed to the Cultural Revolution, and there was no mutiny. You may be able to say that there was Mao Zedong's prestige at that time, but now Xi Jinping's control of power is no less than Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Second, even if there is a voice or even power that is dissatisfied with Xi Jinping within the army, the muzzle has caused the system to collapse. Unless there is a group of troops that really have idealist pursuits, it is possible to see the Chinese democratic army general. But the current Chinese army is an important member of the Communist Party of interests. The system is down and there is no benefit to the army. Why do they rebel? Even if the war failed, they were not their children, and they had no reason to overthrow the totalitarian system that they lived. A netizen said well: In China, whether it is a coup or a soldier, the party has achieved victory in the end, which can change China.</p>
<p>Third, of course, we also have to see that this time the Russian mutiny explained that the war continued for too long, and everything was possible. This is the same for China. Therefore, Xi Jinping's future deployment of the Taiwan Strait War will definitely seek a plan to end military operations as soon as possible. I don't think he will be scared by the Russian soldiers this time. On the contrary, he will learn more lessons. Now that Xi Jinping will be more cautious to treat the military attack plan because of this, I think it is unparalleled. Taiwanese and the world should not pin their hopes on Xi Jinping's rationality.</p>
<p>In short, what happened in Russia this time reminded us that when analyzing the political development of totalitarian countries, we should not underestimate the explosive power of uncertain factors, and at the same time, we should not underestimate the toughness of the authoritarian system.</p>

Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd., located in Changzhen Community, Yutang Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen, a labor conflict broke out because the factory was relocated by the local community within a time limit. The workers were dissatisfied with the compensation plan given by the factory, and <a href="https://maps.clb.org.hk/?i18n_language=zh_CN&amp;map=1&amp;startDate=2023-05&amp;endDate=2023-05&amp;eventId=2023051616495788361&amp;addressId=440300&amp;address=%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E5%B8%82&amp;industry=10202&amp;industryName=%E7%94%B5%E5%AD%90"> Gathering the Changzhen Community Party Mass Service Center for help</a>Essence</p>

<p><a href="http://www.szsuccess.com.cn/yxwl/index_13.aspx">Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd.</a>Established in 2004 and listed in 2009.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">In 2019, Yushun Plant received a written notice from the Changzhen Community</a>, Make a relocation within 3 years. Three years later, in February last year, the company received a written notice from the Changzhen community, requiring the lease relationship before May 31 last year, and August 10th. The lease of Yushun Factory's plant did not expire until July 2024.</p>
<p>So, for the first time in 2019, the company has received the community relocation notice for almost 4 years. Has the Yushun Factory Trade Union conducted negotiations on the compensation plan on behalf of the employee?</p>
<p>In addition, the factories were relocated to the Changzhen community, and the Changzhen Community Trade Union Service Center worked with the Community Party and Mass Service Center. So, is the Changzhen Community Trade Union on the relocation plan that may affect the rights and interests of the workers, and negotiate with the community service center to ensure that the interests of employees can be guaranteed during the relocation process?</p>
<p>In particular, the Changzhen community requires the Yushun plant to relocate before the lease expires, which will inevitably affect the factory's operation, thereby affecting the company's ability to make reasonable compensation for workers. Does the Changzhen Community Trade Union participate in the negotiation of the company's participation in the enterprise and the Changzhen community on behalf of Yushun Factory. It is suggested that the Changzhen Community suspend the lease early to make additional compensation to the enterprise to ensure that the company has the ability to make reasonable compensation for workers?</p>

<p>According to the data, the Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions announced a legal service that cost 170,000 yuan last year <a href="http://www.szgm.gov.cn/xxgk/xqgwhxxgkml/gzgg/content/post_10136621.html">work plan</a>Essence This plan was announced in September, and in October, the goal was that by the end of 2022, the coverage rate of legal consultants in the first and secondary community trade unions in the street reached 100%. Level -level labor communication and negotiation mechanism.</p>
<p>So, did Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions assist Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd. to negotiate the relocation compensation plan in accordance with the work plan that he formulated and announced?</p>
<p>There is another thing. In June last year, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">more than 50 workers in Yushun plant have complained</a>At the Shenzhen Housing Provident Fund Management Center, the factory said that the factory had not paid the housing provident fund for front -line production workers. Before that worker went to the Provident Fund Management Center to complain, did he come to the union for help and ask the union representative workers and the enterprise to complete the supplementary payment through negotiation?</p>
<p>The Yushun Factory was established for 19 years and was listed for 14 years. It did not pay the housing provident fund for front -line workers. Are the corporate unions, Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Unions, and Guangming unions knowing this?</p>

<p>Ethiopia is about to start the fourth water storage of the Fuxing Dam. Observer believes that this has a serious threat to Egypt's share in the Nile Water and calls for a strong response immediately.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Foreign Minister Delike Miconin said that Fuxing Dam is currently close to the fourth water storage and emphasized that "the first three water storage did not hurt the downstream country, and so is the fourth water storage."</p>
<p>Satellite images show that the water level of the Bashu Lake has dropped by about 10 meters, and the amount of water leakage is about 7 billion cubic meters. It is expected that Ethiopia will increase the height of the middle corridor to prepare for the fourth water storage.</p>
<p>Ethiopia has announced the willingness to start the fourth water storage of the dam, just coincides with President Abdul Farita, President and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abi Aihamd at the "New Global Financial Convention" summit Smiling scenes, conflicts broke out recently, and if diplomacy failed again, the Egyptian authorities responded to the most serious crisis alternative to threaten the country.</p>
<h4>dual risk</h4>
<p>Dr. Abbas Salaki, a professor of dam and water resource professor at the College of Africa Research in Cairo, said that the fourth water storage of the revival dam has caused many dangers to Egypt, the most important of which is equivalent to the total water storage in the past three years The volume is 17 billion cubic meters, while the dam reservoir lacks this number. In addition, Ethiopia to carry out similar work on other dams in its territory will bring serious risks to Egypt and Sudan.</p>
<p>Abbas Saraki emphasized that the risk of the fourth water storage is not less dangerous than the third water storage. The third water storage causes a significant decline in high dams for high dams, because the water level of Lake Nasser is reduced, and at least steam is steaming. About 10%of the water loss stored in the form and leak below the surface.</p>
<p>In an interview with Peninsula TV, Saraki warned that Egypt's loss of 1 billion cubic meters of water means that the agricultural field loses $ 1 billion per year.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the four water storage of Fuxing Dam caused the loss of about 18 billion to 25 billion cubic meters of Egypt, which prompted Egypt to implement multiple compensation projects, cost billions of dollars, and damaged the Egyptian economy.</p>
<p>Egyptian experts criticized Ethiopia's "charges" that did not harm downstream countries on water storage operations, and said that relying on alternatives to respond to the damage of the rejuvenation dam, it does not mean to acknowledge the facts.</p>
<p>Regarding Egypt's stance on the fourth water storage, Salaki expects Cairo to continue to carry out political and diplomatic efforts to achieve a binding legal agreement and point out that Egypt tried to arrange for the international stage to pressure the Siabeba on Asia, and So as not to cause damage to it, rather than being attracted to the conflict between the highest interests and national institutions that may harm the highest interests and state institutions.</p>
<p>The Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation of Egypt Muhammad Nasal Ding Alam said that he was surprised to the "official disregard" of the fourth water storage of Fuxing Dam on Ethiopia, although the water safety of Egypt constituted " Extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Muhammad Nasar Ding Alam said in an interview with Peninsula TV that he was worried that Ethiopia would try to use this situation to impose a factor, although he signed an agreement with Egypt and Sudan in Uganda.</p>
<p>At the same time, the former minister emphasized that Egypt is a big country that can protect its own interests. It has proven this in a more difficult situation. Essence</p>
<h4>Between Egypt and Sudan</h4>
<p>On the other hand, Muhammad Hafitz, a dam and river experts, predicts that if the two lower water outlets of the rejuvenation dam will be kept open until the end of the flood, this means that the completion of the fourth water storage will be delayed, not 9 It ended in mid -month, but was postponed until the second half of October.</p>
<p>Muhammad Harfz explained that it confirmed that Ethiopia plans to use the bypass flood channel as an alternative to the intermediate corridor. After the fourth water storage is completed, drainage with Sudan and Egypt. Baba did not close the downstream outlet in the fourth water storage process, and then seized the water flow from the Sudan for the next few months, and 8.5 billion cubic meters of water storage of its dam reservoir. This requires the fourth water storage of Sudan in Ethiopia Start storage at the same time.</p>
<p>The expert told the Peninsula TV that the fourth water storage will end after the storage is equivalent to 43 billion cubic meters, including Sudan's share. Crisis occurs at the remaining 9 billion cubic meters.</p>
<p>Muhammad Harfz explained that in the past four years, the scale of the floods of the green Nile River is much greater than the average flood, and the Egyptian government has done a good job in managing Lake Nasser, but it has lost the lake during the "Kuir" flood. Most of the amount of water stored, and the specified share (estimated at least 55.5 billion cubic meters) has decreased, a decrease of about 10 billion cubic meters from 2016 to 2018.</p>
<h4>Various response methods to choose</h4>
<p>Former Egyptian Foreign Minister Assistant Masum Malzk said that there are many choices for the development of these situations, including continuing diplomatic pressure on Ethiopia through relevant international and regional institutions, and retaining this issue in front of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Egyptian diplomat emphasized that it is necessary to emphasize that the rejuvenation dam will cause damage to international peace and security. This is something that Egypt must pay attention to, because it is necessary to establish a closer relationship with African countries.</p>
<p>Masum Malzk pointed out that Egypt is needed to strengthen diplomatic contact with large powers led by the United States, the European Union, China, and Russia, because these countries have close relationships with Ethiopia and use this to pressure them to ask them Accept the signing of a binding legal agreement on the Ethiopian Renaissa Dam to protect the rights of upstream and downstream countries, as well as the need for Arab countries to intervene and promote Ethiopia's "listening language". Damage, Egypt will remain silent, so Ethiopia has made a strategic error.</p>

However, a survey of the European Union Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday showed that a quarter of the members of the Chamber of Commerce have experienced the decoupling of headquarters and Chinese business in the past two years.

<p>The new oil leakage of the Nigerian Shell Factory pollutes farmland and rivers, destroying the livelihood of the Niger Delta fishery and agricultural community. The region has long suffered environmental pollution caused by the petroleum industry for a long time.</p>
<p>National oil leak detection and response agencies(Corporation)Tell the Associated Press that the leakage incident comes from the cross -Niger pipeline operated by Shell. The pipeline is through the community in the Augnen Lalem area. The headquarters in London has been facing Local resistance.</p>
<p>The oil leakage has not been determined, but the photos released by the activists show that the farmland and the water surface are defiled by oil, and dead fish falls into viscous crude oil.</p>
<p>According to data from the United Nations Administration of Environmental Planning, although there are often leakage accidents in the region due to the lack of maintenance and pipelines, activists claim that this is a "major event."</p>
<p>Fernetfas Donatone is an environmental activity person. Its non -profit organization is responsible for monitoring the leakage of the Delta region. He said that this is one of the worst situation in Ogunlan in the past 16 years. " Start on June 11.</p>
<p>"The flood lasted for more than a week and rushed into the Okulu River -this river was connected to the Atlantic Ocean, which influenced several communities, which caused several communities and caused several communities, which caused several communities and caused several rivers. More than 300 fishermen are displaced. "</p>
<p>Donaton said that the tide further deepened the oil to about 10 kilometers (6 miles) near the country near Harcott, the capital of the country.</p>
<p>More than 20 years ago, due to the deadly riots caused by residents' protesting environmental damage, shell company stopped Ogunlan's production, but Cross -Nerr pipeline still transported crude oil from the oil fields in other regions to the export pier through the community in the region.</p>
<p>Director Director of Nosdra Idris Musa(Idris Moses)It is said that the leak has been controlled, but it is dealing with the influence of the leakage of the farm and the Oukuru River, and said that the project runs through the community and has now fallen into stagnation.</p>
<p>Mouza accused the residents of saying, "Response delay," and added, "but the project is in progress."</p>
<p>This obvious ride originated from the distrust and dissatisfaction of the Niger Delta region with a rich Platform of the Niger Delta. The region is mainly the home of ethnic minorities. They accused the Nigerian government marginalized.</p>
<p>Activators said that the income of Africa's largest economy relies largely on the Petroleum resources of the Niger Delta, but the pollution caused by this production makes residents unable to obtain clean water, damage agriculture and fisheries, and increase the risk of violence.</p>
<p>In 2020 and 2021, NOSDRA recorded a total of 822 oil leaks, causing 28003 barrels of oil to the environment.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-26T13-18-42/1-1687784999.png" />Many oil leakage incidents occurred in the Nigerianiani -Hill Delta region. In 1956, Nigeria first discovered the amount of commercial oil. Since then, there have been multiple oil leaks in Niger Delta. According to the data of the government leakage testing agency, in the past ten years, it has been recorded in the past ten years. 9828 Petroleum leakage incident</p>
<p>Donaton said that the community was very angry about the destruction of the shell equipment caused by the disruption of the shell equipment, and was worried that the regulatory agency and Shell would blame the residents' destruction behavior. "</p>
<p>Petroleum companies often blame the leakage incident on young people who are indignant in the affected communities, which may evade their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Shell said it is working with a joint investigation team composed of regulatory agencies, Ogunlan residents and local authorities to determine the reasons and influence.</p>
<p>The Shell stated in a statement that the response team of the shell "has started, and according to the safety requirements, [mobilization] to the scene to take the environmental protection, personnel and equipment safety possible action."</p>
<p>NOSDRA confirmed the results of the joint investigation, but the cause of the leakage has not been announced.</p>
<p>Donatone said hundreds of farmers and fishermen who were cut off their livelihoods would insist on restoring the environment and then compensated.</p>
<p>At the request of the Nigerian government, the UN Environmental Planning Department conducted an independent environmental assessment of Ogunlan and released a report in 2011 to criticize the pollution of Shell and the Nigerian government in 50 years. Clean up.</p>
<p>Although the government announced its cleanup in 2016, there was almost no evidence that the ground had been recovered, and the government said that the lawsuits of community protests and local activists hindered progress.</p>
<p>Legandi Miti, a senior Ogany Environmental Protection activity and the former chairman of the Oguni people, said, "For the Niger Delta and other regions of Africa, the credible cleaning work is originally a lighthouse. But there is no credible cleaning work, "he added," this is a covering behavior, we can't see its influence. "</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) The Swiss intelligence department said on Monday (June 26) that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused the country where many international organizations are located to become the center of Russia and Chinese spy activities.</p>
<p>"Russia destroyed European -based peaceful order." The Swiss Federal Intelligence Agency (FIS) said in its annual report. FIS is responsible for the stealing work of Switzerland.</p>
<p>FIS said: "The effectiveness of maintaining peace and security international organizations such as the United Nations or European security and cooperation organizations continues to decline; there is no sign of indicating a stable world of a stable world."</p>
<p>Overall, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国驻瑞大使在乎瑞中关系就不要实施制裁/a-63663739">Switzerland's security situation is being affected by the increasingly fierce competition between great powers</a>The Ukrainian war exacerbated this competition.</p>
<p>FIS said that the world is shifting to the bipolar world order shaped from the United States and China.</p>
<p>But at present, Russia's war in Ukraine will still be the focus of Switzerland's security environment.</p>
<p>FIS said: "Foreign (mainly Russia and China) spy activity is still very high to the composition of Switzerland."</p>
<p>The agency said, "In Europe, Switzerland is one of the countries with the largest number of Russian intelligence officials who carried out activities under diplomatic cover. Part of the reason is that Switzerland is the role of many international organizational hosts."</p>
<p>The European headquarters of the United Nations and the headquarters of multiple UN agencies are located in Geneva.</p>
<p>There are usually hundreds of diplomats gathered in various meetings of these institutions in Geneva.</p>
<p>FIS said that this year, Switzerland took over the rotating chairman of the Security Council, "adding spy threats facing Swiss individuals." These Swiss people are dealing with the archives of the United Nations Security Council and making decisions.</p>
<p>The agency said that the Ukrainian war forced it to expand its surveillance scope to areas that have rarely received attention so far, such as the Turkish, India and Eurasian Economic Unions because Russia is using companies in these countries to purchase.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), after the US President Biden said that Xi Jinping was a dictator, State Brillings stated in the latest interview <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论中美的独裁者风波何时平息/a-66014223">supported Biden's statement</a>Essence Sunday (June 25) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antony-blinken-secretary-of-state-face-the-nation-transcript-06-25-2023/">In the United States CBS "in the" National Interview Program</a>Brinken said, "The president's speech has always been very frank and very direct. He expresses very clearly, and he is also talking for all of us."</p>
<p>Brinken emphasized, "I told my Chinese colleagues during this trip that we will continue to do what you don't like, saying what you don't like, just like you will continue to do what we don't like, saying that you don't like what we don't like, saying that If we don't like it, the same. "</p>
<p>Last Tuesday (June 20), when a fundraising event in California, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登称习近平为独裁者-北京公开的政治挑衅/a-65987541">Bayeng talked about the "balloon incident" that made the already intense Sino -US relations continued to fall into the freezing point</a>He said, "Xi Jinping's particularly angry reason was that when I shot down the balloon filled with two spy equipment, he did not know where it was." They don't know what happened, it should not be its destination, because the wind has deviated from the route. "</p>
<p>One day before Bayeng's speech, Secretary of State Brosyl, who visited Beijing, met with Wang Yi, the first leader of Chinese diplomatic affairs and the foreign minister Qin Gang, held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Active signs, Biden himself also gave Bolling's visit to China to give "he did great" and believe that Sino -US relations are "walking on the right road." It is conceivable that the "dictator" remarks make Chinese seniors very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>On June 21, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning said at the press conference that Biden mentioned the dictator when he mentioned that "the United States' remarks were extremely ridiculous, irresponsible, seriously violated the basic facts, seriously violated diplomatic etiquette, and seriously violated the Chinese side. Political dignity is an open political provocation. China has strong dissatisfaction with this and resolutely oppose it. "</p>
<p>In the Sunday interview program, Secretary of State Blinger did not show the meaning of deliberately diluting the presidential speech. He said, "The main purpose of this visit to China is to bring more stability to the relationship between the two countries. I think that China also has obligations to deal with this relationship responsible to ensure that the profound differences between us will not evolve into conflict. "</p>
<p>He believes that China and the United States now have established a <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专家评布林肯访华对话是好的-但安全风险并未消失/a-65962928">better way to communicate</a><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论-布林肯访华结束中美稳定双边关系的考验才刚开始/a-65971604">How to perform this</a><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美财长-拜登总统和我都认为保持美中沟通很关键/a-66004349">Will hand over the answer sheet to people in the next few weeks or months</a> 。</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line</h3>
<p>The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

<h3></h3>
<p>Blingken arrived in Beijing on the morning of June 18, arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in the afternoon to talk with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang. However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."</p>

<h3>Analysis: Pay the way for Xi Jinping to attend the San Francisco APEC Summit in November</h3>
<p>After talking with Qin Gang, Brinken wrote in Twitter that the two sides discussed how to manage the relationship between the two countries in charge through open communication channels. The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>suspense revealed</h3>
<p>Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be on the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>Blinger to complete the main goal of this trip</h3>
<p>According to usual, the US Secretary of State visits China, and Chinese leaders will meet with it. However, there are exceptions, such as when Plingken's former Pompeo visited China in October 2018, Xi Jinping did not see him. At that time, the Sino -US trade war had debuted, and US Vice President Pence had just delivered a tough speech on China. The relationship between the two sides was very tense. Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66036410/59247338"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-26T14-26-00Z/59247338_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany in Chinese), one of the three major rating agencies has lowered its forecast for China's economic growth this year, from 5.5%to 5.2%. This is the first global rating agency to reduce the forecast of China this year. However, before, the main investment banks including Goldman Sachs also lowered relevant forecasts, and Goldman Sachs dropped from 6%to 5.4%.</p>
<p>The Chinese government sets about 5%of the target of this year's economic growth. The growth of the first quarter of this year was 4.5%.</p>
<p>In a statement in Sunday, S &amp; P finger, consumers and real estate market confidence in the real estate market, leading to economic recovery. This is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国幻想的破灭/a-66033341">China's economic downturn</a>The main risk.</p>
<p>After canceling the strict zero -clearing policy of three years, the world's second largest economy has recovered, but the speed has slowed in recent months. In May, real estate investment fell again, and the growth of industrial output and retail industry was lower than expected. The officially announced youth unemployment rate reached 20.8%of the record.</p>
<h3>Consumers take time to recover confidence</h3>
<p>Professor Horsstlöchel, a School of Frankfurt Finance and Management, told Germany: "A economy does not say that a button can be recovered. It must be seen that the Chinese government's strict control policy for more than two years has caused the economy to fall into a lot Large degree of paralysis. Now you need to restore people's confidence. For example, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/疫後首個618戰績揭曉-專家中國消費仍疲軟/a-65955650">in the field of consumption, growth is also very slow</a>Essence This is a clear signal that shows that consumers have no real confidence in the future of the Chinese economy. In addition, the world economy's support for China's exports is not as good as the past. "</p>
<p>Professor Limotor's analysis believes that whether it is the impact of the economy during the previous period of control or the news of the high unemployment rate of youth, it has affected people's consumption confidence and is more willing to save money. The geopolitical tension between the United States and China also brings uncertainty.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-26T14-26-00Z/59951899_401.jpg" />Experts believe that the strict measures and consequences of the epidemic period will still take time to disappear.</p>
<h3>Limited development in the field of high -tech also affects the employment of youth</h3>
<p>On the issue of unemployment rate, Professor Roller said that the severe manifestation of the problem is that young people who have received three to five years of college education have to accept jobs that are far lower than their education level. This will bring dissatisfaction. In addition to the impact of strict new crown measures on the economy, the cause of this situation also has such as further supervision restrictions in the high -tech field in recent years](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國推ai管理法-人工智慧也要姓黨/a-65275966)related. As a result, this area has to lay off or recruit so many fresh graduates because its growth is no longer so fast. Such structural problems also play a role. For example, Alibaba, Tencent, etc. have been under pressure in terms of data and antitrust laws in recent years. Its market value has also shrunk significantly. Operating performance is no longer as straight as in the past.</p>
<h3>should support the private economy and attract foreign investment</h3>
<p>S &amp; P believes that if China wants to promote the economy, possible measures include relaxation of restrictions and down payment thresholds, expanding loans and infrastructure financing, and financial support for consumption.</p>
<p>Ning Jizhen, member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and deputy director of the Economic Committee, called on a group of policies to promote the rise of economic recovery on weekends. "The macro policy is small", he said, "Policy can come out early and can get out early."</p>
<p>Last week, China lowered its loan benchmark interest rate, the first time in 10 months. Two weeks ago, the central bank lowered the short -term and medium -term policy interest rates.</p>
<p>Professor Limorie said that the central bank's interest rate cuts can help promote investment, and because China's inflation is very low, it can bear such measures. In addition, it is estimated that it will stimulate the economy through fiscal policy and infrastructure projects. However, measures to deal with structural issues are also important, such as <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/每周工作一小时算就业中国失业率统计引争议/a-65837480">increase support for private economy</a>Further attract foreign investment and restore restrictions on high -tech fields.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>Technology stocks are founded</h3>
<p>With the tightening of regulatory policies, the market value of Chinese technology companies has continued to shrink, which has exacerbated the market's concerns about the slowdown in China's world's second largest economy, and investors' emotions are generally affected.</p>

<h3>Anti -monopoly and data security</h3>
<p>Since the end of 2020, Beijing has increased its supervision of Chinese technology companies on the grounds of antitrust and guarantee data security. In addition to being criticized and interviewed, many technology companies are fined to varying degrees. After 20 years of loose control, the Chinese Internet industry has been deeply damaged.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>Common features</h3>
<p>Some experts have noticed that mostly the controlled enterprises are capable of collecting a large number of user information and obtaining platform companies with absolute advantage in the market. Maximilianmayer, a professor of global science and technology policy at Bonn University in Germany, analyzed the Voice of Germany: "The purpose of this movement is to strengthen the supervision of large Internet companies and its data processing methods."</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>down the altar</h3>
<p>Not only did technology companies encounter severe damage, but the founders of these companies themselves also felt the power of the government's heavy punch. The first one was Alibaba's founder Ma Yun. In late October 2020, Ma Yun high -profile attacking the Chinese financial supervision system. Soon after, Alibaba's financial business -the listed plan of Ant Group was stopped by the Chinese regulatory agency. Ma Yun faded out of the public vision.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-26T14-26-00Z/59455776_303.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Wealth Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Xi Jinping, a Chinese national leader, put forward the goal of "common prosperity", and the Chinese technology industry giants have expressed their full support. For example, Tencent and Alibaba will invest 50 billion and 100 billion yuan respectively to help "common prosperity." According to external analysis, the Chinese government uses suppression to promote technology giants to share their wealth with employees and consumers, and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in politics.</p>

<p>Under the dual pressure of China's reins tightening the "network security" reins and the United States held up the "accountability law of foreign companies", it was only officially announced that it was officially announced that it was officially announced by the China Internet -Ending Car Drops of the New York Stock Exchange at the end of June this year. "The first shot of large Chinese Internet companies from U.S. stocks. All in all, on the one hand, Chinese companies, which are listed in the United States, have to face strict review of Chinese regulatory agencies on the one hand, and on the other hand, they also face more rigorous risk disclosure requirements in the United States.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>blocked by the United States</h3>
<p>While "soft technology" enterprises encounter China's supervision, "hard technology" companies such as Huawei and DJI are more restricted from abroad. For many years, the United States has not only been committed to eradicating Chinese equipment such as Huawei in its country, but also trying to convince other countries not to buy related equipment. "Safety Equipment Act"(Secure Equipment Act)It is one of the latest actions made by the US government to combat China Telecom and technology companies.</p>

<p>Another example of tightening the restrictions on Chinese technology companies is to include Chinese artificial intelligence giants Shangtang Technology on a blacklist. The US government said that the company on the list provides support for China's military development. This week, the US Treasury Department also included a number of Chinese companies on the entity list, including the world's largest commercial drone manufacturer DJI innovation and multiple biotechnology companies. It is strictly forbidden to invest and export technology on the list Essence</p>

<p>According to Reuters, the market is widely expected that the regular meetings of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China in July are expected to announce a policies that stimulate the economy.

<p>The insiders of the Japanese ruling party proposed to relax restrictions, mainly considering that Japan and the United Kingdom and Italy decided to jointly develop the next generation of fighters. Cooperation means that Japan can no longer strictly adhere to the combat equipment developed by third countries.</p>
<p>According to Japanese regulations, Japan only allows exports or transfer and "rescue", "transportation", "surveillance" and "minesweeper" and other military equipment exports that do not include the purpose of killing.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) "Frankfurt Report" published a comment article entitled "PekingSalbtraum", pointing out that Russia's Wagner's mercenaries were incident, which not only made Beijing feel nervous because of worrying that Russia was in chaos, but also made it possible to make Xi Jinping has doubts about the stability of his power, and even affects him <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳兵变给习近平敲响了警钟/a-66033766">Murder of Wu Tong Taiwan</a>Essence The author wrote:</p>
<p>"What happened in Russia may once again make the Chinese leadership like a nightmare, which is the second time for more than 30 years. This leader tried to convince the world that he was strong and unintended. In 1991 (The same as China) system collapse, and the entire country has disintegrated. Now in Russia, the leaders have been questioned. The lesson in Beijing in 1991 is to make the people live a richer life, but at the same time, it will be politically accepted politically. Keep control. Private troops like Wagner, Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping will never allow it to exist. However, he may also ask himself at the moment of no one: if he is in chaos, can he really be right? All state institutions maintain trust.</p>
<p>The world should not be sent to China to relax internal political control. If Xi Jinping can use Putin as the experience of the army's commander, it is a good thing to think about whether it is necessary to attack Taiwan for a military attack. Ukraine's 16 -month action shows that the objective disadvantage can also resist stubbornly, causing the invaders to be in a serious predicament. Although Taiwan does not have the depth of territory like Ukraine, who can say that this small island country cannot do all this? If Taipei is obvious to good armed forces, it will be an effective deterrent to those good warriors in Beijing. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-26T14-58-00Z/65693314_401.jpg" />The mutiny of the Wagner Corps also makes Xi Jinping nervous?</p>
<h3>Dangerous "Smart City"</h3>
<p>The "Sunday World News" published a guest article entitled "Why China's Smart City is so dangerous?", Pointing out that China uses artificial intelligence to manage cities. One of the weapons is a comprehensive monitoring of citizens. Relevant technology has been exported to many other countries.</p>
<p>"In China, people are fascinated by intelligent networked machine systems, which is clearly reflected in China's monitoring design. This technology makes monitoring residents more convenient and is in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/后疫情时代的中国智慧城市当道/a-53925591">smart city</a>The direction of (Smart Cities).</p>
<p>Chinese officials have installed a large amount of sensing equipment in various types of space in the city, and set up many called '[urban brain] called' <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/一切均无法遁形上海城市大脑火眼金睛/a-57748025">urban brain</a>'(Citybrain) command center. These centers are collected and used by artificial intelligence to analyze all data in the city, and show them to the staff and urban managers in the digital cockpit in the digital cockpit.</p>
<p>The vision of 'city brain' is influenced by the party's leaders, scientists and industry. President Xi Jinping regards it as the key to making cities smarter through artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing.</p>
<p>China has announced that 500 cities have announced that they will build smart cities. China is also committed to expansion in regional and global. Alibaba's smart city technology has been exported to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-26T14-58-00Z/65409310_401.jpg" />Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia introduced Alibaba's smart city system</p>
<p>"Many cities that have introduced Chinese smart cities will lose their sovereignty on their own data, because the use of artificial intelligence in this system is too complicated to fully understand. In addition, there are many questions that there are no answers: city brain networks with global interactive city interaction What will it be? Where will it be made? Who's the interests of the city's brain network? What technical standards and algorithms will follow? "</p>
<p>The author of the article, Valentinweber, is a researcher at the German Foreign Policy Association (DGAP). One of the research points is network security. He believes that smart cities can help China get sensitive data in other countries. The higher the intelligence of export monitoring infrastructure, the easier it is to carry out spy activities, and the higher the influence of China in related areas.</p>
<p>"Once China and the territorial disputes between Malaysia or other countries in the region have developed into an open state of hostile. From the mid -term, the Alibaba city brain positioning monitoring facilities and data streams in Kuala Lumpur can be integrated into the battle map of the Chinese Air Force fighter aircraft "</p>
<p>The author believes that "in 2023, we are still far away from the large -scale network of urban brain. Nevertheless, the political decision makers of democratic countries should still realize that China’ s geopolitical characteristics of exporting smart city projects to foreign countries. "</p>

But then the content of this speech was deleted on the Chinese Internet. Why does the voices about citizenship touched the sensitive nerves of the authorities? Under the high unemployment rate of young people at the moment, can Chinese graduates who are about to enter the society are awake in front of power?</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/tj2-06212023141621.html">China "leftovers blind box" is widely welcomed by young generations</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/sc-06162023104911.html">China National Bureau of Statistics: work for one hour a week, even employment</a></em>**<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm-06152023101737.html"><strong> China ’s youth unemployment rate in May will innovate high economic data weakness </strong></a>At present, as the graduation season of Chinese universities, as many as 11.58 million college graduates are about to step out of the campus and enter the society to make a living. At the same time, the unemployment rate of urban surveys from 16 to 24 in China in May of China reached 20.8%, a record high.</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the unemployment of young people, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued a notice on the 25th (Sunday) that it will start the half -year "2023 college graduates such as young people and other young employment services" to pass a number of assistance measures Let these young people can achieve employment or participate in employment preparation activities before the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong> Dean of China Agricultural University </strong> <strong> Ye Jingzhong's graduation speech was deleted </strong></p>
<p>On the occasion of whether college graduates are worried about whether they can squeeze into the harsh employment market, Ye Jingzhong, Dean of the School of Humanities and Development, Chinese Agricultural University (referred to as "Chinese Agricultural Adults College"), " Do not extinguish the light of true and beautiful ", which arouses public opinion.</p>
<p>According to the "Chinese Digital Age" report of overseas online media, the hospital was in [Official WeChat public account] on June 21(https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vox6KDdHGvRImPC0EVB8dg)The full text of Dean Ye Jingzhong's speech was published. But as of now, this article is <a href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/I7TRJCGR05438Q4K.html">Netease</a>, <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/689738844_260616">Sohu</a>, <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/639063504"> Know almost</a>The reprints of multiple media platforms have been deleted.</p>
<p>In response to this speech, Chen Chuangchuang, a director of the National Autonomous Federation of Students and Scholars of the United States, told this station: "I still admire the speech of this dean. In fact, in the current China, let them speak some truths, especially so big that is so big In the environment, it is very difficult. "</p>
<p>Tang Jingyuan, a commentator of the American current affairs, said: "His speech has touched the institutional contradiction of the CCP, that is, power is omnipresent, and power surrounds everyone."</p>
<p><strong> Ye Jingzhong: Keep awake in the siege of power </strong></p>
<p>So, what did Dean Ye Jingzhong talk about in his speech? According to the publication of the Agricultural Adults College, Ye Jingzhong pointed out in his speech that from a world perspective, he often felt that the "three views" were broken, the bottom line was penetrated, and his imagination was serious. In this era, he especially wanted to tell the graduates: "Keep remaining in the siege of power!" Because he was worried, "You will" follow the customs in the siege of power ", gradually obsessed with power, lost self, confused, confused Life. "</p>
<p>Ye Jingzhong took the recent social incident, for example, a action of the power system can allow the harvester to lift a long team on the highway, reclaim the green water and green mountains into terraces, and turn yesterday's "returning farmland to forest" to today's today to today "Returning to forests and returning to farming"; more serious, power may also create omnipotent illusions, so under the light of light, "forcibly transformer" and "refer to mice as duck".</p>
<p>Ye Jingzhong also talked that the rules and training of power can make people rigid and numb. For example, he said that a student works in a pollution control department in the south and manufacture a large amount of data reports every day. The only requirement is to ensure that the data meets the standard; a student works in a supervision department in the west. Relief, but many villagers in many villages have not even heard of scanning the code; a student is responsible for food safety supervision in somewhere in the east, and takes half a minute in front of the rural supermarket for half a minute. "Delivery".</p>
<p>Tang Jingyuan told this station: "He (Ye Jingzhong) involves the power of the CCP government has seriously violated any public space and private fields that any normal society must have, so it will cause such a 'finger rat The state of duck' or thousands of horses. "He pointed out that the distortion of the entire Chinese social atmosphere is because of the omnipotent and intervening of government power, distorting the normal ecology of society.</p>
<p>Regarding the power issues mentioned by Ye Jingzhong, Chen Chuangchuang told this station: "In fact, the core reason is that there is no political right in the hands of the Chinese people, no votes, and no change in government rights." He believes that the unemployment problem of young people in China is also because of the problem of unemployment of young people because of the unemployment problem. During the past three years, the wanton for power has seriously harmed the national economy.<strong> Ye Jingzhong: Do not extinguish the true and beautiful light in the siege of power </strong></p>
<p>During the speech, Ye Jingzhong told the graduates that although everyone was difficult for everyone to be alone under the temptation, domination and rules of power, "I still hope you don’t become 'delicate' because of the attractiveness of power, don’t want to be smooth, don’t want to do not want It becomes arrogant and arbitrary because of the control of power, and do not become numb and confused because of the rules of power. Because you will always be the beam of light in the eyes of the teacher. "</p>
<p>Ye Jingzhong also mentioned that power is not essentially different from or bad, but the practice of power may bring both lying and creating false, making bad evils, rotten than ugliness, but also to achieve integrity, good, good, and aesthetic.</p>
<p>He encouraged graduates: "In the face of the siege of power, I can't ask you to hit a hard wall like an egg, but I hope you can retain the true and beautiful soul in the fragile shell; I hope you will not extinguish the soul deep The light of the real goodness and beauty; I hope you will keep the courage to run freely towards the real, goodness and beauty, and even if you fall down, you can smile. Your running may allow more people to get equal Freedom, let more people be respected. "</p>
<p>In response to Ye Jingzhong's appeal, Tang Jingyuan believes: "What is refracted behind the call is to hope that students can maintain an independent thinking ability and do not easily cater to or obey their power. From the perspective of the CCP authorities or systems, this is obviously that it is obviously that it is obviously that it is obviously that it is obviously. Acknowledged with them. "</p>
<p>However, Tang Jingyuan also believes that in a social atmosphere of "all power -centered", especially if graduates are facing the pressure of huge employment survival, it is very difficult to maintain independent thinking ability and the bottom line of human beings. big.</p>
<p>Chen Chuangchuang emphasized that maybe when these young people encounter huge survival difficulties in the future, they will be forced to reflect on how to change this kind of power and strive for the most basic rights for themselves. At that time, China's political change could come.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-26T19-47/000001.png" />Morgan Chase said that Amazon is expected to achieve the fastest delivery service ever this year. (Reuters)</p>
<h4>Amazon (Amazon.com Inc) (Nasdaq Stock Exchange code: AMZN)</h4>
<p>JP. Morgan analysts Doug Anmuth and Bryan M.smilek boldly predict that Amazon will replace Walmart in 2024 and become the largest retailer in the United States.</p>
<p>If this prediction becomes a reality, this will be a huge change in the retail industry in the United States. The US retail industry will transform into a new retail industry with high e -commerce penetration, short delivery time, and high "stickiness". Morgan Chase even predicts that this year Amazon's total commodity transactions (GROSSMERCHADISE VOLUME (GMV) will increase by 11.6 % year -on -year to $ 477 billion.</p>
<p>This growth prediction of JP Morgan Chase shows the confidence of Wall Street stock market analysts for e -commerce toughness. Although e -commerce companies such as Amazon had a great prosperity during the epidemic, they did experience a difficult year last year.</p>
<p>In the analysis of Amazon's report, Anmeus and Smallhrak said: "It may be affected by macro pressure, physical retailers, and transformation of overall channel retail after the epidemic. Since the first time, the growth rate is more than 10 % for the first time, only 8.5 % year -on -year. "</p>
<p>This year, Amazon's GMV continues to grow, mainly because of its grocery and clothing. The product category with insufficient market penetration rate has achieved a very steady growth, and its rapid delivery services are increasingly the highlights of the industry. Amazon is also expected to realize the fastest delivery service ever this year.</p>
<p>In addition, Morgan Chase also predicts that by the end of this year, Amazon will have about 300 million Prime members worldwide. In 2021, Amazon had more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. In other words, the increase in this just two years is indeed eye -catching.</p>
<p>In addition to huge members, Amazon also has huge control in the e -commerce market. Morgan Chase analysts predict that by the end of this year, the company's e -commerce market share will reach 42.2 %, a year -on -year increase of 106 basis points.</p>
<p>38 analysts in Tipranks are quite optimistic about Amazon. Among them, 37 were rated to "buy" Amazon's shares, and one of them gave "holding" rating, and the average target price of the first -year period was $ 139.80.</p>
