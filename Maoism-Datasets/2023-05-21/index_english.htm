<p>The World Health Statistics report released by the World Health Organization pointed out that the progress of key health indicators in recent years has stagnated, and the report also reminds people to pay attention to the increasingly serious threat of non -infectious diseases and climate change.</p>
<p>The report released by the World Health Organization on Friday (May 19) has emphasized that as of 2022, compared with the trend from 2000 to 2015, the progress of key health indicators in recent years has stagnated. The report calls on countries to coordinate and strengthen response measures.</p>
<p>The United Nations News Center reported that the report records the latest data of the crown disease epidemic on global health. These losses have led to the continuous decline in the progress of sustainable development goals. From 2020 to 2021, crown diseases have caused 336.8 billion years of life losses worldwide, which is equivalent to a 22 -year life of a person's average loss per person.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the number of mothers and children has decreased by one -third and one -half, respectively. The incidence of infectious diseases such as love, tuberculosis, and malaria also decreased, and the risk of premature death due to non -infectious diseases and injuries was also reduced. These progress has increased the life expectancy worldwide from 67 in 2000 to 73 in 2019.</p>
<p>The Director -General of the WHO Tan Desai said: "The report issued severe information about the threat of non -infectious diseases. These diseases have caused huge and increasingly serious losses to life, livelihood, health systems, communities, economy and society. The report calls on countries to greatly increase investment in health and health systems in order to return to the orbit of achieving sustainable development goals. "</p>
<p>Data show that although the overall health status has improved, the percentage of deaths caused by non -infectious diseases each year has been increasing. At present, nearly three -quarters of people who die due to diseases are caused by non -infectious diseases.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, it is expected that in the middle of this century, non -infectious diseases will account for about 86%of the annual number of deaths, that is, 77 million deaths will be attributed to non -infectious diseases. Since 2019, absolute numbers have increased by nearly 90%.</p>
<p>Although the health risks of smoking, drinking, violence, unsafe water and sanitary facilities, and children's development are reduced, the progress is still insufficient, and the risks of air pollution and other issues are still high. The prevalence of rising obesity shows no signs of reversal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65647590/61980687"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T-11-56-00Z/61980687_303.jpg" /></a>Russia has become India's largest crude oil supply country</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) caused Western sanctions in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in Moscow, forcing Russia to sell crude oil at a discount, India has become the main buyer of Russia's oil in the past year. According to data from Vortexa, a ship tracking company, the oil imported from Russia in South Asian countries exceeded its historical record in April.</p>
<p>In fact, Russia became India's largest crude oil supply last last month, and its supply exceeded the sum of Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Before the outbreak of the Ukrainian war in February last year, India had rarely purchased from Russia.</p>
<p>However, as the sanctions cut off the connection between Russia's major banks and most Western payment systems, finding the way to pay Russian crude oil became a challenge. In the past year, Indian importers have been buying Russian oil and other products with India's rupee, but the restrictions on the currency initiated by the West means that Russian companies cannot convert rupees into currencies in Western countries such as US dollars or euros.</p>
<h3><strong> Russia is worried about a lot of rupees </strong> **</h3>
<p>At the same time, the opportunity to buy discount crude oil has expanded India's huge trade deficit in Russia.</p>
<p>According to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India, in the first 11 months of fiscal 2022-23, India's imports from Russia were close to $ 4.1.5 billion, while exports were only $ 2.8 billion. This led Russian Petroleum Corporation and Banks to leaving billions of Rice in their Indian bank accounts-they are worrying about using this pile of cash.</p>
<p>"I think this situation will not last long," the New Delhi Observer Research Foundation(ORF)Researchers and Russian experts, Nandanunnikrishnan, told Germany, "If the two sides cannot solve this problem, it will not only affect the purchase of oil, but also affect all problems."</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov recently commented on the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Conference in Guoa, India. Bloomberg reported his speech: "We need to use this money. For this reason, these rupees must be transferred with another currency. Now we are discussing this issue."</p>
<h3><strong> The close relationship between India and Russia makes the West worry </strong></h3>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the uncertainty of the payment mechanism also hinders India's weapons imports. New Delhi and Moscow have a long -term political and military connection.</p>
<p>India is the main buyer of Russian weapons. Although it has been working hard to make its military equipment diversified, in recent years, it has shifted more and more to the United States and France to buy it. According to Stockholm International Institute of International Peace, Russia has accounted for $ 8.5 billion among New Delhi's $ 18.3 billion in weapons imports. The two parties are also negotiating on a free trade agreement.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/调查如何看乌克兰战争各国差别大/a-64798559"></a>Essence New Delhi has repeatedly voted for the United Nations' resolution on Moscow. However, it calls for a conflict through dialogue.</p>
<p>At the same time, Western countries are worried about strengthening the trade relations between India and Russia, because they are worried that this will destroy the severe sanctions effect on Moscow.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T-11-56-00Z/62621168_401.jpg" />The Russians are sorrowing how to use a lot of Indian rupees</p>
<h3><strong> Is RMB a solution? </strong></h3>
<p>In addition to India's rupee, the UAE currency Diram and RMB are regarded as potential currency options to resolve the trade between India and Russia.</p>
<p>"Russia wants to have a currency that can be used to buy the goods needed for its economy ... The question is how to find this currency." UNINECIINANA said, "Russians will be happy to use RMB." He also It is pointed out that the bilateral trade volume of Russia and China is calculated by 100 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>In 2022, Russia and China trade reached a record high of 190 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>But Unikrigan pointed out that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印度眼中的安全威胁中国第一美国第二/a-64435242"></a>New Delhi will not be willing to allow trade settlement with RMB. Reuters also quoted Indian officials in March this year that the Indian government has demanded that domestic banks and enterprises avoid using RMB to pay Russia imported goods.</p>
<p>Another choice is to use the UAE currency Diram to pay India imported from Russia, but experts said that this may not be a practical long -term solution due to the sensitivity of the currency on Western sanctions.</p>
<p>Unikriganan emphasized that India and Russia can propose alternative solutions, such as effectively investing in rupees in joint ventures, and producing products that are useful or exported to other parts of the world in Russia. "There are many ways to use these huge sums of money, and the two parties only need to show the political will that can reach the agreement."</p>
<h3>India's appetite for Russian oil is getting bigger and bigger</h3>

<p>(Voice of Germany) According to the recent research, South Korea is a country raising a child in the world with the highest cost in the world. This discovery explains the country's fertility rate and an imminent population crisis.</p>
<p>According to the Korean "Korean Daily", the annual research report of the nursery and population research think tank in Beijing has listed South Korea as a country with the highest cost of childcare. Its cost is 7.79 times that per capita domestic production value (GDP). This is equivalent to 365 million won (equivalent to 251,562 euros or $ 271,957).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/報告中國育兒成本是世界第二高/a-65478032"></a>Followed by Germany (3.64 times) and France (2.24 times).</p>
<p>At the same time as parenting expenses rose, South Korea, as the 10th largest economy in the world, was born in another direction. Data released in March show that the country's fertility rate is 0.78, which means that only 78 babies were born in the lifetime of every 100 women. This is the world's lowest fertility rate. Compared with South Korea ’s fertility rate in 2000, 1.48 decreased significantly. In 1980, South Korea's fertility rate was 2.82 and 5.95 in 1960. Experts warn that South Korea needs to maintain 2.1 fertility to maintain population stability without relying on immigrants.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T-2-57-00Z/64040169_401.jpg" />South Korea's fertility rate is the lowest worldwide</p>
<h3><strong> The biggest cost is extracurricular tuition class </strong></h3>
<p>For Koreans, the biggest cost of a child comes from educational costs other than conventional public school education. "Korean Daily" pointed out that in 2022, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/整顿教培行业韩国的前车之鉴/a-58755633"></a>It is equivalent to 524,000 won (361.53 euros) per child.</p>
<p>Han Yejing, a lawyer of a 31-month-old daughter, said: "South Korea is a society that pays attention to education. For most families normal."</p>
<p>Han Yejing told Germany that the tuition class was called "Hagwon" in South Korea. Children usually started to go to such schools at the age of 4 and usually learn English during playing.</p>
<p>She said: "This is currently a major trend of Parenting in Seoul. People spend a lot of money for these English kindergartens every month, because they think that children are easier to learn language when they are young, and this is a very important skill."</p>
<p>Han Yejing admits that when she meets with her friends or family, she often talks about the choice of education. Her cousin's daughter has just entered an English kindergarten recently.</p>
<p>Another factor decided to send their children to the extra -curricular tuition class was that there were a large number of mothers in South Korea, and the tuition class also provided the children with a place to take care of.</p>
<p>Although private kindergartens also provide sports, music or other art courses, they pay more attention to English and mathematics. Han Yejing believes that most courses are English and mathematics-the study of these subjects is to ensure that children enter good middle schools, and then they are good universities so that they can find good jobs in the future.</p>
<p>"A good private education outside the conventional public school is to ensure that the child gets good results and can enter the best university." Han Yejing said, "Entering a top university is important, it means a good job, ensuring that it is a good job to ensure that The success of life. "</p>
<p>Dr Park Sain-in, an economist at the National University of Seoul, also believes that a large part of Korean family income is used for education, but he does not believe that the impact of this "competition" on young people is positive.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, Korean education is too competitive, especially in college entrance examinations." He told the Voice of Germany, "Obviously, the more children learn, the greater the opportunity to enter a good university, although the younger age is young Children may learn some sports, music and other content in extra -curricular class, but will eventually reduce the subjects they need to enter the university.

<h4>The century -old history of German elementary school</h4>
<h3>Primary school students to learn equally</h3>
<p>In the history of German education, this is still a new thing: in the past, students with privileges followed the classes of family teachers, and poor students were going to a popular school that was full of people; now it is -we are talking about 1919 -everyone reads together. At the time, the Eight -year Elementary School (GRUNDSCHULE, also known as Volkschule) was founded on the basis of the Weimar Constitution, and this year is the 100th anniversary of birth.</p>

<h3>Dressed in uniforms to class</h3>
<p>In 1933, the Nazi ideology entered the classroom: In this photo of 1939, almost all boys were wearing the Hitlerjugnd uniforms, and the walls were hung on the wall with pictures of the Ryzig battle monument that presented nationalism. Since 1942, Jewish students have been dropped out of school -what is often faced to concentration camps and deaths.</p>

<h3>Let's drink soup together</h3>
<p>This is the dining time of a primary school in Berlin. After World War II, the daily life slowly returned to normal, and the children could finally return to school. Due to food deficiency, many families rely on public food distribution. With the establishment of Federal Germany, the original education system composed of primary schools, middle schools and high schools was re -introduced.</p>

<h3>Class with the sickle ax</h3>
<p>With the establishment of Democratic Germany, East Germany's education system has also changed. Six or seven -year -old children enter POS Elementary School, covering 1 to 10 grades. The teaching outline and textbooks are uniform in the whole East Germany, with ideological colors. In Federal Germany, education is the affairs of various federal states to this day, so it is quite different from Balmei to Bavaria.</p>

<p>In the mid -1960s, under the framework of teaching reform, the eight -year elementary school was canceled and changed to a four -year elementary school, followed by different types of middle schools -vocational preparatory programs, practical middle schools, and liberal arts middle schools. This system exists to this day.</p>

<h3>Greek in the classroom</h3>
<p>In the 1960s, some so -called "customer -friendly workers" came from Southern Europe and Turkey to Germany. Their children also came together and would not speak German. This brings challenges for the school system: Therefore, a mining company KLöCKNER funded a Greek teacher to teach the children to read and write -these children were lucky.</p>

<p>This was a student of a school at a school in New Germany, a school in New German, in 1980. In East Germany, students can continue to stay in the school in the afternoon, which has become part of the education system long ago. West Germany is different.

<h3>Let students of physical and mental disorders enter ordinary schools</h3>
<p>In recent years, the new measure is to let students with physical and mental disorders enter ordinary schools to study together. This is based on the relevant conventions of the United Nations. However, many places also lack corresponding professional education teachers. Therefore, some parents still choose to send children with physical and mental disabilities to specialized schools.</p>

<h3>Class digitalization</h3>
<p>This is a primary school in Potsdam. Children take a frame of frames with electronic equipment, and then make them into videos quickly. Digitalization in elementary school has also caused controversy. Some people think that electronic equipment should be excluded from the campus, and some people think these are meaningful supplements.</p>

<h3>Insufficient teachers</h3>
<p>One of the major problems facing elementary school today is insufficient teachers. It is estimated that by 2025, there are about 26,000 teachers. One of the reasons is: Compared to other school forms, elementary school teachers have low paid. Therefore, the attraction of choosing primary school education majors is not great. Others want to transfer to this industry and lack corresponding qualifications.</p>

<h3>German elementary school is very good</h3>
<p>Despite this: According to a survey of the German Parent Council, most parents are satisfied with their children's primary schools. In terms of academic performance, German primary schools are also good. Although they are not top, they are in the upper reaches.</p>

<p>A Social Pioneer of the "Korean Daily" also accused the operators of the tuition class "using (parents) anxiety to plunder" and encouraged them to pay huge costs to keep up with the expectations of society.</p>
<p>The newspaper stated that parents have to pay for many years of additional tuition fees, "no wonder South Korea's birth rate is so low." Dr. Park Chengren has no children. He hopes that Korean society will gradually change, and no longer emphasize school learning, so that children have a more relaxed childhood.</p>
<p>"This will not happen soon, but I hope this is a change that may be seen one day in the future." He said, "I believe that good education is important, so that children can go to college and find good jobs, but many Koreans-including myself-I think the cost of private education has gone too far, and we need a better balance.

<p>(Voice of Germany) If the US Congress fails to raise the debt limit before the end of the month, the US Ministry of Finance may not be able to pay government bills. What if this happens, how will the global economy be affected?</p>
<h3><strong> What is the upper limit of the US federal debt? </strong></h3>
<p>The U.S. Congress first introduced the debt limit in 1917-refers to the national debt amount that the US Finance can bear. This measure means that the government no longer needs Congress to approve the issuance of each debt. The public debt bill was passed in 1939 and 1941.</p>
<p>Over the past 70 years, the upper limit of debt has been increased by 78 times, including 2011, when the United States failed to reach an agreement on the new upper limit at that time, the S &amp; P lowered US sovereign credit rating and triggered an increase in loan costs.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the US government encountered the current debt limit of $ 314 trillion, but the Ministry of Finance took great measures to allow it to continue to provide funds for government activities.</p>
<p>The next critical period is the upcoming June 1st, and Congress must increase the upper limit again, otherwise the US government may start exhausted funds and arrears debt.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are conducting fierce confrontation. The Republican Party hopes that the White House agrees to comprehensively reduce public expenses and carry out other reforms.</p>
<p>Republican senior leaders met with US President Biden at the White House last Tuesday (May 9) and tried to resolve the dispute, but the talks did not make major breakthroughs.</p>
<h3><strong> What are the consequences of the US government's default? </strong></h3>
<p>US Finance Minister Yellen warned last Sunday that the deadlock was actually "a gun pointed at the heads of the US and the US economy."</p>
<p>She said that if the debt limit cannot be increased, "financial and economic confusion will follow."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国财长六月一日起美国政府将面临债务违约风险/a-65491279"></a>-This move will have a profound impact on the United States and the global economy.</p>
<p>The shortage of funds will force the US Treasury to save expenses in order to first pay debts and interest.</p>
<p>This may mean the salary of delay payments including tens of millions of public sectors, including teachers.</p>
<p>Social security and medical subsidies for older and disadvantaged Americans, including veterans, may also be suspended.</p>
<p>Although any non -repayment debt may be temporary, Biden's economic adviser warned that even the "brief" breach of contract would cause US economic losses to 500,000 jobs.</p>
<p>They believe that the "long-term" default will cause GDP to plummet 6%and cause tens of thousands of enterprises and about 8.3 million jobs to lose-almost as much as during the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
<p>In the worst case, the United States will have to completely stop lending before July or August, which will further impact the global financial market.</p>
<p>Investors will subsequently question the value of US bonds. For a long time, US bonds have been regarded as one of the safest investments and the cornerstone of the world financial system.</p>
<p>The US government's breach of contract may seriously weaken global trade and cause deep decline in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>More serious default will lead to a sharp depreciation of the US dollar, the chaos of exchange rates fluctuates, and pushes the price of oil and other commodities.</p>
<p>Global inflation is likely to rise again. Due to the lack of trust in the financial system, the supply chain problem that has been affected by the epidemic may be worse.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T-4-57-00Z/64060116_401.jpg" />### <strong> What is the progress of the U.S. Party negotiations? </strong></p>
<p>The Speaker of the House of Representatives McCarthy and the Republican Party refused to reduce the budget in an incomplete reduction <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国触及债务上限-两党对峙引发经济担忧/a-64462461"></a>Essence</p>
<p>Republican's House of Representatives voted in late April to decide to reduce the proposed budget bill worth about $ 4.8 trillion. The bill will cancel the tax reduction and exemption of clean energy investment and overthrow Biden's plan to remove student loan debt.</p>
<p>However, the bill cannot be passed in the Democratic Senate.</p>
<p>Bynden has refused to negotiate so far, saying <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为避免政府停摆-美国众议院强推取消债务上限/a-59262024"></a>, Then he cut out the possible budget.</p>
<p>Biden hopes that Republicans will publicly promise that the United States will not breach contracts and be able to pay all the bills by continuous borrowing.</p>
<p>During Biden's tenure as Vice President in 2011, the Obama administration was forced to make pain to the Republicans to avoid breach of contract, and Biden hoped to avoid repeating the same mistakes.</p>
<p>Biden's budget plan will be reduced by nearly $ 3 trillion in ten years, mainly by increasing taxes to the rich-Republican Party is unlikely to agree with this.</p>
<p>After the talks between Bayeng and the senior leaders of the Republican and Democratic Party last Tuesday, McCarthy estimated that the two sides had only two weeks to reach an agreement that could be passed by Congress.</p>
<p>However, some analysts still believe that the expiration of the debt limit should be postponed to September 30 to avoid the risk of breach of contract immediately.</p>
<h3><strong> Can Biden quoted 14 amendments to the Constitution? </strong></h3>
<p>Theoretically, the president can quote Article 14 amendments to the US Constitution. The amendment stipulates that "the effectiveness of the US public debt authorized by law ... must not be questioned."</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that Biden can argue that he has the constitutional obligation to avoid breach of contract, so he can break through the upper limit of debt and continue the expenditure that Congress has approved.</p>
<p>However, this move almost definitely leads to long -term legal disputes, which may disrupt the financial market.</p>
<p>Republicans warned that Biden could not act unilaterally and the solution must pass through Congress.</p>
<p>This week, a public sector worked and workers' unions sued the Minister of Finance Yellen and Biden, asking them to ignore the debt limit in accordance with the constitutional obligations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit tries to ensure that the income of workers' income will not be punished because of breach of contract and preferential repayment of debt. (Agence France -Presse, Germany)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-21T-5-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />The Russian Ministry of Defense said: "Wagner's offensive operation under the southern army artillery and aviation support has liberated Artemovsk." Atmomusk was the name of Bakhmut in the Soviet era.</p>
<p>Ukraine President Volodymyr ZELENSKYY is participating in the seven major industrial group (G7) leader summit in Japan.</p>
<p>Bacht is a salt ore town with a population of 70,000. This is the oldest and bloodpiece of battle in the Ukrainian offensive for more than a year in Moscow.</p>
<p>Bacht is occupied by Russia and will be a major victory of Russia who has experienced a series of shameful failures.</p>
<p>Kiev has been preparing a large -scale counterattack for a few months. Zeroski previously stated that the fall of Bachst will open a road for the Russian army to occupy more regions of Donbas.</p>
<p>The head of the Wagner Group, Yevgenyprigozhin, released a film on the social platform Telegram, claiming that Bacht has fell into the hand of his organizational, and the soldiers in the film raised the Russian flag in the context of the ruins.</p>
<p>In the film, Porigzin said: "At noon on May 20 today, Bacht has been completely occupied." He also said that the Wagner Warrior would search for the occupied city and handed it over to the Russian government forces.</p>
<p>However, Ukraine, which claimed earlier this month, said that the war was successful in the success of Bacht and its surrounding areas that the war was not over.</p>
<p>Ganna Malayar, deputy minister of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, said: "Bachtter's battle is fierce and the situation is critical. As of now, our guardians have controlled certain industries and infrastructure in the region."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) based on a study published on Thursday (May 18), more than half of the world's lakes are shrinking due to dryness. A international research team published their research results in Science magazine and found that the main reason was global warming and human activities.</p>
<p>Only about 3% of the water sources on the earth are freshwater. Among them, the freshwater of natural lakes and reservoirs accounted for 87%. The report emphasizes the demand for water resources management solutions.</p>
<p>According to the research led by Fangfang Yao, a water writer at the University of Colorado, since the early 1990s, large lakes and reservoirs in the world have been reduced. The expert group said that in the past three decades, some important freshwater resources in the world have been lost at a cumulative rate of about 22 a year.</p>
<p>"More than half of the loss is mainly due to human consumption or climate warming." Yao Fangfang said that he pointed out that climate warming contributed "a larger share."</p>
<p>Researchers have also found that the changes in rainfall and runoff, the effect of deposits and temperatures have led to a decline in global lake water levels.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T-6-57-00Z/59164872_401.jpg" />The fourth largest lake in the world is now like this</p>
<h3><strong> Lake change data for the years of </strong> <strong> 30 </strong> <strong> Years </strong></h3>
<p>The research team measured the water level of nearly 2,000 lakes and other water bodies in the world, and made a report based on satellite data collected from 1992 to 2020.</p>
<p>In the United States, Made Lake lost two -thirds of water storage during the 28 years.</p>
<p>The study also found that unsustainable human consumption caused the lake to dry up, including the salty sea of Central Asia and the Dead Sea in the Middle East. Afghan, Egypt, and Mongolia lakes were affected by rising temperatures, resulting in an increase in surface evaporation rate.</p>
<p>Scientists say it is necessary to control global warming within 1.5 ° C to avoid the serious consequences of climate change. The world is currently warming at a speed of about 1.1 ° C.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>France has not rained for more than a month. This is the longest drought period since the meteorological records began in 1959. Western European high -voltage bands are squeezed by rain and clouds are the main causes of this phenomenon. Climate change may cause long -term existence of such drought weather. The longest river in France has almost dried up.</p>

<h3>energy shortage</h3>
<p>In early March, Lac Duchambon Reservoir's water level in the Alps in France was seriously insufficient, so that the hydropower station was no longer able to run normally. Hydropower accounted for 15%of French power supply, and people began to worry about the situation of power shortage. In 2022, France was forced to turn off some nuclear power plants because the low water level caused the nuclear power plant to be unable to get enough cooling water.</p>

<h3>The prospect is dim</h3>
<p>The Gatailan River near Turus has almost dried up. The supply of tap water in some parts of France has been interrupted. Paris has ordered emergency measures to prepare for serious drought again this summer. Some areas are no longer allowed to irrigate private pools or cleaning vehicles. The national water emergency plan is expected to be officially introduced within this month.</p>

<h3>Stranging Gentola</h3>
<p>Beginning at the end of February, the Gentola cruise ship shuttle in the streets of the city of Venice had been caught in a muddy riverbed. However, the situation has improved in recent days. Last year's severe drought caused severe apology for agriculture in northern Italy. People are generally worried that the situation will be worse this year.</p>

<h3>The drop in the water level has dropped sharply?</h3>
<p>Throughout the northern Italy, serious droughts appeared: local media reported that the water level of Mal Jiao Lei Lake was only 38%of the usual usual. The snowfall in the Alps in Italy in recent months is only half of the previous years. Last year, it has just experienced the worst drought in the northern part of Italy in the past seventy years. This year's situation is not optimistic. People are worried that drought will also affect the local tourism industry.</p>

<h3>The lowest water level in 30 years</h3>
<p>"I often walk by the river, how can there be no wet shoes." -Walking from Lake Garida to Sanbiagio Lake island, tourists' shoes are really wet now. Due to the serious insufficient rainfall, the water level in Lake, the largest lake in Italy has dropped to the lowest point in the past 30 years. The Italian government has also taken emergency measures to deal with serious water shortage.</p>

<p>The large river bed of the Rhine in the River in the River section of the River in Laifan, Germany has exposed. Due to insufficient precipitation and the sharp decrease in the amount of snow melting in the Alps, the Rhine's water level is much lower than usual. The German meteorological department said that this is the twelfth warm winter, and Meteorological expert UWEKIRSCHE told the German News Agency: "Climate change is still pressing step by step."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65636280/64761700"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T07-56-00Z/64761700_303.jpg" /></a>Some Ukrainian athletes oppose the government's position for resistance to international sports events (information pictures)</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), a Ukrainian member who participated in the two Olympic Games made a call to support Ukraine athletes asking the Ukraine government to re -consider their positions to resist international sports events.</p>
<p>Saradhaha(Olga's secret)It was a three -level bronze medalist at the three -level long jump of the London Olympic Games in 2012. She described the current situation as "difficult", but it said that the Ukrainian parliament will "do everything possible" to allow Ukrainian athletes to participate in the Paris Olympic Games next year.</p>
<p>"I think Ukrainian athletes should and have to participate in the Olympic Games," said the peaceful and free athlete rally held in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia last weekend, "they need the competition, they need to show our strength."</p>
<p>Last month, the Ukrainian administration passed a decree to prohibit national athletes from participating in the competitions with Russia and Belarusians. The decree actually canceled the qualifications of Ukrainian athletes to participate in some competitions for the Paris Olympics.</p>
<p>Saradha said that the Ukraine Parliament is calling on its European counterparts to "strive to achieve the prohibition of Russian athletes from participating in international competitions" and say that they are also continuing to lobby the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p>
<p>"The leaders of our sports organization said that they are trying to educate people at the international level (chairman of the International Olympic Committee) Bach." She said, "But as we see, Bach's decision and statement change a day. "</p>
<h3>Ukraine calls for banning Russia to participate in the Paris Olympics</h3>
<p>Saradha's opinion echoed the Ukrainian steel frame snow car player Vladyslavhelaskevych. At the Beijing Winter Olympics last year, Herraskovic played the poster "No War in Ukraine". He said resistance is not a goal.</p>
<p>"The Olympic Games and International Sports (provided) have a very large media platform." In an interview with the Voice of Germany, Herraskovic said, "We should not give this platform to the propaganda narrative of Russia and Belarus. In that case, they will increase soft power, and more and more Russians will take the front line. "</p>
<h3>International Olympic member criticized Ukraine: political intervention in sports</h3>
<p>The Ukrainian government's decree is to respond to the advice of the International Olympic Committee, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/国际奥委会支持俄罗斯运动员回归国际体坛/a-65170663"></a>The International Olympic Committee quoted some UN human rights experts to defend themselves, arguing that the comprehensive ban on nationality is discriminatory. It also criticized Ukraine's political intervention and reiterated its point of view "which athletes can participate in which international competitions cannot be determined by the government."</p>
<p>However, Ukraine Councilor Saradha believes that sports beyond politics is wrong.</p>
<p>"This war is so terrible that thousands of people are dying. We are talking about a war criminal that threatens the world with nuclear weapons." She said, "We know that in Russia, any athlete is essentially part of the propaganda agenda. . Russian athletes are still talking about the greatness of Russia and the Russian Empire. "</p>
<h3>Ukrainian athletes fled to Berlin</h3>
<p>Anatol Kotau, former secretary -general of the Belarusian Olympic Committee in exile, believes that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人权组织谴责国际体育机构奖励威权制国家/a-61316736"></a>Essence</p>
<p>He said at a conference convened by the Belarusian Sports Unity Foundation organized by an objection athlete: "The International Olympic Committee accused Ukraine for being unacceptable to interfere with sports, because the entire foundation of sports in Russia and Belarus is a state institution."</p>
<p>The articles of association of the International Olympic Committee prohibit political intervention on sports, and call on the Olympic Committee of all countries to "maintain autonomy and resist any form of pressure, including but not limited to politics, law, religion or economic pressure."</p>
<p>When asked if it would suspend the authority of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee in accordance with its charter, the International Olympic Committee only allowed the Voice of Germany to refer to its previous statement and said: "There is nothing to add at present."</p>
<h3>"Bach allows terrorists to participate in international activities"</h3>
<p>Although some sports have retained the ban on Russians and Belarusians, other projects, such as fencing, judo, and weightlifting -have decided to follow the advice of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>As a result, because of Judo athletes from Russia and Belarus attended, the Ukraine Judo Federation resisted the World Judo Championships held in Qatarha this month, claiming that the "most" Russians participating in the competition were "active soldiers."</p>
<p>Many sports organizations in Russia are related to the Russian Ministry of Defense, including the Moscow Central Army Club (CSKA MOSCOW). After verification of the Associated Press, 5 of the 18 Russians on the Entry list of Doha are members of the club. Daria Bilodid, a well -known Ukrainian athletes and two world champions, questioned this.</p>
<p>"This is Hu, isn't it?" She wrote on social media. "I think it is unacceptable to allow military personnel to allow a terrorist country to kill Ukrainians every day to participate in international competitions. This does not conform to sports values at all."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T07-56-00Z/60848255_401.jpg" />The Ukraine Olympic champion Nataliya Dobrynska said at the Tarin conference that the Olympic Committee led by Bach (picture) failed to adhere to its principles</p>
<p>The International Judo Federation stated that after the "independent background investigation", it has banned eight members of the Russian delegation to attend the competition, but these people are not athletes. It said that the person who was allowed to enter the list "was employed (Russia) Federal Training Sports Center", which belongs to state -owned enterprises, not military companies.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee has given the right to the Paris Olympic Games to each movement, and emphasizes that it has not made any decisions on the event itself. However, another Ukrainian Olympic player Nataliyadobrynska said at the Tarin conference that Bach's organization failed to adhere to its principles.</p>
<p>"The goal of the Olympic Games is to ensure world unity." The 2008 Beijing Olympic Games seven all -around gold medalist Doblinska said, "But see where to talk about Russia's aggression war?"</p>
<p>She said: "Bach allows terrorists to participate in international activities. We need to continue to put pressure on him to let him take it back."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Baltic International Shipping Association (BIMCO), headquarters headquarters in Bagoswed, headquarters near Copenhagen, reported on Wednesday (May 17): "From 2023 to 2032 More than 15,000 ships with more than 600 million tons are recycled. "According to BIMCO analysts Nielsrasmussen, this is more than double the recovery volume in the previous decade.</p>
<p>According to BIMCO, in the past ten years, 7,780 ships with 285 million tons in the world have been recovered, most of which were built in the 1990s. The association reports: "In the next ten years, the ships built in the 2000 will become the main source of recycling." And pointed out: "Compared with the 1990s, the ship's loaded tonnage built in the 1990s was more than twice that of the time at the time. It is expected that this will promote the growth of recycling and utilization. "</p>
<h3>stricter carbon emissions regulations</h3>
<p>BIMCO believes that the current shipping industry is more stringent <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/气候变化/t-41538394"></a>Regulations are also one of the reasons for increasing recycling demand. According to the association, the vast majority of ships are scrapped and re -processed in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in Asia. The international non -governmental organization's "Shipbreaking Platform" has condemned this approach to repeated cases such as environmental destruction, infringement of human rights, child labor, and death.</p>
<p>In fact, the harmless and safe demolition work of the environment should have been regulated globally. According to records, since 2009, there is an international agreement related to this, and Germany has approved the agreement in 2019. However, this so -called Hong Kong Convention (all named Hong Kong International Security and Harmic Environment Demolition Convention) will only be approved in at least 15 countries to join, and the total tonnage of the total commercial ships of the contracting parties will be Effective. BIMCO also announced that it would be optimistic after signing the convention in Bangladesh, saying that the effective date of the convention may soon come.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), the three -day seven -way Group (G7) summit will end on Sunday (May 21). During the meeting, the leaders of the seven major industrial countries <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体g7和中国/a-65686050"></a>—— From the militaryization of the South China Sea to "economic coercion" — has issued strong criticism.</p>
<p>The G7 oath should jointly respond to the challenges brought by China's "non -market -oriented policy and actions", including mandatory technology transfer and data disclosure. They warned that China has distorted the global economy, and the G7 leaders realize the importance of cultivating the resistance of "economic stress".</p>
<p>In the initiative document against "economic coercion", the G7 leader acknowledged the incident related to "economic coercion" "increasingly increasing" and promised to establish an agreement platform to improve the collective evaluation, preparation, and preparation of "economic coercion", and to prepare for "economic stress". Strategy and response.</p>
<p>Experts believe that although the document is not directly named, it indirectly mentioned the challenges brought by China's "economic stress", which are "powerful and detailed." DEXTERROBERTS, a senior researcher at the Atlantic Society, told DW that, given that these countries have different benefits and economic exchanges with different degrees of economic exchanges, the coordination and solidarity reflected by the statement is a "big event."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T08-01-00Z/65684441_401.jpg" />Some experts believe that G7's response to China's challenge is "powerful."</p>
<h3>g7 sword refers to China</h3>
<p>In addition to cracking down on "economic stress" initiative documents, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7联合公报政策方针不是为了伤害中国/a-65684805"></a>A severe warning of Beijing tried to condense the policy consensus on China. However, the communiqué still refers to "cooperation with China in areas where China is challenging and interested together" and "prepares to establish a constructive and stable relationship with China."</p>
<p>The G7 leaders emphasized that the world's major democratic countries directly express their concerns to China. The policy policy is not to harm China, nor to obstruct its economic progress and development. "We are not describing or turning inward", but "de -risk."</p>
<p>Experts said that this shows that the G7 leaders have reached a consensus on adopting a "positive geographical strategy policy" in China, but they believe that cooperation with Beijing to respond to global challenges is "indispensable."</p>
<p>"This is actually promoted by European countries in recent years, so it can be said that Europe has played a leading role in shaping democratic countries' policies for China, as shown in the so -called" de -risk "integration." Professor Zsuzsaanna Fernczy said to DW.</p>
<p>In response to G7's criticism, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said "strong dissatisfaction" to the communiqué, saying that the group's approach "has no international reputation." Beijing has accused G7 verbally claiming to cultivate a world of peace, stability, and prosperity, but in fact, "hindering international peace, damage to regional stability, and suppressing the development of other countries."</p>
<p>Roberts of the Atlantic Council told DW that Beijing's anger response showed that the G7 communiqué "touched the Chinese nerves" because "the text, specific content and field scope of" (the communiqué involved) "has been challenged by Beijing.</p>
<h3>to India not only rely on China?</h3>
<p>Another attractive occasion during the G7 summit is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7重頭戲澤連斯基今見拜登/a-65688525"></a>Essence This was the first time that the two met in the first face of Russia in February last year. Prior to this, India had been reluctant to criticize Russia's invasion, and its continued economic relations with Russia also attracted the attention of the international community.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T08-01-00Z/65685670_401.jpg" />This is two leaders of India and Ukraine. It has met in person in person since the Russia and Ukraine War.</p>
<p>Zeelianzki and Modi met on the 20th. Modi promised that India would do their best to help the conflict. He said that the war had a deep impact on the world, not just economic or political issues, but "human issues"; Zerrenceki invited Modi to work together to urge the end of the war.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that Modi is willing to meet with Zellezki that India may be "re -adjusting" its position on the current geopolitical conflict. Dr. Chongja Ian, a assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, pointed out: "This is India trying to rethink its relationship with Moscow."</p>
<p>As for Zellennki, through contact with Modi, he hopes to enable Ukraine to evaluate different choices on the negotiating table. "Ukraine does not intend to rely on China as a bridge (between itself and Russia), because India can also play this role." Zhuang Jiaying told DW that Modi and Zeleneski reminded China that Beijing is not a peace talks about Russia and Ukraine. "The only choice on the table".</p>
<p>G7 leaders hope to meet the challenges brought by Chinese and Russia and other autocratic countries to reach consensus. Zhuang Jiaying believes that the summit has largely achieved this goal, but in the future, more importantly, how G7 member states will transform these consensus into action, "how these different countries implement their commitments, and the efforts of implementing these commitments to implement these commitments Is it really condensed together?

This paragraph was accused of offending the PLA.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) in Singapore's "Duan Media" published an article "Talking Show Industry Storm:" Chinese "offense, national violence, and" review outsourcing "", the author Shen Du pointed out that in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被指冒犯解放军-脱口秀演员被警方立案调查/a-65638312"></a>In the performance of the public opinion caused by "excellent style and victory", a terrible signal is that in a considerable scale of the defense of the army of the army, the concept of the national state, the absolute order and the absolutely obedient condition, Among the language habits that can immediately trigger sensational mechanisms, when the PLA is not blasphemy as if it is in line with the system, we can clearly see that the momentum is becoming increasingly big, no doubt or even unable to cooperate. The unconditional recognition of national machinery as a compression system and the unconditional recognition of national violence, especially military violence.</p>
<p>The article says that it is precisely because of the continuous accumulation of depression, anxiety, and anger in daily life and have nowhere to vent. At the same time, there is almost no effective public discussion that makes people understand where the oppression comes, where the anger should be directed, and the dignified life What does it mean and what we can strive to resist as citizens, and the stories that are pervasive and dependent on the propaganda machines have almost blocked the possibility of recognizing the world from another angle -so depression and ourselves The anger was seamlessly transferred to the enemy needed by the country, and anxiety achieved the charm of power. Regarding the unconditional trust and rationalization of the official notification, it is discriminated against the non -dead corner of drug abuse, or the Kao Kao has become a trend, the "departments of the department" become a new preference for the marriage market, and they are different fruits on the same tree.</p>
<h3>Political trauma left by "Cultural Revolution"</h3>
<p>"New York Times" published an article "China Can't Wipe the Cultural Revolution Ten Years", author Pamela Paul said that in the new book "Red Memory -the Later of the Cultural Revolution" in the reporter Blannigen(Red Memory:The Afterlives of China’s CulturalRevolution)Among them, he noticed that under Xi Jinping's rule, China's cover of the history of the "Cultural Revolution" became stricter -as China showed unprecedented strength on the world stage, this sign made people feel deeply worried about its political health. Essence</p>
<p>The article said that the endless "Cultural Revolution" left political trauma. "No work unit can be spared," Blannigen wrote. "No family is innocent. Using" Tongzhi "to describe is too lightweight -between comrades, friends, husband and wife, and parent -child betrayal. After changing the direction again, the former victims began to fight back. This intimate relationship and the sudden reversal of policies to tear all the texture of Chinese culture, overturning Confucian filial piety ethics and updated communist blog love commitments. "</p>
<p>The article pointed out that when Americans talk about the Cultural Revolution, the discussion content is often about the rise of collective thinking and Wuhezhong, as well as performance -type anger in Twitter's upper and university campuses. Of course, the similarities exist: political leaders are inciting cultural wars, and polarized thinking narrows the category of different opinions to allies and heresy fingers. The media is more willing to shout slogan instead of driving deep discussions. But Blannigen's work provides equally important warnings: ignoring or distorting history will lead to danger.</p>

The author Yan Jiyu said that Xinjiang issues have always been international news hotspots in recent years. The ultimate care of universal value is more important; the manipulation of geopolpolitik should not be sold out of the painful struggle of flesh and blood, especially the flesh and blood of the vulnerable groups.

<h3>"Re -Education Camp"</h3>
<p>China has established so -called re -education camps in Xinjiang since 2017, detaining ethnic minorities such as Uighurs.

<p>In response to the current deadlock in negotiations, McCarthy pointed out that the White House representatives were "changed again" and refused to make concessions to cutting expenses. He said: "They actually want to spend more money than we spend this year ... We must reduce this year's expenses."</p>
<p>The two insiders revealed that Republican representatives rejected a proposal for the White House, which will make the 2024 non -national defense and national defense disposable expenditure in the 2023 fiscal year. McCarthy has repeatedly stated that he hopes to reduce non -defense expenses, but Democrats believe that maintaining funding is equivalent to effective reduction under inflation.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Bachurut is located in Ahwatz, Ukrandon, and is part of Donbas, the industrial area. Residents of local living are mainly Russian. Before the war, the population of Bachmut was about 70,000 to 80,000.</p>
<p>From February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and occurred [] in the city of Bachomut <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄乌战况巴赫穆特决战在即/a-65550358"></a>Have never paused. The fierce battle there is reminiscent of the First World War. The battlefield was covered with mines, and the trenches were shot ruthlessly and the rocket attack. The commanders of both sides of the battle are called [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄乌战争中最血腥的战斗巴赫穆特争夺战/a-65235766"></a>Essence</p>
<p>During World War II, the Nazi Germans drove 3,000 Jews into a mine near Bachmut and sealed the mines, causing everyone to suffocate and die.</p>
<p>Polish military expert Muzka(Konrad Music)In March of this year, the Bachurut area was inspected. After leaving, he said that he believed that the Ukrainian military continued to keep the city no longer military significance.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, he said: "Defending Bach Murut is now a political decision, not a military decision." He said that from a military perspective, the scale and price of Ukrainian losses have surpassed the city that keeps holding the city. income.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-21T12-13-00Z/65453377_401.jpg" />The competition against Bachmut is considered to be the longest and bloodpiectable battle in the Russian and Ukraine War, and both sides have suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>However, for the Russian army, Bach Mutt is very important as a transportation supply center. But more importantly, Bachurut can become the Russian army's stepping stone, helping the Russian army to advance to the long -awaited Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.</p>
<p>Clarmatsk and Slovejansk are within the range of Russian cannons. Moscow needs to control these two cities to complete its so -called mission of "the People's Republic of the People's Republic of China".</p>

<p>Reuters pointed out that if Bachurut is captured, it is also an important victory of morale after the Russian army has experienced a series of failures.</p>
<p>Although the loss of Bachmut will not have much strategic impact, the control of the losing the city is likely to hit the morale of the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Associated Press in March, Zelei said that he was worried that Russia's victory in Bachurut would trigger a voices in the international community and Ukraine's internal demands of peace. This was what he didn't want.</p>
<p>However, even if Bakhmut really fell, Ukraine can still be comforted from the fact that Russia has been resisting the Russian army for so long and let Russia pay a heavy price, because this shows that Russia's attempts to seize more Ukrainian territory will pay the same heavy heavier. cost.</p>

<p>A new study in Japan found that if the breast -lactating mouse is intake in Propanoic Acid, it will help mice to inhibit bronchial asthma symptoms.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported that this research results published in the international journal "Intestinal Microorganisms" will help develop a new method of treating allergic diseases such as intestinal bacteria and short -chain fatty acids as targets, and intervene in intervention The lifestyle of women during the siege prevents the symptoms of asthma in newborns. The perinatal period refers to the important period before and after the birth of 28 weeks of pregnancy to the week after giving birth.</p>
<p>It is reported that the researchers have prepared drinking water (SCFAS), which contain three short -chain fatty acids (SCFAS) including ethyl, as well as ordinary drinking water. They first let the pregnant female rats drink ordinary drinking water. After the birth of the mouse was born, the breastfeeding mouse was paid to one of the four types of drinking water. After weaning at the age of three, the mouse re -feeds ordinary drinking water to the mice and mice, and released dust mites in the trachea of the six -year -old mouse.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that the proportion of inflammatory immune cells such as acidic cells in the bronchial inflammatory fluid in the bronchial inflammatory cells such as obedrom acid drinking water during breastfeeding period is lower than the sons of other mice, indicating that The ingestion of propionic acid in breastfeeding can inhibit the allergic airway inflammation of the mice.</p>
<p>Propine is the main metabolites produced by microorganisms in many animal intestines including humans.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have shown that short -chain fatty acids have played an important role in maintaining intestinal steady state by maintaining the intestinal stability by the G protein coupling Antida and GPR43 expressed in immune cells. Researchers also specially cultivated female rats that cannot synthesize the receptors of GPR41 and GPR43, and they are grouping them with wild mouse according to whether they consume propionic acid.</p>
<p>It was found that if the mice and wild mice of the GPR43 were not synthesized, the allergic airway inflammation of the sub -generation would be suppressed.</p>
<p>The mouse of the GPR41 cannot be synthesized. Even if the propionic acid is ingested, the proportion of eosinophils in the bronchial alveolia irrigation fluid of the subcultisions will not change. Ensure for allergic tract inflammation.</p>
