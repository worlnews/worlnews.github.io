<h3>Re -construct a cross -Atlantic relationship</h3>

<h3>Berlin blockade during the Cold War</h3>
<p>After the end of the Second World War, the four victors divided Germany into a occupation zone. Berlin is also four points, and is in the Soviet occupation area like an island. On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked all water and land traffic to West Germany, and power supply was also cut off. The Western Alliance reacted.</p>

<h3>The door to the world</h3>
<p>On June 25, 1948, Lucius D.clay, the US military officer in Germany, ordered the construction of a Berlin air bridge. One day later, the first U.S. transport aircraft landed at Tempelhof at Berlin. The airport located in the US occupation zone became the most important hub of the air bridge. Today, people can still visit the airport that has become a myth and abandoned at the time of Berlin under the guidance of the commentator.</p>

<h3>Aircraft lifting</h3>
<p>For a full 14 months, 2.2 million west Berlin people relied on air to survive. The Allies designed a system of extremely precise operation: 3 air corridors were opened as one -way lane, 2 were used for take -off, and one was used for landing. At the time of the busiest, there are 5 planes at the same time!Great performance: In 14 months, there were 278,000 batches of transportation, with a total of 2.3 million tons of goods.</p>

<h3>Air Force Museum at the Air Force at Gotov Airport</h3>
<p>The second most important airport during the Berlin blockade was Gatow in the British area. The British implemented a 42%landing operation of the air bridge there. The transportation materials are used for liquid fuels and foods of the West Berlin. Patients and children were also shipped from there. Today, there is an exhibition that introduces German military aviation history at the airport apron.</p>

<h3>Son of the bridge in the air</h3>
<p>Today, most tourists coming to Berlin fly to the German capital at the German capital via TEGEL airport. Many people don't know that the airport is also inseparable from the air bridge. Tiger Airport is a contribution from France in the air bridge. In the autumn of 1948, the French Allied forces had only three months paved the largest runway in Europe, which was 2,5 kilometers long. On November 5 of that year, the third empty bridge airport in Berlin was put into operation.</p>

<h3>"Rice Gun Bill"!</h3>
<p>The Berlin people call the Allied transport aircraft "raisins bomber". Because before landing, American pilots will use their own parachute to cast a small assistance package and send a joy to the children waiting there. The wraps are mostly chocolate and rubber sugar, and sometimes there are raisins.</p>

<h3>Gift from the sky</h3>
<p>Canned food, dried fruits, milk powder, coffee -today, "Caring for parcels" is an exhibit in the museum. At that time, they were the last hopes for survival of many Berlin people. "Care", a US private rescue organization, rented an aircraft at the time and sent up to 1,000 "care packages" to Berlin every day. The package worth $ 15 is available for one month for a family.</p>

<p>The first batch of trees in Tiergarten's reappearing were even transported by the air bridge. With the past in the winter of 1948, the park located in the city center was almost bare. In order to spend severe winter, Berlin residents used trees as fuel. On March 17, 1949, the restraint project was launched.</p>

<p>In the process of landing Berlin, a total of 78 pilots died. In 1951, the monument was erected on the air bridge square, which commemorated. The three darts above symbolize 3 air corridors, and Berlin people call them "hungerkralle". There is a replica of the monument on the Main River Frankfurt and Celle. At that time, the plane flew to Berlin from the two cities.</p>

<p>Description: Many people chose to go to English -speaking countries during the implementation of Hong Kong's immigration after the implementation of the National Security Law. There are not many who come to Germany. The two Hong Kong people interviewed by Voice of Germany chose Germany because of their opportunities in their lives, but the factors of Hong Kong's political environment have an important role in promoting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66083993/60704597"> <img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-02T-16-55-00Z/60704597_303.png" /></a>(Voice of German in Chinese) Ms. Lin said she was a native of Hong Kong. "I was studying in Hong Kong. When I was in college, I went to Britain to study in the last year. Then I worked in Hong Kong. I was in an accounting firm. I got married and had children."</p>
<p>In 2021, Ms. Lin applied for a master's degree in Germany, and later came to Germany with her husband and son through this visa. She tells that half of the reason to come to Germany is because of children. Her son read Waldorf Education in Hong Kong, because in the mainstream school, the child reads language-Chinese and English have obstacles, and psychological pressure is great. "He begged the teacher to give him less homework, but it didn't work." After taking the child to see the psychologist, she was worried that the child may "take medicine and read". She felt that the little child was "unreasonable" Essence So she took her child away from the mainstream school and went to the co-LearningCenter under the Waltedford system in Hong Kong, and the child was very happy and could grow back to the child's original state. However, since the autumn of 2019, she cannot find a teacher with such qualifications in Hong Kong to continue the so -called "alternative education" to the children. When she saw a master's degree in Germany who provided education in Education in early 2021, she had a interest in her own entry and was applied and was admitted. "I ask if I can bring my child to study, the answer is okay." "I also want to see why Waldorf's education can help my children. My child has obstacles to study language, but he can be in Waldorf in Waldorf. When growing up, he can learn well. His grades are not necessarily very good, but he loves reading, and he has more reading than me. "</p>
<p>After graduating from Germany, although Ms. Lin did not engage in teachers' work due to German, she found a job in the accounting industry of the Bank, and continued to stay in Germany with her family.</p>
<p>Ms. Lin said that for her husband, she made <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港移民潮為何親中藍絲也撤離/a-61475091">immigration</a>Germany's decision is difficult. "Because he doesn't want to leave Hong Kong. He actually loves Hong Kong. He feels that he shouldn't leave Hong Kong. We didn't come out of the parade in 2019. What did you publish? But we also love Hong Kong at all. But we also love Hong Kong. All of our family members. All in Hong Kong. "</p>
<p>The other half of the reason for Germany is related to politics. "Politics does not mean freedom of speech, or something," Ms. Lin said. She said that Hong Kong's implementation of the TSA examination system in the past ten years has led to the school's first grade in primary school in order to achieve good scores. "They practice their children from this direction, and his homework and exams are also in this direction. Teachers regardless of their children's ability. I say that my child has limited ability when he is studying language. He has more than ten homework at that time. He did his homework until 12 am and 1 am, and he would get up at 6 o'clock the next day. "In 2015, the government held public hearing on the TSA examination system under social criticism. Ms. Lin participated in the public hearing and feedback her child. However, the end result is, "They continue to let the children test TSA. I was cold at that time. Why can education be done like this and ignore the life and death of the child. At that time, I felt that there was no confidence in the government. They do education, but they ignore their children, as long as their grades. "</p>
<h3>One person election: Li Jiachao in the eyes of Hong Kong people</h3>
<p>In addition, Ms. Lin also observed that the government has gradually moved towards the direction of control. "Control is more, and it has an impact on my children. What topics do you want to read, it is not allowed. It is something that is not sensitive. If the government feels on his adults, you are not allowed to go. Well. "In addition, considering the privilege class and social unfairness of the Mainland, Ms. Lin is also worried that children will encounter uneven opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Today, more than two years have passed, Ms. Lin feels that the decision to leave Hong Kong is correct. "Now my child is very happy to live here." Ms. Lin said, the child can learn what he wants to learn freely. "For example, he likes the history of World War II, he can read. That is surprising to me, because his teacher allowed him to study." In contrast, Ms. Lin said, when she left It has been said that the degree of freedom in Hong Kong will decline, and it is true. Whether it is the use of "peaceful travel" application software during the epidemic period, or the difficulty of extracting compulsory provident fund in advance, Hong Kong people reflect this.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Government Push the "Anxin Travel" APP why Hong Kong people are uneasy</h3>
<p>Ms. Lin said: "Also, if my child continues to grow in Hong Kong, he has to at least 50,000 yuan in the Hong Kong government to complete the" Tomorrow Lantau "-is a big place to develop the north. Because all of them are all. Things <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体看只有爱国者参选的香港立法会选举/a-60194472">No need to go to the parliament to discuss</a>Well. So no matter how much you say, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion, 10 trillion, no problem, you can pass within 3 seconds. Therefore, if we continue to stay in Hong Kong, we will pay a lot of taxes, and my child will pay a lot of taxes. Just like the Mainland, the child will lie flat, because he can work hard, and he can't be the person he wants to do, and he wants the job he wants. The more he earns, the worse the quality of life. "</p>
<h3>"Now there is only a unilateral sound"</h3>
<p>Mr. Li and his family came to Germany because of an opportunity at work. In April last year, Mr. Li's company in Hong Kong had a vacancy in his parent company in Germany. He applied and got it. "You also know that the situation in Hong Kong at that time was relatively chaotic, and the government's situation was not very good. It was worse than the previous year and the previous year. Especially the situation of children's education. Seeing that there was an opportunity to work in Germany to work, Decide here. "</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that after the Citizen Movement, he discovered that "why does the Hong Kong government do this? It seems that it doesn't care about our freedom." The Hong Kong government should do what. He felt that he was usually a little fair before. "The sound of the positive and negative sounds must be together, but now it seems to be gone. There is only a single voice. Even if the other party strives to say, explain it until the end (the other party) There is no way to accept it, and then just do it according to my plan. I think this situation is not good. "</p>
<p>Mr. Li said, I don’t know when I can return to the state of Hong Kong ten years ago or 20 years ago. "That is, I want to say anything, you can go to the parade, or what I do. Don't violate the law. The situation in Hong Kong is more dangerous now. You can also see some reports, saying that what I said on the street, said on the same day that he did not catch you that day, but I set up one in the future. I set up one in the future. The law can go back to what you did before, what bad things you did, and he caught you again. I don't think it is good. "###? Many Hong Kong people have encountered hardships after immigrating to Britain</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that it would be difficult to leave Hong Kong without this job opportunity in Germany, because there were more things to give up. "I know that many Hong Kong people have gone to Britain. Because the method to go to the UK is more convenient. But what do you want after going to Britain? If you don't have a job, you need to think about it. So this part also needs to be considered. Come out, but after a few years, it is still impossible, and if you have to return to Hong Kong, it doesn't make sense. "</p>
<p>Now more than a year in Germany, Mr. Li said that his family liked life here. Of course, "the contrast between Hong Kong and Germany is also quite large." Hong Kong is a major metropolis, and in Germany, they live in a small village. "But overall, our life here is happy. There is not much difficulty when children study." Mr. Li contacted the Hong Kong people in the German Association German, of course, I do n’t understand when I came, I ca n’t say German. Many things have to help others. So if you want to find some Hong Kong people in Germany, we can understand at least what we can say and help each other. " You can talk about your language.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Foreign Institute of Foreign Experts Examination: What makes them go?</h3>
<p>In Germany, Mr. Li has always paid attention to the news of Hong Kong. His feeling is that Hong Kong's economic situation and security have continued to decline. "I don't know when it will return to my situation when I was in Hong Kong before. I guess it may not have this opportunity in the next five years and eight years, and it may not be able to return to the previous level. The Chinese or Hong Kong government has a big change. But I haven't seen this opportunity now. "</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that he has no plans to return to Hong Kong. "I thought about it a little, but there was no chance to go back. Especially what are the other <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/李家超希望最迟明年完成基本法23条立法/a-64434862">23 articles</a>Ah, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座評論國安法3年的香港故事/a-66077700">Guoan Law</a>These two have a great impact on us. Because its rules are not clear, for example, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/港府申請禁播願榮光歸香港-以免誤認國歌/a-65834428">it still has to be banned</a>That <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/願榮光歸香港禁案延后-全球港人串連合唱/a-65888826">Rongguang's Song of Hong Kong</a>Essence Its legislation is unclear. It is not clear how it goes to this legislation and how to implement this regulation. "</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) When the Koreans woke up on Wednesday (June 28) in the morning, they found that they were one year younger than Tuesday, and some were even two years younger.</p>
<p>This large -scale "aging" is attributed to the effectiveness of a new law. The law abolish the traditional age calculation method (virtual age) and requires Koreans to use the internationalization method of internationalization.</p>
<p>Lee Wan-Kyu, director of the South Korean Legal Department, said at a press conference on Monday: "We expect legal disputes, complaints and social confusion caused by age computing will greatly reduce."</p>
<h3>Korean people used to use virtual years before</h3>
<p>According to the traditional method of calculating the age in South Korea, a person is already one year old when he is born. Everyone's age will increase by one year on January 1, not only the age of birthday.</p>
<p>Although the international age calculation method has been used in South Korea for legal documents and medical documents since the early 1960s, the traditional calculation method is still used in daily life.</p>
<p>But the law passed in December last year ended this traditional system. According to a government polls in September last year, 86% of Koreans plan to use international systems.</p>
<p>"I will be 30 years old next year." Choi Hyun-Ji, a 27-year-old office staff member, told Reuters when talking about the traditional age algorithm. "But now I have more time, it's great."</p>
<h3>"Squid Game" reveal Korean social problems</h3>
<h3>Why is the virtual age continued in South Korea to this day?</h3>
<p>This traditional algorithm has also been used in other countries in East Asia before, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉语拼音之父周有光的岁数/a-17370220">for example China</a>, Japan and North Korea, but they were abandoned decades ago.</p>
<p>It continues in South Korea, partly because of the importance of "age" to Korean, because people usually use respect, such as "Unni" (sister) and "OPPA" (brother), not personal names.</p>
<p>"Age is indeed important." Humanologist Mo Hyun-Joo told AFP, "If you don't know people's age, it is difficult to communicate with them."</p>
<p>In the traditional algorithm, everyone in a grade in the school is considered the same age, so we can talk to without a language level.</p>
<p>There are also the third age computing system in South Korea. It is used to calculate a person's school year, when to participate in the compulsory military service, and when to buy alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>The system is similar to the traditional algorithm, but starts from the age of zero. The system is not affected by new laws and will continue to exist.</p>

<p>After a teenager was shot by the police, France experienced the third night of riots</p>
<p>Ri riots began on Tuesday to weekends. From south to north, from Paris to a number of cities in Marseille, France appeared to have a smashing and burning incident.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, the French Ministry of the Interior said that more than 3880 fires occurred on public roads, and Wednesday was 2391 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Ryleos in the suburbs of Paris, the attacker hit a car to the mayor's house. When his wife tried to escape with their two children, he was injured.</p>
<p>In Marseille, about 30 young people broke into a gun shop and stole at least four shotguns. Mayor Marseille called on the state government to immediately send the army.</p>
<p>Lyon Mayor Gregory Dussey(Grégory Doucet)He called the city's "unprecedented" riots and called on the police for reinforcement. After he had a crisis meeting at the city hall, he said that the city was "troubled by unprecedented intensity, degeneration and violence."</p>

<p>French Minister of Home Affairs Gérald Darmanin revealed that France deployed 45,000 police officers. Starting from Tuesday, there are people arrested every night, as few as three or four hundred, as many as thousands of people.</p>
<p>Darmaning asked their parents not to let their children participate in riots, and some children participating in riots were only 13 years old.</p>
<p>The government also requires closing overnight bus and tram services, and said that armored vehicles will be used to assist in law enforcement.</p>
<h3>Police, Mother, Macron</h3>
<p>Tuesday, French President Macron(Emmanuel Macron)It is said that the behavior of shooting Nahler is "unforgivable."</p>
<p>But his remarks caused anger by the police union, accusing him of being eager to judge the police involved. Police unions called for them to be innocent before discovering guilty.</p>
<p>Another French police group posted a tweet saying that the police officer who "opened a fire to a young criminal" "was great" and blamed the death of the teenager on his parents, claiming that they "could not educate their sons."</p>
<p>The Minister of the Interior Dalmarn said the tweet was "despicable and unacceptable" and would take legal operations. This tweet has been deleted.</p>
<p>Nahler's mother Mounia said in a video circulating in social media that they took her child and urged people to participate in the parade and commemorate her son.</p>
<p>"He is still a child. He needs his mother," she said. "He kissed me in the morning and said," I love you, mother '. "</p>
<p>"One hour later, I was told someone to shoot at my son. What should I do? He is my life. He is my everything."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-02T10-37-52.000Z/_130254185_macron.jpg" />Image source, EPA</p>
<p>President Macron told reporters in Marseille: "Nothing can prove that the death of a young man is reasonable," he called for, "keep calm and realize justice."</p>
<p>"I want to express the feelings of the whole country about what happened and the death of the young Nayer, and tell his family's support and the emotions of the country."</p>
<p>"We have a teenager." He said: "This is puzzling and unforgivable." He added that the case had been handed over to the court immediately, and he hoped that the judicial would "quickly complete his work."</p>
<h3>2017 Dispute Dispute</h3>
<p>Nahler was the second person to be shot and killed by the police during the traffic law enforcement this year. Last year, 13 people died in this way and set a record.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-02T10-37-52.000Z/_130250141__130224324_microsoftteams-image-3.png" />Image source, reuters</p>

<p>Screenshot screen at the shooting scene</p>
<p>The human rights organization criticized a law amended in 2017, expanded the scope of police guns, and allowed the police to shoot without the driver's ignorance of the parking order. Official statistics show that after the law is revised, the number of police shooting vehicles during driving has been increasing every year.</p>
<p>Reuters said that since 2017, the French policeman's deadly shooting during the traffic interception process was black or Arabs.</p>
<p>The police officer said that he shot because he felt that he was in danger. However, a video released online and verified by AFP showed that a policeman pointed at the driver with a gun through a window and seemed to shoot at close range when he tried to drive away.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse also reported that in the video, you can hear a person saying, "You will be shot on the head", but it is not clear who said it.</p>
<p>When the shooting occurred, there were still two people in the car. One of them escaped, and the other was a minor and was arrested and detained by the police.</p>
<h3>Is the French policeman a racist?</h3>

<p>Police on Champs Elysiums Avenue</p>
<p>The core issue of these protests is that French police are racists?</p>
<p>The riots on the streets believe that this is the case. Many people interviewed by BBCs have the same feeling of people from the Nantaili ethnic communities from Paris.On Friday, the UN Security Council called on France to "seriously solve the deep problem of racism and discrimination in law enforcement."</p>
<p>In response, the French government said that there was no basis for these charges.</p>
<p>But protesters are the problem.</p>
<p>They said that unless the French government acknowledged and started dialogue on their concerns, they would continue to the streets.</p>
<p>However, business owners and residents in the community are paying a price, and their property is destroyed every day, and they want the riots to stop.</p>

<p>There is a wolf borrowing on the streets of France.</p>
<h3>Social media short video to help long riots</h3>
<p>Many comments say that the scene in the past few days is reminiscent of the 2005 riots.</p>
<p>At that time, the riots were taken by "outsiders" -most of them were photographers or reporters recorded on the spot.</p>
<p>This time, through the rough observation of Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat, you can see the latest riots' first -person perspective.</p>
<p>Through the labels such as "NaHel" and "riots", we can see hundreds of videos, showing that teenagers run in French cities, break into the store, set fire to destroy cars and trash cans.</p>
<p>In one of the videos, the masked people were closer to an automatic cash machine with a circular saw, and dozens of people cheered.</p>
<p>In another news, a senior asked helplessly who was shooting: "Why do you do this?"</p>
<p>The third video shows that a shop was smashed by a group of people, and many people were shooting with mobile phones.</p>
<p>Many videos have a humorous tone, and there are even a few videos to show riots to show riots.</p>
<p>President Macron has accused the social media platform in terms of inciting violence and promoting organizational protests.</p>

The amount of money and subsidy amount of nearly 10 billion Euros is unprecedented, and throw money out of the window ... These description words are enough to reflect how controversy caused by Intel in the German government in the German government's huge subsidy commitment.</p>
<p>The chip manufacturer Intel invested in Magdeburg, Germany, and the construction factory was above the schedule, and in the past few months, Intel and the German government have been negotiating for subsidies. At the beginning of this year, the subsidy mentioned by the German government was obviously 6.8 billion euros, and now it is tentatively scheduled to be at 9.9 billion euros. It shows that Intel's powerful bargaining ability is not included, which does not include possible industrial electricity subsidies in the future. In June, the German federal government signed a letter of intent for investment with Intel. The German Economic Minister of Economic Head said that the investment shows that Germany is very attractive as a high -tech base. Obviously, the subsidy of these 9.9 billion euros is actually attractive.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, although the global energy crisis has been reduced, China still purchases a large number of natural gas from various countries.</p>
<p>Data show that so far this year, 33%of long -term liquefied natural gas transactions have flowed to China. China is expected to become the world's largest liquefied natural gas importing country in 2023. And Chinese companies have agreed to buy more natural gas with a long -term basis for the third consecutive year, and the number exceeds any country.</p>
<p>The report emphasized that China's purchase strategy is to scattered imports between countries to buffer geopolitical interference in one step. Last month, China Petroleum Natural Gas Group signed a 27 -year agreement with Qatar and obtained its equity in the country's large expansion projects. At the same time Signed a contract with American developer Chenierenergy Inc. for decades.</p>
<p>Traders who understand the government's strategy revealed that the power outage and supply in the past few years have changed the way of thinking of Chinese policy makers. They are now more inclined to protect energy and safety, rather than considering fuel importers that may be overdone.</p>

<p>"Numerous facts tell us that only by the signs of winning the brave on the narrow road and daring to fight and be good at struggle, can we win dignity, take the initiative, and effectively safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests." Xi Jinping said, "In our team, we can't be in this team. There are timid ghosts, let alone people who have a different heart, in Cao Yingxin in Han, and the same bed dreams. "</p>
<p>When talking about the letter of letters and visits, Xi Jinping said, "What are the fear of the petitioners?" When he enumerated himself in Zhengding and Ningde, Hebei, he publicly accepted the case of petitions and solved many issues. After that, every time I arrived in the place, I insisted on doing so, emphasizing that "letters and visits are the masses who came to the door, which can be exhausted or ventilated."</p>
<p>Xi Jinping criticized the corruption within the party, and some (party members) asked for comparisons. When they saw some bosses waving their money like soil, spending on the sky, they were unbalanced. Some people are lucky, thinking that they are caught "falling eggs". Xi Jinping also recorded by the "Yuan Shi" records Xu Heng, "Although Pear has no master, I have the master", and the cadres who accuse the illegal discipline are the lack of this kind of cultivation and context, so that the defense from the heart is to fall into the degradation. Essence</p>
<p>When Xi Jinping attended the first meeting of the 20th Central National Security Commission on May 30 this year, he pointed out that China is currently facing "the complexity and difficulty of national security issues have increased significantly." He called for adherence to the bottom line of thinking and extreme thinking, preparing to "adopt a major test of high waves and even stormy waves", and said that China is currently facing "the complexity and difficulty of national security issues are significantly increased."</p>

The next day, Dana White, chairman of the Ultimate FightingChampionship (UFC), received a text message.</p>
<p>SMS is from Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta. He asked White whether Musk really wanted to play with him. White is the person in charge of the world -class comprehensive fighting competition, which are played on the cage -like ring.</p>
<p>Musk operates Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX. White called him and confirmed that he was willing to fight. White then converted the news to Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded on Instagram: "Send my address." This sentence quotes one of the most athletes awarded UFC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/24/sports/khabib-gaethje-live">Habib Nurgomeadov</a>Famous quotes.</p>
<p>White said that in order to organize this game, since then, he will talk to these two billionaires every night. He said on Tuesday that he "had been talking to the two people until 0:45 in the morning." He also said, "Both of them want to do this."</p>

<p>If you think that the cage between the two richest people in the world is just an unreliable gimmick on social media, then you are wrong.</p>
<p>White said that in the past 10 days, he, Musk and Zuckerberg -with the help of the consultant -behind -the -scenes discussion, and closer to the actual fighting. White and three insiders said that although the game cannot be guaranteed, the rough outline of the event is being formed.</p>

<p>White said that this would be a show match, outside the official jurisdiction and scope of broadcast rights, but he will help organize this event. White and a person familiar with the negotiations said that the two leaders of the scientific and technological circles agreed that the event should include charity, and the specific details are still being formulated. The preferred location is Las Vegas, which requires the approval of the Nevada Sports Commission. On Thursday, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1674635153061330946?s=46&amp;t=Ltr79qbdkM-fKmGNDceYfw">Represented on Twitter</a>The game can also be held in the Roman beasts.</p>
<p>Two people who have close relationships with Zuckerberg said that Zuckerberg's friends and consultants generally support the game. Others said that the fighting would disperse his attention to waste his time. A person who is closely related to Musk said that although Musk hates exercise and does not seem to be trained regularly, it cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>If the 52 -year -old Musk and the 39 -year -old Zuckerberg arrived in the science and technology industry, this will be a rare wonders even in the science and technology industry of bragging people. Although Steve Jobs and Bill Gates often attacked each other in the past, before that, the closest real sports confrontation with the science and technology industry was the Oracle company Larry Erisen and SAP's Hasasso Pla's. Turner et al. <a href="https://www.sailingworld.com/racing/i-never-ever-mooned-larry-ellison/">Billionaires participated in sailing competitions</a>Essence</p>
<p>However, two technology giants of the two rich nations fight in the arena in Las Vegas or Rome to fight corner, punch and kick? No one wants to dream.</p>

<p>Meta refused to comment. Musk did not respond to the comment request.</p>
<p>The relationship between Zuckerberg and Musk has been swaying between competitors, also enemies, friends, and thorough enemies for a long time. For many years, the two have been criticizing each other, including the SpaceX Rockets for Musk and Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17156402/elon-musk-deleted-tesla-and-spacex-facebook-pages-twitter-challenge">Data Privacy Scandal</a>etc. Recently, Zuckerberg has formed a team in Meta to create <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/technology/twitter-rivals-alternative-platforms.html">Products to compete with Musk's Twitter</a>, Code specified as Project 92.</p>
<p>If the two have surpassed each other's ridicule and bring the competition to the field, UFC's White said he was worried about the physical gap between the two billionaires. In addition to the age difference, it is said that Muskzacberg weighs at least 30 kilograms. In the formal comprehensive fighting competition, athletes usually group competitions according to weight.</p>
<p>"These two people have never participated in professional boxing competitions, and they are at two completely different levels of weight," White said. However, he said, "This will be the most significant game in the history of fighting sports."</p>

<p>White said Zuckerberg devoted himself to this sport.</p>
<p>"I talked to Zuckerberg for almost two years," he said. "There is never a joke, and we won't laugh." He said, Meta CEO "has always been very serious."</p>
<p>Zuckerberg's physical fitness may be suitable for fighting. Two people who are closely related to him said that he has always followed strict exercise plans, conducts running training, and challenges his friends and colleagues to break his achievements. Last month, he released <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs1pltwPx1a/?img_index=1">Personal Records of Murphy Challenge</a>The challenge needs to complete a series of traction, push -ups, running several miles, and hundreds of squats.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-03T04-28-49-00-00/000124252_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>On June 28, the National People's Congress of China passed the "Law of the People's Republic of China", which passed the macro specifications and guides China's diplomatic work, and fully implemented on July 1st, which became the focus of the attention of international media last week. The international media pays attention to the confrontation of this law, that is, China takes this law based on this law and adopts the "countermeasures" and "restrictions" operations on the sanctions and threats of Western countries; The Chinese leaders have entered several iconic foreign policy initiatives of global security, global development and global civilization, and reiterated China's position against "hegemonism and power politics".</p>
<p>The author believes that Chinese diplomacy often considers policies rather than laws, or policies are more important than law. The significant difference between policies and laws is: the law strictly emphasizes the law without compromising; the policy is flexible, but once a decision is made, it often only focuses on the law and even the program. Therefore, this "Foreign Relations Law" may prevent prevention and deterrence of the West, but in a certain period of time, Sino -foreign relations may also be more nervous. These two consequences may exist at the same time.</p>
<p><strong> Mainly attitude and symbol </strong></p>
<p>The author believes that the "Foreign Relations Law" adopted by the National People's Congress of China last week is basically policy rather than law, and even more like a constitutional document of Chinese diplomacy, especially the "Anti -Foreign Sanctions adopted by the National People's Congress of the Chinese National People's Congress in 2021 Compared with the "Foreign Relations Law" passed last week, the specifications and regulations of the specific "countermeasures" and "restrictions" of Western countries have fewer regulations and regulations, mainly a posture and symbolic position.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because China's policies are often manifested in attitude and symbolic words. This feature can be clearly seen from the legal content passed last week.</p>
<p>First, the law mainly expounds the policy principles of Chinese diplomacy, and specific legal provisions, especially the provisions of "countermeasures" and "restrictions" Western behavior, are rare, so the law looks more like a constitution of Chinese diplomacy. Essence</p>
<p>Second, this law specially includes the global development initiative, global security initiative, global civilization initiative proposed by Chinese leaders in the past three years, and promoting the all -round, multi -level, wide field, and three -dimensional external work layout. The political guidance of the ministry is particularly strong.</p>
<p>In addition, the law also specifically emphasized the "centralized unified leadership" of the Communist Party of China on Chinese diplomatic work. This also shows the strong political color of the law.</p>
<p>At the same time, on June 29, the next day, Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee, was published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Strong policy characteristics. This article pointed out that the current development of China's development has entered a period of strategic opportunities and risk challenges, uncertainty, and unpredictable factors, we must face difficulties. The legal "toolbox" of the struggle. Wang Yi's article also said: This new law provides a legal basis for China's legitimate rights to exercise anti -sanctions and anti -interference in accordance with the law. These contents of Wang Yi's article are undoubtedly a explanation of policy guidance.</p>
<p>However, there is another interpretation, that is, this new law is providing the main trunk and framework for formulating new relevant legal provisions in China in the future. Singaporean scholar Li Mingjiang believes that the substantial impact of the "Foreign Relations Law" is to guide China in the future for a period of time in the future.</p>
<p>However, this is a matter of the future, but it just proves the author's point of view, that is, the "Foreign Relations Law" is exactly the guidance of the policy. It is expected to become a constitution of China's diplomacy in the future.</p>
<p><strong> Chinese and foreign relations will be more nervous? </strong></p>
<p>Since the "Foreign Relations Law" is based on policy and symbolism as the main characteristics of the law, this kind of law that often focuses on the light program and provisions. When the current Chinese and foreign relations are highly sensitive, what will happen to Sino -foreign relations, Impact? Obviously, at least a period of time, Chinese and foreign relations will increase a lot of tension factors and atmospheres. From the perspective of Western public opinion, this is the case.</p>
<p>The US Cable Television News Network website reported on June 29 that China announced a comprehensive foreign relations law, stipulating that it has the right to take "countermeasures" measures to take a threat. This is the latest measure that Beijing has taken in the tension with Western relations.</p>
<p>The news report said: This new law emphasizes that China has the right to take corresponding countermeasures and restrictions on the acts of violations of the basic criteria of international law and international relations, and harming China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits.</p>
<p>On the same day, the website of the United States Bloomberg News reported on the same day, entitled "China's Foreign Relations Law of the Foreign Relations of Western hegemonic rights": China wrote the right to retaliation measures to overseas acts into a new foreign relationship. Law, the (China) national media said that this law provides a legal basis for counterattack sanctions and "Western hegemony".</p>
<p>It is reported that although China has already implemented retaliatory sanctions, this law will provide more legal support for such measures. The Foreign Relations Law also requires that national institutions have strengthened cross -departmental coordination and cooperation to implement retaliation measures.</p>
<p>Even the Hong Kong "South China Morning Post" website reported on June 29th. The report said: Beijing passed the new legislation that supervised China's foreign policy on the 28th. The latest efforts.</p>
<p>The author believes that tension is a necessary prerequisite for prevention and deterrence, but if you cut in with legal means, the scope of application should not be too wide. It can only be targeted at very few key issues and areas, such as Taiwan issues on China.</p>

<p>The newspaper quoted these officials as saying that Putin is committed to controlling more than 100 companies under the Wagner Group, and the Russian security department has also raided the group's auxiliary agencies.</p>
<p>The media added that the commander of the Wagner Group, Yofgen Nihigo, transferred some of his property to his staff a few weeks before the rebellion, which may make the problems facing the Kremlin more complicated.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted Western officials as saying that Perigo set up one of the most complicated and most unusable corporate architectures.</p>
<p>According to Western officials interviewed by the newspaper, many transactions reached by Wagner Group and African governments are unofficial and depend on smuggling.</p>
<p>With the continuous upgrading of the future of the Wagner Military Group and its discussions in different regions of the world, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier that the leaders of African countries should decide whether to continue to cooperate with the Wagner Military Group,</p>
<p>Russia's Klimlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said that Russian countries have nothing to do with Vagna Group's activities in African countries.</p>
<p>He also added that the Wagner Group "conducted independent activities that had nothing to do with the Russian country in Africa", although Russian President Putin revealed that the funds of Wagner Group from Wagner Group came from Russia last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Putin also made it clear that Wagner Group received 86.262 billion rubles (more than $ 1 billion) within a year, and said that Russia had "fully" funded Wagner Group.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov pointed out in another separate statement that Wagner Group "will continue to work in the Central African Republic and Mali, although the organization's leader Yavigani Porige has launched a rebellion."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T05-05-00-04-00/000000.png" />A vegetable vendor in Luoyang, Henan was fined 110,000 yuan for unqualified vegetables. Caused discussion.

The administrative organs applied for mandatory enforcement from the court, but the court ruled that it was not approved. Observer believes that although the Chinese State Council has strengthened supervision, it has failed to effectively curb the crooked winds of some local governments' fines.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-08292022080819.html">Shaanxi vegetable vendors were fined 60,000 for five pounds of celery. </a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediansaomiao/econ-06302023093102.html">Punishment has no economic accelerated small enterprise closure</a></em>*</p>
<p>The surnamed Jiang's involved vegetable vendors recently sold a group of vegetables, spinach, green peppers and other vegetables purchased from a large wholesale market in Luoyang, Henan, and exceeded the standard for pesticide residues by administrative organs. The amount of problems involved less than 200 yuan. The vegetable vendors made a profit of about 21 yuan, but the authorities were fined 110,000 yuan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T05-05-00-04-00/000002.png" />(Weibo screenshot) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gf-07032023050500.html/capture.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T05-05-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>After reviewing the Luoyang West Industry District Court, the vegetable vendor had reason to believe that the products bought from the wholesale market meet the food safety standards. The administrative organs in the case did not consider the initial illegal of the parties, and it was not subjective and intentional. The court believes that the punishment of the parties is too important and the punishment is quite principled, and the final ruling is not allowed to be enforced. The administrative organs subsequently submitted an application for submission, but were rejected by the court.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang, an objection of the incident, believes that the vegetable vendors should not be held accountable during the incident.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang: "It should be accountable from the source. His responsibility for the wholesale market, and even the regulatory loss of relevant departments. The uncle selling a sky -high price ticket for the bottom of the society is obviously selective law enforcement, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand It is the simple and rudeness of the enforcement of relevant departments. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T05-05-00-04-00/000004.png" />The dismissal person Lin Shengliang condemned the Henan authorities to selectively enforce the underlying vegetable vendors.

<p>In 2021, after selling five pounds of celery in Yulin in Shaanxi, the authorities were fined more than 60,000 yuan because of unqualified sampling inspection, which later attracted the attention of the State Council's inspection team. Lin Shengliang believes that the latest incident reflects the crooked wind of some local governments.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang: "The in -depth reason why the local government is keen to punish the people of the grassroots level is that the general anxiety of completing the fines of fines. Even if the (China) State Council has launched a large inspection across the country, it can not restrain the crooked and evil spirits of the fines, which is more likely to be more likely. It is the talk that blocks superiors. "</p>
<p>Cai Yan, an associate professor of retirement law at Wenzhou University in Zhejiang, also expressed concern about some local governments in China under fiscal difficulties.</p>
<p>Cai Yan: "If the punishment is so unfair, it must be linked to the benefits. Once the local government's finances have problems, (not excluded) will make some instructions. Sometimes these cars will be punished frequently."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T05-05-00-04-00/000006.png" />Cai Yan, a retired law, believes that the Henan authorities have punished the vegetable vendors involved in violation of the principles of Chinese administrative law. (Cai Yan is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gf-07032023050500.html/m0703gf-2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T05-05-00-04-00/000007.png" /></a>Cai Yan said that in accordance with Chinese law, the establishment and implementation of administrative penalties must be based on facts, which is equivalent to the facts and social harm of the facts of illegal acts.</p>
<p>Cai Yan: "Your illegal behavior should be equivalent to your punishment. The punishment is the principle of proportion, and the right to tailor the rights can not be used freely. The people at the end are the lowest vegetable farmers. Do you punish him more than 100,000 and ask others how to live? Do you have to leave a family and his wife?</p>
<p>Cai Yan praised the ruling of the Luoyang Court on this incident, reflected the relative independence, exerted the function of supervising the government, and was responsible for the Chinese Constitution, and guarded the dignity of Chinese justice.</p>

<h1>Is it possible for Russia to enter the "Hou Putin era" after the mutiny?</h1>

<p>Description: The short -term turbulence and uncertainty brought by the soldiers have triggered a question that people will step down and what will happen to Putin. However, although the mutiny could face Putin's unstable situation, he also allowed him to consolidate his power through strict suppression. Reuters last week, the Wagner mercenary was near the headquarters of the southern Military Region of Rostov City on the Russon River, which controlled the area last weekend.</p>

<p>Yofgen Prige was appointed a Russian catering contractor and later became a warlord. He had a tank and a private army. He showed Russia and the world what the replacement of President Putin may look like.</p>
<p>In the 23 years of Putin's administration, this is the second time. A rebel leader with populist charm showed a imaginative Russian vision after Putin -last time in 2011, Alekse Navar Ni led a uprising that supported democracy on the streets of the capital.</p>
<p>When the mercenaries of Poligon made a mercenaries to Moscow, the core dissatisfaction of providing him with motivation is the same as Navalni: Putinism is a system of no accountability. It is composed of a group of corrupt officials. And please the boss, not doing the right thing for the country.</p>
<p>Similarly. The unusual incidents that happened last weekend not only showed Putin's vulnerability in power competition, but also showed such a prospect: no matter what happened next, it may originate from the Russian President at the cost of Russia and Ukraine. Extreme and unpredictable forces. The mercenaries of Pricigen were accused of killing innocence and committing other crimes. He made it clear that even if Putin's power was not more cruel, he might be equally cruel.</p>
<p>"The war has incredible instability. This is how history has been changing," said Max Bergman, the director of the European, Russian and Eurasian projects headquartered in Washington's Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center. "This is completely unstable, it will cause the cultural rebound -you don't know how this will show. I don't think we know what direction Russia will develop in."</p>
<p>In the short -term window period of turbulence and uncertainty, the unimaginable things have briefly surpassed the assumptions, which has caused people to question how this Russian long -term leader will step down and what will happen next.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-03T05-28-38-08-00/20putin-power-02-ctvk-master1050.jpg" />In May, Yofgeni Porigen and Wagner's mercenaries were in Bachurut, Ukraine. This photo came from the video released by his company Conkid on the Telegram account. Concordgroup/Telegram, VIA Agence-Presse-Getty Images</p>
<p>The Western government, including the United States, pointed out that Putin's authoritarian leaders have scored cracks. Constantine Datuylin, a senior member of his party, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/25/world/europe/russia-war-putin-wagner-prigozhin.html?searchResultPosition=2">Acknowledged</a>The risk of Putin asked Poigo to ferment for too long, and this incident "did not increase the authority of anyone." Russia's power center -the core circle of the army, oligopoly, Putin -all analyzed to see if the possible heirs.</p>
<p>Without trusted candidates, within a few days, Putin has re -established a balanced appearance at least in Russian politics. His series of appearance aims to convey his firm control and longing for power.</p>
<p>"I wish you health!Hundred years old!" A woman shouted to Putin in Jerbonte in the south. After a few days of the soldiers, the video showed that Putin was in a group of cheers, which was in sharp contrast to his isolation state in the new crown epidemic in the past few years.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Today, Pryigo is exiled to Belarus, and his Wagner's mercenaries are also chaotic. However, he has proven that as long as he does not point his finger at Putin, a person who is willing to say that the Russian government's mistakes in Ukraine can find the listener who sympathize with him.</p>
<p>Before the hand was closed, Pryigon launched the populist anti -elite corruption movement while calling on Russia to transform, at least temporarily transformed into Chile under the leadership of North Korea or Augusto Pinoche under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, in order to strive for Ukraine won, thus won support.</p>
<p>When Russia lost on the battlefield, he used people's dissatisfaction with the system that does not account for accountability and indifferent elites. But he is also responding to the wishes of the eagle people in the Russian society, that is, it is more extreme when necessary. He once attacked Moscow's "weak old grandfather" without "guts" to use nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The information he finally conveyed was contradictory -suggesting that dramatic upgrades were needed to succeed in the war, and at the same time, the entire reason for the Klimlin claimed to be wrong was wrong. He is a strange messenger. His wealth and the privilege of guilty and negatives are brought to him by the system he criticized.</p>

<p>However, when a Russian soldier died because he died of a leader who was almost responsible, his obvious anger was recognized.</p>
<p>"Subordinates and intermediate officers and soldiers who really entered the battlefield all expressed their understanding to him to a certain extent," said Russia's retired generals Leonid Ivasus, who opposed the war. "He said that military operations were not good, lack of supply and death."</p>

<p>Although the rebellion may indicate more instability in Putin, these incidents may also provide him with an opportunity to consolidate his power through a more severe suppression, and wait strictly.</p>
<p>Porigen is basically a unique figure in Russia, and almost no one else like him like him to launch a rebellion, battlefield experience, and casual control.</p>
<p>As Putin began to ensure that the national armed forces were loyal to themselves, the Russian leader's allies have also gained greater influence, such as Victor Zolotov, the head of the National Guard, who had been his bodyguard.</p>
<p>"I definitely believe that despite the exposure of weaknesses, the regime has successfully survived the soldiers and restored its normal operation," said Andre Correzkov, a senior researcher at the research institution Kanegi International Peace Research Institute. "I don't think there is no force to engrav the experience of Parigo. Putin is scared, but this does not mean that his regime has collapsed."</p>
<p>Since the intercourse of the century, Putin has been working hard to clear the potential political threat.</p>
<p>In his early years, he aimed at the oligopoly class in the 1990s after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. He imprisoned the petroleum tycoon Mikhail Hodolkovsky and made it clear to other industrial giants that the end of the disobedience was the same as him.</p>

<p>But Putin's attitude towards the right forces is different. With the development of the war, the nationalist forces that may have threatened him in theory have gained space for activity, and sometimes criticize the army, partly because they play a role in implementing and promoting the war plan. Porigen is a typical case.</p>
<p>For a few months, he has been allowed to attack the Russian military leadership in public, and for the Russian Puluo, even if the criticism is far less than this, he will be held accountable. He can get such special treatment, partly because his troops are indispensable for the war; when he joined the battle, the Russian military was absent from major general. Essence</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Poligon's action proves that Putin's long -term allies may also change against his government, even if the Russian leader has always been careful, only allowing the most trustworthy confidant to occupy a position around him.</p>
<p>Hojolkov was released from Russia in 2013 and has been living abroad since then. Soon after the rebellion began, he publicly called on the Russians to pick up weapons to support Perigo.</p>
<p>He said that these Russian mercenaries are "not friends of democracy", but a group of "robbers", but he said that Plord can become a useful blade to remove "Kylimlin, who has tortured this country for 20 years for 20 years. Palace malignant tumors ". He said that the Russians who pursued democracy would then overthrow Puligon.</p>
<p>Russian liberals quickly opposed.</p>
<p>"Any voices that use violence to overthrow the government and come through the stage through violence will only lead to a regime completely dominated by violence," in a post by the opposition politician Schlosberg in Telegram.</p>

The picture shows Yellen attended the Congress Hearing in March.</p>
<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) The U.S. government said on Sunday (July 2) that Treasury Minister Janet Yellen will visit China from 6th to 9th. At the beginning of this year, US -China relations <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯批中國氣球侵犯美主權-耶倫仍有意訪中/a-64650009">deteriorated due to the "spy balloon" incident</a>, AntonyBlinken's trip to Beijing was postponed to mid -June; <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體美財長預計7月初訪中/a-66040462">Yellen's trip will be the second time this year's cabinet official visit</a>The two sides will discuss issues such as the "Anti -Spy Law" in China.</p>
<p>According to the US Ministry of Finance, Yellen will reiterate the importance of "responsible management and control between the two parties, communicate directly on the field of attention, and jointly cope with global challenges." It also explains how the United States views the relationship with China in economics. Officials of the Ministry of Finance said Yellen would meet with Chinese officials and American companies.</p>
<p>In January of this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/耶伦刘鹤会晤后同意加强两国间的沟通与交流/a-64440627">Yellen met with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the time in Switzerland</a>; Reuters quoted insiders saying that Yellen was expected to meet with the new Vice Premier He Lifeng.</p>

Both parties emphasized that "differentiated and controlling" and strengthening cooperation in climate change.</p>
<p>"What we seek is a healthy relationship with China to promote the growth and innovation of the two countries." An unnamed US Treasury official said on the 2nd: "We do not seek the economic decoustration of the two countries. If we completely stop trade and Investment will destroy the economic stability of our two countries and even the world. "</p>
<p>Officials say Yellen will tell Beijing that on the one hand, the United States will continue to take action against China to defend human rights and safeguard their national security interests;(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/耶倫促中國解決非洲債務-中使館無端施壓/a-64505770)Wait for the issue to cooperate with China.</p>
<p>Yellen's expected issues include China's human rights doubts in Xinjiang, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美財長g7將聯手反制中國經濟脅迫/a-65597554">"Economic Stress" internationally</a>And Beijing recently blocked Micron products, investigated a number of American companies, and launched a series of measures such as the Anti -Spy Law to expand the scope of spy behavior. In addition, she will discuss with China that the United States is about to sacrifice the investment restrictions on China.</p>
<p>Washington expects that Yellen will not bring a "major breakthrough", but hopes to establish long -term communication channels with China's new economic policy team to avoid misjudgment risks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T06-55-00Z/65599096_401.png" />In May, the Treasury Secretary and the central bank leader meeting were held in May of the Seven major industrial groups (G7) to discuss how to co -counter China's "economic coercion".</p>
<h3>What economic relationship should Meizhong maintain?</h3>
<p>Earlier, Brinken told the United States media after meeting the Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing that the United States and China "agreed with the stable relationship", but the two sides still had significant differences. Soon after, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登獨裁者言論不影響中美關係/a-66009564">US President Byndon called Xi Jinping as a "dictator"</a>, Treating China dissatisfaction; <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯支持独裁者表述总统替大家说话/a-66035635">Brinken response</a>: "We will continue to do what you don't like, saying what you don't like, just like you will undoubtedly do what we don't like, say what we don't like."</p>
<p>On June 30, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning expressed dissatisfaction with this: "The United States has aware of the mistakes against China for mistakes, pursuing mistakes in China, and blocking China , Use actual actions to fulfill the commitment made by the United States. "</p>
<p>When Blingken participated in the US Think Tank Foreign Relations Association (CFR) on the 28th, it stated that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/談印太局勢-布林肯遏制中國不符美國利益/a-66063058">curbing China and "decoupling with China" does not meet the interests of the United States</a>And the United States hopes to "see China success in the economic field." Yellen also talked about similar propositions in Johns Hopkins University in April: "China's economic growth, and the role of the United States in economics, may not be incompatible."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T06-55-00Z/65957359_401.png" />On June 19, U.S. Secretary of State Brillin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. U.S. President Biden affirmed the results of the trip. However, some experts pointed out that the United States and China had not recovered the dialogue in the military and the relationship between the two sides was still very fragile.</p>
<p>EdwardAlden, a scholar of the Foreign Relations Association, pointed out to AFP that Yellen's trip to Beijing is expected to restart the lower levels of stable interaction between the United States and China. Olndon added that the United States had blurred its "decoustal" position in the past, but has recently changed its attitude and has clearly adopted the strategy of "de -risk"; this means that the United States will "" " "Establish a guardrail", but in other respects, "try to continue cultivating a stable US -China economic relations."</p>
<p>Wendycutler, deputy director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Chinese officials are observing what specific measures the United States has taken to show that "decircation and China's ultimate goal of the United States." In Olden's view, Beijing also recognizes the importance of the US market, so he realized that he is also responsible for the relationship between the two parties, "because this is also too important for China."EvanMedeiros, a Chinese expert at Georgetown University, believes that Yellen's visit was only "the next step in the uncertain process." Mai Aiwen told the Financial Times, "Under the situation of the essence of competition, and the world view of both sides is in wrestling," this trip seems difficult to greatly change the situation.</p>

<p>The first British newspaper appeared in the 1939 British newspapers.</p>
<p>In the book "Never Again" by historian Martin Gilbert, Ing accidentally discovered this photo of his childhood.</p>
<p>English said, "That's really a big surprise."</p>
<p>"He only wrote" 3 little girls "in the book. So I wrote a letter to him and told him that we were still alive. At that time, people said that I looked like a child star Xiulan Deng Poor. Why am I in the photo? What about laughing? "</p>
<p>"Look at the sister Luz in the photo, her expression is very tight. But I don't know who the third girl with the doll is. I never know who she is!"</p>
<p>In fact, the girl holding the doll was 10 -year -old Hannacohn. She and her twin brothers Hans (later renamed Gerald) from Halle in Germany and other girls withdraw from other girls. train. You can also see the legs of the little Hans on the original film.</p>
<p>However, just like Ing and Ruth, Hannah has no memory of the photos, but she remembers the journey and doll holding in her hands. However, she died in 2018 and talked about her experience in an interview with the University of London during her lifetime. Hannah said: "I remember that after the Netherlands, there were kind ladies on the car gave us biscuits and lemon soda."</p>
<p>"We arrived at Liverpool Station from Harwei's train. I was a person who followed the rules. At that time, my seats were all cushions, not wooden seats. I was worried that I might sit in the first class."</p>

<p>"Liverpool Street Station sounds like Liverpool, another British city. I was still worried that it was not going to London. However, we finally arrived at this station with a huge hall. I grabbed a doll named Iflin."</p>
<p>Hannah's twin daughters Debbie and Helen told BBC that their mother was always curious about the identity of the other two girls in the photo. Debbie said: "When we saw this photo, she sat there, braids, and hugged the doll. Mother always said during her lifetime: I want to know who the other two girls are?"</p>
<p>Then, in January this year, more than 80 years after the photo was taken, her daughters discovered the truth after hearing a BBC broadcast show series by accident.</p>

<p>"We were so excited. I sent a text message to Debie, and I said," We found these two girls!"</p>
<p>Later, in April this year, Ing finally met with Hannah's daughters at the London Empire Museum. This photo has been displayed in the museum for more than 20 years. Now, people can now understand the things behind two families and photos.</p>

<p>We cannot be sure, but it may be a Scottish named John Festevenson, who is famous for his song "Dear Glasgow's Old Town" with his people. In the 1930s, Topical Pressagence recorded a contact information for his address in Glasgow.</p>
<p>With the help of the Scottish Public Archives Office, the BBC found his family through the address on birth and death.</p>

<p>Although this photo has become so important, we still don't know. However, the identity mystery of the three girls and photographers was finally solved. And the story of their brave survivors, as witnesses of the Nazi Massacre, and brave survivors, will always spread to the world.</p>

<p>Because my hometown Dongshi Ancient Village recorded the seven -year crime of the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP has been trying to try to destroy the evidence of crime. Even if all the concretes that have been demolished for the private prison specially established for our family were pulled away a few kilometers away, it was still uneasy. So I came up with a reservoir in Shuangyao Town, moved the residents there, drowned the sin there to the bottom of the water, and destroyed the historical testimony forever. For this reason, the Menghe Repair Reservoir, which is in a disconnected state in the state of breaking in the state of breaking throughout the year, is extremely absurd and difficult to say.</p>
<p>After several years of preparation, the project of Shuangye Town Reservoir is now in the stage of forceing the people to accept the relocation of local compensation standards. According to the CCP's public compensation standards, at least 300,000 yuan per mu in Shandong land. And in accordance with China's land contracting law: the contract for cultivated land is at least 30 years; the grassland is at least 50 years; the forest land is at least 70 years. There can be only a large number of contracts in the above three contractual contracts, and not less. In other words, the contract for the contract can be 40 years or more, but it should not be less than 30 years of grass and forest land ... grassland and forest land are the same. In addition, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the contractor, it also specifically indicates that the local authorities are not allowed to use the so -called "most villagers' signature (according to the handprint) consent" to terminate the contract and take the land from the farmers.</p>
<p>However, it is sad that in the falling area of the Communist Party of China, the laws that protect the interests of the people are often like a waste paper. Now in Dongshi Gu, local officials are forcing the people to sign and agree to only compensate more than 9,000 yuan per acre of land. The forest land is only symbolic compensation a little bit of the losses of attachment (unparalleled trees), refusing to compensate the land fee ... The reason given is "the land is the country, and now the state will use it ...". The homestead of all farmers to be relocated, regardless of the size of each house only compensates for 15,000 yuan. Isn't this blatantly robbed the people's wealth?</p>
<p>All villagers who refuse to sign will be retaliated with various threats and strikes of CCP officials. Among them, the ancient villagers of the East Division Dudu were 55 years old this year. Three years ago, his wife died of violent illness. Now, the old mother who is almost blind in her 90 -year -old eyes needs to be supported, and there are children who have not yet become a family. The family only depends on Du Dudu to see the door in a local elementary school. He can get a meager income of more than 1,000 yuan per month to maintain his livelihood. Because the demolition compensation was too unreasonable, he refused to sign. Local officials and the evil officials of the education department came to force him to sign on the compensation contract, and threatened that he would not let him continue to see the door in elementary school without signing. Under the pressure, Dudu had to be forced to sign "agree" to demolish ...</p>
<p>Facing the CCP's forced and persecution and overlord clauses, the people of dozens of local villages complained, miserable but helpless. After all, where can I find a place where robbers and robbers who have controlled power? Intersection</p>
<p>After the CCP ’s evil, in order to cover up the evidence of sin, not only did it have to flood the ancient divisions, but also snatched the father and fellows who had lived there for thousands of years of houses and fields that had been farmed and cultivated, and once again proved that the Communist Party of China was a group of robbers and robbers. As long as the Communist Party, the black power group exists for a day, the people on that land must not be peaceful.</p>
<p>Therefore, only by ending the communist tyranny and the establishment of a republican constitutional rule of law and the rule of law democratic mechanism, can the people's free human rights be guaranteed. In the falling area of the Communist Party of China, only without the Communist Party can the people of Li Min have true freedom and happiness.</p>

<p>After Putin launched the war against Ukraine, Chinese social media in China was full of various false news. Without exception, Russia won the victory, Ukrainian soldiers defeated like mountains, and the United States and the West. Some are officially systematically fabricated and spread, and some are made of small pink spontaneous folk.</p>
<p>Recently, a broadcaster named Paul Kocharine became popular on Douyin. He claimed to be a Russian Chechen, his face was full of beard, and he looked sturdy. He specifically filmed the experience and feelings of the US military and his comrades -in -arms. He was welcomed by Chinese netizens. In just two months, the fans increased by 300,000. Selling Russia's production, successfully sold hundreds of goods, and earned pockets.</p>
<p>Later, a sharp -eyed person found that the films of Paul Koccan's encircling of the US military were online ready -made resources, and many of them were not pictures and videos during the Ukrainian war. But he voiced and explained, saying that he really fought on the front line. However, the words "filming scene, film and television plot" are also written in the film, as if many movie explanations at the beginning of the movie: "The plot of this drama is purely fictional. Please do not get a seat." Er Kocci courage to fight the U.S. military and repeatedly made great achievements, and also called him "Russian King" and "Russian God of War"!</p>
<p>Soon after, Paul Kochatie was exposed to the true body as a Chinese, and he has always faked foreigners with AR technology. This farce ended.</p>
<p>The name "Paul Koccar" obviously comes from the name of the protagonist of "Paul Cocajin" -The Soviet red classic novel "How to Made Steel". The clip of Ostrovsky's "How to Made Steel" was selected into the Chinese middle school Chinese textbooks. It is a youthful memory of the Communist Chinese generations of the minds. This Chinese Internet celebrity, which uses Paul Koccar's name, is about the young people after 1990, but their generation is still Soviet -Russian iron powder, and it is still the brain disability of the CCP ’s pro -brainwashing education of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>The earliest introduction of the Soviet -Russian revolution model was Professor of Peking University and Li Dazhao, the curator of Peking University Library. Li Dazhao was arrested by Zhang Zuolin from the Beijing Soviet Embassy for subverting the activity of the Republic of China government for subverting the activities of the Republic of China government. The CCP shaped it into a revolutionary martyr. In fact, he was a traitor who was dead.</p>
<p>It is Mao Zedong who truly relied on the support of the Soviet Union and Russia to capture the world and consolidate the regime. French scholar Bi Yanggao specifically emphasized the impact of the impact of Mao in the book of "History: Comparison of the China -Russia Revolution" on the book of the "Confucius of the Communist Party (Bu) Party History" on Mao. This book was written by Stalin himself, and the dialectical materialism and historical materialist parts were scrutinized by Stalin. Stalin proposed the five stages of evolution of human history, and was born in Marxism, and there was its original part. Wolkonov, a Soviet -Russian objection historian, pointed out in "Stalin Biography": "The infamous" The Concise Course of the Party History of the Communist Party (Bu) "has become a real dogmatic encyclopedia. Mummy Encyclopedia. It has published more than 300 versions of about 43 million volumes ... ... In the last three chapters, more than 70 pages, but there are more than sixty comments, citations, and conclusions. According to content, the spiritual grain of anti -history has caused the lack of spiritual poverty, the simplification and originalization of theory. Stalin prepares fertile soil in order to cultivate a huge simple -minded class. , Tolders, diligent clerical clerks, and executors who do not have brains will supplement the bureaucratic institutions, punishment agencies and cadres at all levels. "</p>
<p>As early as Yan'an in the 1940s, Mao Zedong believed that this book was the "Sunflower Treasure" of the Chinese Revolution. Not only did he read at least ten times, he also had to study carefully. Mao Zeng said that Marx has no experience in revolutionary practice. The Paris Commune has only 40 days, but Lenin and Stalin have experience in participating and leading Russia for more than 100 years. experience of. Therefore, not only should we learn this classic of Stalin, but also to study hard and carefully.</p>
<p><strong> How did steel and steel unparalleled? </strong></p>
<p>However, this boring book is difficult to attract the interest of young people. As a result, the emotional and sensational "How to make steel" has become a popular version of its literary. Ostrovsky tells the story of how he was refined into an "steel" without thought. But in real life, Ostrovsky's short life has proven the cruel fact that "how steel is not made".</p>
<p>On November 26, 2006, the Moscow Communist Youth League member published an article entitled "Reboning Life" by a reporter Switlana Samorevolova. The reporter interviewed Ostlovsky's niece Garinna Ostrovscia. Garlina's mother Yekaterina was the sister of Ostrovsky and the last stage of her life. The "nursing nanny" is very familiar with its situation. According to Galinna: Ostrovsky was born in the Ukrainian military family. His father participated in the Balkans and performed heroically in the battle. He was awarded two cross medals. The mother was born in the family of the Czech Forestry Bureau. She is an extraordinary woman who speaks six languages and wrote poems. Ostrovsky participated in the Red Army at the age of fifteen to help the Red Army suppress the Ukrainian independence movement. At the age of sixteen, he was seriously injured. At the age of 27, he was completely paralyzed. At the age of 32, he died. With the advent of the book "How Steel is made", he quickly became famous, and his name spread throughout the vast Soviet land. He was awarded various high honors. But in fact, he complained to his friends more than once: "What we built is completely different from the struggle for us ..." "Nicholas' personality is too straightforward, if his best friend Saldatov said," Nicholas. He died of illness in 1936, and sooner or later, someone would 'help' end his life. "In today's China, no one believes that Paul Kochakin's story is true, and no one believes that the story of Lei Feng's Chinese version of Lei Feng is true -people question: In Lei Feng's short -lived life, shooting There are six or seven hundred photos. A common PLA warrior is rare to take so many photos at that time. It can be said that since 1949, the characters that have influenced the Chinese public through images are Mao Zedong and the other may be Lei Feng. At that time, there were two main photographers who took pictures of Lei Feng. One was Zhang Jun and the other was called Ji Zeng. According to the memories of the two, there were few on -site captures. Most of them were them. Create according to the political needs and the superior instructions at that time. In these photos, some of them were "made up" by the photographer based on the deeds of Lei Feng, which passed through that year, and processed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Paul Kockekin of the Soviet Union and Russia had an idealistic enthusiasm for the revolution, and today's Chinese Internet celebrities, whether it is called Paul Kocharine or Wang Kangmei, is like Russia or the revolution. Water injection pork finally points to the goal of "bringing goods". This is extremely utilitarian nationalist. He knows that the two topics of Russia and the United States have a huge market in China. His personal performance and image shaping can bring huge economic benefits. As for the truth and normal logic of history -since modern times, Russia has been the country with the most wealth in Chinese territory and plundering Chinese wealth. The real Chinese nationalist should point to Russia first. Thinking, let alone such thinking departs from China's main theme.</p>
<p>Steel is not made, and it is not a failure. As long as there are endless and inexhaustible leeks and human mines, the party's rule can be stable as a rock. Small fish and shrimp like Paul Kocha can also be a little bit cold in this human flesh feast.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T09-07-00-04-00/000000.png" />On June 24, 2023, after Wagner's mercenaries, the Moscow Guards mobilized to enter the battle base. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-07032023090658.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-03T09-07-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Reuters picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-07032023090658.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-070320230658.html/@stream</a>At the end of June, the Wagner soldiers changed in Russia, dramatic starting, dramatic ending, but shocked the world. As a authoritarian country, such a fierce internal rebellion occurred in Russia; as a political strong man who ruled Russia for 23 years, Putin encountered such an open challenge and could only end with humiliation. These are enough to cause psychological shocks to Beijing, Zhongnanhai and Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>First of all, this happened under the war that launched Ukraine in Putin. From this, if Xi Jinping launched a war to invade Taiwan, the internal army may not be fully listened. The pressure of war, psychological fear, and generals are generally corruption. The Communist Army soldiers are mainly composed of single children and lower -level civilian families. Compared with the Russian troops, the war is more likely to bring internal panic and chaos to the Communist Army. Once the war is unfavorable, it is likely to change or mutiny.</p>
<p>Secondly, Pricigo is an old friend of Putin. He has more than thirty years. Pricigo personally led his soldiers to the front line, hard fighting, and fierce fighting, which is tantamount to life for Putin. But seeing that there is no chance of winning, and realizing that the war is based on improper reasons, it is reversed. As a result, although the twenty fierce struggle for power seizing power, Xi Jiajun was unique and Xi Jinping was alone. But the anti -Xi and those who are capable of anti -learning must eventually be inside the Xi family. This is the law of law, the laws of human nature and the laws of history. Xi Jinping's defense is invincible, and the hidden dangers cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>Again, Porigerjin is not the same. As soon as he reverses, he directly attacks the capital Moscow, indicating that he understands the principle of seeking snakes and seven inches, capturing the thief to capture the king first. If you change to China, once a similar rebellion occurs, the danger directly comes directly is Zhongnanhai and Xi Jinping himself. The so -called: force and reaction force. Move the stone to smash your feet. Playing firemen will burn self.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wagner Group entered Moscow, thousands of miles a day, as if there was no one. Almost unstoppable along the way, quickly advance to only 200 kilometers from Moscow, and the capital portal opens. The Russian army, military police, and agents seemed to disappear, but they were unaware to block the guns for Putin. As Xi Jinping lamented the collapse of the former Soviet Union: "No one is a man!" Putin could only mobilize six fighter planes for low -altitude bombing, but was shot down by the Wagner Corps.</p>
<p>As for the people, not only did there be no one in Putin, on the contrary, "the pots of pots of pots to welcomes the king", the public welcomes the Wagner Group. People's heart is like this!It can be seen that in Russia, the world is bitter in Putin!If Prodigin did not accept the mediation or flicker of the Belarusian President Lukashenko, it was possible that it would be a drum and Moscow. At that time, Moscow's shape was not only fixed in defense, but also in the heart and public opinion. After the mediation of Lukashenko, Putin quickly agreed to reconcile and immediately agreed to forgive Pleigo and Wagner's officers and soldiers to prove that he was in his heart: How empty is Moscow!What's more terrible is that for him, how empty can he support his military and people's hearts!</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who are not conducive to rulers are more than Russia. Just look at how much sensitive words and banned words have been set up by the Xi authorities (——Namers said: Even Chinese is almost abolished by Xi), and the large -scale public opinion rollover scene that happened in Da Nengxun was probably a little. The power of the CCP leaders is completely compared with public opinion and people's hearts. The greater the power, the more you lose public opinion and depleting. The reason is simple, one -party dictatorship has against the trend and human heart. Today, one -party dictatorship has added a unique and one -person dictatorship. The person in charge did not realize it?</p>
<p>For a long time, the discussion of Chinese and foreign public opinion: The day of Xi Jinping's launch of the Taiwan Strait War is the day when the Communist Party and the Xi Dynasty were destroyed. This statement is roughly vain. Not to mention that, when it comes to war, the Communist Army is by no means an opponent of the U.S. military. As soon as the battle was opened, the world was in chaos. The anti -learning forces inside and outside the party must be unprecedented, and the anti -communist and anti -learning waves of the Chinese people will be unprecedentedly high. After that, at that time, Xi Jinping and Xi Jiajun, which one of them can block the mighty tide of the people's hearts? The praying arm blocks the car. It is said that the Russian mutiny was frightened by Xi Jinping.</p>

This ghost floated to the world with the help of the Soviet regime. Nearly half of the world's population is involved in an experiment to establish an equal, free, and happy paradise on earth by the ghost. All the experimental fields have established a party rights system that stifled human rights and deprives human rights. It turns out that all the experimental fields are full of lies, scarce, hunger, persecution, imprisonment, abuse, killing, and all -round spiritual control of people. The disaster caused by this experiment to all humans is difficult. 31 years ago, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and this cruel experiment ended in failure. There are several ghosts that are gornerating. The largest fortress is the Communist Party of China. This new evil axis is being a strange transformation method to harm the people and the world.</p>
<p>102 years ago, the Communist Party of China was established under the direct leadership of the Communist International to destroy the National Revolution as the same passers -by of the National Revolution. As the Republic of China was invaded by the Japanese invaders, the CCP launched armed riots, split China, and established the so -called "Soviet Republic". Collect the opportunity to grow with the invaders. After the war, the state government was exhausted. On the one hand, the Communist Party of China deceived the world and the United States, and said that it would establish an American -style democratic system. On the other hand, it provoked the civil war with a resentment. The CCP establishes the so -called People's Republic of China in the falling area of the Republic of China. In fact, it is a party rights and autocracy that is more disgusting than the imperial dictatorship, and interrupts China's normal path to modern civilization. The name of its country is not true, one is not China. When they died, they went to see the foreigner Marble instead of seeing the ancestors; second, not the people. In the name of the people, there are signboards such as the Great Hall of the People, the People's Court, the People's Government, etc., but in fact, people's rights are completely deprived. In general, "party leadership is everything"; Openly upheld one -party dictatorship and negate the republic of democracy. The Royal Democratic Party is a vase. From land reform, town anti -, public -private partnerships, anti -rights, Great leap forwards, cultural revolution, etc. until June 4th. Taga, tragedy, tragedy, China. Destroying Huaxia culture, chaotic moral people, killing national elites, burning cultural relics and historic sites, breaking cultural foundations, dirty mountains and rivers, iron evidence is like mountains, irreversible.</p>
<p>In 102 years, the CCP became the Xi family, and the Communist Party of China has come to an end. Where does China go?</p>
<p>Wang Bingzhang, who was imprisoned, predicted that China would have such a day: the Communist Party's collapse, "non -Communist" fever will push all the statues of the CCP veterans such as Mao Zedong, and the government will return to the New China created by Sun Yat -sen -the Democratic Republican of the Republic of China system. In 2000, Wang Bingzhang wrote the article "Reconstruction of the Republic of China". Announced: "Rebuilding the Republic of China and re -standing in the east of the world's first democratic Republic is the responsibility of all Chinese children." He hoped that in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas Chinese, he re -lifted Sun Yat -sen's banner, Rebuilding the Republic of China, which once belonged to and in the future, must also belong to all Chinese children. This day is not far away!</p>

The poster wrote that the design institute was established in 1992. The design qualification is level A.

<p>Fang Yaping, a person in the industry in Shanghai, said in an interview with this station on Monday that many local large companies in the local area have already been suspended. Some have stopped work last year. The reason is that there is only one reason, that is, Shanghai stopped building large projects: "Some design institutions in Shanghai now There are no business. There are many large design institutions in Shanghai. This is different from the architectural design company. The design institute specializes in the large project, such as the National Theater, not a design building. Of course The design business of the building is also connected. Now the Shanghai economy is messy, and even the residential building can't be rented anymore. "</p>
<p>People in the industry said that in the golden age of the construction industry, due to the many projects, the design institute is in an absolute advantage. The design cost of the project was very considerable at the level of salary at that time, so there will be a saying that the design institute employees buy a car for three years and buy a house for five years. However, as the real estate market shrinks rapidly, Shanghai will no longer build large projects. Some analysts said that within 5 to 10 years, enterprises related to construction will be closed.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou, a resident of Shanghai, told this station that many college graduates in Shanghai were unemployed: "Many people now can't find other jobs and go to express delivery. Civil servants now feel unsafe, too busy, and low salary (salary reduction and cancellation of cancellation (cancellation of cancellation and cancellation Bonus).

<p>Today, <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230628/russian-general-prigozhin-rebellion/">Wagner's mercenary organization</a>After a rebellion in Russia, after shaking Putin's indestructible image, people had doubts about this confidence. Those who closely observe China say that although the mutiny has only lasted for a short time, it may lead to the close relationship between Xi Jinping and Russia. This relationship has caused the Chinese government to be criticized around the world and threatened some of China overseas overseas. Benefit.</p>
<p>China regards Russia as a necessary partner to challenge the United States. But Putin's adventure desire -from invasion of Ukraine to dependence on private mercenaries can be seen -forcing Beijing to undergo Western pressure to defend Sino -Russian relations.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping's long -term betting will only be effective only in Putin to maintain the common interests of the two countries. But the rebellion had caused people to question Putin's authority: the Wagner soldiers almost encountered resistance from the Russian regular army when they advanced to Moscow. Putin asked Belarus to provide asylum decisions for the leader of the leader of the mutiny leader, Yafgeni Pleigo, which was not like a strong man with a strong power.</p>
<p>"China recognizes that the Putin government is actually relatively vulnerable internally. This vulnerability has existed before. After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, this fragility was increased," the researcher of the Russian Eastern European Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Xiao Bin said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-03T09-55-28-08-00/01China-Russia-02-gbzv-master1050.jpg" />The members of the Wagner hired mercenary organization, after a brief rebellion, was preparing to evacuate a military headquarters located on the Rostov on the Russon River. It was taken on June 24. Romanromokhov/agent frame-presse-getty images</p>
<p>After the rebellion, China publicly reiterated its support for the Kremlin. Analysts said that because the interests of leaders of the two countries, the relationship between the two countries may remain firm, at least from the outside.</p>
<p>However, this mutiny may have also forced Beijing to consider how it would be affected by Putin's geopolitical, economic and territorial interests if it was suddenly overturned. This may lead to a certain degree of distance between China and Russia.</p>

<p>In the 23 years of Putin's governance, Russia -China relations have improved significantly compared with the Soviet era and the President Yeltsin. The border between Russia and China is more than 4,000 kilometers, and the two countries have sent dozens of divisions to wait on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>Any change in Russia now will immediately re -evaluate the relationship between the two countries. Xiao Bin said that China will worry about Russia's new leaders to adjust the country and adopt a more friendly attitude towards the United States. This may cause China to be isolated in the competition with the United States and face greater pressure.</p>
<p>In more extreme cases, the deterioration of the relationship between Beijing and Moscow may force China to re -deploy troops in the border area border with Russia, which will harm China's interests in other regions. Fu said.</p>
<p>"Reducing the number of troops on the Sino -Russian border, which enables China to prepare for the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, or greater conflict with India," Calver said. "I think what has happened in Russia is not enough to let China think about military deployment issues, but this makes them think for the first time to think about whether to do this."</p>

<p>At the same time, the weaker Putin may give China the opportunity to gain some benefits, Song Wendi, a politicalist at the National University of Australia.</p>
<p>Beijing may consider speeding up efforts and let Russia make more concessions. China's primary goal may be to obtain more Russian technology and strive for more preferential conditions for the proposed Siberian power No. 2, which will help the Russian natural gas supply that was previously flowing to Europe to China.</p>

<p>Putin's approach has always been more aggressive, and he launched the largest war since the World War II in Europe. There is no doubt that Xi Jinping has also adopted a tougher position in territorial claims in recent years, especially on the Taiwan issue (Beijing claims that this autonomous democratic island is its territory). Tension. But so far, Xi Jinping has been cautious to avoid turning confrontation into a war that may involve the United States and its allies.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping has also been committed to consolidating domestic power. Since 2015, the Chinese leader has begun to make significant adjustments to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

<p>Russia and China trade reached a record high after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia. The Chinese government also ensures that Moscow is not completely isolated in diplomacy.</p>

<p>China has paid a considerable price for Russia. The Russian and Ukraine War exacerbated the tension between China and the United States, and harmed China's efforts to improve relations with Europe. Ukraine's counterattack has also made the world pay more attention to China's aggression on Taiwan.</p>
<p>China has carefully responded to these unfavorable conditions in China. Chinese official media described it the importance of its "Wagner incident" and praised Putin to resolve the crisis. The CCP's "Global Times" accused Western media of "speculation" on the rebellion, distorting the relationship between China and Russia, but it does not seem to have reported that Perigo said that the government deceives the Russian public and convinces them that the North Atlantic Convention is in response to Russia.

<p>Song Yongyi said: "The dictatorship of the Mao period, the masses of the sports, and brainwashing the masses. This is ready -made, so it is used to imitate, governing the country without a new situation, and the second exposure to the strong desire to pursue totalitarian power in politics. Historically, personal worship is mainly prepared for permanent governance to make selfish interests. Recently, it is reported that Xi must be at least 80 years old, and see if you can live at that time.</p>
<p>** Cultural Revolution Expert: Mao is soaked in the water and flows in the water.</p>
<p>Song Yongyi mentioned that when watching the film at the time, Mao was "drifting". Mao Mao's memoir also said that Mao floated a big belly.</p>
<p>Song Yongyi: "In fact, he was soaked in the water, because he was more fat, so he had buoyancy. The so -called Changjiang Yangtze River was written. There were more than a dozen swimming players around the Yangtze River drifting in the Yangtze River. What he said, drifting with the water. Mao traveled to the Yangtze River in Wuhan has its political significance. It is the most important demonstration to Beijing Liu Shaoqi, indicating that my body is still good. He has launched the Cultural Revolution and returned to Beijing to rectify Liu Shaoqi quickly. "</p>
<p>Gong and Jian, a Chinese disagreement who stayed in Taiwan, also said: "Create God, make God during the Cultural Revolution, and create a god with Xi Jinping now, saying that he walked 200 pounds to walk the mountain road, 15 kilometers without changing his shoulders. For those who want to rule his rule for a long time, we must fool the people, engage in personal worship, and make God. "</p>
<p>Gong and Jian mentioned that China deliberately filmed the news documentary and watched Mao Zedong's large belly in the Yangtze River. Now it is said that the catfish belly floating surface, even if it was shot, at least once in the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Song Yongyi also said that in July, the hottest, Wuhan was like a stove: "The materials exposed now, Mao Mao has his old lover at the East Lake Hotel in Wuhan, so he is unwilling to leave. In 1967, he went to Wuhan again. , Mao Cangsong flee, and ran to Shanghai for the first time in his life. The so -called great leader went to the Yangtze River to swim and showed the courage to go to the end of the cultural revolution to the end.</p>
<p><strong> Cerebrates have said that they have combined to liberate Taiwan's armed forces 泅 exercise </strong></p>
<p>Gong Yujian mentioned that his father experienced the Cultural Revolution and organized the rivers of the river every year. Mao also issued a maximum instruction, what is going on in the wind and waves, and the sea is actually not terrible and can be conquered.</p>
<p>Gong Toujian said: "My father said that it was a militia, and the whole people were soldiers. He had to carry a rifle with 120 rounds, grenades, and other light equipment. It is not surprising to drown one or two people every year. "</p>
<p>Gong and Jian said that during the Cultural Revolution, the teacher was beaten into a black five category and a stink nine, so the school teacher hated Mao. I remember that in 1992 and 1993, he promoted to high school. In the 100 years of Mao, he scratched the restoration of the Cultural Revolution. Red songs, many people wear Mao Xingzhang on their bodies. Fortunately, Deng Xiaoping returned during the South Tour of the Cultural Revolution through the restoration of the Cultural Revolution, but in the practice of Xi, China did not have the second Deng Xiaoping, which was sinking to the abyss of the Cultural Revolution.</p>

Modified into Chinese.</p>
<p>"On the stage of the Golden Melody Awards, the heart of music love also eliminates the language boundary between different ethnic groups. Here, no matter what language is used, Taiwanese, guest language, indigenous ethnic language, Chinese, English, Japanese, Japanese, Japanese You can sing freely and let us condense together. " President Tsai Ing -wen in Taiwan said on Facebook that the Golden Melody Awards are a variety of and rich voice.</p>
<p><strong> Golden Melody Awards reflect multiple freedom value against totalitarian autocracy </strong></p>
<p>Eliminate a race to destroy its language first, and the Chinese government has suppressed the language of Tibet, Xinjiang Uighurs, and Hong Kong for many years; and in Taiwan, in free and democratic Taiwan, encourage mother tongue creation and retain cultural roots.</p>
<p>"Simply put, it is a democratic and open society, and a society with autocratic power." Li Xiaofeng, a retired and honorary professor at the National Taiwan Institute of Culture, National Taipei Education University, said that Taiwan and China were open to China. It is a single closed value, and all values are determined from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Not just a question of language, he said that under the system of one -party dictatorship, all resources are controlled in the hands of the ruling party. For example, in the early days of Taiwan Chiang Kai -shek's administration, it was also the party, government, military and police special, emotional governance units, media, and education. Now the election of the government is open, no matter how to criticize the government, it will not be arrested. This is the difference between the two sides of the strait.</p>
<p>"Today, the Communist Party of China is a social society, including only one view of history." Li Xiaofeng said, "There are 56 ethnic groups within China, each with its own language, or different languages in the same nation. Respect local language. "</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong, an associate professor of the General Education Center of Taipei Ocean University of Science and Technology, told this station that seeing Taiwan's unique multiculturalism and various music styles through the Golden Melody Awards ceremony. Under the democratic environment of Taiwan, music creators are not constrained by the system, which can stimulate various music appearance. This is the affirmation of the Golden Melody Awards.</p>
<p>"In various kinds of music fields, Taiwan has strong musical strength. This is more difficult for them to be free to create music in the context education of patriotic education in mainland China. The doubts of humiliation. "Wu Jianzhong said.</p>
<p><strong> Golden song Taiwanese songs have been given heated discussions in Chinese speeches after Chinese songs </strong></p>
<p>However, another episode also occurred in the Golden Melody Awards. Zheng Yinong, who won the best Taiwanese female singer award and the best Taiwanese album award, was not good at speaking in Chinese.However, this social media in Taiwan has triggered warm arguments. Zheng Shuncong, who once published a Taiwanese teaching book, wrote on his face, "We have not wanted to change anything ..., singing Taiwanese awards, there is no saying in Taiwanese, this is a fake Taiwanese song." Taiwan media "New Head Shell" Guan Renjian, a column commentator, also called Zheng Yinong under the "Chinese Taipei Song Song".</p>
<p>Nie Yongzhen, who has won the Golden Melody Awards Best Album Packaging Award, wrote on Facebook, "We grow in a country that is free to express and does not need to be reviewed. The most unnecessary thing is that when the creator stands on the stage, the language Channel switching is put on a review of overly political correct framework. "</p>
<p>During the interview, Li Xiaofeng proposed a warning message. In the process of the Kuomintang's rule for 3 or 40 years, Taiwan almost did not speak mother tongue. In society, it is not too late to encourage speaking mother tongue.</p>

However, until the project was completed on May 5, the salary was still not settled, and it was still owed to more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Migrant workers' salary representative Ye Xiangming went online <a href="https://weibo.com/3068651823/N3ri1BAxD">Post for help</a>Said, they "find Shougang Construction Group for working money, Shougang lets the labor service company ask for, the person in charge of the labor service company calls not to answer, send text messages, and go to the labor supervision team of Huaxiang Fengtai District to complain. There can be results in a month. " I called Zhang Rui, the person in charge of the project department left by the worker's salary post to express the attention of the media, and said with a sneer and said: Ha, then you pay attention!</p>
<p>Shougang Erzhong Industrial Park Creative Building Project, December 2018 was the Beijing Development and Reform Commission <a href="http://fgw.beijing.gov.cn/fzggzl/yfxz/xzxk_sgs/201912/t20191226_1504840.htm">approval of projects</a>, Construction Unit is Shougang Construction Investment Co., Ltd., <a href="http://m.gxfin.com/article/finance/default/default/2023-01-29/5933683.html">General Contracting Unit</a>It is Shougang Construction Group Co., Ltd..</p>
<p>According to information on the website of Fengtai District Government, Shougang Eryo Industrial Park Cultural and Creative Building Project site construction site in June last year, a death worker injury accident occurred.

As a result, half a year later, the Beijing Housing and Construction Commission went to the construction site safety inspection, <a href="http://m.gxfin.com/article/finance/default/default/2023-01-29/5933683.html">also found a number of serious safety hazards</a>Essence</p>
<p>As the head of the project department of Shougang Construction Company, Zhang Rui can be exempted from being held accountable after death.

" The Federation of Trade Unions specially hired a professional law firm. In 2022, 101 legal aid cases were accepted by the union, 100 lectures on law publicity lectures were carried out, and 25 enterprises also carried out free medical examination services for the rule of law to effectively safeguard employees' rights and interests.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Qianlong.com, in order to achieve "where the migrant workers are friends, where they have their warm home", Fengtai District has established 7 "[Home of Migrant Workers] who moved with the construction site of the construction site.(http://society.yunnan.cn/system/2022/08/26/032249445.shtml)"There are 173 such homes in Beijing.</p>
<p>Wang Zhenhua, chairman of the Fengtai District Federation of Trade Unions, said that "Beijing Fengtai Trade Union is fully improved to improve the sense of happiness in industrial workers." There are their warm home ", and the money of taxpayers has established so many homes." So, the union claims that these work and achievements they have done have nothing to do with industrial workers who have owed wages in the construction site of Fengtai District? In other words, these are the slogans that must be shouted, and have nothing to do with the rights and interests of the construction industry workers?</p>
<p>Please listen to the workers' salary representative Ye Xiangming's conversation with me.</p>
<p>Does the union go to the union to know this?</p>
<p>Please listen to these questions and talk to the Changzhen community staff.</p>

<p>According to the Chinese media "Caixin.com", Yan Mingfu died at 10:19 on July 3 at the age of 92 at 10:19 on July 3.</p>
<p>According to public information, Yan Mingfu is a native of Liaoning Haicheng and Christians. He is the son of the CCP's secret party member and the son of the Communist International Spy Yan Baohang. He was the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Minister of the United Front Work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and was elected as the vice chairman of the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He is a member of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, but at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, he was dismissed for "poor performance" during the June 4th incident. In 1991, Yan Ming came back and served as the deputy minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. After retiring, he participated in the founding of the Chinese Charity Federation and served as president from 1997 to 2002.</p>
<p>Public information also shows that in May 1989, in the academic movement incident, the petition submitted by some journalists, Yan Mingfu and Hu Qili who were at the time of the Communist Party of China and the Secretary of the Central Secretariat, and Hu Qili had dialogue with reporters. The main person in charge of the unit had a discussion.</p>
<p>After learning that the demonstration students were on a hunger strike, Yan Mingfu asked intellectuals to mediate. Yan Jiaqi, Dai Qing, Liu Xiaobo, etc. went to the square to persuade students to stop hunger strike.</p>
<p>On May 14th, Yan Ming resumed contracting representatives from Wang Dan, Uyo Kaishi and other academic movements in the auditorium of the United Front Work Hall, but the students' dialogue level was not enough and needed live broadcast throughout the process. After compromise, it was decided to change to live video and broadcast on the TV station. But the two -day dialogue did not make progress. Until May 16, Yan Mingfu came to the square after receiving the consent of the General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, trying to persuade the students, and expressed his willingness to sit and do their hostages together. Instead, it became an important basis for its later dismissal.</p>
<p>In June of the same year, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yan Mingfu, Hu Qili and Rui Xingwen were removed from the position of secretary of the Central Secretariat. In 1990, he was removed from the Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the deputy secretary of the Party Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>As a more enlightened person in the Communist Party of China, he was considered to have made a certain contribution to China's democratization process. In 2015, the People's Publishing House published the Memoirs of Yan Mingfu.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The US State Department issued a travel warning that US citizens re -considered their travel to China because China exists in the risk of arbitrarily implementing and wrong detention of domestic laws (including outbound ban).</p>
<p>This warning did not quote specific cases. In May of this year, the Chinese court sentenced 78 -year -olds in the crime of spy <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/爱国侨领梁成运被中国以间谍罪判处无期徒刑/a-65626740">US and Hong Kong citizen Liang Chengyun's life imprisonment for life</a>Essence</p>
<p>Last week, the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Congress <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制西方制裁-中國推對外關係法/a-66064520">Through the "Foreign Relations Law"</a>, Threatening countermeasures and restrictions on acts that endanger China's interests.</p>
<p>China has recently passed a wide range of content ["Anti -Spy Law]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国反间谍法生效-外企忧心忡忡/a-66088954)Amendment. The revision made the foreign business community shudder, and some companies' offices were searched by assault. This is also a law that sanction foreign critics.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department warned: "The Chinese government enforces its own laws at will, including issuing an exit ban to US citizens and citizens of other countries without fair and transparent law enforcement procedures."</p>
<p>The warning said: "American citizens traveling or living in China may be detained if they cannot obtain US consular services or cannot know about their suspected crimes."</p>
<p>The warning states: "The Chinese authorities seem to have a wide range of free discretion, and can set various documents, data, statistical numbers or materials as national secrets, and use this detention and prosecution for foreigners suspected spy activities."</p>
<p>The warning lists a series of acts that may be accused of crimes. From participating in demonstrations to sending electronic information that criticize Chinese policies, it is even just researching the areas of sensitive.</p>
<p>The warning states that China's outbound ban can be used to force individuals to participate in investigations of the Chinese government, forcing family members to return from abroad, resolve civil disputes that are beneficial to Chinese citizens, and "obtain bargaining bargaining chips on foreign governments."</p>
<p>These warnings are also suitable for travel to Hong Kong and Macau, a special administrative district in China. The U.S. State Department issued the warning on Friday (June 30) and sent it to the media via email on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has issued similar warnings to its citizens in the past, but the travel warnings in recent years have been mainly published in China's severe implementation of the "clear zero" policy and closed the border.</p>
<h3>How to hurt the transnational business of Sino -US relations</h3>
<p>China usually responds to the United States accusing its dictatorship in anger. It also issued its own travel warning against the United States, saying that there are risks such as high crime rate, anti -Asian discrimination, and high medical emergency costs.</p>
<p>In view of China's authoritarian political system and the absolute control of the CCP's legal affairs, the details of the crime of spy charged by the US and Hong Kong citizen Liang Chengyun are unknown. He was detained in Suzhou, a city in the southeast on April 15, 2021. At that time, China was implementing a strict "clear zero" policy.</p>
<p>These warnings are issued in the aspects of trade, technology, Taiwan, and human rights issues in the lowest point in the aspects of the United States and China, although the two parties are taking some measures to improve the situation. U.S. Secretary of State Brills conducted a delay in Beijing for several months last week. Minister of Finance Yellen will also conduct a highly anticipated trip to Beijing this week. China has recently appointed a new ambassador to the United States. He went to the White House to submit the national book to President Biden.</p>
<p>Two Chinese Australians who have received much attention are still detained. He has written an article to criticize the CCP's <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/杨恒均案第七次推迟判决-澳外长表示担忧/a-64451918">Chinese writer Yang Jun (Yang Hengjun)</a>Australian reporter who was detained in 2019 and served as the host of the show on China Global Television Network (CGTN) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳記者成蕾獄中受折磨-遲遲難與家人聯繫/a-63000785">Chenglei</a>It was detained in 2020, but there is no specific information about their suspected criminal acts so far.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous arbitrarily detained case is the "two Michael" cases. In 2018, Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China Huawei Company at the request of the US police <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/历经四年终落幕-美法院撤回对孟晚舟指控/a-63975950">Meng Wanzhou</a>After that, Canadians [Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/两加拿大人遭中国关押满千日-数百人游行吁北京放人/a-59094366)He was detained in China in 2018. They were charged with the crime of harm to China, of which Sparford was sentenced to 11 years in prison by the Chinese court in August 2021.</p>
<p>In September 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice and Meng Wanzhou reached an extension of the "bank fraud crime" prosecution agreement (the allegations were canceled by the US District Court in 2022). Meng Wanzhou was released from Canada to fly back to China. "It was also released on the same day to fly back to Canada. Many countries believe that the case is the "hostage politics" of the Chinese government.</p>

<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>Different palm pearls</h3>
<p>Meng Wanzhou was the eldest daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, and then followed her mother's surname due to divorce. Different sources show that in the early 1990s, Meng Wanzhou, who was just 20 years old, had joined Huawei. She started from the secretary and before the arrest of Canada at the end of 2018. She had already officially went to Huawei Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.</p>

<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>Canada was arrested</h3>
<p>On December 1, 2018, when Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was transferred at Vancouver Airport, the Canadian police arrested the 46 -year -old corporate executive at the US government's judicial assistance request. In this regard, she was pushed into a cusp of diplomatic disputes between China and the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T11-29-00Z/53962389_303.png" /></p>
<h3>China requests to let people immediately let people go</h3>
<p>On December 8, 2018, Le Yucheng (above), the deputy minister of China Foreign Ministry, urgently summoned the Canadian ambassador to China Mai Jialian to propose a serious negotiation and strong protest on the person in charge of the Canadian detainees. Two days later, two Canadians were arrested in secret. Due to the coincidence of time, the outside world generally speculated that the two Canadian citizens became the hostage of the middle direction and the United States.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T11-29-00Z/47275361_303.png" />#</p>
<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>U.S. demand extradance Meng Wanzhou</h3>
<p>On January 28, 2019, the Attorney General of the United States, the Chief Prosecutor of the United States, the Minister of Commerce Ross, the Minister of Land and Security Nielsen, and the director of the Federal Investigation Agency, Riyi, held a joint press conference in the US Department of Justice to announce the formal request for extradition Meng Wanzhou. And prosecuted Huawei for 23 crimes.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T11-29-00Z/53867767_303.png" />#</p>
<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>"hostage diplomacy"</h3>
<p>The two Canadian citizens arrested in China were former diplomats, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian businessman Michaelspavor. After half a year of disappearance, China officially acknowledged that the above two were arrested for spy. This is accused of "hostage diplomacy" by Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T11-29-00Z/55408235_303.png" />#</p>
<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>Princess Huawei under the state</h3>
<p>In the same trial, Meng Wanzhou's situation is obviously much stronger than the two Canadian citizens detained in China. After a few days after being detained, her parole application was approved by the court. Meng Wanzhou with an electronic foot can act freely within the specified range. The picture shows at the end of 2020, Meng Wanzhou left his villa in Vancouver and went to the court to participate in the extradition trial.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T11-29-00Z/46837591_303.png" />#</p>
<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>Chinese group support</h3>
<p>During the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, many overseas Chinese support. During the hearing in the Vancouver court, the local Chinese had repeatedly raised cards outside the court and asked to return Meng Wanzhou to freedom. The picture shows Meng Wanzhou supporters requested immediately before the Vancouver Court just started when the trial was started. After being released in late September 2021, Meng Wanzhou said, "I will never forget all the blessings I have received. I want to thank my motherland and the people of my motherland. Go to the biggest pillar today. "</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-03T11-29-00Z/58882241_303.png" />#</p>
<h4>Meng Wanzhou of China, the United States and Canada</h4>
<h3>Meng Wanzhou was released and left Canada</h3>
<p>On September 24, 2021, the US Department of Justice and Meng Wanzhou reached an agreement to suspend prosecution, and the Canadian court terminated the extradition hearing. Meng Wanzhou did not plead guilty to many bank fraud. However, as part of the agreement, she admits that she had misleaded the bank in Huawei in the Iranian business. The Huawei executive subsequently boarded the charter of the Chinese government. At the same time, news was also reported that the two Canadian citizen Kang Mingkai and Michael Spafver, which were detained in China, have also been released and returned to Canada on September 25.</p>

Yellen's trip aims to re -establish a dialogue with China. The two parties may discuss some sensitive issues, including Meiguang's ban and human rights issues in Xinjiang.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-03T12-04-30-08-00/00dc-yellen-china-mjqh-master1050.jpg" />Treasury Minister Jennte Yellen will visit China on Wednesday. This visit is of great significance to stabilize the tension between the two largest economies in the world.</p>
<p>This will be the first time Yellen has visited China as the Minister of Finance. Previously, Secretary of State Anthony Blintin also visited China last month. Earlier this year, the United States found that Chinese spy balls flew over the United States, and China was dissatisfied with the efforts of the Bayeng government to prevent China from obtaining some sensitive technologies, and the relationship between the two countries was tense.</p>
<p>This trip also coincides with the time when the global economic uncertainty intensifies, and the output of China's epidemic is sluggish. The United States tries to avoid economic recession while curbing inflation.</p>
<p>Despite hoping to re -establish a dialogue, the meeting may involve sensitive issues that have been deteriorated for many years.</p>
<p>The Biden government has been taking measures to reduce the dependence of the United States' imported products in China, and try to limit China <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230629/biden-administration-ai-chips-china/">obtaining semiconductor technology, biotechnology and sensitive technologies. These technologies are robots and artificial intelligence</a>Provide motivation with high -end computing.</p>
<p>At the same time, from the poverty -stricken countries of Chinese loans facing breach of contract, China is unwilling to re -negotiate the loan terms, which makes the United States dissatisfied; and, even if Russia invades Ukraine, China still maintains close economic relations with Russia.</p>
<p>A senior official of the Ministry of Finance who was unwilling to disclose a priority of Yellen on Sunday said that Yellen would meet with senior Chinese officials and American companies in China and American companies in China. The official said Yellen will discuss global challenges and common concern with Chinese officials.</p>
<p>It is expected that the Treasury Minister will oppose China's recent ban on Meicuang Technology. Micron Technology is a storage chip for mobile phones, computers and other electronic products for mobile phones, computers and other electronic products. After the Biden government recently took measures to prohibit Chinese chip manufacturers from obtaining key tools required for manufacturing advanced chips, <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230523/micron-technology-china-ban/">Chinese government to buy key information in May to buy</a>Micro -chip made of Meiguang. The company's chip is used in the memory storage of various electronic products such as mobile phones and computers. After review, China's Internet regulatory agencies believe that there is a "relatively serious network security problem."</p>
<p>It is expected that Yellen will also be concerned about the human rights acts in Xinjiang's ethnic minorities.(https://www.nytimes.com/zh/2019/11/16/world/asia/xinjiang-documents-chinese.html)Essence U.S. officials also want to better understand the scope of China's new anti -espionage law, which may bring new challenges to foreign companies.</p>
<p>Although both parties may express dissatisfaction, Yellen plans to prove that the United States' reduction in China's dependence on China and protecting national security is not to make these two highly intertwined economies "decoupled".</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Yellen's attitude towards China has become mild, saying that the relationship between Washington and Beijing is important to the entire world. In an interview with MSNBC last week, she said that "benign competition" can benefit workers and enterprises of the two countries.</p>
<p>"I hope to make a contact in China this time," said Yellen. "There is a group of new leaders who need to understand each other."</p>
<p>She also said that the two countries "need to discuss the differences between each other, so that we will not have misunderstandings and will not misunderstand each other's intentions."</p>
<p>As China is concerned about different American words and deeds, the Treasury Secretary is likely to face the sharp issues raised by the Chinese government's true intention.</p>
<p>The Biden government has implemented extensive restrictions on China's acquisition of advanced technologies, saying that China ’s ability to use such technologies threatens national security.</p>
<p>In the New York's Foreign Relations Commission on Wednesday, Blint said on Wednesday that it would prevent China from obtaining technology that might be used to harm the United States and conforms to the interests of the United States.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"Allows them to obtain technology that may be used to deal with us. How can this meet my country's interests?" He asked, and mentioned China's continuous expansion of nuclear weapons plans, the development of hypersonic missiles, and "may be used to suppress the purpose of suppressing the purpose of suppressing the purpose "The use of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>"If they change their positions, they will do the same thing," he said, and added that the United States is implementing "very targeted and very narrow control measures."</p>
<p>In order to reduce the US dollar investment developed by advanced technology in China, the White House is also preparing to introduce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html">New investment restrictions</a>Essence</p>
<p>Although Yellen <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20210719/yellen-us-china-trade/">questioned in the past</a>The role of tariffs on imported goods in China, but the Trump administration's tariff regulations are still there, and it seems unlikely to be canceled in the short term.</p>
<p>China has also disappointed with the efforts to transfer its supply chain from China to other allies recognized by the United States. Yellen and other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/business/us-india-relations.html">Cabinet officials call this trend "Youkan Outsourcing"</a>Essence</p>
<p>The United States is still dissatisfied with the reorganization loan of poor countries who are unwilling to face debt defaults, and worry about the depreciation currency in China, because this will make China exports more competitive in the United States.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>In addition to the tight monetary exchange rate, China also faces debt problems at home and abroad. For China, the debt crisis of developing countries is not at the same time. With the slow deterioration of the real estate crisis, loans issued by many banks to developers and local governments have faced the risk of serious losses. This makes banks reluctant to accept huge losses for overseas loans. Although Western experts predict that if you cannot significantly reduce debt, the economy of these developing countries may be difficult to recover.</p>
<p>During the epidemic, the contacts between the officials of the United States and China were very limited. At that time, China basically closed the border and no longer sent officials to participate in the international economic conference. As some measures to strengthen national security, China has gradually stopped released thousands of economic data series in the past few years, making it difficult for U.S. officials to understand the current situation of China's economy.</p>

<p>In 1975, the Dutch, a TV star in Germany, Rudy Carrel(RudiCarrell)One song became popular, and the song name was "When will the summer really come again?" ". He longed for the heat wave like the past, "When people do not need sauna/sheep are happy to be cut hair":</p>
<p>A Summer like in the old days,</p>
<p>Yes, with sunshine from june to sectionmber</p>
<p>And not so well and siberian, like last year</p>
<p>(Lyrics: Summer as in the past,</p>
<p>Yes, from June to September, the sun is bright</p>
<p>Not like last summer, the tide, cold like Siberia)</p>
<p>At least since 1923, people in the cold northern region have always longed for hot summer.(Gerald Murphy)He and Sarah Murphic(SaraMurphy)Blue Coast in France(Riviera)Inventory of sunbathing. What kind of climate is the most ideal, and people have gradually formed a consensus: where there is a beach, it is sunny and the temperature is about 25 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>But since the heat waves in 2019, summer has changed from the season that people desire to make people. The heating speed is twice the global average speed in Europe. It ushered in the hottest summer ever in 2022 and broke the record set in 2021 -and the world has not entered the El Nino climate cycle with the heating effect again at that time. Essence The temperature is as high as 40 degrees, and the wild fire in the distance is burning -what else is there such a beach.</p>
<p>For many people with good economic conditions, the first sensible impact of climate change will change our vacation place: after all, it is easier to change the place where we live. Holidays are changing the climate (tourism transportation now creates about 5%of carbon emissions) and is also changed by the climate. As the epidemic has passed, the time of the record of tourism in the tourism industry has arrived, and a new global resort map will soon appear.</p>
<p>At present, the beach is the protagonist on the resort map. Cambridge University(Cambridge university)A study in 2014 stated: "Seaside tourism is the biggest part of the global tourism industry. More than 60%of Europeans choose to go to the beach for vacation. Seahibu tourism accounts for more than 80%of American tourism revenue."</p>
<p>Some beach vacation destinations -Maldives and some areas of the Caribbean -will not enter the sea. The same is true in the Mediterranean region, especially in the Mediterranean coast of Africa, the rising sea plane is eroding the beach. The weather becomes hot and unbearable. We are likely to see that going to the cooler northern Spain (where I was there last summer), the beach vacation of the beach on the Norman, British and Stick's Navia Peninsula became a trend, until these places eventually became hot. Alaska and the North Pole will soon become a more durable summer heaven.</p>
<p>The following is a small example of how to change the resort map. Thirty years ago, I stayed on a small town of St. Lennez on the coast of southern England for a few months. Since the 1920s, this place was once a high -end seawater bathing place. Until the cheap flights to the Mediterranean appeared, vacation on the British seaside was no longer popular. When I knew this place, the former high -end hotels at the beach were all pensions who had no money, and local authorities in London.(councils)People hidden there. In the new climate, St. Lennard may restore the glory of the past (provided that the British water company no longer does not process sewage to rivers and ocean emissions). When the weather is too hot and not suitable for sunbathing, you can also visit Sussex's local vineyards. At the same time, Spain's hot sun coast(Costa del Sol)It may inherit the crown of "abandoned pre -resort". This transformation will reverse the historical trends of tourists from wealthy countries to poor countries.</p>
<p>Another possible trend is that summer will no longer be the peak tourist season. First of all, summer will become hotter and not suitable for travel. Second, more and more people who do not have to have children do not have to take advantage of the summer vacation. Third, with the booming development of the tourism industry, the reception capacity of popular destinations in the peak tourism season is approaching the limit. It is expected that the beach resort will re -focus on the spring business, which will be the first rays of sunlight of the year for tourists from the north. We may even see the situation in the 1920s that came back again -the British ruling class would spend the winter in the blue coast.</p>
<p>Winter ski tour will gradually disappear. Now, the Alps account for 40%of the world's ski passenger flow. There are hundreds of ski resorts. One of the main reasons is insufficient snowfall. In this century, almost all glaciers of the Alps may disappear. University of Arizona(University of Arizona)Zeng Xubin and others wrote that from 1982 to 2016, the number of ski season in many ski resorts in the United States shortened 34 days average. Ski town has begun to try to turn towards summer and cycling destinations.</p>
<p>The changes in the resort map will cause pain. The main withdrawal of pain will be millions of tourism practitioners and their families they support in poor countries. But this huge change will only be previews, and more people will be forced to say goodbye to their homes in the future.</p>

Although many people have left Hong Kong one after another, the power of the Revolution of the Times must adhere to it, and overseas will continue to fight for freedom and democracy!</p>

<p>Congress Guan Huizhen believes that anti -discrimination and anti -foreign influence are two different things, and should not be confused. "I don't think that these actions are related to discrimination against the Chinese, because foreign agent registration systems are suitable for all countries, not for China, but to better protect Canada."</p>

<p>Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said on July 3 that China respects the development of the development of Japan, South Korea, and countries, but "cannot be used to curb or even block the neighbors around him." He also secretly criticized the US behavior as "the hegemony and domineering coercion."</p>
<p>According to a comprehensive Chinese media report, Wang Yi made the above representation when attending the opening ceremony of the 2023 China -Japan -Korea Cooperation International Forum in 2023. South Korean Foreign Minister Park Zhen and Japanese Foreign Minister Lin Fangzheng also delivered a speech in the forum through a video connection.</p>
<p>In his speech, Wang Yi said that in recent years, in order to seek geopolitical interests, "individual countries outside the domain" deliberately publicized the differences in ideology, weave various exclusive small circles, trying to "replace cooperation with confrontation to split unity." He also said that if this trend is developed, it will not only seriously interfere with the smooth implementation of the cooperation between the Three Kingdoms, but also continuously exacerbate the tension between the regional situation.</p>
<p>Wang Yi emphasized that respecting Japan and South Korea's development relations with countries around the world, but "no relationship can be used to curb or even block the neighbors around him." The three countries of China, Japan, and South Korea and Asian countries should maintain regional unity and stability, resist the tide of thinking of the cold war, and "not be coerced by hegemony and overbearing."</p>
<p>Wang Yi's explanation of this remark is just as the United States has adopted a more close relationship with Japan and South Korea to fight against China ’s increasing regional influence. Last week, Japan's "Asahi Shimbun" quoted several Japanese and Korean officials as saying that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kishida and US President Biden and South Korean President Yin Xiyue were planning to officially hold a summit in Washington at the end of August to focus on discussing the situation in East Asia, including North Korea's nuclear nuclear, With the Missile Development Plan and China's hegemony.</p>

<p>Just as the unemployment rate of young people in China hit a new high, the Communist Party of China directly affiliated to the Economic Daily, the Communist Party, said on July 3 that as the graduates of 2023 left the campus one after another, a survey data showed that the fresh graduates who chose "slow employment" of "slow employment" From 15.9%last year to 18.9%this year.</p>
<p>According to the article, the phenomenon of "slow employment" is not a derogatory term, and it needs to be viewed from two aspects. Most "slow employment" is not employment, let alone "lying down". Because the pressure of employment of youth this year is still high, unlimited graduates and unemployed young people have to passively choose slow employment and continue to search for appropriate positions. In response to this situation, employment services should be continuously continuously provided so that young people with employment willingness should employ or participate in employment preparation activities as soon as possible</p>
<p>Public information shows that "slow employment" refers to college students after graduation, neither plan to employment immediately nor to continue their studies, but temporarily choose to study, support teaching, accompany parents or start a business inspection at home, etc. Phenomenon.</p>
<p>At the same time, Liu Yuanchun, a well -known economist in China and founder of the China Macroeconomic Forum, warned that the problem of unemployment in China may last for 10 years and will continue to intensify in the short term. Social problems even become the fuse of political issues.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg report on the 3rd, Liu Yuanchun issued the above warnings in a report issued by the China Macro Economic Forum at the end of June. The report also mentioned that the pain points and difficulties of China's economic recovery are concentrated as "five 20%", including the unemployment rate of the unemployment of youth groups, an annual decrease of 20%of the profit of industrial enterprises, and a new annual decrease of the real estate construction area by 20%. The income of local land transfer is 20%annually, and the gap in the consumer confidence index is as high as 20%. This shows that the pressure in related fields has exceeded the ability of economic self -repair.</p>

"This seems to be contradictory."</p>
<p>China is the country with the largest greenhouse gas emissions in the world. These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, can lead to climate change. China's commitment to greenhouse gas emissions is considered to be the key to maintaining the global temperature rise within 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>However, nearly 60%of the electricity in China last year came from coal.</p>
<p>Greenpeace said in April that China's approved coal -fired power generation this year has risen, accusing China of priority to consider power supply instead of reducing the burning fossil fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The behavior of large -scale approval of coal -fired power plants has increased people's concerns. I wonder if China will deviate from the promise that has been made, that is, it reached the peak of emissions from 2026 to 2030, and carbon neutrality would be achieved by 2060.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Beijing authorities have repeatedly urged the development of the country to fulfill the promise of climate financing.</p>
<p>Although China is the second largest economy in the world, it still refuses to accept that it is no longer regarded as a development country.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the high temperature in the daytime, countless Vietnamese farmers were forced to choose to farm in darkness.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported on Monday (July 3) that since this year, South Asia and Southeast Asian countries have ushered in a record high temperature. In early July, another heat wave was about to land in northern Vietnam, which led to the local farmers who chose to cultivate at night in order to avoid daydown or heat stroke that appeared during the day.</p>
<p>A 47 -year -old Vietnamese farmer Lan (LAN) told AFP: "When the strong sunlight directly illuminated on my back, the warm water in the field splashed on my face, and it became very difficult to grow rice."</p>
<p>After a few days after trying to focus on the high temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, Lan found that he needed to change the cultivation model to avoid unbearable high temperature weather.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-07-03T16-50/000000.png" />The farmers who choose to farm at night must wear lighting. Because of the limitation of visual, farming time is longer than during the day. (Agence France -Presse)</p>
<p>However, farming in darkness will also face visual limitation, leading to the extension of farming time. Lan said: "Because of the lack of light, the planting may not be on a straight line, so I wear a headlight to cultivate."</p>
<p>Although the working hours were stretched, Lan showed that it would continue.</p>
<p>Another 62 -year -old Vietnamese farmer also said that he had changed the farming time to the evening and early morning. He said: "Although it can be seen clearly during the day, but the temperature is too high, the work process will become uncomfortable, and it will be tired."</p>
<p>Fortunately, farmers choosing to farm at night will not affect the income and expenditure efficiency. They can still earn about $ 40 a day (about S $ 54). Compared with the labor class with a revenue of only 250 US dollars per income, the income of farmers is relatively considerable.</p>

The reasons behind the scenes of the Central Committee of the Central Committee at the 20th National Congress of October last year made the outside world unimaginable.</p>
<p>The previous program of our column just introduced the then party secretary of the central bank, Guo Shuqing, failed to be re -elected as a member of the Central Committee in the 20th National Congress. It was announced in March of this year to be announced to become the deputy director of the 14th National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but Yi Gang was unexpectedly announced to be re -elected as the governor of the central bank ... The next day the show was broadcast, the CCP authorities announced the news of the Party Secretary of the Central Bank of the Party Committee. Pan Gongsheng, a member of the Central Bank, member of the Party Committee and Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, was promoted to the party committee secretary. On June 29, Guo Shuqing, who gave the party class to the central bank as a party committee secretary, officially left his first -line provincial and ministerial level. Work.</p>
<p>People noticed that because the Central Organization Department announced that Pan Gongsheng was promoted to the party secretary of the central bank and eliminated the position of the party secretary of the Central Bank of the Central Bank of the Central Bank, it also announced the position of removal of the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank of the Central Bank. When reporting the news, it also hinted that the era of Yi Gang in the central bank was over in the title or content. For example, "Guo Shuqing and Yi Gang are removed from office", they just took Pan Gongsheng to take over the central bank's party committee secretary. " Comprehensively take over the central bank. "But in fact, as I have analyzed in the last article of this column, the author has analyzed:" Since Yi Gang has been discharged from the internal plan ', he was announced to be observed in the hospital, then this', then this' Observation of 'phase shorter can not be only three or two months. "</p>
<p>When the outside world and the internal media of China, when Pan Gongsheng "fully took over the central bank", none of them noticed that the person in charge of the Central Organization Department announced the "purpose" at the central bank cadres' meeting on the afternoon of July 1. On the day, the third session of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress just closed, and the personnel appointment and removal of the personnel determined at the meeting were related to the State Council.</p>
<p>As we all know, the appointment and removal of the President of the Central Bank of the Communist Party of China and the heads of the so -called State Council ministries and commissions must take a process at the National People's Congress, that is, Xi Jinping's "full process of democracy". Then, in accordance with the "Rules of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China", the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress exercise its powers at a meeting of the National People's Congress. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is generally held every two months; when there are special needs, the meeting can be temporarily convened. The Standing Committee Meeting is generally held in the late month. The session is generally about 5 days.</p>
<p>In this way, whether or not it will end the central bank's "dual head system" in the future, and Pan Gongsheng will replace the administrative position of the president. The earliest time to wait for two months, that is, late August this year.</p>
<p>In other words, starting from July 1, the relationship between Pan Gongsheng and Yi Gang has been changed from the relationship between the deputy governor and the governor and the superior to the superior in the past 5 years. The relationship between Guo Shuqing and Yi Gang is a relationship between the same superiors. That is, the relationship between the party committee secretary and the party committee members and the relationship between the deputy governor and president of administrative and business.</p>
<p>Next, if the so -called "dual head system" started 5 years ago by the central bank has been set by the CCP's senior management, it will no longer need to be maintained for a long time. Then two months later, or after a little longer, Pan Gongsheng may be Like Wang Xiaohong, before the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he first served as the party secretary as an administrative deputy. After a period of time, he took over the executive leader.</p>
<p>So will the "dual head system" be implemented in the central bank for a long time? May wish to see why it was "dual -headed" at the central bank 5 years ago.</p>
<p>On March 26th, 5 years ago, an analysis article published an analysis article "Guo Shuqing!" The candidate of the new bank's new secretary announced, why is the "Secretary+Vice President" combination? What is the meaning of picking more? Look at the Four Detailed Explanations ". The first paragraph of the article is: some arrangements seem to be unexpected, but they are also reasonable. On the afternoon of March 26, a cadre conference was held within the central bank, and it was officially announced that Yi Gang was the president of the Central Bank and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee. Guo Shuqing served as the Secretary of the Party Committee and Vice President of the Central Bank. At about 20:48 tonight (March 26, 2018), the central bank's website announced the latest leadership team members. Among them, except for Guo Shuqing, the vice presidents were Chen Yulu, Pan Gongsheng and Fan Yifei.</p>
<p>Please note that the position of Pan Gongsheng in this paragraph ranks third among the deputy governor, including Guo Shuqing. Since then, Chen Yulu, the youngest central bank's vice president, has been degraded back to the original education system, and served as president of Nankai University and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee. Fan Yifei has been doubled and transferred to the judicial organs. There are only Pan Gongsheng who are the vice president of the old qualification.</p>
<p>For example, the Shanghai Finance and Economics Articles continued to analyze: To the outside world unexpectedly, although Guo Shuqing was the party secretary of the party committee in the central bank's party, the administrative position was the vice president. This arrangement is unusual. In the past, the party committee secretary and president of the central bank were held by one person. For example, Zhou Xiaochuan, who had just retired, has served as the party secretary and president of the Central Bank for 15 years.</p>
<p>The article quotes the analysis of insiders in Beijing: Among some ministries and commissions, the ministers and the party committee (party group) secretary are not the same person, and it is also common to implement the "dual head system". Under this arrangement, the minister is usually the deputy secretary of the party committee (party group), while a deputy minister is the secretary of the party committee (party group). "Among the ministries and commissions that implement the" dual head system ", the minister is the" leader '. ".At that time, Caixin.com also reported that: Guo Shuqing said at the conference held by the central bank on the same day, "In the future, it will be a good assistant to President Yi Gang on the specific business and administrative affairs of the central bank."</p>
<p>As also introduced in the article, it is worth mentioning that Guo Shuqing and Yi Gang have worked for 4 years at the central bank. At today's cadre conference, Yi Gang stated that he will fully responsibility and fulfill the duties of the president, and sincerely unite with the Secretary of Shuqing and the members of the Party Committee, consolidate the entire work together, and jointly create a new situation in the work of the People's Bank of China. Guo Shuqing said that he resolutely supported the central government's decision and fully supported Comrade Yi Gang as the president of the People's Bank of China, and was very happy to return to the People's Bank of China again. Fully support Comrade Yi Gang to fulfill the duties of the president ...</p>
<p>Nowadays, I have not seen Pan Gongsheng at the meeting of the party secretary of the central bank. However, the relationship between the "dual heads" of the State Council of the State Council of the Communist Party of China cannot resume the relationship with the local party and political leaders.</p>
<p>After Pan Gongsheng's replacement of Guo Shuqing's news was announced, there were also external media describing the words such as "accident" and "sudden" in the report title.</p>
<p>In fact, Pan Gongsheng's top position is unexpectedly "reasonable" to say unexpectedly. It depends on the analysis from that angle or from which time.</p>
<p>In February this year, the author published an article "Several Possibilities for Possibilities of the Next Central Bank of President" in this column. The article introduced that Yi Gang was "accidentally" appointed as the governor of the central bank five years ago. Economists have discussed whether the former Henan Provincial Party Secretary Xie Fuzhan will be transferred to the president of the central bank. The brother revealed that Yi Gang succeeded Zhou Xiaochuan as one of the contents of the "general consideration" before the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The total number of votes in the process of "pre -selection" was lower than the threshold, which was "second."</p>
<p>What can provide evidence for the above statement is that Pan Gongsheng, another central bank of Zhou Xiaochuan at the time, was also arranged to be arranged as a member of the 19th Central Committee.</p>
<p>The Pan Gongsheng was nine years younger than Yi Gang. His resume specifically stated that he joined the Democratic League in 1993 and later joined the Communist Party of China in 1999. He is a doctor of economics and researcher at Renmin University of China. Poor scholar and senior researcher at Harvard University.</p>
<p>In other words, compared to Yi Gang, this person is a "Dr. Tu" cultivated by the Chinese Communist regime by himself. In the future, the overseas "education" is gold -plated. But at least one layer of gold has been plated.</p>
<p>The time for Pan Gongsheng to be promoted from the deputy governor of the Agricultural Bank of China to the deputy governor of the central bank was June 2012. He was then arranged to be the secretary of the party group and director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange that Yi Gang was no longer concurrent at that time.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, most of the allocate of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission to the State Administration and Commission are mostly a central member, a member of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and it is not common to be assigned a central alternate member. At the same time, there are almost no places for the two central alternate members. It can be proved that the "Suggestion List of Candidate Candidates for the two Committee members" (that is, the Central Committee, the Central Committee and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission) before the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Yi Gang, who presided over the deputy governor of daily work, and Pan Gongsheng, a member of the Party Committee and Vice President of the Central Bank, ranked among the list of members of the Central Committee and the Central Committee of the Central Committee.</p>
<p>The next story is that there are two 19th central alternate members in the central bank starting in March 2018. Guo Shuqing, secretary of the central bank party committee, is not only a member of the 19th Central Committee, but also has been re -elected for two central members.</p>
<p>Time quickly passed for 5 years. At the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October last year, the head of the Central Financial Systems delegation was Guo Shuqing, the deputy head of the deputy group, Yi Gang, and Yi Hui Man.</p>
<p>The development of the incident is enough to prove that this Pan Gongsheng has been the successor of the leader of the central bank that has been cultivated by the CCP authorities at least 5 years ago. According to this analysis, he is now appointed by the party as the Party Secretary of the Central Bank, and he may take over the administrative leader of the central bank in the future.</p>
<p>However, after the results of the "Election" of the 20th Congress of the Congress last year, people discovered that Pan Gongsheng, who was born in July 1963, was not only promoted to the central committee members, and even the central alternate members were not arranged for re -election.</p>
<p>Since then, the author himself once thought that Pan Gongsheng's possibility of promotion at the central bank system was unlikely. From this perspective, Pan Gongsheng is suddenly announced as the secretary of the Central Bank of the Party Committee, which can be said to be surprising. It is simply "salted fish turn over".</p>
<p>The reason for this "accident" was that it was originally a "accident" that Pan Gongsheng failed to enter the Central Committee at the 20th National Congress of October last year. A "accident" that surprised the Chinese Communist Party's decision -making layer at the time but could not be remedy.</p>
<p>Before the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, the central bank's Pan Gongsheng and Yi Gang and Guo Shuqing successfully entered the 20th National Congress of the Central Financial Institution. Among them, only Pan Gongsheng's name entered the 20th Central Committee members' "Candidate Suggestion List".</p>
<p>After the 20th National Congress, Xinhua News Agency issued a special article: During the conference, the delegations were pre -selected by the "two committees" candidates in a differential election method. Nominated 222 candidates for the 20th Central Committee, with 17 differences and 205 elected, with a difference of 8.3%. Nominated 188 candidates for the Central Committee, 17 differences, and 171 were elected, with a difference of 9.9%. Nominated 144 candidates for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, 11 differences, and 133 were elected, with a difference of 8.3%.</p>
<p>And Pan Gongsheng is one of the 17 candidates of the 20th Central Committee of the 20th Central Committee.</p>
<p>However, in the election of the Party Congress from the Central Committee to the local party, almost none of the candidates who were dropped by the difference were less than half of the votes, but because of the premise of too few differences, most of them were "elected". It is a high ticket and even a full votes, so often the person who is unfortunately entered the difference list actually lost tickets to dozens of votes.</p>
<p>Specifically, Pan Gongsheng himself, the first one may be that there are too many tickets in this delegation, that is, there are too many tickets in the central financial delegation. During the election of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a candidate's votes in his delegation were very critical. However, the central financial delegation is very small, with only 44 representatives, so even if these 44 representatives are drawn in Pan Gongsheng's name, some representatives in other delegations need to be intentionally or unintentionally or unintentionally or unintentional. Pan Gongsheng's name was drawn.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, no one believes that even the senior officials of the Communist Party of China did not expect in advance that a large part of the 20th National Congress represents the "democratic rights" and actually perfunctory things. From the first to the lower sequence, 205 are selected on the votes, so the 17 candidates ranked 206 and after the votes were sorry. Who asked you to be born in a family with too many surnames?</p>
<p>In this way, Pan Gongsheng, who ranked last in the "Twenty Central Committee Candidate Candidate Suggestion List". Analyze the content in detail, and keep the next article in this column to continue.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

<p>A person familiar with the matter revealed that the Myanmar military government will listen to the democratic leader Weng Shan Shuzhi this week's appeal to the two convictions to reduce the 33 -year prison prison sentence of the military government under the series of allegations.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that insiders on Monday (July 3) said that the Supreme Court has announced that it will hear the two appeals against Wengshan Shuzhi violating the official confidentiality law and election fraud. In view of the sensitivity to the two cases of Wengshan Shuzhi cases, insiders added that the court may only make a final decision for two months.</p>
<p>The 78 -year -old election government led by Weng Shan Shuzhi was overthrown in the military coup in February 2021. She was imprisoned by the Burmese army and faced a series of control.</p>
<p>The Burmese government spokesman has not responded to this.</p>
<p>The Burmese military insisted that Weng Shan Shuzhi was convicted under the trial of an independent judicial institution and refuted the human rights organization's secret trial or imprisonment of multiple democratic athlete members, and also denied illegal execution of relevant persons.</p>
<p>In June of this year, Angeshan Shuzhi's younger son Aris has publicly called on the Burmese Army to release his mother and urge the international community to increase pressure on the military. Aris claims that the Burmese army has never provided him with news, nor did she reveal her physical condition. He had asked for help from the Burmese Embassy, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Red Cross, but everyone was powerless.</p>

<h4>Apple Inc (Apple Inc) (Nasdaq Stock Exchange code: AAPL)</h4>
<p>The technology giant Apple Corporation became the world's first company in the world with a market value of more than $ 3 trillion on Friday (June 30). This milestone reflects Apple's iPhone's lasting influence and toughness to the global market. Apple products not only continue to dominate the global mobile phone market, but also continue to change the life and business methods of all over the world.</p>
