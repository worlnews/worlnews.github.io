Some parents said that they found that their children had experienced self -harm and irritability in recent months. After asking the child, they learned that the "unknown medicine" that the teacher feeded and adjusted was induced to use children.</p>
<p>After the parents were sent to the medical examination, they found that many children were detected in the residue of controlling drugs such as Phenobarbita and notified them. After the media was exposed, it caused panic in Taiwan, and public opinion has not showed signs of calming.</p>
<p>The New Taipei City Government stated on Monday (June 12) that at least eight young children are currently experimented with a small amount of "phenobarbich" and "phenyl nitrogen" in Taiwan as three -level control drugs in Taiwan; On the same day, 22 parents told the kindergarten and the teacher, and collected 12 hair tests for appraisal agencies.

He told reporters: "Parents have discovered that during vacation, that is, during the suspension of the drug, emotional anger, irritability, unstoppable screams when sleeping, and even crowded feet and crying. I was surprised. "</p>
<p>Another lady "Xiaoxin Mom" told BBC in Chinese that the three -year -old son Xiaoxin entered the kindergarten before he was a child who was in school and was not afraid of adults. It was greatly retreated by yourself. It turned out that it was only the normal reaction of the development stage. Now that I think about it, there is a trace to find it, "she said.</p>

<p>Hou Youyi, a candidate for the Kuomintang 2024 presidential election, is also the mayor of New Taipei City. He was overwhelming in the New Taipei Mayor election last year, but now, the parents of New Taipei City questioned the slow crisis.</p>
<p>Xiaoxin's mother told reporters that she quickly transferred her son to school. After that, her son had obviously increased his smile and improved his physical spirit. , Children can finally disclose the atrocities of the teacher in the past -'I used to be afraid to hide', 'Teachers will use hard stationery who can fight other people' When comparing the front and back, you can know how much physical and mental damage the school brings to the child!For the mother, every time you know it, it is extremely impact and heartbreak!"</p>
<p>Mike said that parents notified before May this year. After the incident on May 18 was exposed in the media, other parents began to report on May 22, indicating that more than one child was fed, but the New Taipei City Government waited until June. On the 5th, the second expanded search for other teachers and principals was expanded. The efficiency of the municipal government's processing efficiency made them very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Xiaoxin Mom criticized the parents of New Taipei last week to criticize the parents. She believed that she would have no public transparency at all. She said that the case is a major public issue, but only the guardian participates in the media and public opinion representatives to participate in these two meetings. ? Parents who have not been free to participate, write authorization books to relatives and friends to attend, and it is not allowed. "</p>
<p>She emphasized that the general administrative households and even the court can allow the parties to authorize her to participate. explain.</p>
<p>This children's health incident seemed to have risen storms in Taiwan's politics. This is because as the Kuomintang 2024 presidential election candidate, Hou Youyi is also the mayor of New Taipei City. He won an overwhelming victory in the New Taipei Mayor's election last year, but now, the parents and public opinion in New Taipei City have questioned the crisis. Essence Whether this incident will affect its top attack is the new focus of Taiwan's politics.</p>
<h3>Why does the controlled drug appear in kindergarten?</h3>
<p>According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, the president and staff of the kindergarten confessed that parents agreed to feed their children with cold potion. But parents denied that the garden party said that they took out the child's medication list and said that there was no such thing: "Which doctor and parents will agree to eat 'phenobarbad' for their children?" Parents said.</p>
<p>However, Hong Zhengxian, a pharmacist at Taiwan Xiuchuan Hospital, told Taiwan Media Union News. "Some cough drugs and gastrointestinal drugs contain phenobarby, and they are not pipe drugs. New News Weekly also said that according to the magazine survey, at present, Taiwan Pharmaceutical Factory has manufactured phenobabic drugs. A total of 9 models have obtained medicine certificates, and 6 indications are relatively common gastrointestinal diseases. ","</p>
<p>But parents emphasized that according to the child's medical record, the above drugs were not prescribed. Taipei Pediatrician, Dr. Lin Zhizheng, said on Facebook that compound drugs containing phenobarbur are extremely rare to be used to preschool children in the Taiwanese doctor's outpatient clinic. He said, "In theory, the only possibility is that these children have a history of epilepsy and clearly have phenobarbur prescription notes."Yan Zonghai, director of the Department of Clinical Poison, Taiwan Chang Geng Hospital, told the media that phenobarbich is a category of drug components, and almost all of them are oral drugs. He said that phenobarbur drugs are mostly used for the treatment of epilepsy and surgical anesthesia, which is difficult to obtain controlled drugs.</p>
<p>Phenobarbich is also used for compound drugs (including 2 or more effective ingredients). In addition to epilepsy, drugs that treat gastrointestinal tract and respiratory diseases will also appear. Yan Zonghai said that excessive use may cause drowsiness, and even inhibit the danger of life. Moreover, children will have addictive signs. When the application is stopped suddenly, there will be symptoms of restless abstinence.</p>
<p>Decades ago, Taiwan had underground drug -making factories and sold related drugs "red" in underground circulation. It has led to serious social and public health problems. The drug slowly disappeared later.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-14T03-54-44-00-00/000178787_piclink.jpg" />China and South Korea's latest diplomatic disputes have witnessed these two neighboring countries. The matter was caused by the Chinese Ambassador to Korea Xing Haiming on June 8th, and Li Zaiming, the leading Democratic Party of South Korea in the Wild Party, was the following words that made the Korean side strong. Interference of external factors. The United States is trying to suppress China, and some people bet that the United States will win and China loses. This is obviously misjudgment. He has not seen the general trend of history. He also said that people who bet on China now will regret it in the future.</p>
<p>According to the exchanges between me and my Korean media, Xing Haiming said that South Korea's betting between the United States and China should lose China. This should not be fake. A Korean friend once bluntly told me that he believed that China and the United States confronted that China would lose. South Korea would change the diplomacy that had a balanced position between the United States and China and joined the United States Sino -China Alliance. This view is quite market in South Korea. Yin Xiyue is also very beautiful. Nevertheless, the fierce response to Xing Haiming's remarks on Xing Haiming still exceeded many Chinese people's expectations. The outside world saw that South Korean Foreign Minister Park Zhen condemned Xing Haiming for his excessive remarks. According to diplomatic practices, the ambassador's score was to enhance the friendship between the two countries, not the misunderstanding of communication. Zhang Huzhen, the first deputy foreign minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, also summoned Xing Haiming on the same day, saying that he in front of many media, condemned the Korean policy with the unspeakable wording and the facts that contrary to the facts. The interference in domestic politics in South Korea violates the Vienna Convention and warns that Xing Haiming should do well in the division, and all the consequences must be borne by me. Zhao Taiyong, the head of the South Korean National Security Office, also said during the day talk about South Korea -China relations that it will pursue diplomacy that conforms to national strength to build a healthy Korean -China relations. Yin Xiyue's government is centered on national interests, based on principles and mutual benefit and equivalent principles, and strives to develop into a global central country that cooperates with the international community.</p>

On June 9, local time, Colombian President Gustov Petro announced to the media that a small aircraft crashed in the virgin forest, and after 40 days of search and rescue, four missing children have been found together. Except for dehydration, malnutrition, and mosquito bites, they were not injured and survived, including a one -year -old baby.</p>
<p>According to relevant media reports, they originally lived in the local indigenous people living in old forests in the mountains. There are no roads in the local area. Generally, they can only rely on small planes. On the day of the incident, the four children followed their mother and a relative, and took a small aircraft to gather with their father according to the instructions of the distant father. However, the plane crashed while flying over Amazon's virgin forest, and all three adults including aircraft drivers were killed. The remaining 4 children are 13 years old, 9 years old, 4 years old, and 1 year old. Poisonous insects and beasts in the jungle are often heavy rains and have a low visibility. The local indigenous and military started search and rescue at the same time, and they found them 40 days later. While the world was surprised and lamented that these children could survive miraculously, they all attributed their miracles to their survival of their survival skills. People say that they are mainly because they are local indigenous peoples. They have been familiar with the forest since they were young. They know what they can eat and what they can't eat. They understand the jungle, so they can survive.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The sketch of the court showed that in the Miami court, Trump was wearing a blue suit, and his lawyer Chriskis and Todbram were on both sides.</p>
<p><strong> Former US President Trump was accused of illegally preserving confidential documents after leaving the White House, becoming the first former US former US or President in history. </strong></p>
<p>He faced 37 charges, including hindering the actions of the government's retrieved documents, but he had denied the court.</p>
<p>Trump has performed in court, and the prosecutor is now promoting to accelerate the interrogation.</p>
<p>The BBC Washington Branch reported that Trump had no expression when he appeared in court, and kept silent. After leaving, he went to a golf club in New Jersey to speak to his supporters.</p>
<p>The Republicans told supporters that he "fully had the right" to save relevant documents, but admitted that he had not read all documents.</p>
<p>After that, he made a series of unsatisfactory allegations and criticized President Biden and his former political opponent Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Legal experts pointed out that Trump may try to delay the interrogation as possible.</p>
<p>"He has sufficient motivation to delay," said Carltobias, a legal professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. He pointed out that Trump is conducting a campaign to seek nominations for the Republican presidential candidate and strive to enter the White House again in 2024.</p>
<p>Trump's hearing on Miami on Tuesday (June 13) was a standard program. He was recorded in the case, fingerprints, and collected DNA samples, and later he denied the crime.</p>
<p>He was allowed to leave the court, and because he was protected by the SARs and was not regarded as a risk of escape, there was no such restrictions in the bail.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump supporters had a mouthful with his opponent outside the court</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65035373">The four major legal issues in front of Trump</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65184982">Trump's trial, what is his "thirty -four sins"? </a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65865840">Trump was again criminal prosecution: Will he be imprisoned for 37 sins? </a>The next step will be a security permit for Trump's lawyers because the case involves high confidential documents. The legal professor of law and former federal prosecutor Kevin Mcmunigal, a legal professor at Case Western Reserveunivers, said: "This takes time."</p>
<p>Prior to this, Trump first established his legal team in Florida. Two of his lawyers James Trusty and Johnrowley resigned on Friday, that is, he resigned one day after his prosecution.</p>
<p>Former President Trump ’s representative lawyer when he went to court on Tuesday was Todd Blanche, but experts pointed out that he might try to join other lawyers who practiced in the state.</p>
<p>At the same time, the court will enter the next step to select the jury in this case.</p>
<p>Mc Munican said that federal trials are often very rapid, and most of the defendants of cases will be tried within 90 days after the hearing. However, Trump's case may be an exception, because it is a well -known case that requires a security permit.</p>
<p>Legal experts still believe that the allegations of the former president are "surprisingly powerful", and any efforts trying to revoke the case are likely to fail.</p>
<p>"This is not to say that he and his lawyer will not delay as much as possible," Professor Tobiaz said.</p>
<p>They may hinder case advancement through the following three methods.</p>
<h3>1 . Called no criminal crimes</h3>
<p>Trump repeatedly argued that he had the right to take away documents from the White House under the Presidential Records Act, and he had decrypted it before his departure.</p>
<p>His lawyer may put this argument in front of the court, but Professor Tobiaz said that this approach is unlikely to obtain a favorable ruling.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>On the day of Trump's court, law enforcement officers were alerting outside the court.</p>
<p>"I don't think he no longer has the right to retain documents after the president," said Professor Tobiaz. "The" Archive Law "is very clear. I don't think there is any doubt about it."</p>
<h3>2 . Claim that he has suffered unfairly</h3>
<p>His lawyers may also argue that Trump is the victim of "selective prosecution" -he is under unfairly targeted, and other politicians, such as HillaryClinton, Mike Pence, And President Joe Biden and others have never been prosecuted for their processing of confidential documents.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-14T08-31-15.000Z/_130064007_5c7ef356661309a3708b452f0030061ac0a1a1300_356_7272_40911000x563.jpg" />Image source, EPA</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The supporters of former US President Trump gathered near the entrance to the Golf Course of the Dorra.</p>
<p>But Professor Tobiaz said that the case of former President Trump is different in several aspects. First, several other politicians were "very willing" to pay back the documents they had preserved at the time, but the evidence in the indictment showed that Trump refused to do so.</p>
<p>"The indictment shows that Trump has been accused of doing a lot of very irresponsible things," he said, the remarks of selective prosecution not far before the court.</p>
<h3>3 . Try to overthrow key evidenceProfessor Mc Monica said: "That may be a question before the interrogation, which will cause some delays."</h3>
<p>However, he added that the judge in the case of the trial of Washington had ruled that under the principle of Crime-Fraudexception, the evidence could be included in the indictment. This exceptional principle applies to the dialogue between lawyers and customers trying to obtain legal proposal on how to perform fraud or crimes.</p>
<p>Experts say that even if these reasons are unlikely to completely overthrow the case, it will definitely cause some delay, because the court will have to carefully measure the issues raised by Lawyer Trump one by one.</p>

<h3>The support of the Republican Party is not affected</h3>
<p>Trump was involved in a lawsuit, and it seemed that his support among Republicans had declined.</p>
<p>BBC's partner Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) found that 76%of the Republican voters were even more worried that the lawsuit was political motivation, not whether documents could endanger national security.</p>
<p>Program, the operation of the US Department of Justice should be independent of the White House. Biden himself was also undergoing another investigation because of the processing of confidential documents. He said last week: "I never -have never -it is recommended to do what the judicial department should do."</p>
<p>Legal experts said that criminal criminal prosecution may make Trump prison for a considerable period of time. But he has claimed that no matter what the decision is, he will continue to run for president.</p>
<p>Trump appeared in court this time for less than three months. He accepted a court hearing in New York in April, and he was charged with the 2016 presidential election to falsify business documents with the sealing fee of porn women.</p>

He said that China has always followed the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation.</p>
<p>According to a notice issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Qin Gang "clarified the strict position" on the core concerns of the Chinese issue such as Taiwan, and emphasized that "the United States should respect, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop harming the interests of China's sovereign security development in the name of competition."</p>

<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/al2-06112023191031.html">After being beaten by suspected Chinese students after the rally of the British and Hong Kong people</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/al1-06122023092700.html">"Resistance to the British Redization" to the fourth anniversary of the Sino -Chinese Movement reunited on the streets of the British and Hong Kong people</a></em><em> </em><strong> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/al-04132023124051.html">For the first time in the three years, senior officials in the Hong Kong government visited the British and Hong Kong people to launch a protest "to fight against Taiwan"</a></strong></p>
<p>Several Hong Kong people participated in the rally after Southampton, southern England on Sunday (11th), were attacked by suspected Chinese students and attracted attention in the British and Hong Kong people. Former Hong Kong Legislative Councilor Luo Guancong, who was in exile, and CatherineWest, a British Labor member who has always been concerned about Hong Kong issues, urged the British Security Secretary of State Tom Tugendhat to investigate the incident.</p>
<p>** The Minister of Security may have returned to China for two days after two days.</p>
<p>On the third day after the attack, Tomtugndhat finally responded. He intercepted the relevant reports in Twitter that the incident was extremely serious. The police were investigating, emphasizing that the behavior of dismissal was not tolerated: "Freedom of speech is the foundation of our country. We cannot tolerate those who tell the truth to the power to the truth. Or hurt. "</p>
<p>However, some netizens found WeChat, which was suspected of attacking Chinese students suspected of being attacked by Chinese students. The posts showed that they were likely to set off back to China. The station asked the Hampshire police to verify that the police said that they were continuing to investigate, and there was no new information at this stage. The police responded a few days ago that the incident involved the "Hate-RelatedAssAult", causing a minor injury, but did not explain whether anyone was arrested.</p>
<p>After investigating the information, it is not the first time in the British Hong Kong people to be attacked for protests. In October last year, when Hong Kong people Bobchan protested by Manchester's "20th National Congress", it was dragged into the embassy by many Chinese diplomats in Manchester City in Manchester City. In November 2021, a group of Hong Kong demonstrators protested on Chinatown, London, opposing the Chinese group's "anti -discrimination" rally for the CCP to "wash" and was attacked by more than 10 Chinese people. Some Hong Kong people were beaten to break the blood, but the incident was not available.</p>
<p><strong> Councilor follows Hong Kong people's security foreign ministers refusing to respond positively </strong></p>
<p>At the British Parliament Conference on Tuesday (13th), Labor Party Councilor Wester asked the security issues of British Hong Kong people and asked Foreign Minister JameScleverly: "The Hong Kong group is still very scared. The government can be outside the UK. Will you make a commitment in the parliament today? You will cooperate with the government colleagues to urgently deal with the security doubts of Hong Kong people? This is what you promised to me last year. "</p>
<p>However, in response, Cleverly only said that it had confirmed to the Chinese government that the "Chinese Overseas Police Department" in the UK has not operated again, and has not responded to the security issues of Hong Kong people.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong> Analysis: Hong Kong people's voice has not been able to control the British policy to China </strong></p>
<p>Huang Weiguo, a Hong Kong international relations scholar who moved to the UK, accepted an interview with this station, saying that it was not just the British Foreign Minister, but the US Secretary of State Brillings was about to visit China. He believes that although Britain and the United States are still tough in China such as technology, they do not want to be too hostile to China in their posture.</p>
<p>In this context, coupled with the influence of most British people who did not experience the infiltration of China, domestic public opinion failed to form sufficient pressure, so it was difficult for Hong Kong people to shake the British government's policies to China.</p>
<p>Huang Weiguo said: "Temporarily public opinion in the UK, Chinese issues and Chinese penetration are not the themes. It is difficult to rely on the voice of Hong Kong people to influence the British government. Although the number of Hong Kong people who come to the UK is a lot, they have been in the past few years. , Still not becoming an important voice, enough to affect the British government's foreign policy, and even attitude towards China. We must also admit that there is such an objective limit. "</p>
<p>He believes that in the British and Hong Kong people's organizations and initiatives, or adjustable strategies, and use the new crown epidemic, to explain the influence of the Chinese regime on the people of the world on the people of the world, it is expected to break through the British public opinion environment.</p>

But at the end of last year, after China ended the epidemic sealing and entered the channel of economic recovery, the confidence of private enterprises has not been effectively recovered, and it has even dragged down the overall performance of China's economy. This reporter Wang Yuncai wrote three series of reports to reveal the dilemma of China's private economy with the experience of many private entrepreneurs. The following is the first episode of the series report.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/ec-04202023073921.html"><strong> In order to boost the economic Chinese government to fight private capital abacus </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/1-03082023101525.html">Chinese official media said that Xi Jinping asked private enterprises to eat Dingxin Pills Sun Dawu is still in prison</a></strong></p>
<p><strong> Tianya meet </strong></p>
<p>For the first time, Hu Li Ren saw Meng Jun in Miami, USA in April this year.</p>
<p>"When eating at night, I feel that he is very sluggish. I asked him, hello. When I met for the first time, I talked about it." Hu Liren recalled the impression when he first met Meng Jun. The two because of their common friends because of their common friends acquaintance.</p>
<p>Hu and Meng originally worked as companies in the country, but Meng Jun closed the company at the end of 2021 and arrived in the United States in April last year. "I have worked hard for so many years, and now I can't go back to what I do ... ... My whole state is not very good this year," Meng Jun recalled this Hu Li's situation.</p>
<p>Hu Li Ren closed the company earlier than Meng Jun, came to the United States at the end of 2018, and settled in the Wellida seaside.</p>
<p>In April, in April, according to the data of the National Bureau of Statistics, the profit of industrial enterprises above designated size (referring to the annual income of 20 million yuan in the main business) had fallen for four consecutive months, of which private industrial enterprises from January to April The profit dropped by 22%. At the same time, private investment has also slowed down month by quarter.</p>
<p>Two Chinese private entrepreneurs in the trapped meet at the beach of Florida, perhaps accidental. But under the tide of economic and social changes, their meeting seemed to be trapped by the times.</p>
<p><strong> Different starting points of the same era </strong></p>
<p>For many years, Hu Li Ren and Meng Jun have actually been the beneficiaries of China's economy. But at first, they were all people who were thrown out by the "system".</p>
<p>Meng Jun was from Jilin, Northeast, and his parents laid off as early as the late 1980s. In order to alleviate the burden on the family, in 1989, Meng Jun graduated from high school and went out to work.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000002.png" />Meng Jun in 1992 in Beijing (provided by Meng Jun) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/wy1-jpg.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Hu Li Ren was born in an intellectual family. He finished his junior college in the mid -1980s and graduated from a research institute mainly in Shanghai. However, in 1991, the Institute was abolished, and Hu Li entered a foreign -funded enterprise.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000004.png" />Hu Li Ren in college (provided by Hu Li Ren)![] <a href="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000005.png"></a>](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/minying/wy-06142023142320.html/wy31.jpg)In the early 1990s, after the dark moment of the June 4th massacre in 1989, China began to improve relations with Western. The Chinese government also put forward the goal of establishing a socialist market economy system. China's economic development began to move towards a new step. On the stairs of climbing fate, Meng Jun and Hu Li began to touch their own direction.</p>
<p>Meng Jun has done many different jobs from the northeast to Hainan. "This was a stage by 1993 to 2000. I went to the seafood restaurant and made a charter. Then doing border trade, I was also familiar with Vietnam. In fact, it was smuggling. "Meng Jun received his first bucket of gold through entrepreneurship. He estimated that he earned a total of nearly 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Hu Li Ren entered the Internet industry in China in 1997. "At that time, Li Ka -shing's company set up a" Meiya Online "in Shanghai. At that time, the annual income was 40,000 to 500,000 yuan. "</p>
<p>It was a glorious era. China's GDP (GDP) accounted for more than 2%in the world in 1994 and rose all the way. The private economy has also developed more vigorously. The number of private enterprises across the country has grown from 0 in 1978 (only individual industrial and commercial households at the time, no private enterprises) to 1.76 million households in 2000.</p>
<p>The smile of the times was written on the face and heart of Hu Li Ren and Meng Jun. "I think it's good. I am prosperous. As long as you work hard and can fight, you will make money; at that time, you can do anything smoothly, what you do, and what you do to make money," Meng Jun sighed.</p>
<p><strong> The trick of making money </strong>In 2000, Meng Jun obtained the opportunity to deal with a rotten tail building less than 4,000 square meters in Beihai City, Guangxi. "I will make a million yuan in less than half a year. I just pack it, probably sell it, and sell it. "He admitted that the key to the entire project was the internal box operation of the government. Through fake bidding, Meng Jun's company started at a low price (rotten tail building), Later, Meng Jun gave the government in charge of 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000006.png" />Meng Jun in 2001 in the rotten tail building (provided by Meng Jun) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/minying/wy-06142023142320.html/wy33.jpg">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000007.png)</a>When Meng Jun was doing charter business in Hainan before, he knew that he could get a lot of benefits through dredging the relationship with government practical figures. But this time in Beihai, he still opened his eyes. "Those officials are not like this, and they are so brave. You know, there are too many rotten tail buildings at that time. Because they must pass their hands. "</p>
<p>For this reason, Meng Jun summarized the trick of doing business in China. "Knowing officials, cooperating with government officials, and doing business with their relatives. Only when you know them, can you divide the money and make this money earn more. It's easy. "</p>
<p>This rotten tail project in Beihai is an important starting point for Meng Jun to establish his own business territory in Guangxi. "When in Nanning, I met higher -level officials, including vice chairman and secretary general of the Autonomous Region CPPCC. In the future, I will start to do some other things, including contracting projects, because there are relationships, you can do some, such as repairing highways, etc. "."</p>
<p><strong> Entrepreneurship instructor </strong></p>
<p>Hu Li Ren has not started to start a business at the same time, but he has been walking at the forefront of China's industrial development. After the World Internet Bubbles were crushed in 2001, Hu Li left the Internet company and entered the investment banking industry that was in the development period.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000008.png" />In 2000, Hu Li took a photo with the team when he served as the CEO of the Internet company (provided by Hu Li Ren) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/20005e7480e1529b4efb62c54efb4e9280547f514f014e1aceo65f6548c56e2961f768454087167.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000009.png" /></a>At that time, the Zhengdai Asset Management Co., Ltd., which is headquartered in Hong Kong, found Hu Liren at the time. "This fund company comes to me. They need to find a partner in China, and they know that I am more familiar with investment and finance, and they are more familiar with the project. I have operated the project before, so I started to do investment business. "Hu Li Ren has entered the investment bank in 2002, and left the industry until the outbreak of the sub -loan crisis in 2008.</p>
<p>During this period, he took the team for industrial research and had a deeper observation of the overall situation of China's politics and economy. The economy is good as a whole. At that time, real estate began, and foreign trade developed rapidly. "</p>
<p>At that stage, Hu Liren was also very satisfied with himself. "I was in all aspects of my aspects in China, and my ability was stronger than others, and had certain advantages. Starting in the late 1990s, my income was almost the same as that of foreign (white -collar workers). of."</p>
<p>Because of the rich experience in the Internet industry and investment banks, Hu Li Ren was invited to give lectures in various places. "I helped the Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, and Fudan University. "Entrepreneurship instructor", Hu Li Ren always emphasized that China's large market is full of opportunities. "China's capital market has gradually become active. It turned out that the Chinese stock market did not have any technology entrepreneurial boards. Later, it was gradually established. Board and so on. "</p>
<p><strong> Dance with the times </strong></p>
<p>Looking back now, Hu Li Ren and Meng Jun's life began to take off, which is also the window period for China's economic development. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the total number of foreign trade has increased, and the GDP (GDP) has also increased at the fastest speed since the reform and opening up. In particular, the liberalization of foreign trade operations has made Chinese private enterprises enter a large number of international trade markets and released the ability to export Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Meng Jun's basic market is in Guangxi. Since 2004, the China-ASEAN Expo jointly settled in Nanning, which was jointly organized by China and Southeast Asian countries. At the 2012 expo, Meng Jun found the opportunity to "go to the sea" and began to engage in the manufacturing and export of rubber products. "At that time, the Thai delegation came over, did the ASEAN Expo not have economic and trade negotiations? When you talk about it, you can get a factory when you mention it, and it started from that time. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000010.png" />Meng Jun in 2010 in Hong Kong (provided by Meng Jun) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/minying/wy-06142023142320.html/wy36.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000011.png" /></a>The factory established by Meng Jun is mainly to import rubber raw materials from Southeast Asian countries, produce daily products such as rubber pillows, and export to Vietnam, Thailand and other countries. For security considerations, Meng Jun was unwilling to disclose the company's name. In the first few years of the factory, the profit margin could reach 40-50%.</p>
<p>During this period, Hu Li was in Shanghai. His work at the investment bank smoothly, in his own words, he made a lot of money. At the same time, he began to get involved in the investment of private enterprises with greater steps.But in 2009, Hu Liren changed his identity and became a real private entrepreneur. That year, Hu Li Ren and his friends jointly invested in the establishment of a company that developed new energy technology ("Shanghai Aiheng New Energy Technology Co., Ltd."). Hu Li Ren accounted for 51%of the shares. Essence Speaking of the original intention of starting a business, Hu Liren said, "I have been working for so many years, and I always want to leave something in this world. I want to contribute to humans. I really have this ideal. , Go to research and develop, I am not so rich. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000012.png" />Hu Li Ren was in the business period (Hu Li Ren provided) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/minying/wy-06142023142320.html/screenshot-2023-06-14-220317.jpg">![] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000013.png)</a><strong> Unknown 2018 </strong></p>
<p>In the year when Meng Jun set up a rubber factory and Hu Li's investment in developing new energy technology products, the Chinese economy is still developing rapidly, but the dilemma faced by private enterprises has become increasingly obvious.</p>
<p>It is impossible to obtain a fair competition with state -owned enterprises. The tax is too heavy, the cost of labor and raw materials has continued to rise, and it is difficult to obtain a loan required for the development of enterprise development, and the changes in the international business environment. It is getting more and more difficult to do business. According to Reuters, the average profit margin of Chinese private enterprises was only 1.44%in 2011. Huang Mengfu, chairman of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in an interview with the media at the time that he learned that there was a trend among private entrepreneurs who did not want to do industry.</p>
<p>After Meng Jun's rubber product factory has experienced the prosperity in the first few years, the profit margin has begun to decline. Because the raw materials are with them. It is many domestic people who run to Vietnam and Thailand to build factories. The local labor force is cheap. In 2018, a group of people have gradually gone out and transported the equipment. "</p>
<p>The overall situation of Meng Jun's company in 2018 is not bad. From 2016 to 2019, the rubber factory is still at its peak. The total output value of Mengjun distributed in three companies in Guangxi, Chongqing, and Beijing is close to 300 million yuan per year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000014.png" />Meng Jun's rubber product factory (provided by Meng Jun) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/5b5f519b76846a6180f6523654c15382.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000015.png" /></a>However, in many aspects of 2018, China has brewed changes in the far -reaching impact in the future. In March, the National People's Congress passed the amendment of the Constitution, canceled the term system of the President of the State, and paved the way for Xi Jinping's re -election of the third Chinese highest leader.</p>
<p>At the same time, the media frequently flashed the unknown signal for private enterprises. In January 2018, Zhou Xincheng, a professor of Marxism -Leninity at Renmin University of China, published an article on the theoretical publication of the Communist Party, saying that he should eliminate private ownership. In September, the blogger Wu Xiaoping wrote an article saying that the private economy has completed the historical mission of achieving economic development and should gradually exit.</p>
<p>These claims were once passed on the Internet as a joke, and they were also tarted by all parties. However, at a economic forum in September in September, Wu Jinglian, an older generation of Chinese marketing economists, said that Liu He, deputy prime minister of the State Council of the State Council in charge of the economy, said that there are now some "unaccompanied voices" to discuss private enterprises.</p>
<p>Meng Jun got a more clear "hint" during the Spring Festival of 2019, which was turned over the New Year. He didn't realize what would happen, and his own company seemed to have not been affected.</p>
<p>But in 2018, Hu Liren's enterprise suffered a devastating blow, and this blow was a disease from the Chinese economic and political system.</p>
<p><strong> "We will catch you again if you come again" </strong></p>
<p>The new energy central air conditioner led by Hu Li Ren won the second prize of the Shanghai Invention Contest in 2014. In that year, he registered another company "Shanghai Gu Ren Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd.". That's it. We have doubled each year and increased. In 16 years, we are about 6 million output value. We reached about 12 million in 17 years. In 18 years, we expected to achieve at least 20 million. "Hu Li Ren and his partner estimated at the time that he could recover all 10 million investment in three years.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000016.png" />Hu Li Ren led a large factory energy -saving central air -saving central air -conditioning ending (provided by Hu Li Ren) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/80e1529b4efb7387961f5f0053d176845927578b5de55382828280fd4e2d592e7a7a8c037ed3675f83b753d1660e5956.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000017.png" /></a>However, the second year of industrialization, in June 2017, the energy -saving air conditioner installed by Huli Ren Company's listed company Amaton Co., Ltd. in Changzhou had a water leakage problem. After the testing and confirmation of the National Architectural Materials Testing Center of China, the PE (polyethylene) pipe purchased by Taobao from Linyi City, Shandong Linyi City is a pseudo -shoddy product.</p>
<p>Yahong Management refused to admit that they provided fake and shoddy products. Although the Linyi Municipal Government where this company was located sent the staff of the Market Supervision Bureau to the project site for investigation, they finally concluded to Hu Liren beyond his imagination. "I am Go to Shandong, the leaders of the Shandong government told me that we are fraud here, and many companies are fraudulent. He said that we cannot suppress their companies. If we suppress them, the local tax here is gone. Can't develop anymore. "Hu Liren's company has done similar projects in Yuhang District, Hangzhou, and has the same problem. The Hangzhou Administration for Industry and Commerce made a clear conclusion on this, determined that Yahong Management Industry sold unsatisfactory fake and shoddy goods, and in April 2018, it was transferred to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Yuhang Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau. But four months later, the Yuhang Public Security Brigade, who was in charge of the case, verbally notified Hu Li Ren, and the case was revoked. "He said that Taobao was fraudulent, and the people of the country knew that if they helped me check this case, I couldn't find it for 24 hours because they could not find it for 24 hours because they could not find it for 24 hours. Taobao's fraud is too large, so they can't check this case. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000020.png" />Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Criminal File Notification of Criminal Pilotting C case (Hu Li Ren provided) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/676d5dde516c5b895c4094885bf95c714e1c4e9a6d2a7ba14e1a4f2a52a3pe7ba1768452114e8b7acb6848544a77e54e66.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000021.png" /></a>Knowing that the situation is impossible, Hu Li Ren decided to stop all projects and recovery efforts to completely withdraw from the market. On the day after receiving the notice of the withdrawal of the Yuhang Public Security Bureau, Hu Li Ren bought a ticket from the United States. After more than ten days, he did a good job of closing the company's aftermath. He boarded the plane and left China on September 12.</p>
<p>After Hu Li took office, the overall loss of the enterprise was counted: "(the problem) has a total of four projects, about 6 million yuan, but after I have a problem, I still have orders. My tens of millions of orders are gone."</p>
<p>Hu Li's encounter is not alone. False fakes have long plagued the Chinese economy. The Chinese government has been claiming to be strictly reorganized for many years, but because of the rule of law and the prevalence of local protectionism, governance measures do not seem to have a significant effect. The "Evaluation of Fake and Piracy Piper in 2022" released by the US Trade Representative Office in January this year pointed out that China is still the number one source of counterfeit products in the world.</p>
<p><strong> I have supported it for two years </strong></p>
<p>Just as Hu Li Ren left China, Meng Jun's rubber company orders were still rising. But what he didn't expect was that just a year and a half later, his own 100 million yuan enterprise will sink with the new crown epidemic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new crown epidemic in 2020, Meng Jun did not particularly worry about business. "You know when the SARS (Coronary Virus epidemic) in 2003 was over, so three months ended, so I simply thought that it might be again that it may be again again. A SARS, there were a lot of orders in my hands. At the end of January 2020, the city began to be closed nationwide. In fact, it has gradually begun to unblock before May 1. "</p>
<p>In order to cope with the order in his hand, Meng Jun also planned to last a production line in May and imported a large amount of raw materials. However, it was only one month after construction, and soon received the order of Fengcheng. The factory was forced to stop work. "The full calculation in the second half of 2020, I started starting for less than 90 days, that is, from May to the end of the year."</p>
<p>In this case, it is difficult to complete the order. After turning over the New Year, the situation did not improve in 2021, and the epidemic control caused the factory to stop and stop. In order to control the cost, Meng Jun had to reduce staff again and again. Before the National Day, there were less than 50 employees who had about 150 people. At the time of time, there was no play, and their employees could see it. "</p>
<p>By mid -October, Meng Jun, who had worked hard for nearly two years, could not see hope, and decided to close the company. Meng Jun told reporters that during the two years, his enterprise did not receive a penny subsidy, no subsidy, no benefits, and all the losses were the company's own responsibility. He calculated the losses during the two years of closed control. More than 10 million losses are still unbearable for companies with an annual output value of Meng Jun.</p>
<p>Meng Jun's failure is only a microcosm during the epidemic. His industrial park closed 90%of companies during the epidemic control, including many companies such as packaging and wood. The number of companies that are closed due to the control of the epidemic is still difficult to obtain from an open channel. However, the data obtained by Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" in early April 2020 showed that 460,000 companies closed down in the first quarter of China in the first quarter of that year, including companies that were canceled in operating licenses and companies that were announced by themselves.</p>
<p><strong> Huang Zhong destroyed </strong></p>
<p>Both Hu Li Ren and Meng Jun acknowledged that when they closed the company, there was no way, but they were unwilling to support it again.</p>
<p>For Hu Li Ren, the most important thing is not the loss of money, but to be completely disappointed with the government. He still clearly remembers that when he went to Shandong to say something, the local officials intimidated him. "He told me very clearly, you can go to any place to tell me, even if you sue; he also threatened me, don't come again, don’t come again If you come again, we will catch you. "</p>
<p>Since the patent is still in his hands, after Hu Li Ren left China, many companies called him to invite him to do projects, but he refused. "I would rather abolish these patents, and they were unwilling to contribute any more to this country any more. Technology, "Hu Li Ren said. He has completely awakened." I don't want to serve such a dark society, dark regime, and dark countries. It is meaningless. I think this country is over. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000022.png" />Hu Li Ren in the United States (Hu Li Ren provided) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/80e1529b4efb57287f8e56fd.jpg">![] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000023.png)</a>Meng Jun said that in closing the company's decision, the impact of the epidemic was just overwhelming the last straw of the camel.</p>
<p>Almost synchronized with the epidemic, the Chinese government has adopted several major management and control operations on private enterprises since 2020. The launch plan of Ant Technology Group was suspended; Didi was executed for network security review; The industry also collapsed because of a paper order. These things were seen by Meng Jun, and he was more and more deeply appreciated by the hints given to him before the officials of the officialdom, "I feel like a large company as big as them has poured, and small and medium -sized enterprises like me must definitely be sure Well. "Not only that, during the epidemic period, the 86 -year -old father -in -law of Meng Jun suffered from cancer. He could not get timely treatment and died early at the end of 2021. Meng Jun, who is trapped at home, can only understand the truth of the epidemic through the wall through the wall. "This is not an epidemic, and the world is open. Only China is not the case. At that time It doesn't matter, this is a exercise. When is this sport? Although I have not experienced the Cultural Revolution, I also imagine what will happen because I understand history. "Meng Jun began to worry that he had been worried for so many years for so many years. Will the accumulated wealth be liquidated?</p>
<p><strong> Fortunately, I left </strong></p>
<p>Now, Meng Jun and Hu Li Ren are a little fortunate that they will be drawn in time. Hu Liren left China in September 2018, and Meng Jun ran away in the United States in April 2022. They said in unison that if they were stubborn at the time, they would not have good results.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000024.png" />Meng Jun in the United States (provided by Meng Jun) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/wy-06142023142320.html/5b5f519b57287f8e56fd.jpg">![] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T19-22-00-04-00/000025.png)</a>"Now after I leave, the entire industry is vacant, no one has done it, and no one will do it now. My technology is mainly for manufacturing enterprises. Now the manufacturing industry is finished." Hu Liren described his industry in this way. status quo.</p>
<p>In 2022, China was under control, and industrial enterprises were full of grief. After abandoning the clearing policy at the end of the year, many outside voices thought that China would have a retaliated economic rebound in 2023, but the actual economic data disappointed all circles.</p>
<p>In order to boost the economy, the Chinese government has taken a variety of measures. In the first quarter of 2023, the growth rate of China's broad currency investment M2 continuously maintained a high level of more than two -digit number. Some commented that the central bank had printed money to release water and letting water crazy. Chinese officials also made heavy bombs at the small conference, saying that private entrepreneurs were their own, and released some policies to help private enterprises. But the reality is that the key index that reflects the status of the manufacturing industry "industrial producer out of the factory price index(PPI)"Since the end of 2022, it has fallen eight consecutive months, and has fallen 4.6%year -on -year in May, the largest decline in seven years. Many people exclaimed that the Chinese economy has entered a shrinkage.</p>
<p><strong> Our fear and love </strong></p>
<p>Both Hu Li Ren and Meng Jun were the tide in the tide of China's reform and opening up. Both of them also understand or use China's government -business relationships, and sometimes even selectively ignore this relationship that the relationship may be harmful to society.</p>
<p>However, in the changes in China's political and society in recent years, both private entrepreneurs have been severely damaged, forced to change their original intention and life plan, and start to amend their past understanding of China.</p>
<p>Meng Jun said, "After the epidemic, I started to reflect and keep looking at. The real problem was the problem of this system, which was the evil of this group; if you did it again, you would like to go in And you are a bribeer, you have to be implicated. So saying that this is a life -saving, no life. "</p>
<p>Hu Li Ren seems to be more pessimistic about China's prospects. "No one wants to leave his motherland, but there is no way. The country is like this, there is no chance to get better, it will only become worse and worse. I will come out for four years. I come out for four years. Time, do you think the country is getting worse and worse? There is no way, all of them have turned around, just like what I was conceived at the time. "He said, many of his friends in the country praised him, saying that he came out It's time.</p>

<p>China's continuous expansion of economic, political, and military influence around the world has aroused strong concern in the United States. On Wednesday, a number of American legislators said that China is a threat to the United States directly, and the United States needs to establish a new foreign agenda to resist China's threats facing regional countries.</p>

<p>The comprehensive security agreement signed with the Solomon Islands last year attracted strong concerns about the Indo -Pacific region headed by the United States. The United States believes that strengthening the alliance with the Indo -Pacific countries is vital to the regional threat to China. On June 14, the Indo -Pacific Working Group of the Natural Resources Committee of the House of Representatives of the Congress held a hearing.</p>
<p>The chairman of the committee, Bruce Westerman, opened bluntly that China was a threat to the United States.</p>
<p>"China tries to destroy our interests in the Pacific region, especially when it involves free union. We must find a way to fight against China's malicious influence and protect the interests of the United States in the region. We will face this threat and face China's aggression Can't watch it with sleeves. "He said:" The impact of fighting against China is a major challenge, because China often operates in a gray area. "</p>
<p>In 1986, the U.S. Congress approved the "Compaction of FreeAssociation (COFA" with the Pacific Island State Michigan and the Marshall Islands in 1994. provide assistance. The agreement especially allows the United States to adopt military operations in the agreement involved in the agreement, establish a military base, and expel military forces that have not been permitted by the United States. The agreement was originally planned to expire in 2024 and 2023.</p>
<p>These three Pacific island nations are also known as the "Frely Associated States (FAS). Because they are located on the second island chain, it is essential to maintaining the leadership of the United States in the Indo -Pacific region and has also attracted China.</p>
<p>The US Marine Corps retired Colonel Grant NewSham told the committee that the funds approved by the "Freedom Joint Agreement" supported the entire defense strategy of the United States in the West Pacific and East Asia.</p>
<p>"China is building a world -class army, but there is a problem." He warned: "The importance of controlling the South China Sea is not as good as that of the Chinese PLA breakthrough in the first island chain. Establishing a political leading position, it will break through the first island chain. China will defeat the US's first island chain defense from behind, so the existing regional strategy in the United States will be fragmented. "</p>
<p>The United States signed a memorandum of understanding with the Marshall Islands in January this year and signed the final agreement with the Federal Federation of Mikonisia and Palau in May. The United States plans to provide about $ 6.5 billion in economic assistance to the Three Kingdoms in the next stage, but the final agreement has not yet been approved by the US Congress.</p>
<p>In 1986, the United States Chief Negotiation Representative and Retired Army Colonel Albert V.Short told the committee that although the agreement was awarded the US defense rights, the United States had never abused this power in 40 years. He pointed out that China's continuous impact in the region has increased the possibility of the United States to use this power.</p>
<p>"As China's influence continues to increase, we cannot predict or exclude the power in the future." He said: "When you look at this agreement, it is a very successful story, but a high priority of China It is the authority that fundamentally disrupted and destroyed in the contract. "</p>
<p>Schott urges Congress to set a correction route for the relationship between the United States and the Freedom Federal State and the region as soon as possible through the approval of the relevant agreement.</p>

<p>Cleopaskal, a senior researcher at the Democratic Foundation, said that it is also important not only to prevent China's malicious impact in the region, it is also important to establish a joint blockade and construction strategy of island countries.</p>
<p>She pointed out that China not only tried to shake the political situation of the Marshall Islands, but also stabilized Pahu through the tourism economy. Therefore, she emphasized that supporting the establishment of their own national security committee and blocking construction tools owned by other places will help contracts and prevent China's political competition in the region. Laure the foundation for truly long -lasting, tough India -Pacific regions.</p>
<p>The United States actively builds the second island chain defense deployment. The Ministry of National Defense has previously established a missile defense test site in the Marshall Islands. In the construction of Palau's military radar system, the Micronesia Federation has also approved the establishment of permanent military existence in the United States in the United States.</p>
<p>On the same day, Gregory W.meeks, a senior member of the US House of Foreign Affairs and Democratic Representatives, also emphasized at another hearing of the "Belt and Road" countries against the Chinese economic coercion "Belt and Road".

<p>As the reform of state -owned enterprises entered the deep water area, an important theoretical and practical issues are on an important agenda. This is what a modern enterprise system should our state -owned enterprise be established.</p>
<p>The discussion of the modern enterprise system is naturally inseparable from the attributive of modifying the corporate system, the concept of "modernization" or "modernity". The British Industrial Revolution in the 19th century was undoubtedly a typical example of modernization. In my opinion, the so -called "modernization" or "modernity" refers to the qualitative change in the following aspects of human society's life compared Modern civilization with equality and progress in rich and feet. First, steam power invented by Newcastle, Watt, Bolton and other inventions instead of manpower and animal power, human beings are gradually liberated from the heavy physical labor of "faces facing the loess, back to the sky". One of them; second, human living space has expanded from the "Shili and Eight Township" that walks one day to and from to the end of the world, and even immigrate to Mars in the future; the third is the concept of continuous redefining luxury goods. In the early days of the British Industrial Revolution, the people generally believed that luxury goods such as luxury goods and coffee had already left luxury goods. Now, for many people, they may be clear or unclear for many people. In the words of Adam Smith, the accumulation of national wealth ((promoted by the industrial revolution) can make ordinary workers live a better life than the prince of Africa in the Neolithic Africa.

<p>Description: Luo Zhiheng et al.: The key to the transformation of Shanxi is to break the "resource curse" of coal. To cultivate strategic emerging industries, implement skills to enrich the people, promote the energy revolution, and promote the reform of the financial system below the province.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-14T22-05-03-00-00/000129210_piclink.jpg" />Shanxi is one of the birthplaces of the Chinese civilization. The humanities are deep and the natural scenery is beautiful. The revolutionary sites such as the Eighth Route Army headquarters are all over the province. The tourism resources are extremely rich and have the reputation of the "Watching Mountains and Rivers". As a large province for resource development, Shanxi Coal reserves accounted for 17.3%of the country, ranking third in the country, and the output of coal (raw coal) ranked first in the country, protecting coal for 16 provinces, autonomous regions and cities across the country. After the two rounds of coal markets from 2012 to 2016 and 2019-2020, the Shanxi economy has picked up in recent years. In 2022, the province's GDP reached 2.56 trillion yuan, and the per capita GDP was 73,700 yuan. It has made great progress compared to the "Thirteenth Five -Year Plan" period.</p>
<p>Due to the industrial structure of "one coal unique", Shanxi has benefited from a large amount of fiscal revenue caused by coal mining, but also faces challenges such as insufficient added value of traditional industries, low residents' overall income, and slow development of high -tech industries. In general, Shanxi Finance has the distinctive characteristics of "two highs and six lows": the scale of resource tax and the contribution of the mining industry, the dual low of individual taxes and the dual low income of residents, the financial contribution to the central government and the central subsidy of the central government, the scale of debt and debt, and debt The risk is low.</p>

<p>Some time ago, US President Biden Gangang announced that he would run for the president again, and the Republican National Committee immediately released a political short film. The short film shows the tragic scene of the United States under the re -election of Biden. The image is realistic and full of emotions. In fact, the video is generated by artificial intelligence. Some people say that artificial intelligence has since entered the field of political propaganda. Prior to this, the pictures generated by artificial intelligence such as the police capture Trump and the Roman bishop dressed in fashion down jackets had been spread virusly on the Internet.</p>
<p>Even the traditional mass media played artificial intelligence. A German magazine publishes a large photo of Schumacher, who has retired F1 racers and withdrawn from the public sight after skiing, is accompanied by the title of "first interview" and "global sensation". The smaller "it sounds like is true" vague wording. In fact, the magazine published an interview generated by artificial intelligence. Although the internal page of the magazine explained that interviews are related to artificial intelligence, the scandal eventually ended with the editor -in -chief walking, apologizing to the Shuma family, and weakening the credibility of the media.</p>
<p>This is a world that is increasingly true and false under the blessing of artificial intelligence. The European Union is known for its leading digital supervision of other countries and regions, but it can no longer keep up with the pace of artificial intelligence development.</p>
<p>The EU's Artificial IntelligenceAct (hereinafter referred to as "AIA") is in the process of legislation, but the supervisor can not wait for the law to finally take effect. On June 5th, Vice Chairman of the European Commission and the EU internal market commissioner and the "Code of Anti -Fake Information Behavior", including the meeting of technology companies, including Google and Microsoft, requested the integration of generation artificial intelligence into their own application products Enterprises to establish necessary guarantee measures to prevent the services provided from being used to create false content and in -depth falsification, and provide technologies that can identify these contents to mark them.</p>
<p>The development of artificial intelligence is beyond human imagination. Since 2020, OpenAI has released GPT-3, Dall-E, ChatGPT and GPT-4. Microsoft released the new version of the Bing search engine and Edge browser that integrates AI this year, while Google launched the competing ChatGPT to compete with ChatGPT Chat robot Bard. The popularity of ChatGPT disrupted the rhythm of EU artificial intelligence legislators.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the European Commission announced the AIA draft, which was a law based on artificial intelligence risk rating. The draft divides different artificial intelligence into the four levels: lowest risk, low risk, high risk, and unacceptable risks. For example, the real -time remote biological characteristics recognition system of social credit scores and public spaces belongs to an unacceptable risk, which is located in the List for prohibition. The original version of AIA provided by the European Commission did not cover artificial intelligence similar to Dall-E and ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Some researchers have sounded the alarm, saying that the rapid development of powerful artificial intelligence, such as FoundationModels, may be declared the failure and outdated EU legislation. Basic models are based on huge data and are then applied to extensive tasks, equivalent to infrastructure of other applications. From the perspective of researchers, any shortcomings in basic models will continue to the subsequent models. Researchers at Stanford University released a research report on large-scale language models in 2021. Researchers entered an unfinished sentence such as "two Muslims" to GPT-3. Among the 100 sentences completed by GPT-3 All 66 times are violent behaviors, such as "two Muslims enter the Jewish Church with ax and bombs." The proportion of violence in the result is much higher than that of other religions such as Christianity and Buddhism. In other words, GPT-3 shows a strong prejudice that binds Muslims and violence together. Researchers believe that the basic model does not have a deep understanding of this world. They collect good, bad, and ugly everything on the Internet. The results they produce is not based on facts.</p>
<p>In addition, the uncertainty of use means the uncontrollable use, which means the irresistible risk brought by it. The EU AIA specifies some of the artificial intelligence of some specific purposes, and the basic model without specific purposes may be in the legal vacuum zone that is not subject to supervision. Some people suggest that the basic models are included in the "high risk" in the bill.</p>
<p>In the process of discussing the draft, the EU Council introduced the concept of the General Purposeai of the purpose into the text, which refers to artificial intelligence that does not have specific purposes and can be used for multiple purposes. The EU Council proposed in the revised version adopted in December last year that the requirements for high -risk artificial intelligence should also be applied to the universal purpose of integrating into a high -risk system. If the common purpose of the artificial intelligence system provider discovered or notified the abuse of the system in the market, the provider must take necessary and appropriate measures to prevent further abuse, especially the seriousness of abuse and risk. This is actually the provisions of the provider of monitoring obligations, similar to the Noticeand Action Mechanism in the Digital Service Law.</p>
<p>Compared with EU member states, the European Parliament is more inclined to add stricter clauses for generating artificial intelligence (General AI) in AIA.</p>
<p>The most worrying thing about European parliament is how to avoid generating artificial intelligence on the grounds that he claims that he has no specific purpose, thereby avoiding risk -based supervision. Generating artificial intelligence can be used for good aspects, or it can also be used for bad aspects. The unfairness may be that risk and responsibility are transferred to the lower reaches, that is, to users who use artificial intelligence for high -risk purposes. In view of the fact that users do not possess data, they may not be able to fulfill the obligations specified in AIA.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the European Parliament once appeared in the trend of unified generationing artificial intelligence into a high -risk system; on the other hand, the report released by Corporate EUROPEOBSERVATORY in February this year shows that companies including Google and OPENAI's largest investors have persistently lobbying EU policy makers have worked hard to promote artificial intelligence similar to ChatGPT outside supervision.The European Parliament is particularly vigilant for generating artificial intelligence. The European Parliament proposes the basic model for generating complicated text, pictures, sounds or videos for the production of complex text, pictures, sounds or videos. Basic rights, including freedom, announce the use of training data protected by copyright law. And these requirements must be penetrated on the entire artificial intelligence chain. In particular, the basic model provider assisted the providers of system providers to provide adequate guarantee measures.</p>
<p>Some researchers have pointed out that the assessment, reduction and management risks in the European Parliament still focus on the model itself, rather than specific applications. This will only cause risk assessment to become more difficult and to reduce the risk of assumptions. Some people have proposed that the focus of supervision should be placed on users who use the generated artificial intelligence to the high -risk applications. At the same time, another concern in the European Union also has another concern, and excessive supervision may stifle local development similar to the artificial intelligence system similar to ChatGPT.</p>
<p>On June 14, the European Parliament voted to pass the draft AIA negotiation authorization, which will then enter the three -party consultation stage. Controversy about generating artificial intelligence will continue.</p>

<p>Capital Economics Economist Jack Allen-Reynolds said that the one-yard of interest rates seemed to be a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Investors will pay attention to whether the Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will reveal how much interest rates will rise, or whether it is about to suspend interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>After the Fed yesterday decided that after 10 consecutive degrees of interest rate hikes, interest rates temporarily remained motionless. However, the Feds also hinted that there may be further interest rates this year. The Federal Station has launched interest rate hikes earlier than the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>Since the European Central Bank launched interest rates in July last year, the cumulative increase has reached 3.75 percentage points.</p>
<p>If the European Central Bank decides to raise interest rates by 1 yard today, the deposit interest rate that the outside world will pay attention will reach 3.50%.</p>

<h1>A few things you should know about Ukraine counterattack</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T01-00-40-08-00/14dc-ukraine-explainer-kmwl-master1050.jpg" />Even the Ukrainian President Zeleiski said so now: In order to recapture Russia's territory, the long -awaited counterattack of the country has begun. For a few months, Ukraine has been resisting the air raid. Now it has begun to attack. It has been looking for loopholes at nearly 1,000 kilometers of front lines, and even launched attacks on Russian territory.</p>
<p>But after a few days of fierce battles, it is difficult to understand the situation of Ukraine. Why don't we have a better understanding of counterattack success? This is complicated, and there are many reasons related to the war. The following is the reason.</p>
<p><strong> Offense is more difficult than defense. </strong></p>
<p>Military history has long stated that it is much more difficult to seize territory than defending territories. This is part of the reason why President Putin failed to reach the Ukraine capital Kiev's Kiev in the Ukrainian capital last year.</p>
<p>Their teams were in trouble and became a living target for the Ukrainian army equipped with shoulders. Due to the Ukraine's motorized air defense system, the Russian Air Force curled up to a large extent, and they could not conduct joint combat of various arms (only all departments of the army knew what other departments were doing and coordinated), which meant that this means that this means Putin's plan to occupy the entire country has not been realized.</p>
<p>But he did try to occupy territories in eastern and southern Ukraine. After that, the Russian army, as the occupant, has been excavating and building defensive work.</p>
<p>It is now a counterattack in Ukraine, and the Russians have been preparing for it.</p>
<p>"Russia's defensive work in Ukraine is the largest defense project in Europe since the" World War II "," "Military Analysts Sais Jones, Alexander Palmer, and Jewelry Beam Des released An article <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraines-offensive-operations-shifting-offense-defense-balance">thesis</a>Written. "In the offensive operation, the Russian military has built trenches, lightning areas, dragon teeth piles and other obstacles to slow down the speed of the Ukrainian army."</p>
<p>Military experts say this means that the Ukrainian army needs to find a region with weak Russian defense and reinforcement before breaking through. At the same time, the Ukrainian army must try not to allow the weakness to induce them to get enough adventure before reinforcement.</p>
<p><strong> What is the dragon teeth pile? </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>During the Second World War, Germany used the shape of a pyramid -shaped reinforced concrete structure to force retirement of the Allied tanks. The general idea is that the rows of uniform interval structures -hidden mines hidden between some of these structures -will force tanks to enter a more likely target position.</p>
<p>This pyramid structure is called dragon teeth because they are about 1 meter to 1.2 meters high, like a mouth full of teeth.</p>
<p>Satellite images show that this year the Russian army erected a dragon tooth barricade between the anti -tank trenches and trenches in eastern Ukraine and Crimean.</p>
<p><strong> Will Ukraine have a large number of casualties during counterattacks? </strong></p>
<p>This situation has emerged. U.S. officials have confirmed that the Ukrainian army had casualties and equipment loss in early battles. There are very few information about Russia's loss, but officials point out that due to the reasons mentioned earlier, at the initial stage, the attacker is usually more casualties than the defensive defense.</p>
<p>For example, on the landing day of Normandy, the number of casualties of the Germans is estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000, and the number of casualties of the Allies is about 10,000, of which 4,414 confirmed death.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The videos and photos released by Russian bloggers that support this war showed that at least three German -made Leopard 2 tanks and eight American Budley -made Bradeli war vehicles were recently abandoned or destroyed. The New York Times verified the authenticity of these videos and photos.</p>
<p><strong> Does this mean that the counterattack failed? </strong></p>
<p>No. Two US officials said on Monday that the main force of counterattack may not have begun. One of the officials said that in the past year and a half, the United States and its allies have trained nine Ukrainian brigades, and most of them have not participated in the battle.</p>
<p>"When we saw the large armored formation in the offensive, I thought we knew that the main attack really started," said Frederick Hodis, the former US Army's highest commander in Europe. "So far, I don't think we have seen those large armored formations, that is, hundreds of tanks and infantry chariots."</p>
<p>He also said that a tank camp in Ukraine is planned to be equipped with 31 tanks, and a armored brigade is equipped with about 250 different types of armored vehicles. Such a huge combat formation is easily discovered by satellite images.</p>
<p>"When we see two or three brigades on a narrow front, I think we can say that the main offense has begun and the starting place," said General Hodis. "But even so, this is not sure. The General Staff of Ukraine hopes to make the Russians guess the main place for a long time as possible."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The Allies did the same thing on the Normandy Login Day, confidentializing the place of "Overlord Action", and misleading the Germans, making them think that offense is more likely to occur near Galan in northern France, not Norman.</p>
<p><strong> Can Ukraine be unexpected? </strong></p>
<p>It is possible, but it is difficult. In modern war, opponents can get satellite images. Ukraine cannot secretly send the 150,000 troops to Russia's defense as the Allied forces in Normandy.</p>
<p>If there was such a technology at the time, "the Germans could see this through satellites," Jones of the Strategic and International Research Center said in an interview. "So you don't have this option."</p>
<p>He said that Ukraine has what it is doing now: launch attacks in various locations to find weaknesses, but also forced Russians to try to defend in many places.</p>
<p>In addition, Jones said Ukraine also has its own satellite images.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"I think what we see now is the weak link of the Ukraine tentative Russian defense," he said. In some weak defensive areas, "Ukraines may definitely break through those feet defensive work and bad Russian troops defending these areas."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65917669/65261690"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T01-28-00Z/65261690_303.jpg" /></a>Officials of the United States stated that they are cautious about the prospects of diplomatic progress in Bronken's visit.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) After the Chinese and American Foreign Minister called, the United States stated on Wednesday (June 14) that he did not expect the trip to visit China on the weekend of Secretary Change of sexual changes. Reuters analysis is that the United States is trying to dilute the diplomatic results that the trip may bring.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has officially announced recently that Brins will visit Beijing from 18th to 19th. This trip should have been carried out in February this year, but for a long time due to the "spy balloon" storm between China and the United States.</p>
<p>This will be the first visit to China for 5 years. It will also be the highest -level officials from the US government to the U.S. government since Joe Biden, Joe Biden, in January 2021.</p>
<p>Before the departure, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美外长通话-秦刚暗指双边关系困难责任在美方/a-65910231">Blingken talked with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on the 13th</a>Essence During the conversation, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美中關係陷寒冰-秦剛籲美深刻反思/a-65556918">Qin Gang's responsibility for difficulties in bilateral relations lies in the United States</a>And urging the United States to stop interfering with Chinese affairs and respect China's core concerns to curb the continuous deterioration relationship between the two major countries in the world.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Danielkritenbrink, Assistant Secretary of State of the Asia -Pacific Affairs, said at a telephone briefing on the 14th that the purpose of restarting the trip to China is "not to achieve some breakthrough or change in each other's interaction."</p>
<p>Kangda said that one of the main goals of Brinken's trip was to discuss "frankness, direct and constructive" with China, but he was cautious about the prospects of progress. He said: "We will go to Beijing with a pragmatic and confident way. We sincerely hope that we can manage our competitive relationship in the most responsible way."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T01-28-00Z/63754483_401.jpg" />Xi Jinping and Biden met in Indonesia last year. Significant to visit China was one of the agreements reached by the heads of state of the two countries at that time.</p>
<p>Kangda added that Brins are expected to reiterate in Beijing that "the United States has a long -term concern for maintaining peace and stability on both sides of the Taiwan Strait" and discuss the situation in Ukraine with China.</p>
<p>According to the State Council, Brinken will hold a series of meetings with senior Chinese officials. As for whether to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the spokesman of the institute Matthewmille said: "We will announce in the next few days who he will meet with. And when to meet. "</p>
<h3>reduces misjudgment</h3>
<p>According to Reuters, the trip to China ’s visit to China aims to stabilize Sino -US relations, because the relationship between the two countries has recently deteriorated, causing concerns about the international community. One day China and the United States may erupt military conflicts for Taiwan problems, and the two parties are in trade. There are also differences in the development of semiconductor production and human rights.</p>
<p>In addition, although the United States has recently tried to restart dialogue with China and dredge communication channels, Beijing seems to be unwilling to have a public dialogue with Washington. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/李尚福拒絕會晤-美防長令人遺憾/a-65766662">China Defense Director Li Shangfu refused to meet with the United States Defense Minister Lloyd Austin at the sidelines of a forum in Singapore</a>Essence</p>
<p>Kurtcampbell, a coordinator of the White House India, told Reuters that Washington intends to establish a crisis communication mechanism to reduce the risk of conflict. "I believe that Minister Brinken will strongly advocate that these communication channels are necessary." He said: "The army of the two sides is mature and strong, and the risk of interaction is too high, so it is inevitable to build a key communication channel."</p>
<p>The U.S. government expects that Blint's visit to the middle of the middle will pave the way for more bilateral talks in the future, including US Finance Minister Janet Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Ginaraimondo. Essence</p>
<p>Campbell also confirmed that there will be a series of two -way visit to "in the future", but no specific details are provided.</p>

<h3>Shooting</h3>
<p>A balloon in China fluttered over the United States for a few days. On February 4, the U.S. military shot down in the coastal waters of the South Carolina. The United States has accused China of using balloons for espionage. But China said that this is just an out of control meteorological balloon.</p>

<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters.

<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the over -the -world of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Reuters reported on Wednesday (June 14) that Billgates may meet Xi Jinping during his visit to China. Gates is going on a three -year visit to China. Late at night on the 14th, Gates said on Twitter that he had landed in Beijing and this trip will visit its foundation "Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation" cooperation units.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted two people familiar with the matter, saying that Gates may have a one -on -one face with Xi Jinping, but did not disclose what the two may discuss; another third source source confirmed to Reuters to meet the two. But it did not provide details.</p>
<p>Neither the foundation and the news office of the State Council of the State Council responded to Reuters' comment requests immediately.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, if this is true, this will be Xi Jinping's first meeting with foreign private entrepreneurs and business leaders in recent years. During the epidemic, Xi Jinping stopped going abroad for nearly three years due to the control of Chinese border.</p>
<p>Since the restarted by the Chinese border earlier this year, several foreign executives have visited China, but most of them have met with Chinese ministerial figures -March of this year, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang met with Apple's Timcook Long; Reuters also reported recently that Tesla's CEO <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/馬斯克訪華成中國焦點-傳曾經會晤丁薛祥/a-65789014">Elon Musk) met with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Ding Xuexiang at the end of May</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T01-33-00Z/65772428_401.jpg" />Musk met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang at the end of May.</p>
<p>As one of Microsoft's co -founder, Gates resigned in 2008 and he resigned from his full -time position in the company. After being stepped down in Microsoft's board of directors in 2020, he focused on charity related to global health, education and climate change.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Xi Jinping and Gates's last meeting was during the Boao Forum in 2015; in early 2020, Gates' Foundation promised to provide China a series of assistance to China, which included 5 million US dollars of funds against COVID-19. To this end, I believe in Gates to show my gratitude.</p>
<p>Immediately after Gates, US Secretary of State <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688">Antony Blinken) will also go to China from June 18th to 19th</a>For a long time of delayed visit to stabilize the relationship between China and the United States.</p>

<h1>Will Trump be the president of the United States governed in prison?</h1>
<p>Creator: 纪思道</p>

<p>Description: Even if Trump was convicted and prison, he could continue to run for public office and even serve as president. This may seem unimaginable, but it is not impossible. This uncertainty illustrates the tragedy of the United States. Mark Peterson for the New York Times</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T02-31-13-08-00/14kristof-bklc-master1050.jpg" />On Tuesday, Trump was rumored for the second time. Watching him endlessly scolding and his arrogance, it made me feel that it was desperate.</p>
<p>"I am the only person who can save this country," Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?528671-1/president-trump-remarks-court-appearance">announced</a>Essence He said that this was "the most evil and most ingenious power abuse in our history" -whelier, he refers to his "persecution". He condemned the special prosecutor Jack Smith "mental chaos".</p>
<p>However, Trump’s delirium seems to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/13/us/trump-indictment-arraignment-court?smid=url-share#776e44a3-10de-502b-bedd-7aceb7fa279f">did not make himself or the audience cheer up</a>Under the review of the prosecution, this typical scammer seems to have shrunk. It is difficult for me not to think about the leaders who have reported to avoid being prison for decades; during the investigation, they were angry in front of us. Now, the net around Trump is also tightening.</p>
<p>A ridiculous question has always troubled me: Can the prisoners in the federal prison take leave to participate in his own president's inauguration ceremony?</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>I want to know the answer, because Trump seems to move towards two opposite and unseenable directions at the same time. First of all, he will become the first possibility of the first president of the crime of being convicted. Secondly, the possibility of winning the nomination of the Republican presidential candidate seems to be increasing. Regarding whether he can be elected president, the gaming market has given him about <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/">22%</a>Opportunity.</p>
<p>Any defendant must be concentrated as innocent before being proven to be guilty. But some smart lawyers believe that, as a former federal prosecutor said, for Trump, "<a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/06/12/never-been-anything-like-it-former-prosecutor-on-the-historic-indictment/">danger is extreme</a>Essence "Trump's own judicial minister William Balt said," If half of it is true, then he is finished. "</p>
<p>Of course, Trump may get breathing. The evidence provided by his own lawyer may be in the trial <a href="https://cafe.com/insider-podcast-sample/cafe-insider-sample-6-13-legal-hurdles-in-the-mar-a-lago-case/">being announced not adopted</a>Or judge judges may allow the defense to delay tactics, or stubborn sympathy in the Florida jury will refuse to convict them. But Trump may ultimately be in <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/">four independent criminal cases</a>He was sued and had so many cases that were unreasonable. He may find that he had increased the chance of being at least of at least some felony.</p>
<p>He will be the first offender, and he is not sure if he will go to jail. So far, officials are very respectful to Trump: he has not been handcuffed, nor did he take a picture of suspects.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after the conviction, such respect may end, and some criminal plots are finally sentenced to a considerable sentence than the defendant. Just this month, a former Air Force officer was confidentially confidential document for private collections <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/06/02/retired-air-force-officer-gets-3-years-for-having-classified-documents/">judge</a>Three years of imprisonment -he has pleaded guilty, so he may be widely treated. During Trump's presidency, Leati Winner leaked a document and was sentenced to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/reality-winner-nsa-sentence.html">more than five years</a>Prison.</p>
<p>Even if Trump is convicted and prison, he can continue to run for public office, and may even hold presidential positions. If he is not busy in a prison factory <a href="https://www.abc10.com/video/news/verify/national-verify/inmates-work-behind-bars-including-making-license-plates/536-cc67a86e-8690-458a-a23c-6c323aa56543#:~:text=Inmates%20have%20produced%20license%20plates,so%20in%20many%20U.S.%20states.">manufacturing license plate</a>if. In 1920, the Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debers caminated the president in the federal prison and received nearly 1 million votes.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>I want to make some adjustments to call prison officials without listening to the phone between the federal prisoners 62953-804 and the leaders of China and Russia. Maybe the summit meeting can be held in a larger cell? Hold a national banquet in the prison cafeteria?</p>
<p>A low -level precedent: During the crime of serving his sentence for murder, Jor Caston was in 2021 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/anc-jail--dc-joel-caston/2021/06/16/e0fc1ab2-ceda-11eb-a7f1-52b8870bef7c_story.html">Elected</a>As a consultant communist in Washington. But this is a two -year -old non -paid consultant position, which is slightly different from the presidential position.Will voters really choose a person who has been or about to be punished as president? It seems difficult to believe, but in 2016, I also thought Trump would not be elected. It is worth noting that as more and more legal cases against Trump this year, his support in the Republican polls has also increased.</p>
<p>Part of the Federal Prosecution <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/12/trump-classified-documents-indictment-republican-voters-surveys">Latest Police Investigation</a>A reasonable guess is that the prosecution may help him in the Republican primaries, but it will hurt him in the election. Looking forward to the future, news agencies must not look like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/opinion/sunday/lessons-from-the-medias-failures-in-its-year-with-trump.html">2016</a>That's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/opinion/sunday/my-shared-shame-the-media-helped-make-trump.html">Light -hearted</a>Give him a platform without Trump without a full factual verification of Trump. We should support democracy, rather than empowering the instigators of anti -democracy.</p>
<p>All in all, I think Trump is about to fall. But my nightmare is that the United States is in a decline, and voters blame President Bayeng. The crisis in the Middle East led to rising oil and natural gas prices. A third -party candidate appeared. Get more. Or Biden has a health crisis, and the Democratic Party's nomination is Kamara Harris, I am worried that she will be a bit weaker as a presidential candidate. In short, it seems unlikely to be elected president by Trump, but it is not impossible -and the consequences may be catastrophic.</p>

<p>An current president who is governed in prison? This is completely unimaginable -is it? This uncertainty illustrates the tragedy of our country.</p>

<p><strong> Author Yangge, this article only represents the author's own point of view. </strong></p>
<p>After two years of reform, the car trading platform operator Changu Group(CANG.US)Finally show a new look, including the first profit of the past two years.</p>
<p>Although the company is still in the early stage as a car trading platform, its preliminary signs of its latest quarterly reports seem to be encouraged. About ten years ago, Cannan started with automobile finance. At that time, China encouraged more private investment to enter the financial field. But later Beijing cracking down on such private financial institutions, forcing many companies to go down, and a few survivors like Can Valley had to find new business models.</p>
<p>Changu is quickly getting rid of the original car loan business portfolio and transforming to the car trading platform operator in the past two years. It not only provides new cars and used cars, but also provides extensive services for car owners and dealers. At the beginning of this year, it launched the application of "Changu You" that provides second -hand car transactions and services, which is the last large puzzle of its new identity. Its other large puzzle is a similar application launched about half a year ago and a "Can Valley Good Car" providing new car services.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has expanded its business rapidly and recorded its first net profit and operating profit after transformation in the first quarter. In the past three quarters, Changu has recorded continuous and steady growth income, reversing the decline in nearly a year. It predicts that this continuous growth trend will continue to this quarter and promote it to achieve another important milestone, because it has also recorded its first year -on -year revenue growth in the past two years.</p>
<p>All of this shows that after experiencing great reforms, the company has obviously entered a good situation. The question now is how far the new growth engine can take it.</p>
<p>As the business improved, Changu seemed to turn a positive cash flow again. This is reflected in its cash and short -term investment. In the first three months of this year, these two indicators have increased for the first time in more than two years.</p>
<p>Even though the government suddenly canceled the new crown "zero" policy at the end of last year, the Chinese automobile market has been declining recently. Therefore, this initial improvement improvement is even more noteworthy. According to data from the China Passenger Federation, the sales of new vehicles in passenger cars in the first quarter fell 13.4%, because the market sentiment was still weak even after re -opening.</p>
<p>"Although the macroeconomics gradually recovered, it laid the foundation for the recovery of the Chinese automobile industry, but in the first quarter, it was received by the Lunar New Year.(Government New Energy Vehicle)The influence of subsidy exits and the price war began in March, "CEO Lin Jiayuan said at the company's quarterly financial report conference call," The comprehensive effect made consumers in a serious wait -and -see mood. "</p>
<p>The report attracted the attention of investors in the original downturn market. After the performance of the performance last Friday, Chanu's stock price rose 5%in the transaction, and eventually closed at a 0.8%increase. So far this year, the stock has fallen by about 7%, but it has increased by more than 20%over the mid -March low.</p>
<p>Successful transformation</p>
<p>Now, the new main structure of Canvy has been assembled, and the next step is the ending stage, and the new model is fine -tuned to improve efficiency and expansion. The size of this company is still smaller, and the longer -history Changu Good Car Platform only handled 16,490 car transactions last year. The latest performance shows that the Changu Good Car Platform promoted 3,867 transactions in the first quarter. Due to the New Year of the lunar calendar, it traditionally in the off -season in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The revenue of Can Valley in the last quarter was 542 million yuan, which is much higher than the upper limit of the previous forecast of 450 million to 500 million yuan. The latest number decreased by 31.1%compared to the company's 788 million yuan reported in the first quarter of last year. However, as we pointed out earlier, since the Chinese epidemic prevention and control measures have reached its peak in the first half of last year, the revenue has risen for three consecutive quarters.</p>
<p>Canni said that its income will continue to grow from the previous month, and it is expected that the second quarter revenue will be 600 million yuan to 650 million yuan. This will make the company's heavy recovery of the year -on -year increase, which is more than doubled from 289 million yuan in the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Auto trading services currently account for nearly 80%of Cancanu's total revenue, and its earlier car financing services account for most of the remaining.</p>
<p>With the completion of the transformation, Changu also showed signs of strict control in the season. Its income costs in the proportion of total revenue, from 98.9%in the previous quarter to 88.6%, but in order to improve profitability, the company needs to further reduce this proportion; the company's total operating costs from 9.77 in the same period last year last year 100 million yuan was reduced to 491 million yuan.</p>
<p>These performances eventually transformed into profits, and its operating profit was 51.8 million yuan, ending its six consecutive quarters of operating losses. The net profit of 78.8 million yuan is the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021, the first time it has achieved profitability. As of the end of March, the company's cash almost doubled from three months ago to nearly 700 million yuan, and short -term investment in the same period also rose slightly to 2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>During the reporting period, the additional features of the platform include the artificial intelligence customer service launched by the Changu Good Car Platform, and the B2B auction service launched by the Canvan Youxou Platform.</p>
<p>With the improvement of performance, Changu's stock valuation has also increased compared to peers. For the rest of this year, similar revenue growth will make its long -term market sales rate of 0.46 times, which is behind a car home with a longer history and higher profits.(Self. That; 2581. Hak)The current 3.8 times, but much higher than the domestic competitors Youxin(UXIN.US)0.2 times, which is also higher than the US used car seller Carvana(CVNA.US)0.13 times.</p>
<p>Obviously, Changu is entering the next stage of development, which will bring it various challenges because it hopes to expand the new model and will inevitably encounter unexpected obstacles in the development path. However, it has recently restored profitability and income growth, which is undoubtedly a positive sign, indicating that its next stage of journey has a good start.</p>

<p>Description: The Fukushima First Nuclear Power Plant in Japan began on June 12 to start the "trial emission" operation in nuclear energy treatment water in waste furnace operation. The purpose is to test whether the relevant equipment can operate normally. The Japanese side will decide the timing of formal discharge of water in summer based on the trial results. However, Seoul and Beijing have different responses to this incident, and there are also opposition in Japan.</p>

Now they say that we want to put water, and we have to return to the original point again, which is intolerable. "</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), South Korea's largest representative of the Welle Party "Common Democratic Party", Li Zaiming, was invited by Chinese ambassador to South Korea to dine on June 8th, saying <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本試行福島核廢水排放設備-中國反對/a-65897783">Japanese emission treatment water</a>One thing is that "the Japanese side is considered by the economy and other interests as its own sewer, which is extremely irresponsible." Later, Li Zaiming said, "We have to speak together and make countermeasures together."</p>
<p>In response, Kim Qixuan, the representative of the "National Power" party of the Korean ruling party, also urgently talks with the Japanese Ambassador to South Korea on the 8th. The two sides conducted recent consultations on how to eliminate the problem of water in South Korea. Regarding the statement in the opposition party and China, Jin Qixuan also emphasized that it was "malicious propaganda and incitement", which will only cause Japanese -Korean relations to deteriorate and have an impact on Korean fishery -related people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本批准福岛核废水排海计划-中国再抗议/a-62568024">China's attitude is as resolute as ever</a>In addition to the "lonely travel" in Japan, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs even called "extremely selfish and irresponsible." On the contrary, the previous Korean Prime Minister Han Dexun had dealt with water emissions at the end of May and said that "the information we want to get almost all the information we want" and said "quite satisfied with this." Attitude.</p>
<p>In fact, after the Hiroshima G7 Summit, South Korea officially sent an official inspection team to Fukushima. However, after a few days of inspecting returning to South Korea, South Korea's official attitude is still cautious about this. Liu Guoxi, chairman of the Atomic Safety Committee, only said that "we have made progress in the process of science and technology and technical review." More information with Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will not be ruled out that there will be a trip again, and the attitude is relatively slow.</p>
<p>Japan is mainly emitted this time.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/含氚核废水真的不会危害健康/a-57184856)The content of radioactive substances before discharge will be diluted to one -seventy -sixth of the drinking water below standard drinking water. As the cooling water storage of waste furnace operations has reached saturated for more than ten years, the official finally decided to dilute it and discharge it. However, this action has also caused local fishermen, as well as the anxiety and doubts of China, South Korea and the Pacific island nation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T03-16-00Z/64969547_401.jpg" />A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company told Reuters on March 8, 2023: "What we say to fishermen is that we have equipment to handle these water safely."</p>
<p>President Palau (also known as Hui Shuren) on June 13 when he visited Japan 4 days on June 13, he specially arranged the itinerary of Fukushima Prefecture to inspect the operation process of handling water in person. After listening to the official briefing, HPS said: "I understand that there are various topics. It is very important to improve the transparency of the waste furnace." The Minister of Internal Immigration, which was previously included in Fiji, another island country, also said that he was "very concerned" about emissions.</p>
<p>In order to make the international community feel at ease, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kohisuke plans to receive it in early July <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本核废水排海在即-原子能机构再赴福岛审查/a-65763766">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</a>Director Director Rafaelmarianographyi, and is expected to give him various reports to him, and the two parties discuss the final process of water discharge. The International Atomic Energy Agency also visited the nuclear power plant from the end of May to the beginning of June, and was expected to announce the investigation report by the end of June. However, it is inevitable that the treatment of water emissions between China and South Korea also trigger a political effect.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>However, for local fishermen, after ten years of earthquakes and nuclear disasters, the local waters gradually lifted the ban and fishing, but under the discharge of water treatment, the local seafood may be fame again. Therefore, in recent years, they have expressed opposition. The Minister of Economics and Industry of Japan visited three counties including Miyagi, Fukushima, and Ibaraki, especially in the 10th to exchange opinions with local fishery groups, but still did not reach a consensus.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T03-16-00Z/64969506_401.jpg" />Employees of Tokyo Electric Power Corporation are cleaning the marine biological breeding water tank of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station with "Treatment of Water"</p>
<p>The president of the Fisheries Association of Fukushima Prefecture said to Japanese reporters: "(talks) is a parallel line. The idea of our opposition to discharge is unchanged." In this regard, Nishicun only emphasizes that "at the same time as the waste furnace, the fisheries will certainly continue to continue (Eat volume) will obtain consensus and exchange opinions between the two. "</p>
<p>Fisheries President of Ibaraki Prefecture, Feitian Masami, criticized, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本坚持排福岛核废水入海-计划补偿当地产业/a-60277456">The country has not fulfilled the responsibility of fully explaining</a>And said: "If discharge without authorization, it will definitely decline to the fisheries. Absolutely oppose."</p>
<p>Although central officials such as Xicun spent nearly an hour in three counties to communicate with the local fishery associations, they were all spoken. Future fishing prospects will only be more worrying. "</p>
<p>The Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Corporation reached a consensus with the local fishery associations in 2015. Before obtaining the understanding of all parties, they will not make behaviors including discharge treatment water.</p>
<p>However, in April 2021, after all, because the storage volume had reached the limit, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛核废水倾倒海洋-渔民说不-中韩反对-美国支持/a-57244397">I have to make an emission decision</a>However, many fishermen are still incomplete to the government's explanation, and they have repeatedly expressed their opinions in the past. Now that it is only one month left in the summer, how to get a truly understanding at home and abroad in the last limited time will also test the Kishida Cabinet, which will also affect the subsequent House of Representatives Congress elections.</p>

<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<h3>In control?</h3>
<p>The radiation test standards cited by the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation and the Tokyo government are stricter than other countries that are also discharged. This release has also been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "We have equipment to make water safe." Tomohikomayuzum, a spokesman for Tokyo Power Company, told Reuters.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns. He said that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation announced that the emission of polluting water was "unfortunate" for the fisheries that have just recovered in the region.</p>

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can." He said in an interview with Reuters and asked, "Why do you put water to the waters of Fukushima, why not put water to Tokyo or Osaka?" He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

Factors such as inflation, rising consumer expenditure, and Buffett's endorsement have attracted the Japanese economy to attract more investors. Richard A.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T03-22-43-08-00/14japan-stocks-gpmz-master1050.jpg" />In 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stood in front of the camera that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/business/international/shinzo-abes-bid-to-shake-up-corporate-japan.html">change the rigid business method of Japanese companies</a>Essence This is a difficult task. Japanese executives have been relieved for many years after the bubbles of the 1980s, and have been in need for many years. Employees have rare salary increases and shareholders' return. As a result, the economy has rarely increased.</p>
<p>At present, there are significant changes in the operation of the enterprise, which will help inject vitality into the economy. In recent months, Canon shareholders have requested <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/vote-bulletin-canon-march-2023.pdf">Diversification of members of the board of directors</a>, West Rail City watches said they will repurchase at most <a href="https://www.citizen.co.jp/cms/cwc/global/files/20230213jie.pdf">one -quarter shares</a>The owner of Uniqlo promises to be their employees <a href="https://www.fastretailing.com/eng/group/news/2301110900.html">up to 40%salary up to 40%</a>Essence Tokyo Stock Exchange has urged the company <a href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/news/1020/dreu250000004n19-att/dreu250000004n8s.pdf">"Attention" its stock price</a>Essence</p>
<p>In addition, this year's unexpected stable economy, weak currency, and ultra -low interest rate -and many largest economies in the world are raising interest rates -plus <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/why-warren-buffett-is-keen-on-japans-versions-of-berkshire-hathaway.html">Volun E. Buffett's help</a>It created the best main stock market in the world.</p>
<p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose nearly 30%this year, far exceeding the increase of the US benchmark Standard Polar 500 index. This is the so -called "[lost ten years] in the early 1990s of the Nikkei index in the early 1990s(https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/weekinreview/19impoco.html)"The highest point since.</p>

<p>Some observers soon warned that investors had changed too optimistic about the attitude of the Japanese board and hurt. However, the company's profits are improving. Japan's third largest economy in Japan is bathing in the sun after the popularity: inflation is finally reproduction, consumer expenditure is rising, and foreign tourists are returning.</p>
<p>"The basic economic situation in Japan, including corporate profits, is better than the United States, Europe and China," said Owaki Owa Owa, an asset management of Tokyo Nomura. "As far as GDP is concerned, Japan will surpass other countries."</p>
<p>The increase in GDP in the first three months of Japan this year has increased sharply last week, raising the annual rate from 1.6%to 2.7%. The overall situation is still halved, and the increase in company expenditure has brought growth, but these expenditures are more to supplement shelves and warehouse inventory, not the needs of consumers. The individual consumption that measures how much people spend is slightly weakened.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T03-22-43-08-00/00japan-stocks-qzhw-master1050.jpg" />Overseas tourists poured into Japan, and domestic consumption demand also showed strong. Philip Fong/Agency France-Presse-Getty Images</p>
<p>The village said that domestic demand is still strong. It is generally expected that it will rise further, just like the so -called retaliatory expenditures that other countries have seen after the blockade. Japan is one of the last restrictions on the new crown. Although the number of tourists is far below the level before 2020, overseas tourists are pouring in.</p>
<p>"They spent more money than before," the village said, partly because the yen was weak. The exchange rate of the yen against the US dollar has fallen to the lowest level since the 1990s.</p>
<p>Japan has also made great progress in two long -term problems, and has improved wages and inflation in recent months. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japans-consumer-inflation-stays-above-cbank-target-price-hikes-broaden-2023-05-18/">Excluding fresh food</a>Consumer prices rose in April <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japans-consumer-inflation-stays-above-cbank-target-price-hikes-broaden-2023-05-18/">3.4%</a>It is the highest level for decades. As Japan's inflation has been at a very low level for a long time, compared to the United States and Europe, Japan is more willing to see inflation, and the Bank of Japan has stated that it will adhere to <a href="https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/press/koen_2023/ko230519a.htm">currency loose</a>policy.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>However, Park Chongxun, the head of Japan and South Korea's economic research at the Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul, said that inflation is mainly promoted by supplying shortages after the large population. Park Chongxun said: "This is not driven by wage growth." He also said that the inflation rate is expected to fall to the 2%target of the Bank of Japan next year.</p>
<p>The current challenge is to maintain the recent income growth of some economic departments and expand the scope. A survey of a commercial group found that the company agreed to this year <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/economy/20230520-110826/">an average salary increase of 3.9%</a>This is the highest level for decades.Another leader who promotes corporate thinking transformation is the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In March of this year, the exchange <a href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/news/1020/p1j4l400000014ul-att/p1j4l400000014x9.pdf">formulated a plan</a>, Will force companies to increase the stock price lower than the book value. Some of the simplest methods are to pay more dividends and repurchase more stocks. Although it is unclear when the exchange starts the policy, Giants such as Toyota and Honda may have to make changes. The two companies have stated that they plan to repurchase stocks this year. (This year, Toyota's stock price rose 27%, and Honda's stock price rose 50%.)</p>

Canon's shareholders rebuked the president of the company due to the lack of gender diversification of the board, and almost kicked him out of the board of directors.

<p>The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5%to 33502 points on Wednesday, a new high of the year.</p>
<p>For the hedge fund manager Sais Fisher, it has made the company more concerned about the transformation of profits and stock prices. He has been struggling to call on a Japanese company for more than ten years. Perhaps the most impressive is to urge <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-hedge-fund-manager-wins-big-at-nintendo-1468320199">Nintendo</a>Transplant the game on the phone.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"We saw the behavior of executives undergone tremendous changes," Fisher, the founder of Oasis Capital, said in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>One example of Fisher is Camera and Optical Equipment Company Canon. Shareholders condemned his chairman and CEO, and almost kicked him out of the board because the board of directors lacked gender diversity. According to the Nikkei News, due to continuously urging more reserve funds for investment, Japanese companies have announced that in the year as of March, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Japan-companies-stock-buybacks-soar-to-highest-in-16-years">a record 70 billion US dollars</a>Repurchase. This year's dividends may reach a new high, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Japan-Inc.-annual-dividends-at-record-levels-again">more than 100 billion U.S. dollars</a>Essence All these measures are combined to invest funds into the real economy.</p>
<p>Then Buffett's endorsement, he recently said that he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/warren-buffett-why-he-bought-5-japanese-trading-houses.html">increase holdings</a>The shares of the Japanese Enterprise Group Ito Choyan, Maruhong, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. In April, he told Nikkei News that he <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Warren-Buffett-says-he-intends-to-add-to-Japanese-stock-holdings2">plans to make more investment in Japanese companies</a>Essence Since then, foreign investors have invested funds into the Japanese stock market. As the tension between Beijing and Washington has intensified, some investors have avoided investment in China.</p>
<p>Fisher is one of the bullish. He said that as the company takes action to increase its value, they will help Japan's overall economy by increasing income.</p>
<p>"Investors finally noticed that there was a chance to cause a huge change in Japan," he said.</p>

<h3>talk show actor Xie Bizi: Malaysia asked the intervention of Interpol in Malaysia for MH370 jokes</h3>

<p>Last week, Xie Bizi, a talk show, who was born in a lawyer, was widely circulated on the Internet at the performance of a club in Manhattan. In the performance, she reviewed the history of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Triggered a stir.</p>
<p><strong><em>* American Singapore -American talk show actor Xie Bizi </em>* </strong><strong> mH370 </strong> <strong> </strong><strong> Air crash is joking, angry at the Malaysia authorities. She expressed the official response </strong> <strong> </strong><strong> "</strong> <strong><em>*</em></strong> excessive <strong> </strong> <strong><em>*" </em>* </strong> <strong><em>*. </em>* </strong></p>
<p>She told BBC that she was "not making fun of tragedy" and the victim, but tried to find humor in tragedy.</p>
<p>The Malaysian police said they had asked the Interpol to find Xie Bizi, and they are currently investigating her about inciting and offending network content.</p>
<p>Xie Biri, who grew up in Singapore, said that the interpol is "ridiculous" involving the Interpol.</p>
<p>Last week, Xie Bizi, a talk show, who was born in a lawyer, was widely circulated on the Internet at the performance of a club in Manhattan. In the performance, she reviewed the history of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Triggered a stir.</p>
<p>The International Interpol told the BBC that they had not received the Malaysian police's assistance to the case.</p>
<p>Xie Bizi said that her jokes "have been disconnected on social media."</p>
<p>"I have said (this paragraph) hundreds of times, and even made a short version in Singapore. It always makes the audience laugh. If it does not work well, I won't use it anymore."</p>
<p>She also said that "to get rid of" or make fun of the audience is part of her New York comedy club culture. She said that American comics have used the "9/11" attack as a joke material.</p>
<p>"Americans can appreciate more severe, sharp, and more straightforward humor, and in Asia, single -sized comedy is still in its infancy. You can't find a lot of sharp comedy in Asia." She said.</p>
<p>In the performance that triggered controversy, Xie Bizi first teased a Malaysian with a rough mouth, saying that Singapore has become the first world country since 1965 independence, and Malaysia "is still a developing country."</p>
<p>Then, she continued to ridicule Malaysia's planes to "not fly" and associate it with Malaysia Airlines MH370 tragedy.</p>
<p>"What? Malaysia Airlines is not funny at all, isn't it?" She joked with a smile, and then said with a word, "Some jokes won't land."</p>
<p>In March 2014, a Boeing 777 passenger aircraft from Malaysia Airlines disappeared from the radar on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>Search and rescue personnel from many countries conducted four years of search in the Indian Ocean and discovered some wreckage, but did not find the host. 239 people on board were announced to be killed.</p>

<p>On March 29, 2022, Xie Bizi performed a talk show when he appeared at the comedy club in Bobbank, California.</p>

<p>The film was also deleted by Tiktok because it violated its hatred of remarks.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Malaysian Brigade and the United States and dozens of Malaysian overseas Chinese were burned on Sunday (June 11) in Flushing, New York, which protested, saying that this move had no mercy to the family members of Malaysians and the family members of the air crash and asked her to ask her Public apology.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had condemned it. Foreign Minister Zambry Abdkadir said her talk show blatantly lacks sensitivity and sympathy for the family members of Malaysians and the families of air crash.</p>
<p>Vanu Gopala Menon, the highest commissioner of Singapore in Malaysia, apologized. Singapore Foreign Minister Vivianbalakrishnan also tried to calm the dispute, saying that he was "shocked" by these jokes.</p>
<p>"Of course, she does not represent the point of view of the Singaporeans." Vivian said, saying that the Singaporeans "cherish the relationship with Malaysian family and friends."</p>
<p>Some Internet users, including Xie Bizi's talk show actor, participated in her numbness. But some people think this is acceptable irony.</p>
<p>The main function of the Interpol is shared information about fugitives and brought them back to the criminal country.</p>
<p>"I really hope to see the face of an international criminal police organization who receives this request." Ms. Xie said.</p>
<p>"Honestly, if the International Interpol Organization takes this requirement and the incident is upgraded, can you imagine how famous it will make me famous?"Last month, Chinese talk show actor Li Haoshi was detained because he was accused of insulting the Chinese PLA during his performance.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T04-15-09-00-00/000079416_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>The German government wants to implement the strategy of “de -risk risks rather than decoupled” in China, and aims to reduce dependence on China through diversification. However, the diversification of the German business community is not to de -Chineseization, but to "use the opportunities of the Chinese market" and further expand the Asian -Africa and Latinaries.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Strategic origin </strong></p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, Olafscholz, German Chancellor Olafscholz, stated in a keynote speech in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, claiming that Europe bears global responsibility: "We need a geopolitical EU, the European Union, An EU, an enlarged and reform, in the end, the same important is a future -oriented EU. "</p>
<p>When talking about the relationship with China, Tsutz said that he agreed to the European Commission Chairman Ursula Von Der Leyen's previous view that "the motto is not 'decoupled', but wisely 'Dest -risk'. "</p>
<p>The "South Germany" website pays special attention to this statement of Shuerz. Zeng Zaiwen said: Tsutz also used the word "de -risk" here, but he likes to add "wise" in front of him. It seems that Shuerz himself appreciates this strategy.</p>
<p>As Tsutz said, it was "not decoupled" to China, but the strategy of "de -risk" was first proposed by the President of the European Commission Feng Delin.</p>
<p>On March 30, on the eve of the visit to China with French President Macron, Feng Delin delivered a speech at a seminar organized by the European Policy Research Center (EPC) and the Merics Research Institute (Merics). In the speech, the President of the European Commission said that the European Union's relations with China must be "risky" rather than "decoupling".</p>
<p>Feng Delin said: "The focus here is that we don't want to cut off the economic, social, political or scientific contact. China is an extremely important trading partner -9%of our goods exports, and more than 20%of our goods imports Although the imbalance is intensifying, most of our goods and service trade are still mutually beneficial, 'no risks'. "</p>
<p>Feng Delin believes that the decoupling with China is neither feasible nor in Europe. To this end, she proposed a "de -risk" plan for the European strategy in Europe.</p>
<p>In the speech, the European Commission chairman also explained her "de -risk" strategy in detail. According to Feng Delin's point of view, the risk of economic relations includes the EU's economy and industry more competitive and elastic, and better use the EU's existing trading toolbox to develop new defense tools for key departments, and seek to seek Consolidate with partners around the world.</p>
<p>She also said: "All of these will help strengthen our supply chain to restore the original power and make our trade diversified -this must be a core element of our economic 'risk' strategy."</p>
<p>On April 27, Jakesullivan, a national security adviser, learned a speech entitled "Revitalizing the US Economic Leadership" at the Brucks Society. In the speech, Shalvin also said that the Biden government is trying to "go risks" in economic and trade relations with China, rather than "decoupling".</p>
<p>The EU Foreign and Security Policy Senior Representative Josep Borrell also stated at the EU 27 Foreign Consumer Affairs Meeting in Stockholm, Sweden on May 12, said: "'' de -riskization 'is just a word. But in this word, the word Behind, there will be a lot of work that will take time to review all our economic relations with China. " Borier also emphasized that the purpose is not to "decoupling" the European and Chinese economies, but to re -balance this relationship.</p>
<p>It seems that the European and American politicians are "not decoupled" to the China economy proposed by Feng Delin, but the strategy of "de -risk" still appreciates it.</p>
<p><strong> 2. It is not easy to implement </strong></p>
<p>The "Mirror" weekly published on April 22 has published an article entitled "Avoid Rain, and by Circular Water". This title is a habitual idiom in Germany, which means: falling into a more difficult situation. The content of the discussion of the article mainly involves the difficulty of implementing the "de -risk" strategy.</p>
<p>According to an essay, it is said: "Raw materials: The EU has just got rid of the dependence on Russia's energy, and intelligence agencies and experts warn more dangerous dependence, such as dependence on China's rare earth."</p>
<p>The article mentioned that in a government statement issued in March in March, it once praised himself: "We have got rid of the dependence on Russia's natural gas, Russian oil and Russian coal within 8 months." Through the ability to awaken and change, refuel and transform. "</p>
<p>However, the article turned around and carefully pointed out that whether Germans and other Europeans can really do all of this remains to be observed. "Because Europeans may fall into a new and more dangerous dependence, from China's rare earth, Qatar's natural gas to oil from Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>The author of the article specifically mentioned "China's rare earth" and pointed out that this is the raw material required for industrial production batteries, semiconductor or electric motor magnets.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, more than two -thirds of Germany (67.2%) of rare earths in Germany in 2022 were imported from China. And some metals are almost completely from China.</p>
<p>This dependence has also triggered deep concerns of European politics. Danielcaspary, chairman of the European Parliament/CPIC party group, claimed: "By stopping the supply of key raw materials, China can quickly unplug the European economy." He also said: "This dependence relies on It is more dangerous than the past dependence on Russia. In some areas, it is devastating. "</p>
<p>To this end, Feng Delin reiterated again in the European Parliament on April 18 that the European Union will implement a "risk" strategy. In particular critical areas, such as key raw materials, artificial intelligence, quantum computers, biological and military technology, it will reduce dependence on China.</p>
<p>According to Feng Delin, her institution will submit a document aimed at the control of European companies' foreign investment in sensitive fields.</p>
<p>But this was also opposed. Bernid Lange, chairman of the European Parliament Foreign Trade Commission of the Social Democratic Party, said: "Where to invest a company should be determined by the company itself." On the contrary, he urged the European Commission to accelerate the establishment of a new international trade agreement.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that in order to reduce risks through diversification, the European Union is also vigorously strengthening partnerships with India.</p>
<p>From May 15th to 16th, the European Union and India held the first meeting of the EU-India Trade and Technology Commission in Brussels.</p>
<p>At the press conference after the meeting, Europe and India mentioned the term "de -risk" many times, implicitly expressing a common desire to reduce dependence on the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Although EU members have repeatedly stated that Brussels does not want to completely cut off the relationship with Beijing, it really wants to make it diversified. And this is exactly the advantage of India.</p>
<p>According to analysis, it is this force that is closer to the distance between India and the European Union. Vice Chairman of the European Commission Margaret Visteig(Margrethe Vestager)It even claims that the EU-India's partnership can be "injecting power" for Brussels' "de-risk" concept.<strong> 3. German enterprise attitude </strong></p>
<p>The German Economic Asia -Pacific Commission (APA) published a report entitled "Seize Opportunities and Reduce Risks -the German Economic Report on the Federal Government's China Strategy" in January this year, which systematically explained the committee of the committee.</p>
<p>In the "core information", the report clearly states: "Although geopolitical relations are becoming increasingly tense, it continues to maintain economic and technical relationships with China that meets the interests of Germany and the European Union. China is not only Germany's largest trading partner, but also for a long time. Important innovation base. "</p>
<p>The report said: "With the participation in China, Germany ensures its global competitiveness. Investment in China and exports to China ensure German jobs and value creation. The cooperation in terms of aspect is irreplaceable. "The words are true and the position is clear.</p>
<p>Although the title of the report also contains "reducing risks", the first is to "seize the opportunity". Here is a special report on the report on the "diversified strategy": "However, the diversified strategy cannot depend on the withdrawal of the Chinese market. It is important to use the opportunities of the Chinese market and develop and expand the new market. The circle of friends', that is, the economic relations with the market economy of the democratic system in a targeted manner, are not a solution for the German economy. On the contrary, the focus of diversification must be placed on further expanding the growth market in Asia, Africa and Latin America. superior."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the "diversification" expected by the German economy is not de -STD, but "using the opportunities of the Chinese market" and further expanding the Asian Africa and Latinaries.</p>
<p>From the current point of view, German companies in China are indeed optimistic about the Chinese market. On March 29, the German Institute of Economics (IW) in Cologne (IW) published a survey report written by the institute's expert Jürgenmatthes, entitled "The dependence of German companies to China is in China. Rising: The investment in 2021 and 2022 hit a new high ".</p>
<p>When the report opened the door, he wrote that "there is no sign of diversity", and pointed out: "The latest data from the German Federal Bank shows that in 2022, German companies invested 11.5 billion euros in China, more than ever."</p>
<p>The report also raised its investment in the previous two years: 2020 exceeded the estimated value of about 2 billion euros, and even increased by 4.2 billion euros in 2021. It also said that in 2021 and 2022, a total of 21.5 billion euros new direct investment flowed to China to China Essence The author Matters was amazed: "There is never such a large Chinese driving force."</p>
<p>In the reference, Matters listed the report published on August 19, 2022, "The Dependence of Germany's Economy to China: Empathy at the Full Speed in the False direction".</p>
<p>But from the above data, Germany's companies in China did not obey Mats' advice, but instead seized opportunities to build a new development pattern in China. This is really unexpected to the expert Mats.</p>
<p>Germany CEO and Chairman of the Asia -Pacific Committee of the German Economic Asia -Pacific (APA) Rolandbusch recently said in an interview with the Financial Times that for Siemens, withdrawing from the Chinese market that accounts for 13%of the company's revenue, "Not One choice. " He also said: "I will defend my market share. If I can, I will expand it."</p>
<p>After the Hiroshima Summit of the Seventh Kingdom Group, the German "Times Weekly" website wrote on May 22: "The Seventh Kingdom Group unanimously agreed to take the 'derived risk' as a common Chinese strategy."</p>
<p>But whether the above -mentioned strategy of Western countries can work is really doubtful. Because, as the German Economic Asia -Pacific Commission stated that it is through participation in China that Germany ensures its global competitiveness and ensures that German employment and value creation is a win -win situation. The diversified strategy cannot depend on the evacuation of the Chinese market. Instead, it is necessary to use the opportunities of the Chinese market while developing and expanding the new market. Germany's achievements in China so far prove this.</p>

<p>The former AIIB employee, named the AIIB, was named Bobpickard. After 15 months of working in the bank, he announced on the 14th that he had resigned from the bank's global liaison supervisor and criticized it. The bank management is "dominated by the Communist Party members" and is full of "toxic culture" within the organization. It does not think that the qualifications of the Asian investment bank members are in line with Canadian interests.</p>
<p>Big Bo wrote: "As a patriotic Canadian, this is my only choice." He also responded to netizens' message: "I have witnessed the extent of the bank's critical positions in the bank. Benefits the membership of the member. "</p>
<p>In this regard, Fang Huilan told Reuters that she had instructed the Ministry of Finance to investigate the allegations of the country and the participation of the country in the AIIB. action. According to the analysis of the report, this statement implies that Canada may further announce the official withdrawal from the AIIB.</p>
<p>The AIIB issued a statement through an email that the public remarks and descriptions proposed by Bigbo "have no basis and disappointment." The Wall Street Journal consulted the internal email of the AIIB that the president of the bank and the former deputy Minister of Finance of China, Jin Liqun, wrote to all employees on the 14th to acknowledge that these remarks may bring uncertainty to the company, but the blessing Biga Bobo will go well in the future.</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy in Canada responded to Reuters' comment request: "The saying that" the Asian Investment Bank is controlled by the Communist Party of China is just a lie. "</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>According to Reuters, Fang Huilan's speech marked the deterioration of Sino -Canadian relations. In the past 5 years, relations between the two countries have also been in the freezing point.</p>

<h1>How does South Korea "turn waste waste into treasure"?</h1>

<p>Description: South Korea is banned from landing kitchen waste, and the government has established hundreds of treatment facilities to convert them into animal feed, fertilizer and family heating fuel. This method was praised, but critics said it did not achieve the goal of reducing food waste. CHANG W. Lee/The New York Times Seoul, a kitchen waste disposal facility.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T04-56-27-08-00/cqbg-master1050.jpg" />The world every year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/climate/global-food-waste-solutions.html?searchResultPosition=11">1.4 billion tons of food</a>Most of them entered the garbage landfill. Their rot will pollute water and soil, release a large amount of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/12/climate/texas-methane-super-emitters.html">methane</a>—— One of the most powerful greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>But this is not the case in South Korea. In the country, the country was prohibited from sending kitchen waste to landfills in the past 20 years ago. Here, the vast majority of kitchen waste is converted into animal feed, fertilizer and family heating fuel.</p>
<p>Kitchen waste is <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021">one of the biggest causes of climate change</a>Not only because of methane, but also because of the energy and resources of food production and transportation.</p>
<p>Governments of various countries are studying Korean methods, and up to 90 % of waste foods here are processed by landfill and incineration. Officials from China, Denmark and other countries have visited related treatment facilities in South Korea. New York City will be required to [require all residents] next fall <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/nyregion/food-composting-nyc.html">requests</a>Separate kitchen waste and other garbage, a spokesman for the city's health department said that New York has been observing South Korea for many years.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Although many cities have similar projects, few countries have implemented this approach nationwide like South Korea. Research institution <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste">Project Drawdown</a>Senior scientist Paul West said that this was due to cost. According to the Ministry of Environment of Korea, although individuals and enterprises pay a small amount of fees to deal with kitchen waste, the project still spends about $ 600 million in South Korea each year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, experts such as West said that this method should be promoted. "Korean examples make a large -scale reduction of emission reduction," he said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T04-56-27-08-00/00skorea-foodwaste-07-plkz-master1050.jpg" />At a treatment point of Gaoyang, kitchen waste is separated from plastic bags.</p>
<p>Korean cooking traditions often bring surplus food. Most of the time, there are a few small side dishes for a meal, as many as a dozen. Over the years, almost all leftovers have been buried underground.</p>
<p>However, the country's multi -mountain terrain restricts the number of garbage landfills and cannot open away from the residential area. In 1995, the government promoted the compulsory recycling regulations of paper and plastic, but kitchen waste continued to bury with other garbage.</p>
<p>Liu Rongji, a researcher at the Seoul Research Institute operated by the government, has provided proposals for the treatment of kitchen waste disposal for many cities. He said that the complaints of the odor near the garbage landfill have promoted the occurrence of the smell from the politics. Essence Because Korean cuisine is mainly stewed, kitchen waste often has soup and water, which means that the size is larger and the smell is heavier.</p>
<p>Liu Rongji said, "The kitchen waste thrown away will make a terrible odor."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Since 2005, it is illegal to send kitchen waste to landfills in South Korea. Local governments have established hundreds of processing facilities. Consumers, restaurant owners, truck drivers and others are part of this network. The network collects kitchen waste and transforms into useful things.</p>
<p>The popular luncheon restaurant in Daofeng District, Seoul is the most popular with dried fish soup and kimchi pot. Regardless of what dishes, the owner Li Yiyan (sound) will carry various side dishes, including kimchi, tofu, boiled bean sprouts and pickled theme.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T04-56-27-08-00/00skorea-foodwaste-02-plkz-master1050.jpg" />Li Yanyan visited his Seoul. The leftovers of the day will be concentrated in a bucket.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T04-56-27-08-00/00skorea-foodwaste-03-plkz-master1050.jpg" />After snoring, Li Xiyan's restaurant will pour leftovers and leftovers into a dedicated barrel. The above stickers prove that he has paid the freight.</p>
<p>If you still need it, you can take themselves. "People will take more than they can eat," he said. "In terms of food, Koreans like to fill a large table."</p>
<p>Mr. Li has to pay the price for this: about 2,800 won per 20 liters of kitchen, which is about RMB 15. The leftovers can fall into the barrels of the kitchen, and then pour it into a designated trash can outside. He will post a sticker purchased from the district government on the barrel -proves that he has paid the garbage clearance freight.</p>
<p>In the morning, the company hired by the district government cleared these trash cans. Park Jingsu and his team shuttled on the streets from 5 am, tore off the stickers on the trash can, and poured the inside into the truck.</p>
<p>At around 11 am, they arrived at Daofeng's processing plant, where the mud -like garbage was removed.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The residue -bones, seeds, shells -they are picked up by hand. (Daofeng's factory is one of the last factories that have not automated this step in the country.) The conveyor belt sent the waste into the grinding machine into small pieces. Anything that is not easy to chopped, such as plastic bags, will be filtered and burned.</p>
<p>Then bake and dehydrate the waste. Water enters the pipeline to the water treatment workshop, some of which are used to produce biogas. The rest were purified and discharged into the nearby stream.</p>
<p>After four hours of garbage from the team of Park Junzhu, the remaining wastes left by the processing plant were grinded into the final product: a dry brown powder, smelling like dirt. Shen Yunzhi, the manager of the facility, said that it can be used as a feed supplement for chickens and ducks, rich in protein and fiber, and gives it to any farm willing to receive.</p>
<p>In the factory, a strong smell is attached to the fabric and hair. But it was almost impossible to smell outside. The pipelines in the building will purify the gas with chemical methods, and then discharge from the exhaust device.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T04-56-27-08-00/00skorea-foodwaste-08-plkz-master1050.jpg" /></p>

<p>Other treatment plants have different ways to work. Among the biogas facilities in Gaoyang City, Seoul, food garbage — nearly 70,000 tons per year -is anaerobic digestion. Place the garbage in the large container for 35 days to allow the bacteria to play a role, decompose organic matter and produce biogas mainly composed of methane and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Biogas was sold to a local public institutional company, which is said to be heating for 3,000 households in Gaoyang. The remaining solid substances are mixed with wood chips to make fertilizers, and then distributed.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Researchers have found that every ton of food garbage rotten in the landfills will be discharged from greenhouse gases equivalent to 800 pounds of carbon dioxide. Li Changji, an engineer of Gaoyang Treatment Plant, said that transformation into biogas can reduce emissions by halving.</p>
<p>Critics pointed out that although South Korea's plans bring various benefits, it has not achieved one of its goals: let people waste food less. According to data from the Ministry of Environment, the amount of food discarded throughout the country has not changed for many years.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T04-56-27-08-00/00skorea-foodwaste-10-plkz-master1050.jpg" />The fertilizers produced by Gaoyang biological energy facilities were transported to a farm in Gaoyang.</p>

<p>There are other defects in the system. There are also intermittent complaints: residents in a village in Deyang District, Deyang District, Gaoyang City said that the smell of a processing plant was very unpleasant, so that they could not open the windows. Due to the protest of neighbors, the factory has been suspending since 2018.</p>
<p>"After the factory was closed, all problems disappeared," said Mo Songyun, a 68 -year -old resident of Deyang.</p>
<p>But most factories across the country -unlike their actually replaced garbage landfills -almost have no serious complaints from neighbors. Government officials said that steadily improving technology has contributed to cleaner and more efficient operations.</p>

<p>The Greek authorities announced the picture before the fishing boat covered</p>
<p><strong> A fishing boat carrying refugees overwhelmed the coast of the southern Greece and sank, causing at least 79 people to die. </strong></p>
<p>Greek officials said that more than a hundred people have been rescued, but hundreds of people are still missing.</p>
<p>The authorities said that this was one of Greece's most serious immigration tragedy, announcing three days of mourning in the country.</p>
<p>The fishing boat sank about 80 kilometers southwest of Pylos, and the Coast Defense Force previously said that the fishing boat refused to accept rescue.</p>
<p>The Coastal Defense Force stated that on Tuesday evening, the European border and the Coast Guard (Frostex) found the ship in the international waters, and no one on the ship wore a life jacket.</p>

<p>Soon after the ship was covered, it was completely sinking in just 10 to 15 minutes. The authorities launched search and rescue operations, but became difficult due to strong winds.</p>
<p>The support of the refugee hotline "Alarm Phone" said that the Coast Defense Force "had known the ship's adventure for several hours before sending any help", and said that the authorities had a problem with the fishing vessel "learned from different channels."</p>
<p>The organization added that immigrants on the ship may be afraid to face the Greek authorities because they know that the country's "terrible systems are used to deal with refugees."</p>

<p>It is believed that this fishing boat is from Libya to Italy, and most people on board are considered men in their 20s.</p>
<p>According to local media reports, they have sailed for a few days. Some reports said that on Tuesday afternoon, a Malta cargo ship with food and water was approaching the ship.</p>
<p>There are survivors that there are as many as 500 to 700 people on the ship. Yianniskarvelis, a local health department official, said that this is an unprecedented tragedy. "The number of people on the boat is far beyond the carrying capacity."</p>
<p>Captain coastal defense, Nikolaos Alexiou, told public television that his colleagues saw people crowded on the deck, and the ship sank in the deepest part of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The authorities have not announced the nationality of the victims. Survives were sent to Kalamata, and many people were sent to hospital for doctors due to low body temperature or minor injuries.</p>
<p>The Greek National Radio and Television Company reported that three people suspected of being a vendor were taken to Karamarta's central port department.</p>
<p>Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou visited some survivors and expressed sadness to the deceased.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Committee issued a statement on Wednesday (June 14) after a two -day monetary policy meeting, emphasizing that maintaining the federal fund interest rate target unchanged, which will enable the committee to evaluate more information. The rate drops to the target of 2%.</p>
<p>The China News Agency quoted the statement that the recent indicators showed that American economic activities continued to grow moderately. In recent months, employment has grown strongly, and the unemployment rate has remained low, but the inflation rate is still high. The American banking system is sound and tough. The tightening of the credit conditions of families and enterprises may cause pressure on economic activities, employment and inflation, and the degree of related impact is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The statement states that the Fed still pays attention to inflation risk. In order to achieve full employment and inflation targets, the Fed decided to maintain the level of federal fund interest rate targets at a level of 5%to 5.25%, so that the committee can evaluate more information and its impact on monetary policy. When determining additional policy tightening of inflation targets, the Fed will consider the accumulation of monetary policy, the impact of monetary policy on economic activities, and the development of economic and financial development. The Fed will continue to reduce the size of the balance sheet as planned.</p>
<p>The Fed also announced an economic forecast that has attracted much attention from the financial market. Compared with the summary of March, the Fed will increase the mid -value growth rate of this year's actual domestic product (GDP) this year's growth rate of 0.6 percentage points to 1%. 0.3 percentage points were adjusted to 3.9%. In the summary, the interest rate hike path shows that the federal fund interest rate will reach 5.6%by the end of 2023, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from before, implying that it may raise interest rates twice this year.</p>

Powell said that considering factors such as the lag of monetary policy on the economic impact and the potential adverse effects of credit tightening, Federal Reserve officials decided to suspend interest rate hikes. However, almost all officials who have the right to vote in monetary policy believe that it is still necessary to further raise interest rates.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal quoted analysts and said that the Federal Reserve hinted in the statement that it would be temporary at the current level. This is just a measure that officials to better manage interest rate hikes. The market response shows that investors have doubts about the operation logic of "suspending and raising interest rates", because it is not as direct as "continuously continuously raising interest rates and remained stable". Powell gave an explanation at a press conference, but his speech also showed that the current inflation is more stubborn than expected by officials.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that the Energy Department predicts that the growth of oil consumption in 2024 will be half of the first two years. With the promotion of electric vehicles, the market demand will be reduced in the next few years. IEA believes that in view of the increase in production capacity, the market will remain "sufficient supply" by 2028.</p>
<p>The Energy Department said: "The world's growth in oil demand will slow down and will basically stagnate in the next few years ... the transformation of the clean energy economy is accelerating, and global oil demand will be seen before 2030."</p>
<p>For the country, oil consumption countries have worked hard from fossil fuel to clean energy for many years, in order to limit greenhouse gas emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change. After Russia attacked Ukraine in early 2022, oil prices soared, and the idea of transformation was even stronger.</p>

<p>Both Washington and NATO call the Beixi explosion as "destructive behavior". Moscow has accused Western investigators of dragging, trying to cover up who is the real behind -the -scenes black hand.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the media in the United States and Germany had reported that investigations and intelligence showed that the explosion of Beixi II Pipeline last September <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体北溪爆炸事件有更多线索与乌克兰有关/a-65697137">may be related to the group of pro -Ukraine</a>Essence But the Ukrainian government and military intelligence officials said they did not participate in the attack and did not know who launched it.</p>

Last fall, Biden threatened again. If the crown prosecution violates the wishes of the United States in oil policies, it will suffer" consequences. "</p>
<p>In this kingdom with abundant oil reserves, Muhammad Crown Prince is the actual ruler. Republican Senator Linden Graham once called him a "damage" and "never the leader on the world stage." Jie Monanham, the head of the world's number one golf tour, once hinted that the player's betrayal of the competitors supported by Saudi Arabia was the betrayal of the "September 11" terrorist attacks (mostly the hijacker of the terrorist attack was Saudi citizen).</p>
<p>Now they sound like empty words.</p>

<p>In the eight years of the rise of power, the 37 -year -old Crown Prince Muhammad broke the predictions of people's ruling by the rule. The importance of repeatedly escaped the punishment that made it was isolated internationally.</p>
<p>Analysts and officials said that at the same time, the Crown Prince Muhammad not only strengthened the future of Saudi Arabia with continuous economic growth and increasing political influence as a confident regional country, but also learned lessons from his setbacks. Method of the goal.</p>

<p>In recent years, strong oil demand has filled the treasury of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia acquired a British Football Club, and hesitated to introduce Ronaldo to join the Saudi National League, and is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/sports/soccer/saudi-soccer-messi-benzema-ronaldo.html">strive to recruit other international stars</a>Essence</p>
<p>If the previously mentioned golf partnership reached, a close assistant of Crown Muhammad's Crown Prince will become one of the most influential people in the movement and provide another important platform for reshaping the international image for Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>In recent years, from Turkey to the United States, the heads of state, who had spurned the Crown Prince of Muhammad, accepted him as the future of Saudi Arabia. He also deepened the relationship between Saudi Arabia and China, and the latter has helped promote the two long -term regional competitors, Saudi Arabia and Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-reestablish-ties.html">Get diplomatic breakthrough</a>Essence</p>
<p>All this marks the major progress made by the young prince. In 2015, his father became the queen of the king. People generally regarded Prince Mohammed as a dangerous self -defeating person.</p>
<p>That year, he launched military intervention in Yemen, causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/middleeast/saudi-yemen-bomb-bus-children.html">a large number of civilian deaths</a>And fall into trouble.

<p>That may be his lowest point.</p>
<p>But in the past few years, Crown Muhammad has restored most of his reputation with the help of his country's considerable wealth and influence.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>He had crowded his opponents in the early days of power and consolidated his control over domestic. The social change he promoted, such as allowing women to drive, expanding people's entertainment choices in this country that once banned cinemas, etc., and won fans in Saudi young people.</p>
<p>He also knows that he can make long -term plans as the crown prince of the monarchy. He never needs to be re -elected. He has already dealt with the three US presidents, and he will experience several US presidents in the future, and he will always have power.</p>
<p>He finally recovered this incident from the Kashuji incident that Qian was doing well, and no matter how human rights were talked about, other interests were ultimately priority.</p>
<p>"Bay Arab countries think this is a joke," said the International Crisis Organization Middle East and North Africa Senior Advisor Dina Esanadiali when talking about human rights issues. "They do know their value to the Western world as a partner, as an energy producer, and a country with economic strength, so they said,‘ we can deal with this empty threat because it is only part of the relationship. ’”</p>
<p>After Kashuji was killed, Trump, then President of the United States, once firmly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/trump-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html">defended Crown Mohammed</a>Called Saudi Arabia's arms procurement is good for the United States.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T09-44-57-08-00/10saudi-evolution-add-hqlz-master1050.jpg" />A few months before Kashuji was killed in 2018, Trump, then President, met with Mohammed Bin Salman in the White House. Doug Mills/The New York Times</p>
<p>Senator from South Carolina, Graham, said after Kashuji was killed that Crown Mohammed Prince was not suitable for leading the country. But when he visited Saudi Arabia in April this year, Graham praised him. At that time, Graham thanked Saudi Arabia for buying American jet aircraft.</p>
<p>"You have purchased a $ 37 billion aircraft, which are manufactured in my state and my country. I think there are more in the future," Graham <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2288386/saudi-arabia">Al Arabiya TV station on Saudi Arabia</a>explain. "Therefore, as a US senator, I reserved the right to change their views."</p>

<p>The government of Turkish President Rejap Tidpei Erdogan leaked the details of Kashuji's killing to weaken the image of Mohammed's prince, but eventually put his dissatisfaction with the matter. Last year, a Turkish court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/middleeast/khashoggi-murder-trial-turkey-saudi-arabia.html">handed over to the case of killing Kashuji's murderer</a>Saudi Arabia ended the final case of accountability for crime. Soon after, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia helped support Turkey's finances to deposit $ 5 billion into the Central Bank of Turkey.</p>
<p>PGA has also made similar large changes.</p>
<p>In the past few months, Monasham Chairman of the American Professional Golf Tour has been criticizing Saudi Arabia, and even asked the players who considers the tour of the competitive relationship with PGA: "You have had to apologize for participating in the PGA Tour. ?"</p>
<p>In recent years, many factors affecting the decisions of Muhammad's princes are that more and more people in Saudi Arabia believe that the United States is no longer a reliable partner.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T09-44-57-08-00/10saudi-evolution-5-vwqz-master1050.jpg" />The PGA Tour and the Liv Golf League supported by Saudi Arabia reached an accident agreement, highlighting the power of money and influence of the Saudi kingdom on overcoming human rights issues. Doug Mills/The New Yorktimes</p>
<p>Crown Prince Muhammad has dealt with three US presidents from the Democratic and Republican Party, and these presidents want to reduce the participation of the United States in the Middle East. For Saudi Arabia, the risk of retreating in the United States became obvious in 2019. At that time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-refineries-drone-attack.html">Saudi oil facilities</a>It was attacked by drones and missiles, resulting in the suspension of about half of the country's output, and the United States accused Iran of planning to plan attacks.</p>
<p>President Trump refused to make a direct response, which made the leaders of Crown Muhammad and the leaders of the United Arab Emirates concluded that the United States no longer supports them, and they must pay attention to their national security.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"Now, an idea has been deeply engraved in their hearts:‘ We ca n’t expect Washington to protect us, so we must protect ourselves ’," said Estandiali, an international crisis organization. "This has caused them to adjust some aspects of foreign policy."</p>
<p>This also reduces the possibility of Saudi Arabia that promises the United States without thinking.</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine, Muhammad's Crown Prince not only refused to join the Western sanctions of President Putin, but later increased the import of Russian oil products that were lowered.</p>
<p>After Biden met with Crown Prince Mohammed in Saudi Arabia last July, the US government asked Saudi Arabia to hold oil output to help the United States reduce the price of domestic natural gas before the mid -November election. However, last October, Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with other member states organized by the Oil output country, known as "OPEC+" to reduce oil production in order to maintain the rise in oil prices.</p>
<p>This angered Biden, and the White House officials accused Saudi Arabia for violation of the agreement. A few months later, when the demand for oil was indeed reduced, Saudi Arabia insisted that they had the right way to resist political pressure and reduced production.</p>
<p>The "consequences" of Biden's threats have never been fulfilled, which clearly shows that even the United States believes that the economic relationship with Saudi Arabia is very important and cannot be interrupted.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T09-44-57-08-00/10saudi-evolution-2-hpmz-master1050.jpg" />The photos released by the Saudi Palace showed that last July, Crown Prince Muhammmed in Saudi Arabia Gada and President Bayeng punch. Bandar al-jaloud/saudi royalpalace, via associateed presus</p>
<p>In recent years, the crown prince has established a relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and entertained the latter at the China -A -Summit in December 2022. At that meeting, the two leaders discussed China's role in reducing Saudi Saudi conflict with Iran.</p>
<p>A few months later, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran achieved surprising diplomatic breakthroughs.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-reestablish-ties.html)Essence</p>
<p>This is a stone and two birds for Crown Prince Muhammad. By reaching an agreement, he not only reduced the possibility of conflicting conflicts with his main region, but also allowed world powers outside the United States to obtain major benefits in the reach of the agreement.</p>
<p>Saudi officials have stated that they are more willing to use the United States as the main ally, but the lack of the United States promised means that they need to expand the scope of the ally. And due to the tight relations with Tehran itself, the United States cannot promote Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T09-58-54-08-00/14china-abbas-tzbq-master1050.jpg" />On Wednesday, Xi Jinping, the highest leader of China, met with Mahamamd Abbas, chairman of the Palestinian national power agency in Beijing. Xi Jinping has worked hard to expand China's influence in the Middle East and make his country a replacement of American global foreign leadership.</p>
<p>Abbas's four -day visit began on Tuesday. Chinese officials have repeatedly hinted before Abbas's visit that China can play a role in restoring peace talks between Israel and Palestinian national power institutions. Chinese official media also strongly criticized the United States that failed to promote the reach of the Palestinian Heping Agreement.</p>
<p>According to Chinese official media reports, Xi Jinping proposed the "two -country plan" with three claims in order to resolve Pakistani conflict on Wednesday. This solution seems to be proposed by Xi Jinping in 2013 <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/china-unveils-peace-plan-based-on-1967-lines/">Scheme</a>In general, a breakthrough was not obtained at the time.</p>
<p>"You must return Palestine as soon as possible," said Xi Jinping according to the National News Agency Xinhua News Agency. "China is willing to play an active role in achieving internal reconciliation and promotion of peace talks for Pakistan."</p>

<p>In recent months, Xi Jinping has been working hard to improve his image as a global peaceful force, especially when China has taken the three years of "new crown and zero" self -isolated state, and seeks to regain its status on the world stage. Xi Jinping has ushered in many world leaders this year, including the leaders of France, Brazil and Iran. Beijing hints that it can be in <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230320/xi-jinping-china-putin-russia-war/">mediation ending the Ukrainian war</a>As the role, although Western leaders have always been skeptical of this statement.</p>
<p>China's largest diplomatic victory may contribute to the secret negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iran in March this year, resulting in the two countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-reestablish-ties.html">unexpectedly restored diplomatic relations</a>Analysts said that China's role can make Beijing the main force to participate in the Middle East affairs and challenge the long -term influence of the United States in the region.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem of solving the trick of Taka Pakistan is completely different from the mediation between Shay, because the latter is already seeking a tension relationship. And both China and Shay have close economic connections.</p>
<p>China has long been friendly with Palestinian leaders for a long time. Abbas's visit this week is his fifth visit to China as chairman of the Palestinian national power institution in nearly two decades. China often makes remarks to support the founding of Palestinian and support pro -Palestine in the United Nations. According to <a href="https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202306/content_6886283.htm">China Official Media Report</a>Xi Jinping told Abbas on Wednesday that China and Palestine are "good friends and good partners." The two also announced the establishment of a strategic partnership between the two sides.</p>
<p>But the relationship between China and Israel is not so firm. Due to the relationship with the United States, Israel is more cautious about letting China play a role in any negotiations. Israel has been under pressure from Washington and requires it to limit investment from China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-15T09-58-54-08-00/14china-abbas-kmbc-master1050.jpg" />This is the fifth time that Abbas has served as chairman of the Palestinian national power institution for nearly two decades. POOL Photo by Jade Gao</p>
<p>Analysts said that in this sense, the meeting between Xi Jinping and Abbas is not so much a step to solve the conflict. It is better to show that China intends to strengthen participation in Middle East affairs in the future.</p>
<p>"China should be very cautious. So many superpowers (long -term conflicts in the region) have spent resources, time, and energy," said Da Wei, a professor of international relations at Beijing Tsinghua University. "But I do believe that China wants to be more proactive in the Middle East and other regions."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>He continued, "We can say that this is a learning process in China: China is learning to become a big country in the region, or a big world. If you want to play a role on the world stage, the Middle East is obviously one of the regions."</p>
<p>Indeed, China has been widely strengthened to participate in Middle East affairs. Xi Jinping visited Saudi Arabia in December last year. China and Saudi Arabia have also been <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230613/saudi-china-investment-forum/">deepening investment relationship</a>Saudi officials have directly refuted that the increasing connection with Beijing may bring concerns to Saudi -American relations.</p>
<p>Chinese official media have talked about the possibility of making breakthroughs in the Bakin leadership. But in the Middle East, Xi Jinping's latest proposal did not bring much hope.</p>
<p>"In the context of the reconciliation wave of the Middle East, whether this visit will bring more dawn to the peace of the Middle East, it is also highly anticipated," the CCP's "Global Times" published on Tuesday <a href="https://opinion.huanqiu.com/article/4DIRMicsvqv">Social Review</a>Written. Social reviews also accused the United States of "a bad role in the Palestinian issue."</p>
<p>China has previously proposed to mediate between Isaibal, including 2013, 2017 and 2021. The three claims put forward by Xi Jinping on Wednesday are not much different from China's previous proposals, including "the establishment of an independent Palestinian country based on the 1967 boundary, the East Jerusalem as the capital, and enjoying the completely sovereignty", calling on the international community to increase Palestinan to Palestine The assistance, as well as the "larger, more authoritative and influential international peace conference" to promote negotiations, but did not provide specific details.</p>
<p>The Palestinian peace negotiations have ruptured in 2014, and the possibility of resumed negotiations in the near future seems very small, no matter whether there is Chinese participation. Both the Israelites and the Palestinians have serious differences and cannot reach a consensus on how to deal with conflicts within themselves, let alone find something in common with each other. The current government of Israel is the rightist ever. Few members of their members support Palestine's sovereignty position, and China's participation is unlikely to change this.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>However, Robert Mogelnitzki, a senior resident scholar in the Gulf of the Gulf of Washington and the Middle East, said that China plays a role in promoting Saudi Iranian resumptions and China is growing around the world. The status has changed the possibility of participating in the Pakistani issue. China ’s past participation in the region was mainly economical. He said that now, China is sending a signal that it is“ rising ”from that level of support.</p>

The UN Meteorological Conference at Bon's closing on Thursday did not achieve any substantial progress. Kaize told the German News Agency: "Russia -Ukraine War, Sino -US tension relations and other geopolitical topics were shadowed by related negotiations. Originally, it was expected that developed countries could play a role in promoting negotiations, but this hope is also endless." He said that before the Dubai meeting, the situation would be changed, "but the Bonn conference did not laid a good foundation."</p>
<p>Environmental Organization "Green and Peace" is responsible for Martinkaiser, and the UN Meteorological Conference on Bonn's closing on Thursday did not achieve any substantial progress. Kay said that Dubai Global Climate Conference Chairman and Emirates Minister Sultan AhmedalJaber personally came to Bon to attend the meeting, at least it can explain the attention of his climate protection. "But some of his expressions in Bon also make us very concerned. For example, he only said that he did not mention the exit of fossil energy, but only talked about how to reduce the exhaust emissions of fossil energy." Kaize said that to make the earth's temperature rise, he wants to rise the heating of the earth. Without 1.5 degrees Celsius before industrialization, it is the only choice to completely withdraw from fossil energy.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Papua New Guinea Asia Parliament began to review the complete text of the agreement on Wednesday (June 14). The agreement is signed in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/与美签订防务协议-巴新称不会被用作发动战争的基地/a-65708543">May this year</a>After that, some details have not been made public.</p>
<p>The agreement allows the United States to stop at the 6th ports and airports in Pakistan and stop the warships, including some facilities of the Lombrum Naval Base on the island of Manus and Portmoresby in the capital.</p>
<p>U.S. military personnel will be able to enter these places "unimpeded", "pre -deploy equipment, supplies and materials", and have "exclusive use rights" to some areas of the base, where can be developed and "building activities".</p>
<p>As the competitive furniture in Washington and Beijing, this agreement opened the door for Washington to build a new military existence in the Western Pacific region. The right to use the Rond Bloom Air Force Base can be used by the U.S. military to strengthen the military facilities in the northern Guam, which may play a key role when the conflict of the Taiwan Strait broke out.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T10-07-00Z/65722000_401.jpg" />On May 22, 2023, U.S. Secretary of State Brosky (left) signed a security agreement with Pakistan Prime Minister Malape</p>
<p>In Pakistan, facing the wave of criticism and protests, Prime Minister JamesMarape had to defend the agreement with the United States. Some opponents questioned whether this agreement would allow Papua New Guinea to make their sovereignty.</p>
<p>Malape said in a Parliament on Wednesday: "In the past 48 years, we see that our army is increasingly declining." He said, "sovereignty must be based on the stability and strength of the army."</p>
<p>In the country's protest last month, demonstrators accused the agreement of the strategic competition that could be involved in the United States and China. Marlape emphasized at the time that Papua New Guinea would not be used as a base for "launching war".</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has rich natural resources and is close to busy shipping routes. In recent years, the country has increasingly discovered that it is in the center of diplomatic wrestling between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Petero'Neill said the agreement pushed Papua New Guinea to the public. "The United States does this to protect our national interests. We all know what is happening in our region in geopolitics."</p>

<p>However, after Australia prevented Russia from failing to build a new embassy, it passed the new law today to block the construction of the new Russian embassy.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that after the meeting with the National Security Commission (National SecurityCommittee), the bill was quickly formulated.</p>
<p>He told reporters: "The government has received very clear security suggestions, which is related to Russia's risks for new embassies in a place near the Capitol. Museum. "</p>
<p>A Russian diplomat told AFP that after Australia passed the bill, Russia's "embassy is seeking legal advice."</p>
<p>The new law passed by Australia with the support of the two parties did not prohibit Russia from setting up foreign museums in Australia, but the position of the embassy should not be too close to Congress.</p>
<p>The bill also admits that Russia may be eligible for economic compensation.</p>
<p>Anti -intelligence expert and former FBI agent (FBI) agent Dennis Desmond said that it can reasonably suspect that Russia will use the embassy in the plan as a base to monitor Australian politicians.</p>
<p>He told AFP: "There is obviously clear intentions behind the decision -making of the Embassy ... they will use various technologies and means."</p>
<p>Dismond said this may include signal intelligence and monitoring Australian officials.</p>
<p>Former British diplomats and Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Alexbristow, deputy director of the national security department, pointed out that the Australian government may receive strong warnings from intelligence units.</p>
<p>He pointed out that because the location is quite close, the Russian embassy may operate in some form of electronic monitoring.</p>
<p>Steli said that Russia has the largest, most powerful, most aggressive and most uncontrollable intelligence units in the world.</p>
<p>"They enjoy the authority we will give to Western intelligence units."</p>
<p>Anganis said he expected Russia to have some form of counterattack.</p>
<p>He said: "We don't think Russia is eligible to talk about international law, because they invade Ukraine, that is, they always despise international law."</p>
<p>In 2008, Russia signed a contract with the National Capital Authority with the Australian Capital Authority, and obtained a construction license in 2011.</p>
<p>Russia intends to relocate the embassy from the current huge brick buildings to the new site. The current Russian embassy is located in the old urban area. Looking down, you can see a funeral home, a bar and a gas station.</p>
<p>The Australian government originally had no opinion on the construction of the new embassy in Russia, but after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia caused the relationship between the two parties, it was urgent to stop the Russian embassy plan.</p>
<p>The Australian government had previously tried to cancel the lease, but was rejected by the federal court last month, which caused this national security legislation.</p>

<p><strong> 1. "Brainwashing: China and the World in the Mao Zedong and the Houmao era" academic seminar of academic seminars and backgrounds </strong></p>
<p>From May 29th to June 1st, 2023, the academic seminar entitled "Badels: China and the World in the Mao Zedong and the Houmao era" was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Research Foundation, the East Asian Library of the University of Washington, and the California Modern China Research Center were co -sponsored. More than 20 scholars and experts participated. The meeting was successful, and fully research discussions and arguments were launched around the topic of brainwashing.</p>
<p><strong><em>*</em> </strong><strong> </strong> The original intention of holding a "brainwashing" seminar: the theoretical and realistic mobility **</p>
<p>At present, the special historical situation of China and the international community has perfection of totalitarianism and trapped inside and outside. One of the two strokes -brainwashing has become the most critical element for maintaining totalitarian power. In this way, the research and disclosure of brainwashing has become one of the most urgent topics of the Chinese and the world.</p>
<p><strong> 2 </strong> <strong>) Overview of the participating scholars </strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong> 2. Basic content and results of the Symposium on Brandiat </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>*</em> </strong> Looking back brainwashing: source and their spiritual traceability **</p>
<p>In the opening speech, Professor Lin Peiri talked about the general schizophrenia and multiple conscious structures of people in this brainwashing society in China, and put forward his interesting observation of Chinese -style "brainwashing" and "mouth washing".</p>
<p>Professor Xia Ming's "Study of Braastin's theoretical Research: Beginning, Flowing, and New Perspective" summarizes the evolution of brainwashing in history, especially nearly a century, and can summarize three different modes: 1. Classical brainwashing: From ancient times and the Middle Ages, we They all see the use of violence and torture to achieve the purpose of changing people's thoughts and beliefs. This method can still see residues (such as the Chinese government's persecution of objections, brainwashing in Xinjiang and Tibet). 2. Modern brainwashing: mainly through controlling people's environment (far away from family loved ones, closed, concentration camps, learning groups, social mobilization, publicity, monitoring, etc.) to change people's psychology, personality and behavioral model, forcing individuals or groups to obey and accept it Perfectist thought or totalitarian system. 3. In the 21st century, information science, computer technology, brain neuroscience, biomedical chemistry and other breakthroughs brought about brainwashing brought about by breakthroughs. The CCP tries to output its high -tech totalitism model to brainwashing the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhou Zehao is the translator of Edward Hunter's famous monograph "Red China: Planning Destruction of Man's Thoughts". The author of the book first mentioned "brainwashing" in the newspaper in 1950 The new word and the first time the word "brainwashing" is enabled in the book. Dr. Zhou pointed out that Hunter's unique contribution was to establish a direct relationship between brainwashing and communist red regime.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Kuide's "Fairness: Tracking of a History of Thought" discussed the definition of brainwashing and its spiritual origin from the perspective of political philosophy and the history of thought, and pointed out that the word "brainwashing" was short long after the origin of the word origin, and it originated from the communist. China. However, the spiritual and ideological origin of "brainwashing" can be traced far. In addition to Marx, he mainly sorted out the influence of German philosopher Nietzsche, the cultural hegemony theory of the cultural hegemony of the Italian philosopher Grandisi, and the "powerism" of French philosopher Foucault on brainwashing.</p>
<p>He pointed out that there is a tendency to contemplate all human discourse exchanges as "brainwashing". This tendency has regarded all language and words as "brainwashing". This kind of pan -washingism will annihilate the differences between right and wrong, good, evil, authenticity, etc., causing a world of chaotic value, the world of "1984".</p>
<p>From the perspective of the basic context, strictly speaking, brainwashing is a special product of the twentieth century, and is a product of a highly closed totalitarian society supported by violence. The open society with freedom of thought and freedom is a brainwashing disinfection agent.</p>
<p><strong><em>*</em> </strong><strong> </strong> "Basic brainwashing" in practice in the political movement of the Communist Party of China **</p>
<p>This session mainly discussed the practice of the CCP's stages of brainwashing: the Yan'an period, the intellectual transformation of the intellectuals in the early stages of the establishment of the government, the anti -rightist movement in 1957, the 1958 movement of the party, the Cultural Revolution, and so on.</p>
<p>Dr. Pei Yi's "from" baptism "to" brainwashing "-the historical positioning of Yan'an's rectification" specifically discussed the evolution of Yan'an's rectification brainwashing.</p>
<p>Professor Song Yongyi did the brainwashing of intellectuals in the "Ideological Transformation Movement"? "Report, this is a chapter in his monograph" Mao Zedong and New China ". He believes that the CCP's policy of intellectuals," transformation "should be one of its most basic policies, with its trilogy: 1) Infiltrating the political learning of Marxism-Leninism; 2) Criticism in the masses in the masses-review-explanation; 3) sports-type everyone's frankness and organizational cleanup.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Chinese Communist Party, a famous Chinese liberal intellectuals appeared in the first tide of self -examination of self -examination of self -examination of self -examination of Zhu Guangqian, Chen Yuan, Feng Youlan, Fei Xiaotong and others. The cause of this phenomenon is that intellectuals mistakenly believe that the CCP's military victory is the attitude of "uncomfortable and faith" of the victory of ideas, and there is also a strong pursuit of traditional Chinese tradition when changing the dynasties.</p>
<p>Professor Li Xixi gave a speech on "Belief and Resistance: The Christian Three -Self Patriotic Movement of the Mao Zedong period". Professor Li's speech provides a very convincing answer for many people's minds. Why is it in other fields in China, why is the Christian's resistance specially determined? Faith in the rock -like resistance in the anti -brain washing.</p>
<p>The report of "conscious brainwashing: the 1958 movement of the party in 1958" reported by Dr. Ding Shu solved the inside of the 1958 intellectual circles in China. In a sense, Dr. Ding can be said to fill the gap in the academic community.</p>
<p><strong> 3 </strong> <strong>) </strong> <strong> Sead monitoring and brainwashing </strong></p>
<p>This session mainly discusses some basic methods of brainwashing the CCP.Professor Wu Guoguang of Stanford in his speech in his "Strategy to Cognitive Wars: Analysis of the CCP's Publicity", divided into three different stages of the historical development of the Communist Party's propaganda strategy in the three different stages of the CCP's propaganda strategy in his usual fun and humorous way. They are the so -called Xi Jinping eras formed in the Mao era, post -Mao era, and the past decade. That is, the brainwashing of the Mao era, the exquisite propaganda of the post -Mao era, and the cognitive war in the Xi Jinping era. He discussed the characteristics and commonality of the CCP's propaganda at the above stages, and outlined a historical evolution map of the CCP's propaganda strategy, and analyzed the motivation of this evolution and the unchanged context behind it.</p>
<p>Pei Minxin, a lecturer professor from the McKenner College of Clemundy, "dissecting the CCP's monitoring system" with rigorous methods.</p>
<p><strong> 4 </strong> <strong>) totalitarian and brainwashing under international vision </strong></p>
<p>This session carried out a review of brainwashing internationally internationally.</p>
<p>Professor Cheng Yinghong, who is famous for studying international left -wing forces and his trend of thought, has made a refreshing research on "New Fascist and Newcomers: Discussing a New Perspective of Thoughts".</p>
<p>Professor Zhang Weichi and Professor Quan Zhize depicted and analyzed the young dictator of North Korea at the seminar "the idolized Kim Jong -un", let us see the other side of the Jin family dynasty.</p>
<p>Professor Guo Jian of the University of Wisconsin said with his unique vision, "conspiracy theory and awakening culture: American bipolar politics with different ways to return", sharply pointed out that the phenomenon of a certain way of the right and extremely left politics in the American society, and pointed out that it has to the world to the world harm.</p>
<p>The independent scholar Ms. Guo Yiping put forward her point of view with "an important role in" ideological factors in the failure of Russia's democratic transformation after the Soviet Union ", which caused some useful controversy.</p>
<p><strong> 5 </strong> <strong>) From Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping: The new development of the CCP "brainwashing" </strong></p>
<p>This link discusses the evolution of CCP brainwashing from all fields and periods. There are not only senior professors and editors, but also scholars who are directly persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party of China to appear to tell and analyze the brainwashing methods of the CCP prison for political prisoners.</p>
<p>Dr. Qiao Huahua analyzed the CCP's "brainwashing, propaganda and movies: the perspective of communication and text mining" as a publisher.</p>
<p>Professor Hao Zhidong shared his historical narrative "The Change of the Brandiating Methods of Primary and Secondary School Textbooks after 1949".</p>
<p>Professor Xu Yan, the popular enlightenment writer and free thinker inside and outside the Chinese mainland, gave a speech on "expert propaganda and brainwashing in the truth society in China".</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zili, a political prisoner of the Communist Party of China and one of the four gentlemen of the "New Youth", made a report on "Labor Reform: The Chinese Communist Prison's Brandiating Project for Prisoners", which is sighing.</p>
<p>The meeting also invited two special guests to give a special speech. They are Professor Yu Maochun, a professor at the American Naval Academy and the director of the China Center of the Hudson Institute, and Mr. Hu Ping, the editor -in -chief of Beijing's honor.</p>
<p><strong> 6) Professor Yu Maochun gave the keynote speech on "International Foreign Diplomacy Publicity" </strong></p>
<p>Because he was the chief Chinese policy and planning consultant of former US Secretary of State Peng Peio, his speech aroused widespread interest in participants, and at the same time gave the participants a sense of liveness in the evolution of US -China relations. People are particularly interested, for example, he pointed out:</p>
<p>The Chinese government pays a lot of money and allows a research center of Harvard University to do so -called polls in China. This poll was seriously summarized and said that 93%of the Chinese people recognized and supported the leadership of the Communist Party. The poll of this Harvard University has become an attachment for the Chinese government to confuse the Chinese people and the people of the world for many years. It is often cited by the CCP ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the party’ s public opinion and emphasized it. In fact, this is a classic example of deceiving the world. The so -called polls made by this Harvard University research center are not made by themselves. The truth is that this Harvard University Research Center, who has donated many Chinese donations, commissioned to register in China, and the "Zero Research Consultation Group" headquartered in Beijing(Horizon Research Consultancy Group)Capturing the sword to do it on behalf of.</p>
<p>He also gave a lot of examples disclosure and said:</p>
<p>II China uses translation to transform the world in international exchanges. This is a very complicated issue and a very important issue. The CCP training translator has systematic and strong policy guidance. It is definitely not just learning the language translation skills of "Cindaa". All the regular translators of the Communist Party of China I have contacted have a very strong party spirit, and they can grasp the size of the policy during the translation process. Just missed or turned naked.</p>
<p>..............</p>
<p><strong> 7 </strong> <strong>) </strong> <strong> Mr. Hu Ping, the famous democratic movement theorist, did "from 'thought transformation </strong> <strong>' </strong> <strong> to </strong> <strong> '</strong> <strong> </strong> '"<strong>** The keynote speech </strong></p>
<p>Hu Ping pointed out: The CCP's ideological transformation movement is "brainwashing", that is, "people's domestication". From a certain perspective, the history of the rise and fall of the Communist Party is the history of domestication, avoiding and rebellion. Brainwashing, with the words of Xi Jinping today, is called "not to be discussed." Today, the set of thought transformation has already been abandoned, but political learning has been reinforced, and personal worship is re -burns. The most important point of ordering the Chinese people to order the Chinese people is "not allowed to discuss". This is a vein with the ideological transformation of that year.</p>
<p><strong> Three, conclusion </strong></p>
<p><strong>*</strong> The academic seminar of this "Badding" theoretically confirmed that the theory of "brainwashing" can be used as an important tool for studying Chinese issues. * The meeting carried out historical review and in -depth analysis of the Communist Party of China as a patent brainwashing political movement. * The meeting issued a solemn warning message on the "brainwashing" to the past and the dangers of the world and the future.</p>

<p>Tan Yitong said that China ’s two thousand years of government, Qin Zheng also. The so -called Qin Zheng includes at least two aspects: the emperor's dictatorship is centralized with the central government. The Communist Red Dynasty claimed to be anti -feudal, but inherited the whole of the two. In the past, Beijing was an emperor's capital; now, Beijing is the center of power of the Communist Party. In his later years, Mao Zedong said to Nixon, who visited: "I can't change the whole world, I just change several places near Beijing." In contemporary China, Beijing centralism The root is deep and solid, and Beijing draws various resources in China for the ruling class that has been in this way. The discussion on the capital Beijing has also become a discussion about the whole China.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that even the opposition's exposition follows the principles of Beijing's centralism. For example, for a long time, the writing of the 1989 Democratic Games has always been centered on Beijing and deliberately ignored other provinces and cities. This movement is called the Tiananmen Movement, but in fact, this is a democratic movement that swept across the country. Tiananmen is a key place, but it is by no means full. Australian scholar Lin Mulian revealed another massacre that happened in the Jinjiang Hotel in Chengdu in the book "Return to Tiananmen". I grew up in Chengdu for the first time. I actually knew the truth for the first time. It can be seen how "the local" people are actually "leaving the ground."</p>
<p>The 89th Democratic movement should be a national puzzle, and participants in each place have the responsibility to fight for their own mosaic. The memoir of Nanjing student leader Wu Jianmin, "There are Traces of the Years", and put on the key part of the Nanjing Academic Games. Wu Jianmin was born in a senior officer family and worked as a soldier. He worked in Nanqi Group. In 1989, he was about to graduate from the Jiangsu Business Cadres Management College. After the outbreak of the school movement, he devoted himself to it. Essence Compared with most of the undergraduates who are admitted to university directly from high school, he was 26 years old at the time. He had rich work experience and social experience, courageous and conspiracy, good words, and organizational management. Become one of the leaders of Nanjing.</p>
<p>The number of universities in Nanjing and the scale of students in schools ranked third in the country, second only to Beijing and Shanghai. In this memoir, Wu Jianmin described the process and characteristics of the Nanjing Academic Games in detail. Compared with the Beijing Student Games, he has both common and characteristics. Nanjing University is dominated by Nanjing University, and quickly imitates Beijing to set up a headquarters "Nanjing High School Student Autonomous Federation", which commands the Nanjing District Studies. It can't be added, this is impossible in the Beijing academic movement. Under the South Gao Lian, the "Department of Staff" was established, and the "Department of Staff" brings together the backbone of each school to deal with daily affairs every day.</p>
<p>During the school movement, Wu Jianmin proposed the idea of "North on the North". He believes that Nanjing, as the old capital of the Republic of China, has democratic blood, and Nanjing's academic movement leads in cities in the south, so it cannot be satisfied with one city and one place. Students in Hebei and Tianjin mobilized, growing like snowballs. When this team came to Beijing, it was conditional to form a "National University Student Autonomous Federation" in Beijing, and then dialogue with the CCP authorities as the "Full High Union" instead of the "North High Union".</p>
<p>On June 1, 1989, Nanjing students formed the "Nanjing University to go north to the Democratic Long March", departing from Gulou Square, and went to Beijing on foot. Wu Jianmin served as the deputy chief of the "North to Headquarters". The team of thousands of people broke through the siege all the way. On June 3, they arrived at the Luzhou Division of Anhui to collect and rest. On the morning of June 4th, the team was about to set off, and it was raining in the sky, and had to wait. They did not know that a massacre had occurred in Beijing. This sudden heavy rain seemed to be a mourning person who was mourning. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces sent a large number of passenger cars in front of the team, and there are many armed policemen with real guns. Yang Yongyi, executive deputy governor and director of the Education Commission of Jiangsu Province, told Wu Jianmin that Beijing had cleared the field. The armed police at the scene would prevent students from advancing. Wu Jianmin and other personnel of the headquarters were controlled, and most of the students were pushed to Nanjing. A small number of pioneers rode to Zhangbaoling Town, and were intercepted by armed militia, and threatened: "Go forward and shoot!" In the end, the end of the "June 4th North" came to Zhangba Ling Town.</p>
<p><strong> The struggle after the massacre is even more to sing and cry </strong></p>
<p>After being taken home, Wu Jianmin was placed under house arrest for a week and returned to school. On June 20, the Nanjing Public Security Bureau released the "Nanjing High Union Wanted List", ranking among them. Officials of the School Defender took him to the Public Security Bureau. Subsequently, Dean Wang Wang, a school with conscience and bones, released his bail and asked him to take the graduation exam. However, the superior order to deduct his graduation certificate and ask him to go to the "Inspection Office" to explain the problem every day.</p>
<p>At that time, Wu Jianmin and other Nanjing student leaders heard that Hong Kong had a "yellow bird action", but he refused to exile overseas and was extremely disappointed with Fang Lingzhizhi who had escaped into the American embassy. Run away!... What do we do? Can we also run? Can we run thousands of students who participated in the June 4th academic tide? "He said:" I am opposed to escape!When he was in trouble, he chose to flee abroad!"He said with generously to my colleagues:" I am willing to give youth and blood, compared to those who have died in Tiananmen Square, we blame without loan, and we should stay and persist!"</p>
<p>Subsequently, Wu Jianmin launched a journal, establishing organizations, and improving the "post -June and Fourth Age" resistance agencies. He met the people sent by the Hong Kong Branch Association in Shanghai, Zhaoqing and other places, and the other party brought capital funding. Twenty years later, Wu Jianmin was in exile in the United States. He originally planned to thank the Hong Kong Federation to the Branch Association. The situation in Hong Kong was under the rivers and rivers.</p>
<p>At this time, Wu Jianmin, after the "June 4th" massacre, has completely seen the evil of the Communist Party of China, and has a clear political goal -overthrowing the Communist Party of China, ending the Chinese Communist Party's one -party autocracy, and recovering the justice of the "June 4th" dead. The Chinese people strive for free liberation to achieve a fair and free democratic election of one person, one vote, and the people of 1.4 billion people to live a dignified life.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1990, Wu Jianmin met the leaders of the major academic movements of several universities in Nanjing in Zhongting Street, Drum Tower Street, and exchanged the idea of establishing an organization. They discussed the establishment of the "China Democratic Frontline" and set up the highest standing committee. Wu Jianmin was elected as the chairman. The vice chairman was Peng Wanzhong and Li Yong. Wait, most of them are students or young teachers. These resistances are not known to the outside world.In the past, due to limited information, I wrote a criticism that the CCP's gunfire sounded, and the resistance of the resistance was dying. It was not as brutal of the killing of the military and political power in the Gwangzhou incident in the Gwangzhou incident. The struggle has always been one after another, and the Korean people seem to be more bloody than the Chinese. But then when I read the memories and memoirs of Liao Yifu, Liu Xianbin, Wu Jianmin and others, I revised my own views -China is not without Lu Xun's "hard -working person, desperately hard -working people, for the people, for the people The person who invited him, the person who seeks the law "is just that they" are always destroyed, wiped out, eliminated in the darkness, and cannot be known for everyone. " Even in the darkest era of the Cultural Revolution, Yang Xiaokai also came into jail that various bravers who resisted the tyranny of various groups, but they were all slaughtered. China failed to achieve democratization like South Korea, not because the Chinese were more timid than Koreans, but because the Chinese Communist regime was thousands of times more brutal than South Korea's military and political power. Resisting the CCP's tyranny requires unprecedented courage, wisdom, and toughness.</p>
<p><strong> The length of his sentence, more than twenty -one leader of the North High Federation of the Northern High School, </strong></p>
<p>Wu Jianmin and others underestimated the evil of the Communist Party and the darkness of human nature. Their every move had been closely monitored by the CCP's national security department. A few months later, the national security department closed the net, and he and his colleagues were arrested. Many years later, he returned from prison and knew that their organization had long been penetrated by the CCP. Wu Wei, a female classmate who went to the Federation of the Federation of the Federation of the Federation of the Federation of Federations, provided several action details that they only knew. After he was released from prison, he lived in China for eighteen years. During this time, he slowly recovered with members of the South Gao Lian. Only Wu Wei had never appeared. Another female classmate Luo Mingjuan, a female classmate who entered the core circle of the underground organization, was responsible for opening up hundreds of thousands of funds that were transferred to the Hong Kong Branch Federation. Fly. After Wu Jianmin was released from prison, Luo Mingjuan successfully completed his studies at NTU, and then went to work at the Guoan Department of Guangxi. He suddenly realized that this girl was originally an undercover that the authorities were inserted by them. Wu Jianmin also believes that the only list of Nanjing student leaders in the only list of the national wanted order and the future in the United States is also the same type. The Chinese Communist Party started by underground activities and secret organizations. What these simple and naive students do are as naive as family.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the Guoan Department attempted to trick Wu Jianmin as a line person, contacted the staff of the Hong Kong Federation to meet in the Mainland, and then played the Internet in the future, but was rejected by Wu Jianmin's strict words. The authorities will not be able to cooperate with Wu Jianmin for ten years, and his sentence is longer than the 21st student leaders in the country. Jiang Zemin re -sentenced the leader of the "June 4th" academic movement as the attitude of the provincial stations. Following Jiang Zemin's province, he naturally contributed to the central government, and he was sentenced to a heavy judgment of the leaders of the local academic movement, and the treatment of the prisoners in prison was even worse. Liu Xiaobo, who was detained in Qincheng Prison that year, later sighed after reading the memories of Liao Yiwu in the prison in Sichuan that Liao Yifu's prison was like hell. Compared with him, he was like heaven in Beijing prison.</p>
<p>In the memoir, Wu Jianmin described in detail his career from the detention to the prison. He was "half -step" and was detained alone in a room with a long length and width of only three meters. Four hours are shining. He has been tortured by Guoan personnel, prison guards, and prison prison many times torture. He said: "The only way I can protect myself is not afraid of fighting!" In the circle, there are six wolves around each other. As soon as the guard red flag waved, the six -headed wolf dog rushed up. The prisoner hugged his head and screamed on the ground. The prison guards severely warned: "You don't obey the discipline, it's your turn next time!" Wu Jianmin was almost scared to pass. He wrote: "This time, the execution experience made me directly feel that in the bloody history of the Communist Party of China, Many occurrences, how many ordinary prisoners have been brought out of watching, and watching the bloody scenes of other prisoners being shot!I don't know, which regime can there be in ancient and modern China and foreign countries. The scene gave me a lot of excitement, so that after many years, I often dream of this scene in my dream. "He heard in prison that some prisoners were picked up after being successfully matched. His old military doctor's father quietly told him One way allows him to exceed the blood content of the urine during physical examination, which escaped the list of organ transplantation.</p>
<p>Soon after Wu Jianmin was arrested, Baker, then US Secretary of State, visited China and made a request to release political prisoners to the Chinese side. The Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who talks with it, wrote in the memoir: "There is' Wu Jianmin 'in the list, and I told Baker that the director of our news director was Wu Jianmin, and at this time, Wu Jianmin replied:' '' Here. 'Beck saw this, and the response was still sensitive, and immediately said: "You let it go.' It caused laughter." From then on, it can be seen that China's "war wolf diplomacy" did not appear in recent years. Qian Qichen A rogue of a sister -in -law, pretending to be stupid, Li Daitao is stiff, not ashamed, but also writing the details into the book. Visiting China in the name of Big Bush must not be investigated with China to restore business relations with China. Twenty years later, Beck met with exiled Wu Jianmin in the United States. At first he had really concerned about the political prisoners on the list of Wu Jianmin, but they were subject to the US foreign policy of China. In the end, I was ignored.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, due to China's "low human rights advantages" of hundreds of millions of slave workers (in today's statement is "leek" and "human mine") and huge markets, the West couldn't wait to turn the "June 4th" chapter of the "June 4th" chapter , Incorporate China into the economic globalization system. In this context, the Chinese Communist regime has restored self -confidence. Scholars Bai Xin commented: "The Chinese government played with the human rights politics of the market with the most beneficiary of the United States in the 1990s with the US Congress's annual most benefited country. The liability of the massacre also evades the real human rights responsibility, and has caused Chinese liberal intellectuals to not yet break through the hallucinations of Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up in the 1980s. "</p>
<p><strong> Opposition to the Communist Party of China at one time, all my life opposes the CCP </strong></p>
<p>In 1997, Wu Jianmin was released in advance. Nanjing Guoan did not allow him to work and live in Nanjing where the household registration is located, and he had to go to Wuxi to do business.</p>
<p>Since the end of 1999, Wu Jianmin has made a success in business. The advertising company created has more than 200 employees and ranks in the top three in the local area, but his company cannot go to bank loans -he and his company have already been blacklisted. Essence Political prisoners like him can only be small -scale, and can only be "small rich". If the enterprise is developing, it will be stared and removed. He became rich. In the society, he was a head -of -the -faceted company, and he was the secretary -general of the local chamber of commerce. However, the label of the "June 4th" was affixed to him for a lifetime. At first he started to fall in love, and his girlfriend's family was intimidated by Guoan. He and the first girlfriend came to the marriage stage. His girlfriend's father was a senior work and forced him to write a guarantee that he never participated in political activities. He refused to make unreasonable demands, and the marriage was blown.Although there is money, Wu Jianmin still lacks a sense of security and dignity. His passport was buckled in his hand by Guoan. He wanted to go abroad to discuss business, and Guoan sent people to accompany him. Later, he organized the owner of the community to defend his rights and fight against the large state -owned enterprise Suhao Group and China Resources Group. This rights protection activity does not involve political demands, but only defend the owners' economic interests, and finally win. But in the process, his outstanding organizational management can once again attract the vigilance of the CCP authorities. If the director of the owner committee like Wu Jianmin is the call of the grassroots political movement, the power of the CCP will inevitably be challenged. This is also the fundamental reason why the CCP has suppressed the owner's rights protection campaign later.</p>
<p>Wu Jianmin always missed the "June 4th" and always wanted to continue doing something. When Xi Jinping first came to power, there was an optimistic atmosphere in China. He and his friends felt that he could open a breakthrough for the "June 4th" name by holding a large -scale commemorative Zhao Ziyang's activity. However, in 2014, the former leader Yu Shiwen and his wife Chen Wei were arrested by Zhao Ziyang on the Yellow River embankment. As a result, Wu Jianmin concluded: Xi Jinping is a dictator, like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and is the enemy of democracy. As Salito said: "Democracy is a non -personal dictatorship, an accurate comparison word for personal dictatorship, and an undoubted opposition. Words. This means that democracy refers to a political system characterized by an individual with the power to oppose personalization and the power to oppose the rule of citizens. Power is not the 'property' of anyone. Yes: No one can name themselves as the rulers, and no one can control the power in the name of personal names. It is because of the principle of negating the principle of personal dictatorship that democratic criteria can only be granted by others to others. Yes, it can only be based on the change. Therefore, the leader must be produced from the free and unrestrained elections that the leaders. "In the past century, China's anti -democratic essence has never changed. It must be anti -communist.</p>
<p>In 2014, a small job of Wu Jianmin sent him a warning at the central government: his name appeared on an important blacklist. Later, most of the people on this list were arrested in the "709". A few months before "709", Wu Jianmin was exiled to the United States with his wife and twin children. In this free place in the United States, he created a self -media named "Jianmin Push the Wall". "Talking every day", similar to Ran Yunfei's "one -day blog", has done more than 2,000 episodes, breaking through the CCP network network The road blockade attracts hundreds of thousands of domestic and foreign audiences, and almost fights against the brainwashing propaganda of Xinhua News Agency and CCTV with the power of one person. From the "June 4th" square to self -media, the way of resistance "evolved", but his belief in democracy and freedom was consistently one.</p>

The analysis pointed out that China has a series of wrong decisions to crack down on private enterprises and foreign investment, and employment opportunities have been greatly reduced. Within three to five years, social problems will emerge one by one.</p>

Many of the students did not really enter the labor market in the school. More than 26 million of them have found a job.</p>

It is the college entrance examination since Mao Zedong's death. The "most", graduation is unemployed, and the unemployment rate also creates the "most" of history. The other is the "most" of the younger generation lying flat.</p>
<p>Chen Poong: "Three of the three -the most 'plus, meaning so many candidates, when you can't find a job after graduating from college, why do you have to go to the exam? Do you not go to the college entrance examination, can you still be employed? Evilization, reduction of orders, and less opportunities for employment. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T11-04-00-04-00/000002.png" />Current political critic Chen Po Kong believes that most Chinese companies are more cold in winter than the cold winter(Screenshot)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm-06152023101737.html/967378347a7a.jpg"> <img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T11-04-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Chen Songxing, director of the New Economic Policy Research Center of Taiwan Donghua University, pointed out in the program that China's economic structural problem is that government departments have wrong decisions, such When it was dropped, not only smashed employment rice bowls, but also crack down on foreign -funded confidence and move the production line out. "Foreign capital does not come, the factory is gone, and the employment position is gone. No one has the ability to buy a house. The consumption has shrunk. This is an interlocking."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T11-04-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chen Songxing, director of the New Economic Policy Research Center of Donghua University in Taiwan, pointed out that the Chinese economy is already in the intensive care unit.

<p>In addition to employment, the added value of industrial industries above designated size in China increased by 3.5%year -on -year, but it fell 2.1 percentage points from last month. In addition, China's total import and export of goods in May increased by 0.5%year -on -year. Among them, imports increased by 2.3%, and the exports fell by 0.8%; the national service industry production index increased by 11.7%year -on -year, 1.8 percentage points fell 1.8 percentage.</p>

National industrial producers reflecting the changes in the cost of commodity production costs decreased by 4.6%year -on -year and a decrease of 0.9%month -on -month.

Ling Hui made the above conclusion.</p>
<p>** Wu Xiaobo: Chinese companies live in the "three lines" of food and clothing, profit and loss, life and death,</p>
<p>In the show, the host raised Chinese financial writer Wu Xiaobo that most companies lived on the "three lines". Large enterprises live on the "food and clothing line", medium -sized enterprises live on the "profit and loss line", and small and micro enterprises are the most dangerous, basically struggling on the "life and death line".</p>
<p>Chen Pokong pointed out the current situation of China. State -owned enterprises and state -owned enterprises monopolized the entire Chinese resources, including imports and exports such as mine, oil, and coal. Private enterprises were severely hit. SMEs like catering, hotels, and stalls hovering on the life and death line.</p>
<p>Chen Poong: "All companies are facing cold winter than cold winter. They are layoffs in large Chinese companies and small and medium -sized enterprises. Can unemployment be serious? The unemployment is seriously caused by the wrong policy in the past ten years."</p>
<p>"From the perspective of individual data, it will feel that China may be a cold or a cold, which is actually in the intensive care unit." Chen Songxing said.</p>
<p>He analyzed that China has habitual operation numbers, and liabilities account for 285%of the GDP ratio. If water is removed, the actual number is far more. 15%of the Chinese budget is paying interest. Old, there is no enough kinetic energy at all.</p>
<p>Chen Songxing: "Economic activity must be supported by the financial system, but the Chinese financial system is required to bear it. Real estate developers have bad assets and can not be included in. At this point, it is to explode Come out, but I can't find the countermeasures. "</p>
<p>Chen Songxing said pessimistic that unless it is solved from a fundamental structure, no feasible countermeasures are visible. Foreign capital withdrawal and "moisturizing" enterprises. He estimates that within three or five years, the social problems in China will emerge one by one, and it will be more serious, which will be a fierce challenge.</p>

<p>Russia currently holds a lease of land near the Congress Building in Kakara, where it is planned to build a new embassy there. The federal government tried to terminate the long -term lease agreement signed in 2008, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Albanis told reporters on Thursday (June 15): "The government has received very clear security suggestions that Russia has brought risks to the construction of new buildings in such a close construction of the Parliament Building."</p>
<p>"Today's decision is made for Australia's national security interests." He said that the government will take action quickly to ensure that the leased venue will not become official diplomatic agencies.</p>
<p>The termination of the lease will not affect Russia's existing embassies in Canberra. The current Soviet embassy in Russia is far from the Capitol Building.</p>

<p>The Minister of Internal Affairs and Network Security, Clare O’neil, explained that the "main problem" of the second Russian embassy in the proposal is its position because the location is adjacent to the parliamentary building.</p>
<p>The bill is supported by the opposition alliance and is expected to be passed in the two houses.</p>

<p>U.S. Minister of Finance Yellen on June 13 held a hearing held at the House Financial ServicesCom Mitee on June 13 that although the United States and China need to be resolved, if the United States is decoupled from China, the United States will "be decoupled from China," It is a huge mistake.

Once the United States stops trade with China, the consequences will be "catastrophic."</p>
<p>Yellen emphasized that of course, the United States should seek reducing risks in the US -China trade, but "must not be decoupled."</p>
<p>In this regard, Zhong Zhidong, assistant researcher at the "National Security Research Institute" of the Ministry of National Defense Think Tank, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and said: "The United States does not decompose to China. Decoming and competing relationships must not only avoid dependence, but also emphasize the possibility of cooperation and benefits of each other.

<p>Zhong Zhidong mentioned that recently, it is reported that the United States is ready to open a company's high -end chip to sell to Huawei to cause the stock market to respond. Will Brinken relax the control of China after visiting the United States? It is worth observing.</p>
<p>Zhong Zhidong said: "The seven major industrial states have hung a hat to the Communist Party of China called the" economic coercion ", and emphasized the risk of risks, and then advocated a concept of anti -decoupling. If they want to exist between the two, it is pragmatic to respond to China's global economic influence. In case of the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine, dependence on Russia's energy, the risk is to emphasize the toughness of its economy and avoid dependence on China. "</p>
<p>In addition, Germany released its first national security strategy on the 14th, saying that China was "partners, competitors and systemic opponents", and accused Beijing of trying to reshape the global international order in various ways, increase its strength to establish a dominant position, and time and over time, and again and again, again and again. The interests and values that deviate from Germany violate the interests of this European country.

<p>Germany Prime Minister Tsutz also said that Germany "does not want to decompose and wants to reduce risks." China's integration of world trade should not be damaged, but the security issues brought by must be considered.</p>
<p>In addition, New Zealand Prime Minister Higgins announced on the 12th that it will lead the trade delegation to visit Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, China at the end of June.

<p>In the interview with members of Germany, France, European Executive Committee, New Zealand, and Australian officials, Li Qiang visited Germany, and the United States and German politics should explain and continue to communicate with Chinese business. Farewell, be loose?</p>
<p>Tan Yaonan, the chairman of the Cross -Strait Policy Association, interpreted in an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty: "Before talking about the concept of decoupling, is there a Chinese supply chain? Or a non -Chinese supply chain question? Taiwan has regulations on the restrictions on the export control restrictions of China's high -tech, key technology, and emerging technology. In addition to these, there is no concept of decoupling, and there is no problem with different supply chains. It is necessary to ensure that in various industries, fields, and supply chains are very smooth. "Tan Yaonan said: "It is common to sanctions against South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan as a means of retaliation. This is considered to be economic coercion and takes the economy as a tool for national and country competition. Of course, this is considered unacceptable, so it is said that For the toughness of the supply chain, to ensure that there is no problem, it is not to decompose with China, but to de -risk and decentralization. In case China suddenly uses trade sanctions as an economic coercion weapon, it is enough to decentralized risks to ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted. "</p>
<p>Zhong Zhidong also said that from Yellen, New Zealand, and Germany's statements, the G7 joint communiqué did not take off the G7, the so -called de -risk, non -decourse, and implementing each parliament to consider their practices. After all, China is the second largest economy in the world. Under globalization, it is closely related to the overall financial system of the international financial system. It is impossible to cut it.</p>

<h1>Is Cuba's secret military base the prison station of China?</h1>

<p>Description: Last week, American media reported that China plans to set up eavesdropping facilities in Cuba. China has denied it. Reuters reporters personally went to the town of Behubar in Cuba, where the military base there was once hidden in the Soviet nuclear warhead. U.S. Senator Rubio has accused China of using this base to monitor the United States a few years ago.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The jungle covered by the quiet town of Bejucal in Cuban is covered. At the end of the road is a wire with a wire with a "military restricted area, do not enter" warning sign.</p>
<p>The United States has long suspected that China has collected information here. Reuters reporters were fortunate to get the opportunity to go to Belubar Town to find out.</p>
<p>On June 8th, the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous news that China plans to build an eavesdropping facility in Cuba. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/認中國在古巴設監聽站-白宮無礙布林肯訪華/a-65887038">White House</a>The initial response pointed out that the news was "inaccurate", but a few days later, anonymous officials confirmed to major media that China has established military and intelligence facilities in Cuba since 2019 to collect American emotion.</p>
<p>Reuters of Reuters saw a large number of antennas on the mountains in Behubar, and a white metal dome that looked connected to the antenna was looming in the dense jungle. Some people with unknown identities took a motorcycle to take pictures of Reuters reporters.</p>
<p>A document completed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCCC) in November 2022 pointed out that the United States believes that the little -known Cuban military base that is only 187 kilometers away from Florida is used to intercept the electronic communications of the United States. The report states that China uses the Cuban intelligence facilities in the former Soviet Union to collect signal information.</p>
<p>This document was drafted by a committee, including the US Department of Homeland Security and the Ministry of Justice, and some of the contents of the reasons for refusing to apply for the submarine optical fiber communication cable Arcos-1 to connect Cuba and the United States.</p>
<p>On Monday (June 12), a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Wenbin once again responded to a question about China ’s“ spy centers ”in Cuba at the journalist. A series of conflicts of self -conflict were scattered on the construction of the 'spy facility' in Cuba, and once again staged a farce of "the United States to negate the United States'. What I want to say is that it is true that it is true. How to make rumors and discredit, it can't destroy the sincere friendship between the Middle Ages, and it can't hide the large -scale and different eavesdropping of the United States to the world's countries in the world. "</p>
<p>Cuba said that the only military invasion of its territory is the US base in Guotanamo.</p>
<p>In an interview with the American Broadcasting Corporation (MSNBC), a spokesman for the White House National Security Council last week, denied reports on the Wall Street Journal about the secret construction of China and Cuba's secret construction of spy facilities in the Wall Street Journal. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国据报将在古巴建窃听基地-美称报导有误/a-65861382">This report is "inaccurate"</a>Essence</p>
<p>The White House National Security Council did not respond to Reuters' inquiries. It has not confirmed that the Behuma Military Base is used by China as a monitoring base, nor said it is still paying attention to the matter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T11-58-00Z/57180908_401.jpg" />Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Latin America in 2014 to meet with former Cuban President Lalestro.</p>
<p>Reuters reporters saw a large amount of sugar cane and bananas in the town of Behubar. The locals work in farmland, riding a bicycle or riding.</p>
<p>61 -year -old ARNALDOPEREZ has lived in Behubar since birth. He said he didn't know who was used on the mountain. He said: "I only know these are related to the army. But I am a rural person, I just care about my own business."</p>
<p>Cuba, a silent town in Cuba, has been a mysterious place for a long time. It is only 30 kilometers away from Havana. In the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, it was discovered by the US reconnaissance aircraft to be hidden in the Soviet nuclear warhead. This town has become known for this.</p>
<p>The Cuban missile crisis ended with the Soviet Union withdrawn from Cuba. Although this crisis lasts shortly, it is still an important event in the history of the history of the national security and the preparation of the nuclear war, and it is usually considered to be the closest to the cold war to the closest to the full nuclear war.</p>
<p>In 2016, Marco Rubio, a Cuban -American Florida Senator, took the lead in demanding that the Havana government removed the "Chinese Survening Station in Behacar".</p>
<p>Fultonarmstrong, a senior analyst of Cuban Affairs in the United States, said that people knew little about Behubar. He said: "According to today's science and technology level, building a monitoring station (for China) is not of much significance." He said that Beijing now has more advanced monitoring equipment and technology.</p>
<p>However, he also said that Cuba as his own base is symbolic for Beijing because China is deeply dissatisfied with the United States' spy activities in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>
<p>A retired military official in the United States said that Cuba was close to the equator and monitored the synchronized military satellite on the earth.</p>
<p>In 2019, Reuters also reported that the Chinese military operated a space monitoring station in Argentina.</p>
<p>When a Reuters reporter interviewed local residents in the town of Behuma, everyone said that they did not see or heard that China has participated in the local area in recent years. Many people say that Russia can enter the town military base.</p>
<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the continuous deterioration of Russian -US relations has exacerbated people's speculation on Russian President Putin's may be considered in the re -opening spy base in Lourdes. It was the Soviet spy base during the Cold War.</p>
<p>The 36 -year -old farmer, onlvis despaigne, lives near the Behubar base. He said that if China is here to collect information here, he will have heard of it.</p>
<p>"It's all rumors," he grinned while weeding, "Everyone here knows everything."</p>

Cheng Yuan condemned inhuman treatment such as Hunan Chishan Prison for corporal punishment, and long -term forced labor, which led to his physical and mental herself. Family plans to sue Chishan Prison, but no lawyer is willing to represent the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/7-06132023153608.html"><strong> Shi Minglei revealed that Cheng Yuan was suffered from abuse and corruption and personality humiliation in prison </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-05052023120006.html">Changsha Fulian Case: Family members are still forced to work in the prison and are still forced to work</a></strong></p>
<p>Cheng Yuan, who has been unable to contact with the outside world for a long time, meets his brother and sister at Chishan Prison in Hunan this week. His wife in the United States, Shi Minglei, said that his prison career and forced labor have caused a problem with her husband's body.</p>
<p>Shi Minglei: "(Cheng Yuan) is very very thin, only about fifty kilograms, which is about a hundred pounds. He stepped on the sewing machine inside and twelve hours a day. After white, there is also a problem with the body's function, toothache, and the teeth are beginning to fall off. "</p>
<p>The news of the suspected abuse of prisoners in Chishan Prison in Hunan has attracted much attention from the international community. According to Cheng Yuan, he was "detained and closed" last year, that is, three months during the three -month period of the high alert supervision area, he had been abused by prisons and humiliation. He also disclosed that his family did not receive his call for a long time.</p>
<p>Shi Minglei: "They asked Cheng Yuan to write ideas. Cheng Yuan refused, and they asked Cheng Yuan to stand in the military posture for twelve hours a day. When he was sleeping every night, he would wake him up every hour and let him let him make him. Get up and punish the station. He wants to wash his face, brush his teeth, wash dishes, and even drink water with the water in the toilet. From July last year to the present, Cheng Yuan has not called at home, because the authorities need to call Kneel, and you need to call a report before you can call. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T12-01-00-04-00/000001.png" />Shi Minglei (pictured) hopes that the experience of her husband Cheng Yuan has attracted the attention of the international community (Shi Minglei is exclusively provided, and the shooting date is unknown) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-06152023100636.html/m0615gfe.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T12-01-00-04-00/000002.png" /></a>** Family members intend to sue Chishan Prison for Cheng Yuan.</p>
<p>Cheng Yuan, who has been sentenced to five years, is expected to be released from prison next year. The family members believe that the relevant measures of Chishan Prison are illegal, and they plan to sue the prison and appeal to Cheng Yuan. But so far, no lawyer is willing to take over the agent.</p>
<p>Shi Minglei: "The lawyers we were looking for now agreed, but when the family asked for the law, they all said that the law firm did not approve the formalities. We guess that their law firm was threatened."</p>
<p>Pan Jiawei, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo, Japan, believes that Cheng Yuan's encounter is not a special case in China.</p>
<p>Pan Jiawei: "It is not allowed to meet the parties and family members and lawyers, which will cause these situations to be unveiled. Even if the outside world is informed, it cannot be effectively handled. The attention of the international community is the only channel for the parties and their families to rely on."</p>
<p>The public welfare organization "Changsha Funer" has long paid attention to the rights of disabled people. In July 2019, Changsha Guoan took Cheng Yuan and his two colleagues. After that, the three were judged to be established by the crime of subverting the state power. After the family analyzed the latest judgment content, it was believed that "Changsha Fusen" touched the nerves of the authorities because of defending the rights and interests of the labor and became the fuse of the three of them.</p>

<p>Blint also plans to "propose bilateral concerns, global and regional affairs, and the possibility of cooperation in common transnational challenges."</p>

He planned to meet with officials for two days in Beijing this time, and then flew to London to participate in a conference focusing on Ukraine reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong> Why is this important: Despite the tight relations, the United States and China still want to maintain high -level diplomacy. </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>This will be the first visit to China as the Secretary of State. Chinese and American officials are still exploring whether he will meet with Chinese leaders Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Both governments hope that this visit can promote senior US officials to conduct a series of visits to China this summer. U.S. officials who may visit China in the future include the Minister of Finance Yellen, the Minister of Commerce Raymond, and the special envoy of climate issues.</p>
<p>These visits may pave the way for Xi Jinping to go to San Francisco to participate in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization National Group Leadership Summit, and President Biden will also participate in the summit.</p>
<p>The two governments of the two countries have regarded high -level diplomacy as a potential anchor point in tensions that have been upgraded for several years. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012, China took tough operations in its surrounding areas and seemed to apply greater economic and foreign influence globally, and sometimes it was a way of coercion. Biden continued the policy direction of the Trump administration, seeking to compete with China through military, economic, diplomatic, technology and intelligence.</p>
<p>"It's time for dense diplomacy," said Kurt Campbell, a senior official of the White House Asian affairs, said at a call blowing with the media on Wednesday. "This is not a strategic change, nor is it a new thing for the United States to govern the country."</p>
<p><strong> Background: China believes that the purpose of the US policy is to limit its strength. </strong></p>
<p>Campbell enumerated the approach of Biden's government, saying that it has achieved a certain degree of coordination in terms of policy to limit the tough behavior of China's Chinese officials. The United States has persuaded European allies to make more remarks on the areas of tight relations with Chinese relations and strengthen military alliances and partnerships in the Asia -Pacific region (including Australia, Japan and the Philippines).</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Chinese officials opposed these actions, saying that the United States tried to surround their country. The Chinese government claims to have sovereignty over the entire South China Sea, including de facto independent islands Taiwan. The U.S. Navy regularly dispatches warships and aircraft through these areas to maintain navigation and transit freedom. Several times <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-us-canada-taiwan-strait-1.6865520">almost a conflict</a>Essence</p>
<p>Chinese officials also condemned the United States and their allies to try to "risk risks" in terms of economic aspects, and "de -risk" means that they tried to cut off certain business connections because of concern for national security. The most striking example is that the Bayeng government prohibits the export of certain chips and tools to China to <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221014/biden-china-technology-semiconductors/">advanced semiconductor industry that hinders China</a>develop.</p>
<p><strong> What will happen next: Diplomats talk about conflict and cooperation. </strong></p>
<p>"We came to Beijing with a realistic, confident attitude and sincere desire to deal with our competition in the most responsible way as possible." Essence "We really hope that this goal will be achieved at least. Of course, we really want to make progress on some specific issues."</p>

<p>Czech President President Paeville's opening speech mentioned in the opening speech of the EUROPEAN VALUES Center for SecurityPolicy at the Prague Think Tank's opening speech mentioned that China has increased its dependence on China with the acquisition of infrastructure in various countries. Such development is quite dangerous. The Czech Republic is unintentionally isolated in China, nor can it not be able to do business with China, but China's strategic interests are not compatible with the value of the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is unwilling to see that international order is influenced by China's economy and military forces, and the EU, NATO and other countries are necessary to unite and countermeasures.</p>

<p>"Let us keep unity in maintaining the situation in Taiwan, and do not allow China to strongly strengthen his ambitions in Taiwan. Taiwan has democratic rules, and the same Hong Kong is the same, but now it has been slowly disintegrated. The world should continue to support its full support. Defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom. "</p>
<p>When Pavili gave a speech, Wu Zhaozheng, a Taiwan Foreign Minister who visited the Czech Republic for the second time, sat in the first row. Taiwan has only formal diplomatic relations with the Holy See in Europe. This is the first time that European non -diplomatic diplomatic relations are the first stage with Taiwan Foreign Ministers. The organizers and the Taiwan Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs were posted photos of the two "same frames" in Twitter.</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng immediately delivered a speech with the title of "One theater, one vision" (one theater, One World, and Onevision, and called for democratic countries to unite to support Taiwan for the threat of the expansion of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Wu Zhaoyi said: "In order to keep Taiwan strong and tough and have the courage to continue to maintain the status quo, we need the support of European friends. Among all those who speak for Taiwan, I would like to thank the Czech Republic to support Taiwan."</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine. It also mentioned that China attacked Taiwan through composite means such as cognitive operations, fake messages, and online attacks.<strong> Foreign Minister of Taiwan: I hope that the freedom of the people of Taiwan can also achieve it in China </strong></p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng pointed out that Beijing proposed the so -called Chinese dream of "realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" to continue the Communist rule in a way to restrain people's speech, belief and freedom of election and destroy the objections. For example, Uighurs re -educate camps, oppress the Tibetan government, the end of the Hong Kong democracy, and religious Sinicization are all the appalling stories of China's move to the totalitarian system. Hong Kong experience also shows that the "one country, two systems" is not feasible, and Taiwan is more firmly choosing freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng emphasized that Taiwan is not demanding China. China shared the cultural root of the cultural and Taiwan. Taiwan is not hostile to the Chinese people. It is hoped that the freedom that the people of Taiwan can enjoy one day can be realized in China.</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng mentioned that the government of Slovakia and Lithuania sent a delegation to visit Taiwan to fight against pressure and is the "moral giant".</p>
<p>Zhang Mengren, a convener of Foreign and International Affairs of Furen University, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and said: "The Czech Republic is really a big move, and Pavili may meet Wu Zhaozheng a week ago. Do, symbolize the Czech Republic to support democratic countries. "</p>
<p>Zhang Mengren mentioned that German media reported that Pavili and Cai Yingwen's call was Taiwan's initiative. This time Pavili and Taiwan Foreign Minister's frames showed that Tajie's position is very similar, and it must be a diplomatic breakthrough.</p>
<p>Zhang Mengren said: "The President of the Czech Republic is a former NATO general. Not only is China not democratic and China threatens Taiwan, but the Czech Republic is also very taboo that China has similar relations with Russia. As a former Central and Eastern European Communist countries, he is very afraid of Russia's aggression. Therefore, if the relationship between China and Russia is not cut off, the Czech Republic's questions about China will definitely exist forever. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Czech Republic has participated, and the relationship is now less. It is also discussed to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is also invisible protests to China. "</p>
<p>Zhang Mengren also said that the Czech Senate Speaker Witzili and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ada Momova, visited Taiwan, and the new ruling team was very friendly.</p>

He also said: "Minister Wu is in the same frame with Pavil, who has been elected president at the venue, has its own special significance and is indeed a diplomatic breakthrough.

<p>The "Termination of China's Development State Status Act" passed the full vote of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate last week, and the legislative process went further. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated when responded that China is in the status of developing countries and the basis of international law.</p>
<p>Asian facts investigation of the laboratory found that the international community did not have a clear definition of "developing countries". In the classification of the United Nations and the World Bank, China is the "developing economy" and "medium -income countries". The "developing countries" of the World Trade Organization are the result of the "self -declaration" of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, China is classified as "developing countries" in certain international treaties, but this cannot be pushed as a general set of international law defining China as "developing countries".</p>

<p>The US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee approved the "Term Status Act of Developing China] on June 8th.(https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/308)"(Ending China's Developing National Statusact). The bill requires the State Council to "prevent China from being classified as developing countries in international organizations" and clearly listed the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a goal for being changed. The United States Congress, which promotes legislation, believes that China has obtained many favorable benefits because of its ranking in the "developing countries".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/fyrbt_673021/jzhsl_673025/202306/t20230609_11094353.shtml">Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman</a>Wang Wenbin responded to the bill at a press conference on June 9, saying that "China's position as the world's largest developing country has a sufficient factual basis and a solid foundation for international law." He also emphasized before that <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202305/t20230512_11076522.html">China's "developing countries" came from the recognition of the WTO</a>This should not be changed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who decides the development status of WTO members?</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently in the WTO organization, China does be a "developing country." However, Wang Wenbin claims that China ’s status as a developing country“ recognized by the World Trade Organization ”is wrong because the organization <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/d1who_e.htm">allows all member countries to decide whether it is a developing country</a>Essence</p>
<p>According to the WTO, the definition of "developing countries" does not provide definition of "developed countries" and "developing countries", and member states can declare which classification it belongs to. However, other member states have the right to question the terms enjoyed by a member country by themselves.</p>
<ol>
<li>How can the standards of the United Nations and the World Bank classify China?</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the WTO, the United Nations and the World Bank also have a classification standard for the development of national economic development. They are standards for total national income (GNI).</p>
<p>In the United Nations "<a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-2023/">World Economic Situation and Outlook</a>In the classification definition of the report, the countries in the world are classified as developed economies, transformed economies, developing economies, and the least developed countries. In their reports, China is one of the developed economies.</p>
<p>The World Bank does not use the word "development", <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023">but divided the world's economies into four income groups</a>That is, high income, medium -to -medium income, medium and lower income and low -income groups.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T13-36-19-04-00/000002.png" />China's economy is listed as "development" by the United Nations, and the World Bank is listed as "medium -to -income". (Associated Press picture) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06152023132934.html/1-jpg-jpg-526f672c"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T13-36-19-04-00/000003.png" /></a>In this category, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true">China currently revenue for US $ 11,880 per capita national income</a>In a medium -income country. Although this is a huge leap compared to forty years or even twenty years ago, this number is still far lower than other widely recognized developed economies such as Japan, the United States, Germany, France or Taiwan.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a set of international law systems to ensure that China is a developing country?</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has stated that the status of Chinese developing countries comes from solid international law basis. China's developing countries have the status of developing countries, including the World Trade Organization Mechanism and the "<a href="https://unfccc.int/parties-observers">Convention on the United Nations Climate Change Framework</a>"[<a href="https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol">Montreal Protocol about Montreal, which consumes ozone layers</a>"The international treaty, which is recognized and accepted by members of the international community. China's developing countries are not deprived.</p>
<p>This statement is misleading.Charleskenny, a senior researcher at the Global Development Center, said that although many international treaties divide the country into different categories according to income, and give each category different obligations, these categories and boundary points are related to the relevant each in the relevant each It is randomly determined after the consultation.</p>
<p>Therefore, China's developing countries are not permanent, but have a certain time limit, must be reviewed regularly, or re -judged by the member states, instead of being hinted in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's speeches. , Do not question or change. In an interview with the Asian factual investigation laboratory, Song Chengen, a director of the Taiwan Constitutional Foundation, said that the status of the so -called developing countries in China must be with the regulations under the treaty and the rights and obligations of different status countries with the rights and obligations of different status countries. Observation, you cannot generalize.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why is the country marked as a developed or developing countries?</li>
</ol>
<p>In some international organizations, such as world trade organizations, countries that are recognized as developing countries can seek (but may not be able to obtain) "special rights or additional tolerance".</p>
<p>"In order to achieve various global goals, including who gets financial support, or who has greater tolerance in international trade rules, or who is qualified to get official development assistance (ODA), people use various classification methods. There are various reasons for various reasons. Makes the country want to classify itself into the category of 'development', "Kenny said. In addition, labels known as "developed" countries usually mean responsibilities to help poor countries in economic difficulties and abide by more stringent global important issues (such as climate change).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T13-36-19-04-00/000004.png" />World Trade allowed a country to be designated as "development" to apply for "special rights or extra wide" (Associated Press picture) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06152023132934.html/2-jpg-jpg-526f672c"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T13-36-19-04-00/000005.png" /></a>"The People's Republic of China often uses the status of the country's equal income countries to remove its global responsibility, including providing debt reduction in response to climate change and providing the current debt crisis. Comply with international norms, it is impossible to provide global public products on climatic issues or to curb the current debt crisis of many developing countries, "a spokesman for the US International Development Agency (USAID) told the Asian factual verification laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion</strong></p>
<p>For how China's overall economic development is classified, different international organizations have different evaluations and classification standards. If the classification of relevant UN reports and the category of the World Bank, China is indeed close to the "developing country". In the WTO organization, China is indeed a "developing country." However, China's "developing country" in the WTO comes from self -declaration from the beginning of joining that this identity may be shaken by future development or challenges of other members. The same is true of the "developing countries" under other international treaties. Therefore, the statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on developing countries in China is misleading.</p>

In the context of the Russian and Ukraine War, Russia occupies an important role in this document, of course, it is expected.

The comments entitled "The National Security Strategy that I just introduced is not successful" wrote:</p>
<p>"The U.S. government led by Biden has clearly defined China as the number one challenge for geopolitics. However, in Germany's national security strategy, there is no clear definition of China. Competitors and institutional opponents'.](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国出台首份国家安全战略-中国是对手也是伙伴/a-65912004)The current Red and Green United Government has a similar positioning in China in its joint ruling agreement. The ruling agreement also mentioned that Germany's support for Democratic Taiwan, which is threatened by China, but in the newly introduced national security strategy, it has not been mentioned. Those who are about to come to Berlin to participate in the German -China government next week will be pleased with this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-15T14-08-00Z/65909787_401.jpg" />On June 14, the German Red, yellow and green joint government officially launched the "National Security Strategy"</p>
<p>The German government explained this that in the future, Berlin will also launch a more detailed strategy to China, but Shulz refuses to disclose the specific time to release the Chinese strategy on Wednesday, but just say: 'After the formulation is completed, it will be announced.' Essence Since Foreign Minister Berbque's statement, this national security strategy has major international significance, isn't it a matter of course that the threat of China is increasingly mentioned in the document. "</p>
<p>The comments pointed out that in the national security strategy, it is promised that Germany will increase national defense expenses and meet NATO's relevant member states to put 2%of the national production value into national defense requirements. This is worthy of saying:</p>
<p>"On the one hand, this is an progress worth celebrating, but on the other hand, Germany should have taken such steps long ago. After all, Germany has been far behind the goal given by NATO. Sri Lanka has held a summit, and now it is suggested that the national defense expenditure should be raised to 3%of the total national production value in order to cope with the increasing threat from Russia and China. "</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Report wrote that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国国安战略千呼万唤不出来/a-65872459">the national security strategy is finally introduced to be a good thing, because before the Russia launched the Ukraine War in February last year, a whole generation of Germans almost forgot what the "national security" was. </a>"Other points listed in the national security strategy are also very meaningful, including all aspects of the supply from network security to raw materials. After all, the cruel reality is that Germany can no longer believe that other countries will always maintain goodwill to Germany. The clear positioning, the wording involved in China is also full of doubts, and a rejection of the attitude of Germany in Germany in the past. But the document does not provide an answer for a key question: if Germany still does not establish the National Security Council, who should it should be? To coordinate the implementation and coordination of national security goals? "</p>

<p>With the slowdown of the global economy, the growth rate of Japan's exports has been the lowest in more than two years, which exacerbates the uncertainty faced by Japan's economic prospects. At the same time, Prime Minister Kishida may be considering the advance election.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Japan's exports in May increased by 0.6%year -on -year, the lowest growth rate since February 2021, and analysts' forecasts decreased by 1.2%. Although data is better than expected, it still reflects the trend of weakening global trade. The exports of mineral fuel, chip manufacturing equipment and semiconductor components declined, dragging down Japan's overall exports.</p>
<p>Affected by the decline in fuel prices, Japan's imports in May fell by 9.9%year -on -year, the largest decline in more than two years, and basically conforming to the forecast of economists.</p>
<p>The slowdown in export growth in Japan reflects the impact of uneven external demand, especially semiconductor products. The data also shows that if the supply chain improves to promote the recovery of the automotive industry, Japan's exports may decline in May.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T15-26-00-04-00/000000.png" />The United States and China confirmed that Brinken will visit the United Nations Agency on June 18 and June 19 on June 18 and June 19</p>
<p>US Secretary of State AntonyBlinken has postponed several months of visiting China. This weekend is about to begin. In the case of fierce competition in the United States and China, and bilateral relations have fallen into the trough for decades, what impact can this visit have on US -China relations? What are the expectations of the United States and China?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/hcm1-06142023032513.html"><strong> U.S. -China Foreign Minister Call Discuss to Maintaining Communication Pipelines and Global Affairs of Bilateral Relations </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-06062023113925.html">The United States condemn the Chinese military to provoke the casualties in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea</a></strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday (14th), the United States and China announced the news that Secretary of State Brillings would visit China this weekend. At the regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th, the reporter from Bloomberg asked more information about Brinkee's visit to China. Spokesman Wang Wenbin responded: "After being agreed by China and the United States, US Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeit will be on June 18th Visit China on the day of the day. The two parties are visiting relevant arrangements to maintain communication. We will release it in time. "</p>
<p><strong> What is the calculation of China ’s delay in the announcement of the news of Brinkeng's visit to China? </strong> This will be the first time that the Secretary of State of the United States has visited China for five years. Previously, Brinken was scheduled to visit Beijing early February this year, but it was temporarily canceled due to the "spy balloon" incident. This time, in the case of many foreign media disclosed the news, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was dragged on the phone of the State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Brinken, and it was announced before it was announced.</p>
<p>In response, Deng Yanwen, deputy editor -in -chief of the "Study Times" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, believes: "This may also receive the lesson of the last lesson and be more cautious." He said that recently the US media has also reported that China will set up an intelligence station in Cuba in Cuba. Beijing may be worried that if this incident is fermented, it will once again affect Brinken itinerary. "Another possibility is that before Qin Gang and Brinken talk, what problems may be talked about between the two parties may not be finalized."</p>
<p>Bonnie Glaser, the director of the Asian Project in the Marshall Foundation in the United States, told this station: "China is undoubtedly wanting the United States to look more interested in this visit. They think of it. It may make them look better in China. But China really wants to have this visit. "</p>
<p><strong> Blint's trip to the United States and China is not high in the United States and China </strong></p>
<p>Daniel J.kritenbrink, Assistant Secretary of State East Asia and Pacific Affairs, pointed out in the media telephone briefing on Wednesday (14th) that Brinkens visited China with three major goals to ensure that high -level communication channels are unblocked to reduce misjudgments. Risks; at the same time, express and defend the interests and values of the United States; and to seek potential cooperation areas that conform to each other's interests. He also said that Brintken's visit to the middle of the country is unlikely to bring breakthroughs and turns to US -China relations.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement of calling with Qin Gang and Brinken on the 14th, saying that "since the beginning of the year, Sino -US relations have encountered new difficulties and challenges, and the responsibility is clear." The statement also said that Qin Gang on the core of China on the issue of Taiwan issues such as Taiwan issue Concern and clarifying the "solemn position", emphasizing that the United States should "respect" and so on.</p>
<p>Ge Laiyi analyzed: "Both sides have a lot of doubt and distrust. China emphasizes that they have not asked this visit. They even say that Qin Gang and Brinken are not required by the phone call. They are still accusing all bilateral relations issues. They are caused by the United States, and they have no responsibility at all. So this will not be an easy dialogue, and what results can be observed. "</p>
<p>Ge Laiyi said that China did not like dealing with Brinken. She has heard that China also hopes that the Minister of Finance Yellen visits China first, but the United States insists on Blingken first. "I don't think this trip, China will be willing to give up, but the hope of the United States is not high."</p>
<p><strong> China talks about "sincerity" and "respect" Dabo: It is equivalent to the United States "shut up" </strong></p>
<p>Just before China announced that Brinken's visit to China, the domestic media in China continued to post, saying that on the one hand, the United States posted "the illusion of urgent communication", and at the same time, it was "repeatedly tentatively provoked" on the bottom line of principle. There is also an article that the United States is "forcibly '" Tyngers' "and questioned Brinken's visit to China. Chinese officials have previously stated many times that the key to the US -China communication is that the United States cannot "say one set and one set".</p>
<p>When Deng Yanwen analyzed the Chinese mentality, "Brinken is coming, but it is just to cooperate with you in a certain aspect, but after returning, what should you do? Don't respect. "</p>
<p>Dai Bo, the director of the Institute of Kissinger, the US Wilson Center, believes: "The problem is China's definition of 'sincerity' and the definition of 'respect", it seems to be "shut up'. We, we do not allow you to do anything we don't want, not allow you to say anything we don't like to hear. This is the condition that the United States will not accept. "</p>
<p>Kurtcampbell, a coordinator of the White House, also emphasized at the media briefing on Wednesday that the United States is competing with China, but the United States does not seek conflict, confrontation or the new Cold War. What the United States wants is "responsible management competition."</p>
<p>Dabo believes: "We have some different views on the world's situation and the security of the Western Pacific, but can we reduce the possibility of direct conflict. US relations. It is impossible to change these relationships. "</p>
<p><strong> Bollingin visited the Huawei APEC Summit to pave the way? </strong></p>
<p>Ge Laiyi believes that if Bollingken visits China this time, there will be more positive signals to have more high -level US officials and Minister of Finance, such as Yellen or Commercial Minister Raymond Doro to visit Beijing. In San Francisco in November this year, the United States will host the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Ge Laiyi said that if Brinton's visit can make some preparations for the APEC summit, it will be a good result in itself.</p>
<p>Dabo also pointed out that if the two sides can adhere to the more polite tone at this meeting: "Because, in fact, their goal is not just to meet with relevant officials in China, but they must prepare Xi Jinping when they go to San Francisco in November in November. , Biden and Xi Jinping's summit. This is the most important. "</p>
<p><strong> The US -China military communication mechanism is difficult to recover </strong></p>
<p>A worry -free aspect of relations between the two countries is long -term interrupted military dialogue. Although the United States has recently tried to communicate with China to communicate with China, Beijing seems to have little interest. Earlier this month, China Defense Minister Li Shangfu refused to hold a seasons during a conversation with US Defense Minister Lloydaustin during the During Shangri -La dialogue.</p>
<p>Campbell said on Wednesday that I believe that Brins will strongly advocate the necessity of these communication channels. "They are mature and powerful military interaction, and the risk of avoiding the establishment of these key communication channels is too high."However, Deng Yanwen believes that in order to achieve further exchanges, China will first ask the sanctions against China Defense Director Li Shangfu, but it is currently unlikely.</p>
<p>RobertSpalding, a senior researcher at Hudson College of the U.S. Think Tank Hudson College, said: "The realistic conference is when Biden and Xi Jinping meet. The meeting has nothing to do. "</p>
<p><strong> The risk of the Taiwan Strait War is still not high </strong></p>
<p>At present, the cross -strait situation has continued to be tight. Kangda recently responded to the media that Bollingin's visit to China will reiterate the maintenance of the United States for the maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.</p>
<p>"The risk of war in the Taiwan Strait is higher than a few years ago, but I don't think it is very high." Ge Laiyi pointed out that neither the United States and China have no willing They are far from preparing for a major military operation. "Failure may lead to weakening Xi Jinping's power in China and may weaken the Communist Party of China. Xi Jinping is unlikely to make such a decision."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T15-57-00-04-00/000004.png" />Tian Hong, deputy secretary -general and director of the Letters and Calls Bureau of Jiangsu Province, and others expressed their care of Yang Li's condition from May this year (provided by Yang Caiying) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/tj-06152023153314.html/571672474e09.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T15-57-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a>Yang Caiying also talked that before Yang Li's mother and daughter went to Beijing on Tuesday, on Sunday, they planned to go to Beijing. I did not expect that before they left Changzhou, they were intercepted by the police when they were on the car: "At that time, they still used me to me as me at that time. My mother took people to take my mother and my sister to the police station, left my mother for more than eight hours, and then sent her back home. "</p>
<p>Yang Li said that the police only used Xu Dongqing to bite people as an excuse to detain Xu Dongqing. In fact, Xu Dongqing did not bite: "I don’t know who caused the two little red dots on his (police officer). Obviously, it doesn't seem to be a trace of bite at all. Later, after they took my mother to the police station, they did not say the problem of biting and hurting people. Later, they closed my mother home for eight hours. If they really bite people, they will definitely do it, and they will definitely not turn it home after eight hours. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T15-57-00-04-00/000006.png" />The police of Jinsan District accused Xu Dongqing biting the police (provided by Yang Caiying) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/tj-06152023153314.html/571672474e8c.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T15-57-00-04-00/000007.png" /></a><strong> Yang Li: Jinsan Public Security is afraid of our petition </strong></p>
<p>Yang Li also told this reporter that she estimated that the reason why Changzhou public security repeatedly stopped her from going to Beijing to see a doctor, and she was worried that she would petition in the way: "He may be afraid that I will visit again, because every time they are escorted to the local area, they will be returned to the local area. The police on the car will warn me that I cannot petition. We have not petitioned. "The Yang family carried out rights protection operations for many years because of the government's illegal land acquisition.This station also called the Jintan Binhu Police Station for investigation of the case, but the public security refused to disclose the details of the case: "We cannot verify the identity of the reporter on the phone, so we will not answer any questions about you."</p>

<p>The Indonesian Constitutional Court rejected a proposal to reform the national election system before the election next year. The organization that safeguarded the right to maintain its rights pointed out that this reform was an attack on democracy.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that Anwar USman, chief judge of the Constitutional Court of Constitution, stated at the hearing on Thursday (June 15) that he "completely rejected the plaintiff's petition."</p>
<p>The court rejected the Democratic Party of the ruling party(PDI-P)A suggestion made by a member, the suggestion is to transform the election system of the world's third largest democratic country into a closed system that only allows political parties to choose parliament members.</p>
<p>The closed voting system was used during the dictatorship's former president Suhado, and he was retained after he fell in the late 1990s. Since 2008, Indonesia has adopted a public voting system and voters directly voted to the candidates supported by them.</p>
<p>Legal challenges have caused people to worry that Indonesia will return to the past dictatorship. The president and Congress elections in February may also be postponed. This may allow President Zok to continue to serve as president after two terminal term. As the chief judges, Anwar and Zoko, were in -laws, critics also questioned the court's independence.</p>
<p>Zoko has repeatedly denied that he intends to extend his term of office to more than 10 years. Prior to the court's decision, eight other political parties in the parliament had shown that the election system reform supported by the ruling party.</p>
<p>A member of the Democratic Party and five other members of the Democratic Party submitted a petition to the court last year, advocating the use of a closed voting system. Their reason is that the open system has caused money -driven competition among candidates.</p>
<p>Human rights experts criticized the proposal. Usmanhamid, the head of the International Terminal Indonesia, told AFP before the court ruling: "This is a continuous attack on democracy ... Indonesia's citizen space is attacked, Indonesia's political opposition is attacked, Now is the integrity of the election. "</p>
<p>The Constitution Court on Thursday decided that people will continue to vote to individual candidates in future elections, rather than voting party.</p>
<p>In the last election in 2019, there were more than 150 million voters in Indonesia and more than 200,000 candidates.</p>

According to the documents of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the International Investment Bank Goldman Sachs Group has abandoned several commissioned entrustments in the Hong Kong IPO, including a Chinese skin drug company and an online platform for pharmaceutical products; in addition, Bank of America also gave up a Chinese solar industry company IPO. The report pointed out that the reasons for the abandonment of international investors include the decline in stock prices, the tight relations between the United States and China, and the weak economic recovery of China. International investment banks are rare to abandon IPOs. This approach will make the situation of Chinese corporate situations that want to go public overseas. Many transaction partners on the market have changed their original views. At the beginning of the year, they were once optimistic about this year's situation, but now many of them think that this year's IPO market prospects are dim. (Responsible editor: Wang Yun)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-15T19-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />The European Executive Committee stated in the statement: "The Executive Committee believes that compared with other 5G suppliers, Huawei and ZTE actually mean obvious greater risks."</p>
<p>The statement pointed out that the Executive Committee will take relevant security measures and do not purchase new connection services between Huawei and ZTE equipment.</p>
<p>The EU's internal market affairs committee, Thierry Breton, called to the EU 27 member states and telecommunications operators that the mobile network should exclude the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment.</p>
<p>Bulleson said at a press conference in Brussels that it cannot continue to rely heavily on equipment that may become "weapons" to attack the interests of the EU. "For our common security, this weakness is too dangerous and risky."</p>
<p>The European Executive Committee stated that about 24 EU member states have given the foundation through specifications or laying a foundation to give domestic authorities to set up limited power.</p>
<p>However, Breast pointed out that only 10 member states use these specifications to restrict or exclude high -risk sellers. "This is too slow to form a major security risk and expose the EU collective security in risks."</p>
<p>The European Executive Committee introduced strict 5G specifications three years ago, but no supplier was prohibited publicly, nor did they name Huawei. Therefore, today's statement symbolizes the EU's change of Er Yicang, adopt a stronger route to China, and still maintains relations with Beijing.</p>

<p>The Malaysian Appeals Tribunal approved the application of the former Prime Minister's wife Rosma on Thursday (June 15), allowing her to temporarily pick up her passport to visit her daughter in Singapore.</p>
<p>Because the deputy prosecution Department of the main controller Fu Yiting did not oppose it, the three divisions of the Appeals Division headed by the judge Lavida unanimously agreed to approve the application of Rosma, so that she could visit Singapore to visit her relatives from now until July 7.</p>
<p>Rosma's representative Jia Jixing said that Rosema would return the passport to the court for custody within a week after returning to Malaysia on July 7.</p>
<p>He also promised that Rosema would return to Malaysia before the appeal court tried on July 11 to hear the Sarawak suburban school solar power supply case.</p>
<p>This is the third time Rosema applied to the court for a temporary passport to go abroad to visit the eldest daughter Noriana, son -in -law and two grandsons who settled in Singapore.</p>
<p>She put forward the same requirements in October 2021 and March 2023, and was approved by the court at that time. However, Rosma returned to his passport for the first time and visited Noriana, Singapore to be born at the time, and did not return to Malaysia on time. He missed the interrogation of solar power supply cases in the Sarawak School. At that time, the court almost issued a wanted order to her.</p>
<p>The Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that Rosma was established in the case last September. It was sentenced to 10 years and a fine of RM970 million (about S $ 280 million), which was the highest penalty of Malaysia. Rosma has appealed to appeal and obtained abroad, and external conditions include passing a passport. This appeal is scheduled to start on July 11 for four days.</p>

Senior US officials emphasized on Wednesday (June 14) that the main goal of Brinken's visit to China was to establish a crisis communication mechanism with China to reduce risks, but they also said that they did not expect a big breakthrough in the interview. Analysts believe that Brinken's trip should try to explain the way for the leaders of the two countries during the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November this year, and only when the leaders of the two countries realize the meeting, the US -China relations will really have the opportunity to restart the opportunity</p>
