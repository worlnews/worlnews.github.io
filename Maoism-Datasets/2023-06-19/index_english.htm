Brincken is the first supreme US official to visit China in five years. After the Chinese spy balloon incident in February this year, Brinken postponed the plan to visit. Some analysts believe that the meeting between Blint and Qin Gang has provided an opportunity to ease the tension between the United States and China.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/kw-06162023130012.html"><strong> International Organization calls on Brinkens to make account on Chinese human rights and the United States, and then you will be recruited </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-06142023113705.html">Bolling Kenkee's visit to China is an expert: the U.S. -China relations are difficult to change</a></strong></p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang welcomed the United States Secretary of State AntonyBlinken at the Diaoyutai State Guest House on Sunday. Qin Gang stretched out his hand first. After a few seconds, Brinken would come to shake hands with Qin Gang. The two did not talk to the media after taking pictures, and entered the conference room for closed -door talks.</p>
<p>Blink's less than 48 hours of whirlwind visits is quite compact. In addition to meeting with Qin Gang, he will also talk to Wang Yi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office of the Politburo.</p>
<p>At the earlier media briefing meeting, US officials faded any expectations of major progress in Blingken's visit, and "it is unlikely to make breakthroughs in any major issue."</p>
<p>"The most important purpose of the United States is the 'meeting'. The meeting this time makes the senior management of both parties really sit face to face." Huang Jiezheng, an associate professor of the Institute of International Affairs and Strategy of Tamkang University in Taiwan, told this station that at least the above meeting represents the balloon incident. The controversy caused by this page temporarily turned over. He believes that the tension of the rising tension of the evil line of the United States and China has slightly slowed down, and "this trip provides an opportunity to ease bilateral tension."</p>
<p>"With the continued tension of relations in the United States and China, the United States can build a pipeline of communication dialogue to the greatest extent, establish a mechanism for crisis management or risk avoidance." Song Guocheng, a researcher at the National Guan Center of Politburo in Taiwan, said This is the subjective expectation of the United States in China, but it does not mean that the United States shows weakness or reduces the siege of the CCP. The United States wants to "compete without confrontation."</p>

<p>Earlier, Brinken has expressed three purposes to visit Beijing: one is to establish an open communication channel, deal with misunderstandings, and avoid misjudgment; The third is to explore cooperation space for issues such as stabilizing global economy and climate change.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Qin Gang talked to Bollingen in front of the meeting. According to the official release of China's officials, Qin Gang explained the strict position on the issues of China ’s core concerns such as Taiwan’ s issues, emphasizing that the United States should respect, stop interference in China ’s internal affairs, and stop harming the interests of Chinese sovereign security development in the name of competition.</p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng analyzed that the first item has done the first step. The outside world expects subsequent high -level officials including Janet Yellen, including US Finance Minister Janet Yellen and Commercial Secretary Ginaraimondo. consensus. However, he believes that it is difficult to reach the second item. "The United States must clearly state the value of the United States. Core in Beijing's core interests. "</p>
<p>Song Guocheng emphasized that "the United States and China are still structural confrontation", involving the competition for global leadership. The Chinese Communist Party attempts to compete for Asian hegemony and expel the US military existence to the global leadership of the United States and even replace the United States.</p>
<p>"Its ambitions have not changed at all. It is not to be the role of world peaceful builders. It must be the role of the world's highest leader. Isn't that the global leadership position, isn't it the point of the two strong resistance? "Song Guocheng added.</p>

"The most important guest" Xi Jinping should not be absent. In addition, during the 20th National Group's Summit held in India this year, the leaders of the United States and China also had the opportunity to meet.</p>
<p>Song Guocheng pointed out that the only conclusion was "the next time for a while", but the substantial relationship between the United States and China has not improved. He said that from the perspective of Chinese military aircraft closer to the US military's approaching and rejection of the US -China military high -level dialogue, China did not show the sincerity of the dialogue.</p>

<p>June 18, 2023<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085791_b750fe71-e6db-4900-91ec-64af097bbd41.jpg" /><strong> For several months, the BBC has been secretly contacted with three people in North Korea. They disclosed for the first time that the government blocked the disaster after blocking the border more than three years ago. Hunger and brutal suppression, but there is no chance to escape. </strong></p>
<p>Ming Shu stared at the mobile phone with her body, fighting for the next sale. She is a savvy businessman who secretly sells smugglers to some urgent people with a small amount of supply, allowing her to live barely. She had been caught once, and it was reluctant to afford the dredging fee at that time before she was relieved.</p>
<p>She has almost no money to come again. However, knocking on the door may sound at any time. She was afraid of not only the police, but also her neighbors. Now she can hardly believe anyone. This is not the case. Mingshu's drug business was originally prosperous.</p>
<p>However, on January 27, 2020, North Korea suddenly closed the country to deal with the global epidemic. Citizens who have been banned from exporting are now closed in their own towns. Rescue workers and diplomats were packaged and left. The guards received the order, and any person near the border killed. The most isolated country in the world has become a black hole.</p>
<p>Under Kim Jong -un's totalitarian rule, North Korea was banned from contacting the outside world. With the help of the Northern Media "DailyNK" in the country in the country, the BBC was able to contact three North Korean civilians. They urgently want to tell the world about the catastrophic impact of Fengguan on their lives. They understand that if the government finds that they are reporting to us, they are likely to be executed. In order to protect them, we can only disclose what they tell us, but their experience provides a picture of rare domestic conditions in North Korea.</p>
<h3>Mingshu</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085793_h_ch1_dk_2560_x_1440.jpg" />"Our food conditions have never been so bad," Ming Shu told us. Like most North Korean women, she is the main economic source of the family. The meager salary obtained from the mandatory government work is basically worthless, which forces their wives to come up with various ways to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>Before the closure, Ming Shu would find an urgent need of antibiotics such as antibiotics in various ways, stole them from China, and then sold them to their local market. She needs to buy the border guards, which occupies half of her profits, but she accepts the rules of the game. This allows her to live a comfortable life in the northern town that borders in China.</p>
<p>The burden of supporting her family has always given her heavy pressure, but now this pressure makes her overwhelmed. It is almost impossible to find a sellable product. On one occasion, she wanted to steal the drug by herself, but was caught. Now she is always surveillance. She tried to sell domestic drugs in North Korea, but it is difficult to find this now, and her income is almost halved.</p>
<p>Now, her husband and children wake up every day, and she will prepare corn breakfast for them. Her hungry neighbors have begun to knock on the door for food, but she has to reject them. "We all live on the edge of life," she said.</p>
<h3>Chanhao</h3>
<p>In another town of the border, the construction worker Chan Hao was frustrated the day in the morning. "I want people to know that I regret being born in this country," he vented like this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085795_3c5e0bd7-f6f9-4b3d-b31d-ce2b4a91ee30.jpg" />He got up early, helped his wife to open the market, and then went to the construction site by himself. He did his best to help her move the goods and put it on the booth. He knew very well that he lived on her small business. He earns 4,000 North Korea -equivalent to $ 4 (£ 3) -the is not enough to buy a kilogram of rice, and his family has not received the government's grain for a long time, and he no longer expects.</p>
<p>He said that most North Koreans buying food markets are now almost empty, and the prices of rice, corn and seasonings have risen. Because the food produced by North Korea is not enough to be supplied to the citizens, it depends on imports. The blockade of the border allows the government to cut off the important food and fertilizers and machines for planting crops.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Chanhao was worried that he might die in the new crown, but over time, he began to worry about starving, especially after he watched the people around him died. The first to be starved to his village was a mother and her children. She was sick at the time. Her children rely on begging food to keep her life as much as possible, but in the end, all three died.</p>
<p>Then there was a mother who was sentenced to work because of violating the isolation order. She starved to death with her son. Recently, a acquaintance's son was released from the army because of malnutrition. Chanhao remembers that his face suddenly swelled, and then he died within a week. "I think of my children, thinking that we have to live in this unsatisfactory hell, and I can't sleep."</p>

<h4></h4>
<p>Hundreds of miles away, relatively rich capital Pyongyang, high -rise buildings on both sides of the rivers of the city. Zhiyan took the subway to work. After another sleepless night, she exhausted.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085797_132e4697-c7d8-4553-b58f-b5dc7afde75e.jpg" />Her two children and husbands live on the money she earns in a food store. She once stole fruits and vegetables in the store to sell in the market, and she also sold cigarettes received by her husband from colleagues, and then bought rice with those money. Now, every time she get off work, the bag is thoroughly searched, and her husband no longer receives bribes. No one can afford anything.</p>
<p>"They have no longer possible," she was worried. Zhiyan now pretends to have three meals every day, but in fact she only eats one meal. She was hungry and was better than others knowing that she was poor.</p>
<p>She couldn't forget for a week, she was forced to eat "paste" -the food that mixed vegetables and grass into porridge into a paste. This food is inseparable from the darkest period in North Korea's history -in the 1990s devastating famine abused the country, causing as many as 3 million people to die.</p>
<p>"We all plan to survive 10 days in advance, and then plan for 10 days after the plan, thinking that if my husband and I are hungry, at least we can feed the children," Zhiyan said. Recently, she hasn't eaten for two days. "I thought I would die in my sleep, and I couldn't wake up in the morning," she said."This is a disaster," she said. "Without overseas supply, people don't know how to make a living." Recently, she heard that someone committed suicide at home, and some people hid in the mountains and died. She was distressed by the cold mentality of the city. "Even if someone dies next door, you will only think about yourself. It's so ruthless."</p>

<p>During the new crown epidemic, the Pyongyang people wearing a mask are waiting for the train at an intersection.</p>
<p>For many months, the news of people's starving has been circulating, causing fear of may face another famine in North Korea. Peter Ward, an economist of North Korea, described the description of "very worrying".</p>
<p>"You heard that people starve to death are the same thing, but when you really know that the people around you are starving, this means that the food condition is very serious -worse than what we realize, and in the late 1990s The famine has been serious since any time, "he said.</p>
<p>North Korea's famine represents a turning point in the history of this country that is not long, causing its harsh social order to collapse. The government that cannot let people eat meals, give them fragmented freedom, and do what they need to do for life. Thousands of people fled out of the border and went to South Korea, Europe or the United States for refuge.</p>
<p>At the same time, the private market began to rise, and women began to sell soybeans, second -hand clothes and Chinese electronic products. A non -mainstream economy came into being, followed by a North Korean of the entire generation, and learned to make a living in the case of rarely helping the government -capitalists developed in a high -pressure communist country.</p>

<p>Children in North Korea's famine in the 1990s</p>
<p>The market went to the building one day, and Ming Shu was calculating her revenue. She was worried that the government would start the capitalist generation for her and this capitalist generation. She believes that the global popularity is just an excuse for the authorities to re -control the people's lives. "Indeed, they want to fight smuggling and prevent people from escaping," she said. "Now, even if you are near the river near the Chinese border, you will be severely punished."</p>
<p>Construction worker Chanhao also reached the point of the collapse. This is the most difficult time he has experienced. The famine was difficult, he said, but at the time there was no such harsh suppression and punishment. "If people want to escape, the government can't do anything," he said. "Now, you may be executed in a wrong step."</p>
<p>His friend's son has recently witnessed the execution of the government several times. Three or four people were killed every time, and the charges were trying to escape. "If I live according to the rules, I am likely to starve to death, but as long as I try to escape, I am afraid that I may be arrested, the label as a traitor, and then to execute," Chanhao told us. "We are trapped here and wait for die."</p>
<p>In front of the border blockade, more than 1,000 escapers will arrive in South Korea each year, but after that, the number of people who are known to escape and reach South Korea is very small. Satellite pictures analyzed by Human Rightswatch (Human Rightswatch) show that the authorities have built many walls, fences and defense points along the border in the past three years, making it almost impossible to escape.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130128893_satellite_imagery_shows_borders_have_been_fortified_640x2_fixed-nc.png" />Just trying to contact foreign people is becoming more and more dangerous. In the past, residents near the border could also use mobile phones to be transported in from China to secretly call abroad through the mobile network of China Unicom. Now, Chanhao said that at each community party, people with Chinese mobile phones will be asked to surrender. Recently, a person he met by Ming Shu was discovered to call on the phone with the people in China, and was sentenced to several years.</p>
<p>Hannasong (transliteration) of the North Korean Human Rights Data Center (NKDB) said that by cracking down on smuggling and preventing people from contacting the outside world, the government is also depriving the people of the country to make a living. "When a grain is scarce, the government fully realizes what kind of damage this will cause," she said.</p>
<p>However, these extreme control measures cannot resist the new crown virus. On May 12, 2022, nearly two and a half years after the global popularity, North Korea officially confirmed its first confirmed case. Because there is no detection method, the people who have a fever are actually held at home for 10 days. The whole family will be prohibited from taking a step. As the epidemic spread, the town and the street were completely blocked, and sometimes it was more than two weeks.</p>
<p>In Pyongyang, Zhiyan looked at some neighbors out of her windows. They did not have enough food to adhere to the entire blockade period, and there was vegetables in front of them every day. But along the border, there is no help.</p>
<p>Ming Shu was panicked. Her life was already very tight, and the cabinets at home were empty. That's how she had to go crazy to sell medicine secretly. She felt the risk of getting sick to make money and starve to death.</p>
<p>Chanhao said that when the blockade was lifted, five families had "half dead". They only went out to find food after dark. "Those who stayed at home could not live," he said.</p>
<p>"People begged loudly, saying that they were starving to death, and for a few days, the government issued some rice from the inventory," he said. It is reported that the blockade in some areas has been lifted in advance, and people are obviously unable to survive if that.</p>
<p>Those infected people cannot rely on national ruined hospitals to treat them. Even the basic drugs are used up. The official suggestion is to use folk therapy to relieve symptoms. When Zhiyan became ill, he called his friends desperately. They suggested that she use boiling water to drink green onion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130086111_screenshot2023-06-14at10.00.58.png" />According to Zhiyan, many elderly people and children died in the 2019 coronary virus. Health experts said that in a United Nations, 40%of countries with malnutrition of population are different from other countries, and children's infection is reasonable. A doctor in the city told Yan Yan that during the outbreak of the epidemic, every 550 people in Pyongyang died.</p>
<p>If it is calculated to the entire country, it is equivalent to more than 45,000 people, which is hundreds of times higher than the official announcement. But she got the news that everyone was informed of another cause of death, such as tuberculosis or liver cirrhosis.</p>
<p>In August 2022, three months after the outbreak of the epidemic, the government announced the victory of resistance, claiming that the virus had been cleared in China, but many isolation measures and regulations still took effect."I think those leaders have determined that the new crown virus can kill many people, at least the people who are not damaging, they are worried about those who will die," Peter Ward said. He refers to the army and elites that keep their power for the Jin family. There is one of the worst medical systems around the world. The overall population is malnourished and has not been vaccinated. Many people will die for a reasonable prediction.</p>
<p>But Song Hannah said that the new crown epidemic also gave Kim Jong Un a great opportunity to re -control people's lives. "This is what he wants to do secretly for a long time," she said. "His first priority has always been as much as possible to be isolated and controlled by his people."</p>

<p>End of podcast</p>
<p>After making a little meager dinner, Zhiyan washed the dishes and cleaned her home. She climbed up to bed very early, hoping that she could rest better tonight. She will probably sleep more than Chanhao. The current work is very busy, and Chanhao often sleeps in the construction site.</p>
<p>However, in the relatively quiet border town of Ming Shu, she fell a little time, sitting with her family to watch TV, and used the battery that was charged during the day.</p>
<p>She especially likes watching Korean dramas, although these are prohibited. The show was sold and secretly sold through miniature SD cards. The latest episode that Ming Shu saw was about a K-Pop star appeared at the door of the family, claiming that he was his son who had been separated for many years. She said that since the border blockade, there are almost no new programs that can enter the border. In addition, the crackdown was very severe, and people became more careful.</p>
<p>She refers to the Reactionary Ideology and Culture RejectionAct adopted in December 2020. According to this law, people who smuggle foreign imaging products may be executed. Chanhao said that this is the "most terrible new law", and just watching these videos may face 10 years of imprisonment. According to the legal text obtained by "Daily North Korea", the purpose of the law is to prevent "a kind of decaying ideology that erodes our society".</p>
<p>Kim Jong -un's most worried thing is that his people understand the prosperous and free world outside their border, and wake up from the lies they hear.</p>
<p>Chanhao said that since the law was passed, foreign videos have almost disappeared. Only the younger generation dares to watch, which makes their parents extremely worried.</p>
<p>Zhiyan remembers a recent public trial in Pyongyang. Local leaders gathered together to judge a 22 -year -old man who shared Korean songs and movies. He was sentenced to 10 years and three months in the labor camp. Zhiyan said that before 2020, the trial of such cases usually only carried out quietly, and may be sentenced to one year in prison.</p>
<p>"The punishment is so much so much, and people are shocked," she said, "It's terrible, they are targeted at young people like this."</p>
<p>In 2019, former North Korean diplomat Ryu Hyun-Woo, a former North Korean diplomat, said that the formulation of the law is to ensure the loyalty of young people, because the attitude they developed is very different from their parents. "We have received a gift from the country since we were young, but under the leadership of Kim Jong -un, the country has not given the people anything," he said. Young people now question what the country has given them.</p>
<p>Zhiyan said that in order to implement this law, the government has established a group and "relentlessly" fights everywhere to fight anything that is considered anti -socialism. "People don't trust each other now, and the fear is huge."</p>
<p>Zhiyan said she was taken to ask for this new law. Since she was questioned, she no longer revealed her true thoughts to others. She is now more afraid of people than before.</p>
<p>For Professor Andreilankov, who has studied North Korea for 40 years, this trust is worrying. "If people don't trust each other, they can't talk about resistance," he said. "This means that North Korea can maintain stability and exist in the next few years or even decades."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130086115_screenshot2023-06-14at10.01.52.png" />In January 2023, the government passed another law to prohibit people from using vocabulary reminiscent of Korean dialects. Violation of this law may also constitute a death penalty in the most extreme circumstances. Zhiyan said that the law is now too much to remember, and those who are taken away may not know which one they have been accused. If they want to ask, the prosecutor will only answer, "You don't need to know which law you have committed."</p>
<p>"The three Korean people who interviewed the interviews confirmed a amazing point of view. North Korea is more high and totalitarian than in the past at any time." Korea's Sokeel Park said, "This is the disaster tragedy that is currently being performed."</p>
<p>Recently, there are signs that the authorities may be open to the border. Ming Shu and Chanhao, who lived near the border, said that most of them in the town had vaccinated the new crown vaccine -they estimated that it was a Chinese vaccine -in Pyongyang, Zhiyan said that a considerable number of people had already vaccinated two shots Essence In addition, customs data shows that the country is allowing some grains and flour to be imported from China again, which is likely to be to alleviate the shortage and avoid famine that many people are afraid of.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130128894_north_korea_rice_imports_640-2x-nc.png" />The control system that appears during the popular period is likely to be consolidated. This will make it more difficult for us to understand this country, and it is a pity that it will be much more difficult to understand everything that happens to what they have been instilled. "They must participate in the life summary every week, which is the mandatory activity of each citizen. Here, they have to admit their mistakes and failures while reporting their shortcomings. These meetings are designed to encourage good behavior and take out unusual molecules. They can never admit it in the classroom, but Chanhao said that people no longer believe in the publicity on TV.</p>
<p>"The country tells us that we are inhabited in the arms of our mother, but what kind of mother will kill him because the child does not want to starve in China because the child does not want to hungry?" He asked. "Before the new crown, people's views on Kim Jong -un are positive," Ming Shu said. "But now, almost everyone is dissatisfied."</p>
<p>Zhiyan remembers that when Kim Jong -un and US President Trump met with nuclear weapons in 2018, she was full of hope and joy, thinking that maybe she could go to foreign travel soon. The negotiations have been ruptured later. Since then, Kim Jong -un has continued to use its limited finances for nuclear weapons development and reject all diplomatic proposals in the international community. In 2022, he conducted a record number of missile tests.</p>
<p>"We were deceived," Zhiyan said, "Border blockade made our lives back 20 years. We feel deeply betrayed."</p>
<p>"The people never want this endless weapon development, it brings hardships to generations," she sighed.</p>
<p>Chanhao accused the international community. "The United States and the United Nations seem to be stupid," he said, questioning why they still proposed to negotiate with Kim Jong -un, it is clear that he would not give up nuclear weapons. On the contrary, the construction worker also hopes that the United States will attack his country.</p>
<p>"We can live only through war and get rid of the entire leadership," he said. "We must end this regime in some ways."</p>
<p>Ming Shu agreed to this. "If you start war, people will abandon our government," she said, "This is reality."</p>
<p>But Yan Yan hopes to have a simple way. She wants to live in a society where people are not hungry, neighbors can live, and they do not need to monitor each other. They can eat rice in three meals a day.</p>
<p>When we heard her news last time, she did not have enough food to feed the child.</p>
<p>We submit our survey results to the Korean government. The representative of the country's embassy in London said: "The information you collected is not exactly in line with the facts, because it is a testimony from the forces of the Anti -North Korea's Democratic People's Republic. One, and unswervingly maintain the well -being of the people. "</p>
<p>"Even in the face of the test and challenge, the people's well -being is our first priority."</p>

<p>Description: On the morning of June 18, US Secretary of State Brills arrived in Beijing and held a five and a half hour meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. This is also the first US Secretary of State's visit to China after 2018, and it is also the highest -level American officials who visited China since 2021. However, Brinten's trip is unlikely to cause major turns in the cold Sino -US relations.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Brinchen(Antony shine)It should have been visited China in February this year, but it delayed its trip because of a suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States. He landed in Beijing on the morning of June 18, local time, and met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang at the Diaoyutai State Hotel in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters reporter, Qin Gang greeted Brinken at the door of a villa in the National Hotel, instead of greeting in the house as usual. As soon as the two entered the door, they conducted a brief English conversation. Qin Gang asked Brinken's long -distance travel situation, and then shook hands in front of the national flag of China and the United States. After entering a conference room, journalists were briefly allowed to enter the photo, but neither foreign minister did not make any remarks in front of the reporter.</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and spokesman, posted a photo of Qin Gang and Brinken with Twitter, and sent a text "I hope this talk can help guide <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美关系/t-17455900">Sino -US relations</a>Return to the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Bali. "Hua Chunying also attended the Diaoyutai State Guest House.</p>
<p>In November last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Biden held a bilateral meeting during the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. He had a straightforward dialogue on issues such as Taiwan and North Korea. Essence</p>
<p>Blint will stay in China for two days. It is expected that Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the CPC Central Committee on June 19, may meet Xi Jinping. The trip to Brinkon is to seek to establish open and lasting communication channels between the United States and China to ensure that the strategic confrontation between the two countries will not evolve into a conflict. The outside world expects that Brintken's talks with China can pave the way for more US -China bilateral exchanges in the next few months, including US Treasury Secretary Yellen.(Janet Yelle), Minister of Commerce Raymond Duo(Religious ramond)Possible access. At the same time, Brosky may also be committed to laying a foundation for Biden and Xi Jinping at a meeting at the multilateral summit later this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T10-27-00Z/65952775_404.jpg" />After the meeting with Qin Gang, Brinkee will meet Wang Yi next, and may be traveled to Jun Ping.</p>
<h3><strong> Management and control risk </strong></h3>
<p>On June 17, US President Biden said that he was looking forward to meeting Xi Jinping within a few months. When talking about the balloon incident in February this year, Biden said that Chinese leaders may not know the specific position and use of the balloon at the time.</p>
<p>The balloon incident allowed Sino -US relations that had just recovered because of the meeting with Xi Jinping at the time <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美外长通话-秦刚暗指双边关系困难责任在美方/a-65910231">re -slide into the bottom of the valley</a>, And directly caused Brinken to postpone the visits to China in February. In the next few months, high -level exchanges between the two countries were almost interrupted; and despite the United States repeatedly tried, China was unwilling to conduct regular military talks with Washington.</p>
<p>An accompanying senior officials in the United States State Department told Reuters reporters when they stopped Tokyo to supplement fuel that both the United States and China now realize that both countries do need to have high -level communication channels. "Relations between the two countries are at an important node. I think it is very important to reduce the risk of misjudgment, or as Chinese friends often say: to prevent the spiral of the relationship between the relationship between the two countries from falling down."</p>
<p>At present, there are major differences in the fields of China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, Trade, Semiconductor, Human Rights and other fields. The outside world is worried that any form of friction upgrade may have a significant negative impact on global financial markets, trade, and supply chains.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T10-27-00Z/64610458_404.jpg" />The balloon incident in February directly led Brinken to delay in visiting China</p>
<h3><strong> US side reduces expectations </strong></h3>
<p>At a press conference on June 16, Brinken once said that the three main goals to go to Beijing this time are: establishing <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688">crisis management and control</a>Mechanisms, promote the protection of the interests of the United States and allies and directly talk about concerns about issues and explore potential cooperation areas. Brinken said he would also mention the issue of being detained in China in China, and the United States believed that there was political motivation.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department's website pointed out that Brinkens will meet with senior Chinese officials during his visit to China. Blint will discuss the importance of "maintaining open communication channels" and "responsible handling Sino -US relations".

<p>(Voice of Germany) "Dry mango" is a homophonic vocabulary used by netizens during the election in Taiwan, which means that the votes are urged by stimulating the "feeling of the country". Taiwan's "report" publishing article "What exactly what Xi Jinping sells" dry mango "to do", the author Zhuoran pointed out that according to the logic of the CCP official media, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论习近平的极限思维是什么意思/a-65909139">the extreme situation in Xi Jinping's heart probably refers to the final battle between China and the United States</a>So what would his "worst plan"? On June 5th, Xi Jinping inspected Inner Mongolia, convened cadres to meet again to emphasize extreme thinking again, singing his dual -cycle theory, claiming that the rice bowl should be brought in his own hands. , Live better!"With this highest instructions, the leaders of all provinces and cities have made various strange movements such as" retreating forests and returning farming "and" rice up the mountains ", which made the people resentment.</p>
<p>The article said that Xi Jinping's sense of death should not be worrying. After the clearing of Lingyatan, the housing market is still dying. Both imports and exports have declined significantly. No matter how faint Xi Jinping is, you should also know that it is impossible to keep up with technology to maintain stability.</p>
<p>Many people are curious when the CCP is here. The author believes that its large limit will be deeply bound to the housing market. The CCP's finance relies on the sale of public land, but the residential houses only buy the right to use and have no rights. It is equivalent to paying 70 years of renting for the government at one time. The Chinese commercial housing system was launched in 1979, and the showdown is not far away. Once the people awakened, when the CCP collapsed, Xi Jinping probably understood this. Before the limit came, finding a US to the United States may be the best choice for the contradiction.</p>

<h3><strong> "May Rongguang return to Hong Kong"? The Chinese Communist Party wants to pinch this golden bird </strong></h3>
<p>Taiwan's "Wind Media" published an article "Beijing will not hesitate to pinch the golden silk birds". The author Gu Erd believes, "Hong Kong today, tomorrow in Taiwan" does not necessarily be regarded as a curse, but it is definitely a vigilance Essence Recently, the Hong Kong Government <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论消失的香港由禁歌開始/a-65941658">Banning "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong</a>The big move is a bloody lesson -in order not to hear the bird singing this song, he squeezes the birds to death.</p>
<p>The reason why Hong Kong has become an important financial center and trading center in Asia in the past is that Hong Kong enjoys freedom of information. After the implementation of the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District, this freedom has been restricted.

Don't Beijing worry about this negative effect? The author believes that Chrispatten, the last governor of Hong Kong, provides a answer.</p>
<p>In a recent discussion, Pengding said that instead of regarding Hong Kong as a Chinese golden chicken, it is better to be regarded as a golden bird. "I always think that Hong Kong should be the golden bird in the pit, let everyone know whether the power of China is getting larger and larger, whether Hong Kong can really maintain such a free society." He wrote in the "Hong Kong Diary" in the "Hong Kong Diary". Tao: "If the Chinese Communist Party believes that it is necessary to pinch the golden bird to ensure that the Chinese Communist regime can continue, would they hesitate? I always feel that the answer is not. Even if such evil behaviors are observed Not good, they will not hesitate. "</p>

Although he was supported by extensive public opinion in Taiwan, he was attacked by a lot of conspiracy theory outside Taiwan. Discover sixth four. Singapore's "Duan Media" published an article "Facing the charges of sexual assault, should the public" suspect "? Can public opinion be neutral? ", The author Lin Yubo believes that the Chinese Communist Party will indeed use the" sex scandal "as a means to discredit the different people, but the allegations of Wang Dan's sexual harassment are not the groundwriter of the third party, nor is it not the arrest and persecution of the television to plead guilty to the television. The incident of "being priested" came from the party's own statement, and it was more detailed statement by the parties. It is unreasonable to depict the parties as "unsatisfactory", which is a typical slander of sexual violence experience, especially the slander of sexual violence experience in power relationships.

<p>The article said that for sexual violence, criminal Rashi Vidyasagar advocated rethinking "justice". She proposed that the righteousness we are familiar with is usually "retaliation justice", that is, the individual must be punished for what he must do.

Because in the face of revenge justice, "suspicious crime is not" important-even if 1,000 defendants are allowed to be free, one innocent person is not allowed to be punished. But we should be included in "restramed justice"), "Repairing Justice" does not regard the criminals as a natural wicked, but instead to test how the social environment makes him a criminal and review what kind of culture makes sexual assault and what kind of culture makes the victims the victims.

<p>(Voice of Germany) more than 40 years ago, on January 31, 1979, when the leader of the Chinese Communist Party Deng Xiaoping visited the United States, he signed the China -US Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement with then US President Carter when he visited the United States. This landmark agreement released a strong signal at the time, indicating that even the opponent can still put on the dispute and make common efforts.</p>
<p>At present, the US -China bilateral relations have been in the worst state in the past decades. Several officials familiar with Washington said that the government is postponing the US -China Science and Technology Agreement (STA) as usual later this year.</p>
<p>Although U.S. Secretary of State Brills arrived in Beijing on Sunday for the first time in US Secretary of State's visit to China for the first time, it was basically unwilling to break through the interview. Whether the Sino -US Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement continues the current setbacks, it highlights the following issues: The US government has not yet determined that the benefits of US -China cooperation have more benefits, or are they more risky? This issue is dividing the decision makers of the American politics.</p>
<p>This agreement was signed during the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China. It has been updated every 5 years since then. It has been known as the stable factors in relations between the two countries. The fields of cooperation include basic research in the fields of atmosphere, agriculture, physics, and chemistry. The development of academic and commercial exchanges in the United States and China laid the foundation.</p>
<p>These exchanges have undoubtedly promoted the process of becoming a technology and military power, but at the same time, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/走私美国海洋技术-中国商人在美遭判2年徒刑/a-59128825">American politics is concerned about the stolen science and commercial secrets of China</a>So that the agreement continued before it expired on August 27 this year.</p>

<h3>Shooting</h3>
<p>A balloon in China fluttered over the United States for a few days. On February 4, the U.S. military shot down in the coastal waters of the South Carolina. The United States has accused China of using balloons for espionage. But China said that this is just an out of control meteorological balloon.</p>

<h3>search</h3>
<p>The shot of balloon fell into the sea a few miles away from the coast of South Carolina. The U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard positioned the areas where the balloon fell, and sent helicopters and ships to sort out the wreckage of balloons in the fall area.</p>

<p>It looks like fishermen are fishing a large jellyfish, but in fact, this is a group member of the US military who is responsible for dealing with explosives. This balloon has a diameter of about 61 meters, and the weight is equivalent to a small passenger aircraft.</p>

<h3>wreckage</h3>
<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters. The U.S. military is trying to salvage more wreckage in order to more accurately understand the actual use of this flying object.</p>

<h3>tool</h3>
<p>The U.S. military uses special equipment such as underwater drones to search and salvage balloon wreckage. The "Explorer" -class marine measurement ship uses the sound of sound to find the wreckage fragments in the fall area. According to the U.S. military, the search area is about 2.25 square kilometers.</p>

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<h3><strong>主流似乎支持延长协议</strong></h3>
<p>目前，美国政界的主流观点似乎是支持延长协议，但反对的声音却越来越高。美国国务院拒绝对此发表评论。国家安全委员会也保持缄默。中国驻华盛顿大使馆称，中方早在一年前就主动与美方接触探讨该协议，并称该协议构成了两国40年来 "富有成效 "的合作基础。</p>
<p>中国驻美大使馆发言人刘鹏宇对路透社表示，"据我们所知，美方仍在就续签协议进行内部审查"，他说双方可以考虑对原协议进行相应调整，"希望美方能在协议到期前加快内部审查"。</p>
<p>Those who support the continuation of the agreement believe that they will stifle academic and commercial cooperation at the end of the agreement. People who support the extension of the US -China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement also believe that if there is no agreement, the United States will lose observation channels for Chinese scientific and technological progress. Denissimon, a Chinese science and technology strategy expert at the University of North Carolina, said, "whether China is a friend or an enemy, the United States, the United States It is necessary to understand what happened in China. "The opponents believed that the signing of the agreement that year made the relationship between the two countries" feel good ", but this atmosphere no longer exists.</p>

This is the first meeting since the start-up interest rate hike cycle in March 2022. In a policy statement, the Fed stated that "maintaining interest rates unchanged can give the committee the opportunity to evaluate more economic information and its monetary policy meanings in the future." In the summary of economic forecasting, the committee's prediction of economic growth at the end of 2023 has increased. The median number has increased significantly from 0.4%in March to 1%, and the unemployment rate has decreased from 4.5%to 4.1%. 3.6%increased to 3.9%, and the most striking policy interest rates increased from 5.1%to 5.6%.</p>
<p>What are the factors of the three -month interval that has improved the Fed's prediction of the economy? The most important reason may be continuous employment. New non -agricultural employment raised from 217,000 in March to 340,000 in May, exceeding market expectations. In addition, the decline of energy prices and the improvement of the supply chain have also boosted the economy.</p>

Prime Minister AnthonyalBanese will decide the referendum date within a few weeks. The referendum is currently expected to fall from October to December. This will be the first referendum since Australia held the Republican referendum in 1999. The proposal revised into the Republic system was eventually rejected.</p>
<p>This referendum will become an important moment of politics in Australian countries, which will help define the significance of being Australians and redefine the relationship between Aboriginal people and white people.</p>
<p>If the proposal is passed, the Australian Aboriginal people who have lived in Australia for at least 60,000 years will be recognized for the first time. The Aboriginal people and the Torresstrait islander will also obtain the rights given by the Constitution to give Congress a law that affects their own affairs to the laws that affect their own affairs. Member's suggestions.</p>
<p>Angonis said: "Today, our parliament has said" good "to the referendum. Now, the Australian people will have the opportunity to say" good "to the reconciliation and say" good "to the Aboriginal people to the Constitution.</p>
<p>The polls show that most people support the so -called "Voice of Congress", but as the debate becomes more and more gunpowder, the support rate is also declining.</p>
<p>Australian Aboriginal people account for about 3.2%of the national population of nearly 26 million, and are lower than the national average in most social economic indicators. They used to be marginalized by British colonial rulers and did not obtain voting rights until the 1960s.</p>

<p>The US State Department said that US Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeng held a "frank, substantial and constructive" talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing.</p>
<p>On the occasion of stabilizing the relationship between stability, the talks on Sunday on Sunday marked the beginning of the highest level of visit to China in the past five years.</p>
<p>State Council spokesman Matthew Miller said, "Secretary of State emphasizes diplomacy and the communication channels that maintain openness on all issues to reduce the importance of the risk of misunderstanding and misjudgment."</p>
<p>According to official media reports, Qin Gang told Brinken that China is committed to establishing a "stable, predictable and constructive" relationship with the United States.</p>
<p>He also clearly expressed China's concern about the core interests including Taiwan, and said it was the "most prominent risk" in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>Before the talks, US officials believed that from the efforts of trade and the United States that hindered China's semiconductor industry, to Taiwan issues and Beijing's human rights records, the possibility of obtaining any breakthroughs between the two major economies between the world's largest economies was very likely Small.</p>
<p>Miller pointed out, "Secretary of State has raised some concern issues, and opportunities to explore cooperation on common multinational issues that are consistent with our interests."</p>
<p>He pointed out that Brinken invited Qin Gang to visit the Washington Special Economic Zone "to continue the discussion and they agreed to arrange for each other's appropriate time for mutual visits."</p>
<p>The two -day visit to the US senior diplomat was conducted in the background of bilateral relations. Earlier in February, he found suspected spy balls over the United States, which led him to delay the visits scheduled to be in the same month.</p>
<p>Due to the differences in a series of issues such as trade, technology and regional security, both countries have expressed their cautious hope to improve communication.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney's Burenden Oconn said that there are still many jobs to do a lot of work to repair the relationship with China, including "opening more communication channels."</p>

<p>Bayon weakened the balloon incident when he went to China when he went to China. He said: "I think the Chinese leadership does not know where it is, what it is inside, and what happened. Awkward."</p>
<p>Biden said he hopes to meet again with Xi Jinping. Previously, the two sides held long talks after the G20 National Summit held in Bali in November, and the two agreed with Brinken's visit at the meeting.</p>
<p>Biden said, "I hope that in the next few months, I will meet with (President of China) Xi Jinping again to discuss the reasonable differences between us and the fields we can get along."</p>
<p>The two leaders may attend the next G20 summit held in New Delhi in September. At the same time, Xi Jinping was invited to visit San Francisco in November. At that time, the United States will receive the leaders of the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leader.</p>

The water channel has important strategic significance: rich fishery resources; possible oil and natural gas mines; a trade transit of $ 3 trillion each year.(Peninsula TV Station)#### "Spiral Out of Control"</p>
<p>A recent phone call between Brinken and Qin Gang emphasized the intensification of tensions between the two sides.</p>
<p>"Beijing is seeking the United States guarantee that the red line that will not interfere with its internal affairs and will not cross its core interests, especially Taiwan."</p>
<p>However, the expectation of any major breakthroughs on this visit is very low.</p>
<p>"But this does not mean that it is not important, especially China's neighboring countries are very worried that the relationship will become so bad, so that the tension is likely to lose control into some open conflict."</p>
<p>The relationship between Beijing and Washington has deteriorated, which is worrying that the two countries may have a military conflict one day. China has repeatedly stated that Taiwan is an indispensable part of China's territory.</p>
<p>There are also differences between the two sides on issues such as trade, the United States' efforts to curb China's semiconductor industry, and Beijing's human rights records.</p>
<p>In particular, the neighboring country is worried that although the United States has repeatedly tried dialogue, the former is unwilling to have regular military dialogues with Washington.</p>

<p>Blingken said at a press conference before Beijing on Friday that the three main goals of his trip were: establish a crisis management mechanism, promote the interests of the United States and its allies, and directly talk about related issues, and explore potential cooperation areas.</p>
<p>"If we want to ensure that our competition with China will not evolve into a conflict like what we do, then we must first communicate."</p>
<p>The United States has also been closely linked to allies. Blingken talked with Japan and South Korea during the 20 -hour journey across the Pacific.</p>
<p>Biden National Security Consultant Jack Shalvin also went to Tokyo to participate in a separate three -party meeting involving Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.</p>

<p>When aircraft manufacturers receive hundreds of orders, airlines are also preparing to welcome the number of passengers close to the record this year, and the aerospace industry is returning to Le Bourget Airport in the outskirts of Paris.</p>
<p>Russia's war in Ukraine has also led countries to increase military expenditure, which may benefit aviation defense companies.</p>
<p>About 2,500 companies lined up to show the latest aircraft, drones, helicopters and flight taxis.</p>
<p>Guillaume Faury, head of the French Aerospace Association (Gifas) and CEO of Airbus, described this air show as "a beautiful old time."</p>
<p>The exhibition area of Paris Airlines exhibition covers an area of 125,000 square meters (equivalent to 18 football fields). It is expected to attract about 320,000 visitors during a week -long event.</p>
<p>The air buses and rival Boeing are competitive, and they are scrambling to announce up to billions of dollars aircraft orders.</p>
<p>The Paris Air Show held at Lebul, together with the Farnborough Aviation Show, which was held in the past few years, was an important sales activity of civil and defense industries.</p>
<p>At least 158 aircraft, helicopters, and drones were exhibited in Paris Air Show this time. From the latest long-distance commercial jets to the latest hiding fighter F-35 in the United States.</p>
<p>There will be 425 manufacturers in the United States to participate in the exhibition. This is due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and people are interested in military equipment. There are also 46 companies in the air show to attend, but excluding sanctioned Russia.</p>
<p>China, which has not been restricted by the new crown borders earlier this year, will also send representatives to participate. However, China does not show its first domestic Zhongshu passenger aircraft C919, which aims to compete with the Airbus A320NEO and Boeing 737 MAX.</p>

China expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition on the 18th.</p>

<p>A source told Reuters on the 14th that Togenhart's meeting with Tang Feng was for "common security benefits." Britain has only established formal diplomatic relations with China, but still has offices with the functions of actual motion halls in Taipei. Although the British Primary Minister will hold talks with officials at the same level in Taiwan, the British Minister does not meet with Taiwanese officials in accordance with the convention.</p>
<p>Togenhart was not the official minister of the British Cabinet, but attended the cabinet meeting as a security minister and was responsible for cracking down on terrorism, domestic national threats and economic crimes. Two years ago, Togenhart was sanctioned by Chinese sanctions for publicly issuing remarks on human rights in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>Luke Depulford, Chief Executive CEO of the China Policy Council of China, said that according to him, this is the first time that the British Cabinet Conference members met with Taiwan Ministers. "This is worthy of welcome and sent the right information."</p>
<p>Pei Londe pointed out: "Security affairs ministers against the pressure of other departments have established a precedent that all ministers can follow, which is worthy of appreciation."</p>
<p>Reuters reports that bilateral officials are unwilling to talk about this, which shows the sensitivity of the meeting.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the British Ministry of Political Affairs said: "We do not often comment on the ministers' private conferences."</p>
<p>Tang Feng's office also refused to comment.</p>
<p>Tang Feng released a photo she was reading on Twitter on Thursday, the title of "New Technology: How Our Dreams Become a Social Nightmare and what we can do."

<p>Tang Feng wrote in the tweet: "Learning from Tonenhart can bring a return. I look forward to reading the minister's digital insight. I also look forward to deepening the relationship between Taiwan and the United Kingdom and more cooperation in the field of science and technology. Let us</p>

<p>"Do you still remember that you have a habit of looking at the material table recently? Because of your little behavior, you have naturally started to change ..."</p>
<p>At the 15th meeting (COP15) of the Conference of the Contract Council (COP15), which was held in Montreal, Canada in December last year, Wildbound, the non -profit educational organization, released the world's first in the world. Continuous palm oil game- "People in the Forest".</p>
<p>In this text adventure game, players make a choice of consumption, investment and production methods by playing different roles such as ordinary consumers, palm oil companies, and small farmers, so as to produce the habitat and biological diversity of red hair orangutan Different effects.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese folk social organizations have carried out many activities to increase the awareness of palm oil of Chinese consumers. Palm oil has not yet become a public issue in China. Most Chinese people know nothing about palm oil, let alone care about its sustainable issues. Ru Mingyi, the chief Development Officer of Ye Sheng, said, "It is a long -term job to improve the awareness of Chinese consumers' palm oil. Although it is full of challenges, it is by no means impossible."</p>
<p>According to the "2022 Sustainable Consumption Report" jointly released by Shangdao and interface news, with the publicity of the government's "double carbon" goals, more and more Chinese consumers recognize the impact of their consumer behavior on the environment and society. As the main consumer population, consumers aged 21-140 are more likely to be guided by low -carbon information. Not only can they accept higher premiums, they are also willing to share their experiences. However, the report also mentioned that the popularity of most sustainable relevant certification standards and logos remains to be improved, and sustainable palm oil is one of them.</p>
<p><strong> Palm oil for consumer invisible palm oil </strong></p>
<p>China is the world's second largest palm oil importer and the third largest consumer country. In the past two years (2020 and 2021), China's palm oil imports have remained at about 7 million tons, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Although China has high demand for palm oil, its demand for sustainable palm oil is very low. According to a 2020 report from the United Nations Development Program, only about 1%of the palm oil imported from China have obtained sustainable certification. Similarly, a study by the World Natural Foundation (WWF) in 2021 shows that only about 4-7%of Chinese consumed palm oil has passed the Roundtableon Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification.</p>
<p>Insufficient consumer awareness is one of the reasons for China's limited demand for sustainable palm oil. 80%of China's imported palm oil is applied to the food industry, but most Chinese consumers do not know the palm oil that eats into the belly. The Consumer Survey conducted by the Beijing Representative Office of the World Nature Foundation showed that 46%of the 5,000 respondents had not heard of palm oil, let alone the connection between unsustainable palm oil and forest cutting.</p>
<p>The reason for this phenomenon is that the fuzzy label makes the palm oil be invisible in the consumer market. Since 2014, EU laws have demanded the specific types of vegetable oils (including palm oil) on the food component table. Under the requirements of the current bills in China and many other countries, foods using palm oil only need to mark "vegetable oil" on the packaging. In addition, the palm oil industry produces many complex derivatives for home supplies and personal care products. These products usually do not clearly indicate that palm oil is the original ingredient, and users naturally cannot know.</p>
<p>The discussion of palm oil about palm oil is not much, and what initially attracted attention was its impact on health. In 2005, a instant noodle brand played the slogan "Non -Fried" in the advertisement, and the palm oil used by fried instant noodles also entered the consumer's vision. However, the public's attention to palm oil was once limited to whether the characteristics of the high saturated fat content brought health risks. People's Health Network posted that "Although too much intake is not good for health, the human body also needs an appropriate amount of saturated fatty acids. "" ".</p>
<p><strong> How to make palm oil be seen? </strong></p>
<p>The low awareness of palm oil for ordinary public has increased difficulty to consumers' propaganda and advocacy activities. Lu Mingyi introduced that in order to attract more people to participate, the current domestic activities are generally designed and promoted and educated projects under the framework of biological diversity and forest protection.</p>
<p>In 2020, RSPO and Wild Sheng cooperated to launch the "Changemakers for Nature" initiative. Co -founder Isabelnepstad and Yao Songqiao initially hoped to bring young people to Amazon Rainforest, witness the cutting forests of the cut, and intuitively experience the importance of protecting forests and biological diversity.</p>
<p>Due to the epidemic, the goal becomes difficult to implement, and the participants can only learn through online and offline courses, and create their own influence items and solutions after the course. The content of the course also includes the knowledge of sustainable palm oil. One of the trainees Yang Yang produced a sustainable palm oil initiative short film "Behind the Shelves", and the entire platform played more than one million times.</p>
<p>Lu Mingyi said that the biggest difficulty encountered in the process is that it is difficult to buy products with sustainable palm oil certification in the market. Therefore, this concept can only be implemented when organizing activities, and there is no corresponding product and consumption scenario to match. Even if consumers agree with the importance of sustainable palm oil, it is difficult to make practical changes when buying.</p>
<p>Natural founders have tried to advocate the production of some sustainable products. However, companies have found that the entire procurement process of sustainable palm oil is more complicated, long cycles and not flexible. "So simple. In the end, they lost their interest, and they were only willing to wait until the industrial chain was relatively sound before trying.</p>
<p>In addition to educating young consumers, they also chose to cooperate with Nanjing Hongshan Zoo to integrate the relevant information of sustainable palm oil into the "Orangutan Care Week Tour Club" held by the zoo and promote tourists. Lu Mingyi believes that after visiting the red -haired orangutan in the zoo, he associated with them, and it was more effective to advocate on this basis.</p>
<p>The Linzhong game game introduced at the beginning of the article also started with the protection of red Moso Orangutan and promoted the importance of sustainable palm oil on the protection of red orangutan and its habitat, but the internal logic was also directly linked to the supply chain of palm oil.</p>
<p><strong> Can companies guide consumers? </strong></p>
<p>The certified sustainable palm oil will generate a premium of 3%-30%. If consumers have a low awareness of sustainable palm oil and they are unwilling to pay for the premium. Willing to invest in sustainable authentication products.</p>
<p>However, the CDP Global Environmental Information Research Center's interview with Chinese companies in 2020 shows that companies are increasingly aware of the potential long -term costs of unsustainable palm oil on the environmental impact of supply chain elasticity.In addition, as consumers' sustainable awareness increases, it is recognized that the negative impact of the unsustainable palm oil purchased by the company on the environment will constitute risks on the company's reputation. If more and more companies can realize such long -term costs and change the mentality of avoiding risks, it will help the development of sustainable palm oil.</p>
<p>Fang Lifeng, the person in charge of RSPO China, said that the main work of RSPO in China is to further enhance the industry's awareness and awareness and cognition of sustainable palm oil, and mobilize more companies to purchase sustainable palm oil. At present, there are more than 300 Chinese members. If some leading companies are willing to propagate and guide consumers while purchasing sustainable palm oil, consumer consciousness will gradually increase, and it will also stimulate other companies in the industry to purchase sustainable products.</p>
<p><strong> Promoting sustainable palm oil in the instant noodles and the cosmetics industry </strong></p>
<p>One quarter of the palm oil imported from China is used for instant noodles, and currently more than 70%of the world's individual protection and cosmetics products contain one or more palm oil derivatives. Starting from these two industries, it has promoted the certified sustainable palm oil to Chinese consumers to increase consumer awareness and has more potential.</p>
<p>Master Kong, who occupied nearly half of China's market share, wrote in the 2022 Sustainable Development Annual Report, "We are committed to reducing the negative impact of packaging and palm oil procurement on the forest. Certification. The statement may be misleading. Master Kang is not a member of RSPO. The proportion of suppliers obtained by RSPO certification does not mean that its procurement certification palm oil ratio.</p>
<p>According to the report of Palm Oil in WWF2022, the relevant costs of corporate transitions to sustainable palm oil and certification agencies include membership, evaluation, audit, documents, training, and premiums for certified palm oil. The report estimates that the average of 70 grams of instant noodles per pack, the cost burden brought by the enterprise is 0.0009 US dollars, which can be ignored.</p>
<p>Fang Lifeng introduced that the premium exists objectively. In particular, it is convenient for palm oil, with limited gross profit in the industry and fierce competition among enterprises. But this does not mean that the industry has no room for transformation. Some Japanese instant noodle companies have promised to use 100%sustainable palm oil. In the end, it is still depending on the company's willingness to move and long -term business goals.</p>
<p>In contrast, cosmetics consumers have a high ability to withstand premiums. Investigators of WWF 2018 also showed that consumers generally accepted sustainable palm oil (especially cosmetics and personal care products) premiums were 6%to 10%. Under the trend of sustainable cosmetics, the makeup protection industry has also become a potential breakthrough to increase consumers' awareness of sustainable palm oil.</p>
<p>In recent years, sustainable cosmetics have set off a trend in China. In 2021, Tmall International defined the "Cleanbeauty" for the first time, including palm oil that does not use non -RSPO certification. After the concept was proposed, many consumers were sought after by the "pure beauty" brand of environmentally friendly environment. The sales of this category increased by more than 600%year-on-year sales in January-June.</p>
<p>In 2021, RSPO delivered a speech at the International Cosmetics Innovation Conference in Shanghai as a special guest. It is mainly determined by the raw material of the product. The sustainability of the ingredients in the product formula is also the main consideration. "</p>
<p>Fang Lifeng also observed that, as an important component of beauty care products, the awareness of the beauty industry has gradually increased the awareness of sustainable palm oil, and the relevant parties of the industry's interests are becoming more and more willing to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the industry, China's local brands are relatively late, and international beauty brands occupy most of the market. In 2021, French personal care company L'Oreal's share in the Chinese cosmetics market was about 12.2%, ranking first, and L'Oreal's palm oil had passed RSPO certification 100%.</p>
<p>"International brands make commitments and promote the implementation of China's supply chain in the Chinese market, so that many local Chinese companies realize that if they do not take measures and purchase sustainable palm oil, corporate reputation will face additional risks. In China, it also exists in the world. At the same time, large enterprises can move first, which can strengthen the capacity building of domestic sustainable palm oil suppliers, but also increase consumer awareness in publicity, "said Fang Lifeng.</p>

<p>Description: Although the US business leader has always urged the Biden government to restore the stability of US -China relations, they have not hoped that the conversation between the United States and the high -level and middle -aged and middle -aged high -levels is not high. Analysis believes that in addition to increasing flights and visas, the relationship between the two countries will not have significant breakthroughs, especially in terms of economy. Haiyun Jiang for the New York Times Secretary of State Brosky will arrive in China on Sunday. The US business leaders have been promoting the stability of the Bayeng government to restore the relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>State Secretary of State Brillings met with Chinese peer officials in Beijing from last Sunday, which seemed to be obviously indifferent in comparison.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230617/blinken-china-us-xi/">high -level meetings</a>The purpose of making US -China relations returns to the right track. This is one of the most important bilateral relations in the world. Many American business leaders have been urging the Biden government to restore the stability of US -China relations to a certain extent.</p>
<p>But for business leaders and officials, the expectations of talks seem to be high. There are two main goals of the talks. One is to restore the communication between the two governments in this year's interruption. Previously, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/politics/chinese-spy-balloon-shot-down.html">a Chinese reconnaissance balloon flew into the United States to lead the United States</a>Later, Brinken canceled the visit that was scheduled to be in February. Another goal is to prevent the relationship between the two countries from worsening further.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that the relationship between the relationship has affected. Foreign direct investment in China has dropped to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Foreign-investment-in-China-slumps-to-18-year-low">the lowest point in 18 years</a>Essence A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in 2023 shows that enterprises still regard the Chinese market as the priority, but their willingness to invest has declined.</p>
<p>"Economic relations have become so bad, and any signs of progress are welcomed, although the expectations of any form of breakthroughs are not too high," said Jack Korvin, chairman of the State Foreign Trade Commission representing the National Foreign Trade Commission representing multinational enterprises.</p>
<p>He said: "I hope that a high -level meeting like this can start to inject some commercial certainty into a more and more worrying and unpredictable trade relationship."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as one of the world's largest consumer markets and many factories that are supplied to global enterprises, China still has a strong attractiveness. This year, after three years of blockbuster blocking the travel restrictions, a large number of CEOs went to China, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/gm-ceo-mary-barra-visits-china-meets-shanghai-party-chief#xj4y7vzkg">GM's Mary Bora</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-dimon-says-us-china-need-have-real-engagement-2023-05-31/">Jemin Chase's Jamie Dimon</a>And <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-deputy-c-bank-governor-083405199.html">Su Shimin of Blackstone Group</a>Essence</p>
<p>When visiting China this month, Tesla's CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk described the US -China economy as a "serial twins" and said he was opposed to separate them. Apple CEO Tim Cook visited China in March, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e5bc3ec2-b522-48c8-880f-7e981c14c9aa">praise</a>The company's "symbiosis" relationship with China.</p>

<p>The science and technology industry has established a rich profit -making relationship with Chinese manufacturers and consumers. The industry has been paying attention to the tough attitude of Washington's adoption of China. Although industry organizations acknowledge the importance of taking action to maintain national security, they urge the Bayeng government to properly adjust their actions.</p>
<p>Former diplomats and trade negotiation representatives, deputy director of the Institute of Policy Research Institute of the Asian Association, said that the United States and China may announce a small step at the end of both parties. She said that the two sides may agree to increase the number of poor flights between the two countries, or increase the issuance of visa.</p>
<p>But Carter said that both sides would express a lot of dissatisfaction. Chinese officials may complain about the US -made tariffs on Chinese -made goods, as well as restricting US companies selling flirtatious chip technology to China. U.S. officials may emphasize <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230515/china-anti-espionage-law/">China's continuous worsening business environment</a>And recent <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230523/micron-technology-china-ban/">companies that prohibit key information purchase</a>Micro -chip measures produced by Micron in the United States.</p>
<p>"I do not expect any breakthroughs, especially in terms of economy," Cartler said. "Both sides don't want to be polite," she added.</p>
<p>U.S. officials hope that Brintken's visit has paved the way for more cooperation, including on issues such as climate change and debt burden of developing countries in developing countries. Other officials, including the Minister of Finance Yelle, are considering visiting China this year. President Xi Jinping and President Biden may meet directly at the APES meeting held in Delhi in September or the Asia -Pacific Economic Conference held in San Francisco in November.advertise</p>
<p>However, the trust between the two governments has been eroded, and Chinese officials seem to be skeptical to the extent to how much they can restore the Bayeng government.</p>
<p><a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221008/biden-chip-technology/">The United States issued a ban in October, and widely restricted</a>The semiconductor technology shared with China has always made it difficult for China to release it. The United States has included dozens of Chinese companies on the sanctions list because they assist the Chinese military and monitoring systems, or avoid the United States' restrictions on trade with Iran and Russia.</p>
<p>Biden government officials are weighing further restrictions on China, including a long -delayed cover cover <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html">some US venture capital ban</a>Essence The White House faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/politics/republicans-blinken-china.html">huge pressure from Congress</a>It is required to take more measures to crack down on national security threats from Beijing.</p>
<p>Not all companies are promoting improvement relationships. Some companies with less business in China have tried to obtain political interests in Washington in Washington in the increasing competition with China. Facebook and Instagram's parent company Meta has repeatedly concerned about Tiktok. Tiktok is a video application owned by Chinese people and is recognized as a powerful competitor of Instagram.</p>
<p>"This is really a controversy," said James Lewis, senior vice president of Strategy and International Research Center. "What is your degree of integration? How is your confrontation?"</p>
<p>Lewis said that the positiveness of corporate resistance to China's tension is related to their business in the Chinese market.</p>

<p>Some reporters asked, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/吴钊燮若被攻击台湾不指望他国参战/a-65504614">If you want to prevent the possible aggression in China</a>What can the European Union do? Wu Zhaozheng responded that the recent statement of the European Union mentioned that the Taiwan Strait was peaceful and stable, and it also warned all parties not to change the status quo. This statement showed a "powerful attitude." "If this statement is reiterated with the same intensity, I think this will remind China that the actions that invading Taiwan are unhappy in European countries."</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng's visit to Europe is quite low -key. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has only publicly confirmed two itineraries. It includes the EUROPEAN VALUES Center Forsecurity Policy of the Czech think tank on the 14th.

He met with 12 members including Nicola Beer.</p>
<h3>Czech New President Paeville: Taiwan President actively invited calls</h3>
<p>The press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan on the 18th pointed out that Wu Zhaozheng was "high -standard reception" by the European Parliament, "highlighting the European Parliament's emphasis on Taiwan and the positive actions of bilateral strengthening partnerships."</p>
<p>Before Wu Zhaozheng visited Europe, China had warned EU officials and politicians not to meet him. A spokesman for the European Commission was asked about the European trip of Wu Zhaozheng last Friday (June 16). The spokesman responded that they "it is not convenient to confirm whether there is any official meeting between the European Union representatives and the visitors from Taiwan."</p>
<h3>Store in Europe?</h3>
<p>A survey released by the European Council on Foreignrelation (the European Council On ForeignRelations) shows that if the United States and China broke out of conflict because of Taiwan, most of the 11 EU people who filled in their countries would hope that their countries will maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>Taking Germany as an example, 60%of the respondents are in favor of neutrality, and 23%of people tend to support the United States in Germany.</p>
<p>When asked about the results of this survey, Wu Zhaozheng said: "For a long time, European countries want to maintain strategic neutrality in international affairs. But with the development of reality, this situation may change." He believes that when the international community is discussing important discussions In the international principles, Europe will be very difficult to express the attitude of "ignorance"; despite this, to persuade the EU to give Taiwan more support, it is still "hard work."</p>

<h3>will not block TSMC invest in Germany</h3>
<p>In recent years, the EU is committed to expanding its own semiconductor capacity. Last year, it also announced the subsidy plan, hoping to attract chip manufacturers. At the same time, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/為台積電設廠鋪路德國薩克森州今秋在台設辦/a-65382366">TSMC) in Taiwan is considering establishing the first European factory in Germany</a>Essence</p>
<p>A reporter asked Wu Zhaoxuan whether Taiwan would turn on the green light by this plan to seek political interests. In response, he said: "I don't think we have set any conditions, whether in the United States, Japan or in Europe, Investment case. "</p>
<p>"If Europe provides very positive incentives, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/與歐企合資媒體台積電德廠擬砸百億歐元/a-65509308">also talked to TSMC</a>Let them feel assured and feel that investing in Europe will bring very positive results, then their investment in Europe will definitely not be stopped by the government.

<p>Wu Zhaoyi said: "Although we do not selfishly prevent TSMC from investing in other countries, of course, we hope that other countries that want to attract TSMC can also think about the situation in Taiwan, think about TSMC's status in Taiwan. The position. "</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng further emphasized the importance of establishing a relationship. "When a country lacks a chip, he will come to Taiwan," You should do this, you should do that. "Wu Zhaoxuan said:" But they don't seem to think of a greater situation, but they do not expect to maintain more with Taiwan to maintain more. Good relationship, whether it is economy or other aspects. "</p>

<h3>is expected to sign a bilateral investment agreement?</h3>
<p>Taiwan also hopes to reach a bilateral investment agreement with the European Union. As the European Union considering promoting a comprehensive investment agreement with China (CAI), Wu Zhaozheng said that he was very worried that the potential EU -Taiwan investment agreement "turned into hostages". <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/默克尔计划受挫-欧盟搁置欧中投资协议/a-57438085">European and China CAI progress has been stagnant since 2021</a>Essence</p>
<p>Wu Zhaoyi believes that if you see the closely related connection between Taiwan and the European Union, then "the EU should find an alternative to strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations, rather than being tied up by CAI."</p>
<p>A European official told DW that "no connection" between these issues. The European Commission's trade spokesman Miriam Garciaferrer told DW that Taiwan is an "important economic partner in the region" and added that economic talks are regularly held between Taiwan and the European Union.</p>
<p>However, since the European Union included Taiwan in 2015, it has not made formal progress in reaching an agreement after discussing the list of partnerships of the negotiations. Ferrer clearly shows that the European Union's current position: "The bilateral investment agreement with Taiwan is not yet planned."</p>
<p>Faced with Taiwan issues, the EU adheres to the so -called "one Chinese policy." A spokesman for the European Commission told DW that the European Union acknowledged that the government of the People's Republic of China was the only legal government in China.(Comprehensive report, DW reporter Rosie Birchard also contributed to this article)</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The Associated Press reported that although various Chinese businesses are "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/618购物节折射疫情打击下的消费者情绪/a-62128718">618 Shopping Festival</a>During the period, the price reduction was significantly reduced, attracting billions of dollars to snap -up, but analysts pointed out that the confidence of Chinese consumers is still weak.</p>
<p>From the end of May to June 18th, major Chinese e -commerce companies ushered in the first large -scale shopping festival after clearing the zero. Chinese merchants have sacrificed a large discount, so as to boost sales when the consumption recovery is weaker than expected.</p>
<p>The Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency said that the 618 Shopping Festival is "important nodes that promote consumption potential release" and "testing gold stones that test consumption recovery." It is reported that "the turnover of nearly 50%of small and medium -sized merchants in JD has increased by more than 200%", "Tmall 618 sells for 4 hours, and more than 30 brands of mobile phone digital home appliances have exceeded 100 million yuan." The platform's 618 transcript "witnessed the footsteps of the Chinese consumer market accelerated and recovered."</p>
<p>However, the Associated Press reported that although JD.com said in a blog post that the results of the 618 event this year's 618 event "growth exceeded expectations and innovated records", and the sales volume was 10 times during the March "10 billion subsidy" period, However, it did not disclose its total sales. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國618購物節買氣冷-疫情重挫消費慾望/a-62186940">During the epidemic period last year</a>Neither Alibaba and JD.com also announced the results of the "Double 11" shopping festival.</p>
<p>The Associated Press quoted analysts that although JD, Tmall, Taobao and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/出海寻增量拼多多将上线跨境平台/a-62981485">Pinduoduo</a>Waiting for the shopping platform to provide billions of dollars discounts, the pace of China's consumer market out of the epidemic is still slightly stagnant.</p>
<p>Shaun Rein, the founder of the China Market Research Group (CMR), said that China's consumption confidence is still in a weak state of "geopolitics, weakness after epidemic and domestic politics".</p>
<p>Earlier, the Chinese e -commerce giant "Jingdong" competed with the opponent "Pinduoduo", which is known for its low -cost products, and launched the "10 billion subsidy" plan in March; before, Alibaba's industrial e -commerce group and social e -commerce companies Dai Shan, the president of the business group, also promised that Taobao will "make a huge historic investment in the user size" this year, hoping that merchants can clearly feel that the number of visitors will increase.</p>
<p>Lei Xiaoshan said that under such circumstances, Chinese consumers have been in a state of sensitive prices in the past few months, constantly looking for discounts and price reduction transactions. In the past few years, Chinese merchants have discounted for a long time due to the epidemic. Compared with the previous months, 618 discounts have not been much better, so consumers are unlikely to make more purchases.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese shopping service platform "Buying.com" data, before the epidemic, the total turnover of JD.com's 2019 618 Shopping Festival in 2019 was RMB 2015 billion, and in 2018 it was 159.2 billion. DW tries to check, but many large Chinese media such as Tencent cannot display the web pages of 618 data before the epidemic.</p>
<h3>Are you monitoring you?</h3>
<h3>Luxury, cosmetics to open a red disk</h3>
<p>The Associated Press reported that JacobCooke, Chief CEO of WPIC E -Commerce (WPIC), said that although China ’s overall consumption was still weak during the 618 period, compared with the previous quarter, the sales of cosmetics and luxury goods Large increases have emerged.</p>
<p>According to reports, the luxury industry was hit hard during the strict "clearing" period in China, and the first growth of the first five years in 2022 has declined. Therefore, this year's 618 event, more luxury brands have participated in and trying to boost sales in China. For example, brands such as Moncler and Lemaire have participated in Tmall's 618 event for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Many luxury brands have also taken the opportunity to launch new products online, and some brands also rarely provide discounts and interest -free stages provided by some brands.</p>
<p>According to Tmallian data, at the end of May, brands such as Burberry, Chloe, Miumiu sold at the 30 minutes before the 618 shopping festival have exceeded the total amount of the same event 1 year ago. Cook said that the return of luxury goods to e -commerce will be a major trend, because the industry is very serious during the epidemic: "some brands of sales may increase 10 times compared to last year."</p>

The economic growth of all major countries is rising. Knitina Ragard, then president of the International Monetary Fund, declared that the global economy "is in <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2018/01/global-financial-markets-see-short-term-prosperity-but-long-term-challenges/">excellent trend</a>"" ".</p>

<p>From then on, many things have happened: global epidemic; European war; tension between the United States and China is hot. The inflation, which is considered to be properly preserved like the Disco record collection, has a comeback.</p>

<p>However, as the dust settled, suddenly, we found that our understanding of the world economy seemed wrong.</p>
<p>Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall more than 30 years ago, the economic agreement that policy makers have rely on -the eternal advantage of open markets, free trade and efficiency -it seems to be deviating from the track.</p>

<p>In recent decades, globalization has been regarded as an unstoppable force like gravity, but it is obviously developing in an unpredictable way. The pace of separation of the world economy is accelerating. The best way to deal with it has become a topic of argument.</p>

<p>It is believed that the new world of goods, money, and information in the world's crisscrossing will basically eliminate the old order of the Cold War conflict and the non -democratic regime.</p>
<p>People have reason to feel optimistic. In the 1990s, the inflation rate was very low, and the employment rate, salary and productivity were rising. Global trade almost turned over. Investment in developing countries surge. The stock market rises.</p>
<p>The World Trade Organization was established in 1995 to perform these rules. Six years later, the joining of China is deemed to have changed significance. Establishing a huge market with 142 countries will inevitably lead the Asian giant to democracy.</p>
<p>Together with China, South Korea, Malaysia and other countries, China has turned the difficult farmers into a productive forces of urban factory workers. Furniture, toys and electronic products they sell around the world have brought huge growth.</p>

<p><strong> The funds are here, and the poor country pays the price. </strong></p>
<p>In developing countries, the results may be bad.</p>
<p>The economic destruction caused by the major epidemic, coupled with the soaring food and fuel prices caused by the Ukrainian war, triggered a series of debt crisis. Rising interest rates make these crises more serious. Like energy and food, debt is usually denominated in the world market, so when the US interest rate rises, debt payments become more expensive.Poor countries have been forced to completely cancel the restrictions of capital entering and leaving the country. The reason for this is that funds should be freely flowing between the country like commodities. The government, enterprises, and individuals borrow money from foreign lenders will provide funds for industrial development and key infrastructure.</p>
<p>"Financial globalization should have brought developing countries into an era of strong growth and fiscal stability," said Jiadi Gosh, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amhaster. But "the result is counterproductive."</p>
<p>Some loans -whether it is from private lenders or institutions from the World Bank -none of them have sufficient returns to repay debts. There are also some loans that have been put into speculative projects, incomplete proposals, face engineering, or entering the bank account of corrupt officials. The debt country is still around the interest rate, and the rise in interest rates will instantly increase the scale of debt payment.</p>
<p>Over the years, the poor loans, asset bubbles, currency fluctuations and official management have led to the cycle of prosperity and depression in Asia, Russia, Latin America and other places. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/world/asia/sri-lanka-economic-crisis.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article">Sri Lanka</a>The luxury project from the port to the boarding courts initiated by the government has led to the country's bankruptcy last year, and the citizens were looking for food. The central bank paid Iranian oil in the form of earthenware transactions to pay Iranian oil.</p>
<p>This is a "Ponzi scam", Gosh said.</p>
<p>The private lenders were worried that the debt country could not repay, and suddenly cut off the flow of funds, causing these countries to be in trouble.</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund(IMF)With compulsory tightening policies, the bailout is forced to cut over -expanded government cuts. It usually leads to many people suffering by cutting public assistance, pensions, education and medical care.</p>

<p>Although the disintegration of the Soviet Union has cleared the road for the orthodox free market, the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine has now decisively leaving this road.</p>

<p>The politics of the old world style has subverted the assumptions of the global economic order -this is the threat of the catastrophic climate collapse, the fierce social turmoil and the increasing inequality of inequality.</p>

Europe has obtained cheap energy from Russia, and has obtained cheap finished products from China. "That world no longer exists," he said.</p>
<p>The bottleneck of supply chain caused by the popular and subsequent recovery has highlighted the vulnerability of the global procurement economy. As the political tensions caused by war intensified, policy makers quickly added self -sufficiency and strength to the goals of growth and efficiency.</p>
<p>"Our supply chain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/business/janet-yellen-supply-chains.html">Unsafe</a>There is no elasticity, "the Minister of Finance Jennite L. Yellen said last spring. She said that the establishment of trade relations should focus on" trustworthy partners ", even if this means that" the cost level is slightly higher, the system efficiency is slightly lower, the less system efficiency is slightly lower "" ".</p>
<p>"It is too naive to think that the market is about efficiency and power without power," Abraham Newman said that he co -authored "Underground Empire: How the United States has weapons the world economy"(Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy)This book.</p>
<p>The nature of the economic network determines that it can cause imbalance and pressure on power, because the abilities, resources and weaknesses of various countries are different.</p>
<p>Russia provides 40%of the EU's natural gas, which tries to use the EU's dependence to pressure it and require it to withdraw its support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States and its allies use their dominant positions for the global financial system to remove major Russian banks from the international payment system.</p>

<p>China restricts trading partners into its huge market for revenge.</p>
<p>The extreme concentration of key suppliers and information technology networks have produced more bottlenecks.</p>
<p>China has manufactured 80%of the world's solar panels. Taiwan produces 92%of micro -advanced semiconductors. Most of the world's trade and transactions are calculated in US dollars.</p>
<p>The new reality is reflected in the US policy. The United States -the main founder of the Liberalization Economic Order and the World Trade Organization, the more comprehensive free trade agreement, and repeatedly refused to comply with the decision of the WTO.It also adopts Chinese -style industrial policies to provide huge subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries, wind farms, solar power plants, etc. to ensure the security of the supply chain and speed up the transition to renewable energy.</p>
<p>"The economic dependence, which has been established for decades, has become very dangerous." Said Sausa, a national security consultant. He also said that it was wrong to persist in "too simplified market efficiency".</p>
<p>Although the previous economic orthodox has been partially abandoned, it is unclear what it will be replaced. The current mainstream approach is <a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-216">improvisation</a>Essence Maybe the only assumption that must be reliable now is that the road to prosperity and policy weighing will become even more unclear.</p>

Qin Gang rarely interpreted the issue of Taiwan with the "most prominent risk". According to analysis, although China has repeatedly reiterated that Taiwan is the core interest of China, for the United States, the United States has its own "one -China" policy and will not be abducted by US -China relations.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st-06192023034858.html">Brosky and Xi Jinping met in the Great Hall of the People</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-06182023075433.html">Brinkee meets Qin Gang analysis: Provide an opportunity for a tension between the United States and China</a></em><em> </em><strong> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st1-06172023220613.html">Whether Brintken arrives in Beijing's Sino -US relations to improve global attention</a></strong></p>
<p>According to the press release of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Qin Gang clarified the strict position on the core interests and major concerns of the Chinese issue in Taiwan, and put forward clear requirements.</p>
<p>"The issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue in Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk." Qin Gang said that China urges the United States to abide by the "one China" principle and the three joint communiqués of China and the United States. The promise of "Taiwan independence" is really implemented.</p>
<p>According to the Voice of the United States, a senior official of the US State Department emphasized that China's military upgrade in the Taiwan Strait is a "issue of global attention." The official said that the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait are in line with the "long -term interests" of the United States.</p>
<p>Professor Lu Industry, a professor of National Politburo, told this station that after many dialogues in the United States and China, the press releases issued by each other can see that China especially emphasizes the importance of Taiwan issues, but the United States usually lighten to deal with Taiwan issues. The main difference is that China believes that Taiwan is its core interest, but from the perspective of the United States, the United States has its own "one -China" policy, and its subjectivity about the US -Taiwan relations. The United States believes that it should not be abducted by US -China relations.</p>
<p>"(Qin Gang)This time is different from before. In other words, he explicitly told the United States that this is the core interest, but at the same time, it is also the place where both sides are most likely to wipe the guns and get angry or have misjudgment of each other. "Lu Yingzhong said immediately," The first policy of the United States mentioned the so -called differences on the two sides of the strait(differences)It should be handled through peaceful ways between the two sides of the strait, and the United States has stable in this position. "</p>
<p>** Analysis: U.S. -China talks will help alleviate the current situation of the Taiwan Strait's current situation.</p>
<p>Regarding whether the talks can help the tension of the Taiwan Strait, He Chenghui, deputy secretary -general of the Taiwan Security Association, said in an interview with this station that "has eased the current situation, but the long -term trend remains unchanged."</p>
<p>He said that for China, it is not a good time to launch a war against Taiwan at this moment. Once the war fails or is difficult to carry out, it is enough to shake the Chinese Communist regime. Therefore, China will make the "drag titles" and make the outside world mistakenly think that the situation is slow, but it will only accumulate backwards.</p>
<p>Standing in the United States, He Chenghui believes that the current Russian and Ukraine War is in full swing. Western countries do not want to fight on both sides, tendency and slowing situation. As the U.S. Indian commander Aquirino said publicly that he was awarded two heavy tasks to prevent the CCP from invading Taiwan. "At least everyone gradually condenses consensus, expands this kind of amendments, and responds positively and rapidly. Let this aggression be eliminated invisible."</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan problem in China China Soft and Hard Hand </strong></p>
<p>Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the director of the Foreign Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with Blink in Beijing on the morning of the 19th. When he mentioned the issue of Taiwan, Wang Yi also reiterated that the maintenance of the country's unity is always the core of China's core interests. The fate of Chinese children is the historical mission of the Communist Party of China, and "China has no room for compromise."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-19T04-46-00-04-00/000002.png" />When the US Secretary of State Brills, Wang Yi and Wang Yi and Qin Gang met, China both mentioned Taiwan's issues.(Reuters pictures)China's issue in Taiwan shows the handling of "hard and hard, both hands and inside and outside". Wang Huning, the highest -level official of Taiwan affairs and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, emphasized that "the development of cross -strait relations in the people and the people are in the people. The results of cooperation benefit compatriots on both sides of the strait. "He also talked about" peace "and said that" the peaceful development of cross -strait relations is the right path to maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, ... to the right path to the national rejuvenation. "</p>
<p>The former editor -in -chief of the Global Times, who has always faced the world of war wolf, said that in response to the talks between Brinken and Qin Gang, he posted on his personal Weibo. But in the core interests, he is resolutely not allowed. "He also reminded," No matter what the front appears, we don't need to be impatient, impulsive, and panic. "</p>
<p>"On the one hand, he knew very well that it was a catastrophe to China. But on the other hand, he couldn't give up the core bottom line." He Chenghui interpreted that Hu Xi's informal document was close to the conflict of China's mainstream interesters.</p>
<p>He Chenghui reminded that in order to avoid conflicts, Western countries were willing to take a step back in certain interests. However, in addition to the concession in China, others will not be concessions. "In the negotiations set in China, Western countries will always suffer, because you never understand it, China will not refund in substantive issues, then this negotiation is invalid from beginning to end."</p>
<p>Lu Industry analyzed that in the past, Hu Xijin played the role of "throwing throttle" in Chinese nationalism. Now he publicly puts soft tunes, helping the Chinese leadership to promote interaction and exchanges with the United States in the future. "Regardless of his intentions, there will be some situations that help ease the tight US -China confrontation."</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China's foreign policy is based on such basic assumptions: in a fair world, China should dominate East Asia, and other regional strong powers are centered on East Asia, respecting China, and accepting China guidance. The same as two thousand years; those areas that are regarded by Beijing as part of China should be "unified" with China; the revival China should at least have an equal speech in the standardization and rules of the formulation of international affairs. Xi Jinping said that these goals can be achieved, because the world is undergoing "a great change in a century", that is, the "great rejuvenation" of the Chinese nation and the decline of American power. Xi Jinping said, "Shi and Shi are on the side."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-19T05-33-54-08-00/19germany-china-dialogue-htfv-master1050.jpg" />Berlin -Ten years ago, when China and Germany began to conduct government consultations, Angra Merkel was still the Prime Minister, and relations between the two countries seemed to mean endless trade and profit opportunities. During the dialogue period, there was unprecedented prosperity, with trade agreements and signature ceremonies, and red carpets and military ceremonies.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, after the three -year interruption of the epidemic, German Chancellor Olaf Tumolz and Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang will be in a very different world -a world that has new considerations on political fragility and economic dependence -re -re -considered Start consultation.</p>
<p>The two countries have returned to talks with almost alienated partners. Their relationship became nervous due to the deepening of Russia's war in Ukraine, the deepening of the friendly relations between Beijing and Moscow, and the tension between China and Germany's most important allies in the United States.</p>
<p>"These consultations seem to be not synchronized with the times," said Tolstine Benner, director of the Berlin Global Public Policy Research Institute. "Affairs between governments is usually what you and your democratic allies will do. The challenge we face is to get a balance between the new realism we face and the Merkel -style consultation with China."</p>

Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</p>
<p>This will be the first consultation of Shuoerz, and Li Qiang is also the first visit to Berlin as the Prime Minister. It will accompany him to visit a large number of ministers. There is no doubt that their tasks will conflict, even if they try to shape the areas of common interests.</p>
<p>For Germany, this meeting will be an opportunity to declare a new position, that is, China is still one of its most important economic partners, but it is also a "systemic competitor." This means that Berlin will try to protect its key technologies and encourage their companies to stay away from Beijing and achieve diversification.</p>
<p>For China, this will be a greatest European trading partner to persist in all opportunities -and make a gap between Berlin and Washington.</p>
<p>Today, the pressure from the United States to fight against Germany to fight against Beijing is increasing. How to maintain the necessary economic connection with China under such shadows is a balance between Germany is still working hard.</p>
<p>A German official said that it was a "three -body problem" in Berlin. German officials are keenly aware that Washington is a security guarantee, and they can no longer expect to treat economic interests separately from political interests.</p>
<p>Germany once regarded Germany, China, Germany and the United States, and the United States and China as each other's independent bilateral relations, but now they feel that they are tangled together. Safety concerns also interfered with Germany's economic ambitions in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/europe/germany-russia-china.html?searchResultPosition=68">Forced Germany to re -consider its economic relationship that it had been regarded as natural</a>For example, Russia once provided 50%of natural gas supply to Germany. Germany managed to turn to other energy supply, barely avoided a serious energy crisis, although it was not avoided to avoid economic recession.</p>

<p>In contrast, incidents such as China attacking Taiwan have caused Sino -US military confrontation to be much more painful. German officials believe that they will now be forced to be involved in it. Previously, they once vigorously promoted Asian countries to support Europe to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine, thinking that this was an act of violating territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>Economic consequences will be more serious: more than 1 million <a href="https://www.iwkoeln.de/en/studies/juergen-matthes-mutual-dependence-in-trade-between-china-the-eu-and-germany.html">German jobs</a>Relying on China directly, there are more positions indirectly relying on China.

<p>This is also a difficult time for China.</p>
<p>After the popularity, China's economic recovery speed is slower than expected. Some Western companies are also cautious about making new investment in China, because President Xi Jinping has begun to promote strengthening national security this year -including expanding anti -spy law and strengthening police's review of Western companies in China.</p>
<p>Sino -German relations are particularly important: it is the source of China's largest European trading partners and the source of European foreign investment.</p>
<p>Hu Chunchun, an associate professor of Shanghai University of Foreign Languages, said: "Germany has been talking about reducing risks or reducing dependence on the Chinese market. This fact naturally makes China worry."</p>

<p>In Berlin talks, German officials are likely to let China understand the content of Chinese strategic documents they have never announced. As the German government's position around its position should last for several months, the document is postponed. It is expected to be announced in July.advertise</p>
<p>Under the pressure of Tsumers, the tone of the document is expected to soften because he is worried that it will have a great impact on the economy that has fallen into a decline.</p>
<p>German officials will make it clear that they have no intention of changing the "one China" policy, while recognizing the goal of Beijing unified Taiwan, while maintaining a "friendly but unofficial" relationship with Taiwan.</p>
<p>They will also emphasize a message conveyed many times: Germany does not have a plan to "decompose" with China, as U.S. officials have urged. But on the contrary, it tends to the concept of "risk".</p>
<p>Analysts said the question is how to define the true meaning of "de -risk".</p>
<p>"Does this mean to remove risks, or minimize the risk? Do you want to do this at a fast speed? There is a big room for this statement," Benner said. "Tsold is careful. He is doing the" de -risk "of the lightweight version. He pays great attention to decentralizing risks, but he does not want to hinder investment."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-19T05-33-54-08-00/19germany-china-dialogue04-tpbq-master1050.jpg" />In April, China had lifted a strict epidemic restriction measures, a shopping area in Beijing. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</p>
<p>In April of this year, some news reports that Berlin is considering restricting the sale of chemicals for semiconductors in Beijing, and Chinese officials are concerned about Germany. The United States has been seeking support from Europe and other allies to prevent China from obtaining key technologies such as semiconductors, which has furious China.</p>
<p>"They need to keep the Europeans stay away from Americans as much as possible," Hu Yongkong, Executive Director of the Institute of Merkato China Research Institute(Mikkohuotari)When talking about the goal of the Chinese delegation's visit to Germany this week. "In this regard, Germany plays a huge role."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Han Lei's(Paul Haenle)It is said that the Beijing side still hopes to be in such a fact that many European companies are seriously dependent on Chinese consumers, and they cannot bear the cost of maintaining a distance from China.</p>
<p>He said: "The abacus of Chinese leaders is that Europe still play a large extent."</p>
<p>Especially for Germany, China has cards to play: run counter to many more vigilant German companies. Chemical producers BASF and Volkswagen's largest and most powerful companies such as Volkswagen and other automotive manufacturers have increased their investment in China.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, China had canceled strict epidemic restrictions, reopening the economy, and at the same time spread the red carpet to encourage foreign investors to invest in China. Volkswagen's CEO Oliver Brumer is one of the first batch of leaders of multinational enterprises visiting China. China is the largest market for the car manufacturer.</p>
<p>"China thinks that due to the dependence of a small number of major German companies, Germany will always compromise, or at least reached an agreement with China," Luke(Philippele correct)explain.</p>
<p>In fact, the biggest challenge facing Germany may not be a showdown with China, but to be with their own companies -to indicate that they must rely on China to continue their own risks in the future.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>This makes Germany change the relationship with China, but there are also risks. Analyst Hu Yongkong said: "The method is there. Whether this will be painful, we can only see it then.</p>

<p>The US State Department said that US Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeng held a "frank, substantial and constructive" talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing.</p>
<p>On the occasion of stabilizing the relationship between stability, the talks on Sunday on Sunday marked the beginning of the highest level of visit to China in the past five years.</p>
<p>State Council spokesman Matthew Miller said, "Secretary of State emphasizes diplomacy and the communication channels that maintain openness on all issues to reduce the importance of the risk of misunderstanding and misjudgment."</p>
<p>According to official media reports, Qin Gang told Brinken that China is committed to establishing a "stable, predictable and constructive" relationship with the United States.</p>
<p>He also clearly expressed China's concern about the core interests including Taiwan, and said it was the "most prominent risk" in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>Before the talks, US officials believed that from the efforts of trade and the United States that hindered China's semiconductor industry, to Taiwan issues and Beijing's human rights records, the possibility of obtaining any breakthroughs between the two major economies between the world's largest economies was very likely Small.</p>
<p>Miller pointed out, "Secretary of State has raised some concern issues, and opportunities to explore cooperation on common multinational issues that are consistent with our interests."</p>
<p>He pointed out that Brinken invited Qin Gang to visit the Washington Special Economic Zone "to continue the discussion and they agreed to arrange for each other's appropriate time for mutual visits."</p>
<p>The two -day visit to the US senior diplomat was conducted in the background of bilateral relations. Earlier in February, he found suspected spy balls over the United States, which led him to delay the visits scheduled to be in the same month.</p>
<p>Due to the differences in a series of issues such as trade, technology and regional security, both countries have expressed their cautious hope to improve communication.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney's Burenden Oconn said that there are still many jobs to do a lot of work to repair the relationship with China, including "opening more communication channels."</p>
<p>Aonori told the Peninsula TV that "currently the urgent need of diplomacy and access itself is a good thing for Anthony Blint.</p>
<p>Blinden is the highest -level American officials who visited China since President Joe Biden took office. On Monday, the 19th, he conducted more high -level contact with the Chinese, including possible with Chinese leaders Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Bayon weakened the balloon incident when he went to China when he went to China. He said: "I think the Chinese leadership does not know where it is, what it is inside, and what happened. Awkward."</p>
<p>Biden said he hopes to meet again with Xi Jinping. Previously, the two sides held long talks after the G20 National Summit held in Bali in November, and the two agreed with Brinken's visit at the meeting.</p>
<p>Biden said, "I hope that in the next few months, I will meet with (President of China) Xi Jinping again to discuss the reasonable differences between us and the fields we can get along."</p>
<p>The two leaders may attend the next G20 summit held in New Delhi in September. At the same time, Xi Jinping was invited to visit San Francisco in November. At that time, the United States will receive the leaders of the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leader.</p>

The water channel has important strategic significance: rich fishery resources; possible oil and natural gas mines; a trade transit of $ 3 trillion each year.(Peninsula TV Station)#### "Spiral Out of Control"</p>
<p>A recent phone call between Brinken and Qin Gang emphasized the intensification of tensions between the two sides.</p>
<p>"Beijing is seeking the United States guarantee that the red line that will not interfere with its internal affairs and will not cross its core interests, especially Taiwan."</p>
<p>However, the expectation of any major breakthroughs on this visit is very low.</p>
<p>"But this does not mean that it is not important, especially China's neighboring countries are very worried that the relationship will become so bad, so that the tension is likely to lose control into some open conflict."</p>
<p>The relationship between Beijing and Washington has deteriorated, which is worrying that the two countries may have a military conflict one day. China has repeatedly stated that Taiwan is an indispensable part of China's territory.</p>

<p>At 9:30 a.m. on Monday, Broskere, who was visiting Beijing, and Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee, held a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Hotel. Before the meeting, the authorities allowed reporters to take a brief photo, and six Chinese personnel such as Brinken, Sarawon, and six Chinese personnel such as Wang Yi held closed -door meetings.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the same day, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Blint in the Great Hall of the People, and the two sides talked. Xi Jinping said: "China shows our position. The two sides agreed to implement the consensus reached by President Bayeng when he met with President Biden. The two parties also made progress on some specific issues and reached consensus. . The communication between the country and the country must always respect each other and treat each other with sincerity ... "</p>
<p>Wu Qiang, a Beijing political independent commentator, told this station that this is a symbolic meeting, which is very important to Sino -US relations: "Although it has no substantial help for repairing Sino -US relations, it has re -launched Sino -US senior officials. Dialogue communication is of great significance to stabilize Sino -US relations, especially the worst Sino -US relations in the fifty, not only to China and the United States, but only to China and the United States and world peace. "</p>
<p><strong> Xi Jinping sees Brinden -China relations to develop good development </strong></p>
<p>Ma Ju, a commentator in the United States, believes that the Chinese reception when Broskery arrived in Beijing was low -key. There was no red carpet. It was a director -level official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was in a clear comparison with Xi Jinping to see Brinken. He said to this station: "This shows a need for publicity. Some people say that this is humiliating Blindken. Of course, this is a very stupid behavior. Xi Jinping will never show weakness when he meets Brinton, because this will not show weakness because this is because this is because this is because this is this because this is not weak because this is because of this, because this will not show weakness because this is because this is because this is because this is because this is because of this. It is Xi Jinping's style and characteristics. I think the most important thing is to swore his toughness and show his diplomatic attitude towards the United States. But for Brinken, he needs a reality and real diplomacy. "</p>
<p>In the morning, Wang Yi and Brinken talks, Wang Yi mentioned in the opening white. Sino -US relations have to stop falling and stabilize. The priority is to truly implement the consensus of the heads of state of the two countries. Sino -US relations must be stable and far away, and use the principle of "mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation" as the fundamental follow. China reported that Wang Yi asked the United States to "cancel illegal unilateral sanctions against China, abandon the suppression of China's science and technology development" and respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and clearly oppose "Taiwan independence". However, the report did not disclose the details that Brinken talked about. It only mentioned that Brinken looked forward to strengthening communication with China, responsible for responsible management and control, and cooperation in areas where both parties have common interests.</p>

<p>The official said that China -US Foreign Minister held a constructive talks, and the two sides agreed to maintain high -level exchanges. Mr. Gao, a senior media person, analyzed that Brinken visited Beijing: "At least the two parties notified what the other party will do next, such as the Russian and Ukraine issue, economic and trade issues, and test the possibility of the other party if there is conflict."</p>
<p>U.S. President Biden told the media on the 17th local time that he hopes to meet with Chinese leaders in "the next few months", "discuss the reasonable differences between us and the fields we can get along."

<p>Scholar Wu Qiang told this station that Wang Yi's opening of the meeting with Brinken showed a high posture and asked the United States to make choices at the historical turning point. Whether cooperation or confrontation showed that China was aware of the dangerous situation in Sino -US relations. He gave an example of the situation before the Pacific War broke out in 1941. He said: "China also seems to have aware that they are developing the future development of Sino -US relations in the future of Sino -US relations. Under the situation, China seems to use a marginal strategy, similar to the Cuban missile crisis, and requires the United States to return to the so -called cooperation track. "</p>
<p>The cooperation between China and the United States in some areas is the goal of the US President Biden Biden. Wu Qiang said: "Blingken's visit to China this time, in the meeting with Qin Gang and Wang Yi, they are all trying to find the support points that may ease the future of Sino -US relations, such as the issue of Fentney, the Russian and Ukraine War, etc. I am also optimistic. expected."</p>

<p>On June 19, Li Qiang, the State Council of the Chinese State Council, visited Europe, conducted a formal visit to Germany and participated in seven rounds of China -German government consultations. French official visit and attended the new global financing contract summit. This is the first visit after Li Qiang took office, which fully reflects the high attention of China ’s China -Europe relations. After all, Europe is always the object of China to fight against the United States to try to win, and the leadership of Germany and France in Europe has become the target of China to strive for.</p>
<p>During his visit to Germany, the Sino -German government will hold a new round of government consultations. As the first consultation between the new government between the two sides, the economic community and the media of the two countries have paid great attention to the government consultations in this round. In addition, Li Qiang will also attend the 11th Sino -German Economic and Technological Cooperation Forum and conduct in -depth exchanges with representatives of the two economic circles.</p>
<p>Although it is not yet possible to guess whether both and Germany will eventually reach some consensus, from the perspective of results, it will definitely be much "restrained" than in the past. After all, for the German side, it is too high -profile. G7 member states explain. Regardless of the results, this round of consultations should be tentatively tone for Sino -German future politics and economic and trade toward. Once the direction is determined, even if the external environment is changing at all times, the essence of Sino -German relations in the future will not have much guessing space. Just as the German "China Strategy", for this dragging report, all walks of life does not seem to make much expectations. After all, when the German government is regarded as "competitors" and "institutional opponents", "China "Strategy" The rest of the focus may be on wording and tone.</p>
<p><strong> "Preheating" "Preheating" </strong> **</p>
<p>Originally, the Beijing Representative Office of the German Industry and Commerce Conference and the German Chamber of Commerce planned to host a "Sino -German -level high -level government -enterprise dialogue" event on June 8. This event invited Roberthabeck, Deputy Prime Minister of Germany and Minister of Economic and Climate Protection, Dr. Frank Ruekert, the German Minister of Germany, Peter Adrian, Chairman of the German Industry and Commerce Conference, and Hubertustroska, Chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce. It is regarded by the outside world as a warm -up of the China -German government consultation in this round. The enthusiastic registration of German companies seems to herald the German economic circles' desire to find out the direction of the German Germany. However, good things are worn more. The week before the event, the organizer announced that the event would be postponed.</p>
<p>In order to support this "warm -up activity of the German government consultation", the German Chamber of Commerce in China also did a small fast survey (FlashSurvey) in mid -May and planned "Dialogue" announced the relevant results before the abroad. It was thought that the preheating preheating will be canceled with the postponement of the big activity, but it arrives as scheduled, but the result is not as optimistic as expected.</p>
<p>This Flashsurvey is a survey on business confidence in all member companies after the results of the German business business survey at the end of last year after the results of the business confidence survey of Germany's business at the end of last year. Later business emotions, but due to consumer consumption and geopolitical tension, the business confidence of Waldes' enterprises was still sluggish in the post -epidemic period.</p>
<p>Survey results show:</p>
<p>• The business prospects of the Wald Enterprise are half -mixed: Although China's "zero -zero policy" has ended, 22%of companies are still expected to remain unchanged in the development of its industry in 2023; even one -third (even one -third ( 35%) Enterprises are expected to worsen the development of the industry; but more than 40%(43%) companies say they will improve.</p>
<p>• Both turnover and profit growth are lower than expected: the number of companies with a decline in turnover and profit declines have nine and ten percentage points than in 2022.</p>
<p>• The end of the Qing Zero policy did not boost investment confidence: 55%of German companies plan to increase investment in China in the next two years, which is four percentage points from the results of 2022, but far lower than the level of previous years (2019: 67 %, 2020: 72%, 2021: 71%)</p>
<p>• Market development is lower than expected and geopolitical factors hinders investment, but competition promotes investment: The main reasons for companies that do not invest in enterprises come from low expectations of market growth, continuous geopolitical tensions, and China's independent controlled policies; in increasing investment in investment; Enterprises: 62%of companies will continue to invest in maintaining their competitiveness in the Chinese market. 48%of companies are expected to benefit from market growth potential.</p>
<p>• The trend of localization and diversification continues: The strategy of the corporate headquarters responding to the intensified situation of geopolitical tensions includes expanding the diversified development of the region outside China and the degree of localization in China.</p>
<p>(Appendent complete <a href="https://china.ahk.de/news/news-details/german-chamber-post-covid-flash-survey-business-outlook-restrained-by-market-development-geopolitics">Research Results</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Localization, diversification </strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in the article that I commented on the article of Tsutz's visit to China last year, the German energy crisis caused by the Russian and Ukraine War caused the German government to reflect, and there was a huge hidden danger to an excessive dependence on a entity. Such hidden dangers today are the energy crisis caused by too dependence on Russia. Tomorrow may be the supply chain crisis (such as rare earth) caused by excessive dependence on China. This also prompted the German government for safety and hedging considerations to prepare early for possible extreme conditions.</p>
<p>But if it is just to avoid danger, the starting point of Germany's strategy to China is different from the United States. Therefore, the "decoupling" theory between China and the United States is not suitable for plagiarism in Germany (and even Europe), not to mention that German companies have also expressed their conflict with "decoupling". Therefore, when the European Union Commission chairman Feng Delin made a speech on the European Union's Chinese policy, "de-Risking" became the main tone of the Western camp strategy to China.</p>
<p>"Risk" is the existence of risk. But it may not be so simple to eliminate the German's determination of risks. Fortunately, the German government's "risk" of the German government may not buy it. Because regardless of whether the "risk" is to reduce the existing dependence or reduce future dependence, just from the perspective of the consumer market scale, labor quality, raw material supply stability, and industrial chain integrity, if you want to find one in a short period of time The single market completely replaces China, and it is really unlikely that at best it is a "flat replacement". "Localization" and "diversification" have also become two variables, allowing German companies to adjust their own strategies to China by their own proportion in the global market.<strong> Increased, stock </strong></p>
<p>In 45 years of reform and opening up, China has experienced a series of transformations from scratch to upgrading, and also has a huge domestic demand market. After joining the WTO in 2001 Giant international market. The superposition of the two incremental markets outside and inside has made enterprises get used to "adding additions" in the process of high -speed development. However, with the continuous rise in raw material costs, labor costs, and operating costs, the advantages of Chinese manufacturing have weakened. Coupled with the weakness of the domestic demand market, the transformation of consumption and investment awareness caused by the epidemic, the Sino -US trade friction and the Russian and Ukraine conflict The geopolitical impact of geopolitical, the growth rate of the incremental market gradually slowed down. When facing the "subtraction", companies that are used to "adding additions" will perform more "volume", especially in the stock market.</p>
<p>In order to get more stock market share or ensure that the existing share is not divided, on the one hand, the Walted Enterprise chooses cost reduction and efficiency, and actively enhances competitiveness to meet the localization needs of customers. On the other hand, on the other hand, It is also actively seeking the support of the Chinese government: calling on the government to stimulate consumption, boost confidence, call on the Chinese government to increase the openness of the market, and provide more fair competition environments.</p>
<p>For the Chinese government, stimulating consumption and boosting confidence is a common demand for interests. However, the latter two points are not so easy. Although the domestic and foreign capital of the Chinese government, such as palms and backs, when the Chinese government's measurement standards for the open market shift from economic benefits to more national security, the natural disadvantages of foreign capital will be prominent. Competition and strengthening the business environment, the palm of the hand is often "inside".</p>
<p>However, this is where the new German government is emphasized. What's more, when the new German government faces China, it will take more pragmatic as a prerequisite for cooperation, and the priority of solving problems will also be higher than the win -win cooperation.</p>
<p>It may be a more effective way to alleviate the game of domestic and foreign capital in the stock market and actively finding a new incremental market. The old saying: "Divide the cake is better to make the cake bigger together." Increasing the consumption capacity of low -income people and the cooperation and construction of countries along the "Belt and Road" countries will become a new engine of the incremental market. Of course All foreign investment needs to participate together.</p>
<p>There are still many uncertainty in the future of China and Germany. Slowing speed, adjusting strategies, and finding new directions, maybe they can run further.</p>

Brinkens(Antony J.Blinken)A meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing. The United States and China are seeking the relationship between the two countries that ease the state of deep freezing. This state has aroused concerns about the increase in the risk of conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>The two met at the magnificent Great Hall on the west side of Tiananmen Square. Xi Jinping often met with national leaders here. It is defined by hostility, and they realize the great interests of the competition between the two sides and the huge interest relationship between diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Brinken met with Wang Yi, the highest foreign policy official in China. According to Chinese official reports on this three -hour meeting, Wang Yi said that the two countries should reverse the spiral of Sino -US relations with a responsible attitude towards the world. However, Wang Yi touched and blamed Sino -US relations into the trough on Washington.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department's summary attitude was cautious, saying that Brinken and Wang Yi conducted a "frank and effective discussion". Blintken emphasized that the two major powers must responsiblely manage their competition and "through open communication channels to ensure that the competition is not inadequate. Will evolve into conflict. "</p>
<p>Blint is the first US Secretary of State to visit Beijing since 2018. Establishing regular high -level diplomacy efforts was carried out at the lowest point at the lowest point in bilateral relations at the lowest point in bilateral relations. In February of this year, the Pentagon announced that a Chinese reconnaissance balloon flew over the United States -this prompted Brinken to cancel the Beijing trip to Beijing earlier -then the US government ordered fighter aircraft to shoot the balloon down and the tension soared.</p>

<p>Data recently released by Germany show that the prospect of this European economic power is dim. The German economy has declined this year, and the country's emotions have recently decreased as the fastest speed since the epidemic. OECD(OECD)It is now expected that Germany's economic growth rate will be the lowest in major economies this year. However, the trend after this year is even more worrying. The current geopolitical adversity -the upgrade of tensions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the United States and China -highlight the vulnerability of the international economic model pursued by Germany, and also highlights its challenges in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Tumz(Olaf Scholz)It has always been ambitious to re -adjust its economic direction, including reducing Germany's dependence on Russia's energy and creating a new industrial supply chain. The Souls government has been acting quickly. Increased the target of renewable energy power generation to 80%, increasing the attractiveness of Germany as a green investment destination. Germany will invest tens of billions of dollars to promote the development of the semiconductor industry. The German economy also showed toughness, and it did not come true for the terrible predictions of its deep recession this year. But the future tasks are still arduous.</p>
<p>Germany has rapidly reduced its dependence on Russia's natural gas. The rapid construction of liquefied natural gas terminals help enhance energy security. However, the decision to close the last nuclear reactor in Germany in April, and the slow promotion of renewable energy, means that Germany still rely on imports and fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, and it is still subject to international prices that are easy to fluctuate.</p>
<p>Economic diversification is also challenging. Manufacturing accounts for about a quarter of German output. The automobile manufacturing industry as a key industry has been declining since 2018. Germany's expertise in internal combustion engine technology has been challenged by automotive electrification transformation, and China has an advantage in the field. It is not simple to "de -risk" in China (China is the largest commodity and trade partner country in Germany), because many German companies believe that China is a vital market and a key supplier of intermediate products.</p>
<p>Shuortz called for the transformation with a new "German speed". But he needed to remove many "deceleration bands" that hindered the German economy for a long time. Renewable energy infrastructure projects such as wind power field have been dragged down by the lengthy planning process. The reform has been launched. Business leaders complained that heavy bureaucracy, high energy costs and limited digitalization have also hindered vitality. Since the establishment of SAP companies more than 50 years ago, there has not been a world -class German technology company.</p>
<p>The shortage of labor is another obstacle. It is expected that in Germany to have a gap of up to 7 million by 2035, part of the reason is that the population aging is aging. The construction industry, electrical engineering, and professional services are lacking in skilled labor, and these industries are important for the country's economic ambitions. The revision of immigration regulations is ongoing. Reforming the economy also requires more public investment and incentives, but the demand for funds will be limited to the promise of population aging and improving national defense expenditure. The disputes within the government also dragged their hind legs.</p>
<p>In a sense, Germany is the victim of its own achievements. In the era of rapid globalization in the 20 years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, its economic model is prosperous. But the times are changing, and the foundation of its past competitiveness and toughness has been challenged. The economic and disadvantages of the supply of regulatory, digitalization, and labor supply seem to be so urgent when they are in good time, but now they are restricting the flexibility of the country's economy. Only by solving these deep obstacles facing economic growth can Germany complete self -renewal again.</p>

<p><strong> Moderator: Hello everyone, this is "view" I am Tang Qiwei. Today, the "Viewpoint" program connected through the video and visited Mr. Yang Lian, a famous poet in Berlin. In the 1980s, Yang Lian made a sensation in the poetry of mainland China with the long poem "Noigon". In 1987, he was selected as one of the "Top Ten Poets" by his readers. In 2018, Yang Lian won the Hungarian International Poetry Award, known as the "Poetry Award", and became the first Chinese poet to win this award. Yang Lian has a quarter of Mongolian descent. His grandmother is the first generation of Mongolian people who can marry the Han nationality. His father was the Shantong family of Beijing Auspicious Theater. Peking opera master Mei Lanfang sang red in the auspicious theater. After 1949, Yang Lian's parents were sent to work at the Swiss Chinese Embassy and were born in Switzerland. Yang Lian was born, and did not return to Beijing to live in Beijing until the age of six. </strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Reporter: I found that your life is very special. What does the family have the greatest influence on you during your growth?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Of course, my father is a very loving culture, especially literature. In -penetrating in his literary hobbies, there is a kind of pursuit of conscience and this character. My mother is the background of Shanghai, and her family is a family like the old Shanghai film industry. My mother's pro -mys are the famous film director named Shi Dongshan (directed "Eight Thousand Miles Road Clouds and Moon", "New Children's Heroes", etc.). Suicide and die one of Chinese intellectuals. The day of his death was the second day when I was born on February 23, 1955, so I had to think that at this point, the background of my mother's house was also deeply related to me. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I remember that you said that the death of your mother at the age of 20 is a starting point for your creation. Why?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Of course, under the influence of my parents, I have liked literature and art from childhood. It's just some publicity. On January 7, 1976, my mother died suddenly myocardial infarction, because at that time they lacked medical medicine in their dry school. My mother also gave me a starting point for the year of my life at the lowest point in my life. In that year, I had a conversation with me to talk to me with me. And these texts present a completely different amount of things than those previously painted things. So in fact, my mother's death also gave me the second birth, the birth of poetry. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I know that your creation is very affected by your mother's death. What literary style has your initial creation be influenced?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: In a sense of my creation, I came from detour. Unlike these poets of other hazy poetry, they were a small circle in Beijing at that time, including North Island, including Gu Cheng. They all came into contact with some modern literary works in the West, such as (</strong><strong><em> Spanish poet) </em></strong><em> Lorga and so on. But I went to the village directly from the university, so I didn't have the opportunity to contact these things. But just as I just said, in 1976, after having the painful life experience that could be said to be, it was increasingly feeling that such a false and empty newspaper had nothing to do with my real life. Then we cut into the village in that village. The life of the real people is also a very important classroom for me. The kind of love and hate, such a kind of entangled and complicated feelings between people and land. In fact, I discovered that it was not my feelings alone, but a very profound feelings in China that can be said to be said to be a very profound emotion in the entire historical and cultural tradition, and even poetic traditions. But this all requires me in the middle of the reading and thinking in the middle, and go against these experiences again. </em>*</p>
<p>Reporter: In 1983, you announced that Chang Shi Nonorng caused a sensation in Chinese poetry. At that time, you were only in your twenties. How would you evaluate your famous work now?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: In fact, this poem is famous, let's say that. Whether it is because of criticism, or it does have the amount of poetry, but I really think it is a turning point in my life. Such a mad state of completely anti -common sense cannot be just a result of a man. In fact, at that time, a poetry magazine, others said that the representative of the hazy poetry was Gu Cheng, and that person said something to calculate with Guo Cheng. Because they suddenly found that such poetry had been far from such a small flower and grass style, just in the sense of the wind and snow, I spent the singing or moaning. At the same time, in 1983, this so -called political movement that was criticized by my poem was criticized by this poem. In fact, this has a greater significance, because people suddenly found that at that time, it was a Mao Zedong's thoughts without Mao Zedong. From that time, I have completely transformed such a spiritual energy of literature from a surface socially social to a kind of inner, a kind of question or inquiry about self, and turned it into the energy of creation. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Moderator: Compared with Chinese poets, Yang Lian has long highlighted different creative personality with the practice of its grand historical subjects. However, because of the five poets of Yang Lian, Beimao, Gu Cheng, Shu Ting, and Jianghe published in 1986, Yang Lian is generally considered to be one of the representatives of the Chinese hazy poetry school. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Just now you mentioned hazy poems, I know that you and Gucheng Shuting, Beimao, and Guicheng, and Jianghe in the 1980s. Why is it called hazy poetry? How will you evaluate the impact of the era of hazy poetry?Reporter: I saw (about) the biography of the poet Haizi mentioned that he was particularly affected by you at the beginning of his creation. How would you evaluate his poems and the last tragedy of Haizi?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: I think he thinks he is of course a very talented young poet. For me, he has also come to my house to talk to us. He is a very ambitious poet. If he is fake, let him go through the process of life and thinking, I believe he will develop much more. But Haizi, the sensitive of his poet, can be said to die in March 1989, and it was only one month away from the students on the street in April 1989. (He) It can be said to be like a radar of a Chinese society. One of people who are ahead of the vast majority, a sound, heard a sound as an restlessness in the air in the air, and feels that rhythm. As a sensitive mind, it may be exactly exactly stimulating him, because the person who heard such a sound earlier, the surrounding environment is relatively more depressed to him, because he has not moved around. The earliest rabbit or the cat who felt the earthquake was coming. But one situation that was not moved around was crushed. In fact, he is really a pioneer of the whole movement. In my opinion, he is particularly significant in this aspect of Chinese society and ideology. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Speaking of 1984, I saw that after June 4th, I wrote a poem called 1989. The ending sentence at the end is: This is nothing more than a common year. Why do you have such a sigh?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Because it was not an emergency for me for me. From the end of 1976 (Cultural Revolution), we began to wake up, to the underground publication of the Democratic Wall in 1978, and to clear mental pollution in 1983 and all a series of political movements around it, such as opposing bourgeois liberalization. The control and suppression of ideas throughout the 1980s, and the awakening of the younger generation has always been relative movement and always collided. And the progressive deepening of each level, I just said that the political reality, historical and cultural language self, and the entry of such a level one by one is actually constantly injecting new ideological energy and accumulating new social shocks into this society. And the progress of such a level of energy, in 1988, we already felt that the air was covered with gunpowder. When the Australian Art Committee invited me to visit for a year in 1988, it was actually the year when we set up a survivor poet club. In fact, (we) had clearly felt such a close storm, come to me to me Saying this is an inevitable result of a series of processes. If I am in Beijing, I will definitely be on the square, but when the whole world is crying for it, at this time, I actually have a question in my heart. I said that if we think Tiananmen as a massacre and a large -scale death we see for the first time, then where are we remembering the disaster of all the dead before? If we tears, just brushing our memories of death again and again, then who can guarantee that today's tears are not preparing for the new shock of the future? So this is nothing more than ordinary year. In fact, I transferred this question from an external inquiry to me to my own inside. If we actually, in 1989 it was just an ordinary year in our lives, then how we will face it, such a normal and catastrophic life. In fact, in this ordinary year today, it has become very ordinary. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Just now you mentioned the survivor, I saw that you said that all our works after Tiananmen slaughtered, whether they were written at home or abroad, can only be called survivor literature. why?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Because when we were preparing to set up one in 1988, when we were still young poets such as young poets, this survivor more referred to a spiritual survivor, whether we can survive in spirit. However, no one expected that less than a year after we established the survivor poet club, the reality caught up with this word. After Tiananmen (incident), each of us can't get around, we must remember that every new sentence we write, starting from here. So the survivor has become at this time, and all of our writing starting points. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Moderator: </strong><strong> In the mid -to -late 1980s, after experiencing the fate of poetry criticism and banning poetry, a large number of poets in mainland China across the world and wandered around the world. Many of them have returned to China for so many years, and Yang Lian finally settled in London and Berlin. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Let's talk about Gu Cheng, because you also mentioned Gu Cheng just now. I know you met in your early twenties, and then you have a lot of contacts after immigration to New Zealand. Gu Cheng is known as a fairy tale poet, but in the end his ending was so violent and cruel. What do you think of Gu Cheng's tragedy?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: When Gu Cheng became famous, he used publicity as a banner. If you only read his text, of course, it is very pure and bright fairy tales created by sterling silver, but in fact, I think there is a kind of violence that he has always contained in Chinese society in the other side. It is an authoritarian tendency. So in fact, I think this personality tragedy highlights the intricate splitting of each individual (existing) in China. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: As a poet, how would you evaluate Gu Cheng's poems? Because you also mentioned just now that his poems are relatively pure and more pure, what about the depth and thickness you are pursuing?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: This is very interesting. Of course, I still like his poems very much, from the perspective of his aura. Especially if he is 13 years old, you can write: Closing your eyes, the world has nothing to do with me. But our lives are not always kept. In such a fairy tale, especially when we are forced to leave China and become an exile person, at this time, the inner endurance of a poet will increase infinitely. It can be said that myself (1993) the place where the sea stopped, that is, the year when Gu Cheng died. In that year, I stopped through the sea. For the first time I used a relatively large structure overseas to integrate my wandering experience, and finally implemented a sentence, to overlook myself from the shore. All external wandering is actually part of our inner wandering. At this time, I suddenly felt, okay, I found my own thinking and basic ways and basic ways of life today. But looking back, if I look at a batch of poems written between 1992 and 93, whether at that time or ghosts or ghosts, his language has a very violent state. This inner crushing state is almost consistent with Gu Cheng's later heart. This language is a fragmented fragment. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: So in 1993, you created the place where the sea stopped. At that time, you also said that this was the darkest moment in your exile. But just now I hear you say that this poem is actually the stop of the sea, let you go out of this darkest?<strong> Moderator: </strong><strong> Since going abroad in 1988, Yang Lian has never stopped creating. According to geographical changes, he divided his manuscripts into three parts: "Chinese Manuscripts", "South Pacific Manuscripts" and "European Manuscripts". After completing the masterpiece of the "South Pacific Manuscript" period, "Where the Sea Stop", at the end of 1996, Yang Lian began his "European Manuscript" creation. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: At that time, there was no place to live, and wandering has become a real life state of life, but in such a state of walking around, in fact The difference between different languages in different countries is increasingly diluted, and it is increasingly discovered that in fact, different places and different languages and even the depths of different languages and culture. The big difference, even this is not only the same generation, that is, in the deeper level of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, we all have a convergence point. After the feeling of stopping me in the sea, I started writing another poem called concentric circle. You can think of the word concentric circle. In fact, life literature is a kind of concentric circle. The heart is constantly questioning the poetry. The living environment has become our concentric in life. </strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Moderator: </strong><strong> Before 2014 to the epidemic, Yang Lian was invited to become a specially appointed professor at the School of Literature of Shantou University in Guangdong Province, and had the opportunity to communicate face to face with young Chinese students. In 2017, "Survivor" was repeated in mainland China. As one of the editor -in -chief, Yang Lian also went to Beijing to participate in the repetition ceremony. From 1988 Survivor Club's Poetry of Oil Seal, to thirty years later, it was repeatedly published in the form of the Internet. In Yang Lian's view, this is also a kind of "concentric circle". </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I know that you have also taught a book in European universities. How will you compare the attitude of Chinese young people and young European people to poetry? What does poetry mean for them today?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: I think there are about 40 students in my class each year, at least five or six, which makes me feel that the future can be a good seed of poetry. Many of these students are from the background of rural families. The works I write make me feel that they directly have a deep relationship with the source of life like the family and their own life. In a sense, they may also add such an influence with classical poetry. So they have such a poem that can be said to be the foundation. In this regard, when I think I recite poetry abroad, or when they are exposed to young people abroad, I think they may be less. I said that I like me to study, and it is good to read. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I think it is particularly interesting to have a phenomenon you just mentioned. You said that you have several students in the class when teaching. You feel very aura. Most of them are from rural areas. In your opinion, why are these children from rural areas, and there are many poems of migrant workers' poems, but they will be even more moving?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Because poetry should move the easiest point of the people, or the most fundamental point is sincerity. If poetry loses sincerity, then it has become a very meaningless thing. Regardless of the children from these rural areas, the parents who see their parents can make money through quite hard labor, to make money for them to go to school, let alone the poets of these migrant workers. The exiles in China have left their hometown of hot soil, and in a place for them to make money much more than we go abroad for them to go abroad. In fact, these people have accumulated the deep sourness of life in their hearts, especially the poetry of these migrant workers. When our survivor (poem) issued invitations to all Chinese poetry, I was actually very surprised to find that among these poets, there are some strange names that are completely strange, but these works are better than all than all than all. Those names I know, or some of the works I have used to get more and more moving, because they have the first -hand experience of living or even bloody, and then they have not been in the low -level publicity at all. The slogan is looking for your own expression. For example, Xu Lizhi, who has already died, for example, you are still alive </strong><strong> Guo Jinniu </strong> <strong>. These poems are really touched by the Chinese foreigners. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Yes, I read the terracotta warriors and horses of Xu Lizhi (on the current), and I felt very shocking.</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: He is a pity that he did not contribute to the survivors, and he became the fourteenth (committed to committing suicide) in Fuji. And what I was even more moved was that thousands of these parts wearing blue workers facing the crowd and standing next to the machine were all part of these parts of the machine. We originally thought they were silent. When they turned their faces, they turned their faces. When we came, we suddenly found that they had sounds and very personalized voices, and there was a kind of vivid sound in the middle of Chinese literature, that is, I saw China in these people. I saw China in China The tradition of poetry for more than 3,000 years has not been cut off, and it continues to move forward. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Moderator: Mr. Yang Lian said that today's poetry is an era of individual poetics. Poetry sinks the bottom of the sea, and it is dark and calmly looking at the dangerous world of storms. For more of Mr. Yang Lian's point of view, please pay attention to the next program. I am Tang Qiwei, thank you for watching, and you will see it again. </strong></p>

<h3>Employees should not be dressed, should be low -key</h3>
<p>In October last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping mentioned in the 20th report that "resolutely win <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體中紀委在海外部署反腐執法人員/a-65190075">anti -corruption struggle</a>Tackling the battle for a long time. "</p>
<p>According to the website of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission of the Communist Party of China (Central Discipline Inspection Commission), Li Xi, the secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in January this year, listed the financial industry, state -owned enterprises, political and legal industries such as "centralized power, dense funds, and resources" as the The focus of rectification of corruption, and said that it is necessary to correct the "hedonism, extravagant wind"; in February, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission also <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中纪委发文誓言反腐-16次提金融/a-64801939">published an article</a>, Emphasize <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/兩會將召開-中國打擊金融業的享樂主義/a-64871545">Break the "Financial Elite theory", "only money theory", "Western reading theory"</a>Essence</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Beijing's attitude prompts financial companies to take action. Whether state -owned enterprises or private owners, they are ensuring that they have not violated the government's ideology.</p>
<p>An employee of a large state -owned common fund in China revealed to Reuters that the company asked them not to upload photos of high -end diet, clothes or bags on social media, try not to attract the attention of regulatory units and avoid public criticism.

They said that the summer allowance of about 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan per month was canceled from this month. None of these two banks responded to Reuters' comment requests.</p>

Although the overall salary of the banking industry has changed Not big, but the salary of executives has declined significantly; the trust industry not only declines in the overall salary level, but also has a significant layoff. "</p>
<h3>The financial regulatory agency is an example?</h3>
<p>Under the driving force of Xi Jinping's promotion of "common prosperity" and anti -corruption, China has recently launched the reform of financial regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/應對西方競爭-中國力推數十年最大機構改革/a-64915023">institutional reform plan in 2023</a>The CCP has once again formed the "Central Financial Working Committee" to strengthen the party's guidance of the financial system. The State Council of China established the "State Financial Supervision and Administration Administration" in May, based on the original "Bank of China Insurance Supervision and Administration Commission" (China Banking Regulatory Commission).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-19T07-46-00Z/64801048_401.jpg" />China implemented a large -scale institutional reform earlier this year, and financial regulatory units have since formed a "one line, one game and one time" pattern, namely the People's Bank of China (central bank), the State Financial Supervision and Administration Administration, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (Securities Regulatory Commission).</p>
<p>According to Reuters last month, after the institutional reform, the CSRC and the People's Bank of China have reduced their salary budgets in 2023. Bloomberg analyzed the budget report of the Securities Regulatory Commission that the unit's salary and allowance budget for employees this year was 17%less than the previous year. Those who are familiar with the matter have revealed that some employees may be reduced by more than 50%. Earlier, those who worked at financial supervision units had higher salaries than ordinary Chinese civil servants.Xinsun, a senior lecturer in China and East Asia Business, the King's College London, told Reuters: "The economic growth momentum and the overall budget of the government are not as good as in the past. That is a key political priority, and it is also the most important driving force for the recent tightening policy. "</p>
<p>"China's inequality has reached a high level, which has been continued for a long time." Sun Xin said that the Chinese Communist Party is now reducing the benefits of the "financial elite" to reduce the inequality in the regime. To achieve political stability.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, London, 19th) The British Parliament will vote on the investigation report of the "Party Gate" incident in the former Prime Minister Johnson &amp; Johnson.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-19T08-02-07-00-00/000000.png" />Congress voted on the 59th birthday of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The former British leader was calculating the next step. His allies predict that Johnson &amp; Johnson will return to the election battlefield.</p>
<p>The conservative party government of Rishi Sunak, the current Prime Minister, is also facing increasing political problems. The British inflation rate is high, and frequent interest rate hikes have also made voters suffer economically.</p>
<p>As the pushing hand of Brexit, the Leadership of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Conservative Party, won an overwhelming victory in the December 2019 election. However, the party door and a series of other scandals, Johnson &amp; Johnson was forced to resign in July last year.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson refuted the investigation report of the Privilege Committee of the Congress, claiming that he was a victim of the design of political rivals, and also accused the investigations of the investigated members who performed like a "private court" and determined to end his political career. Essence</p>
<p>The Privilege Committee of the Congress found that Johnson &amp; Johnson "repeatedly despised (Congress) ... and tried to destroy the parliamentary procedure" in a severe report on the 15th.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that "because the person who committed this behavior was the Prime Minister and the highest internal level of the government, it was even more serious to despise the plot." The report also said, "In the past, the Prime Minister had never deliberately misled the previous example of the house."</p>
<p>If the voting is approved, Johnson &amp; Johnson will be suspended for 90 days, but he has already resigned as a parliamentarian position on the 9th. Several of his parliamentarians expected to invest in the report, but it was reported that Qiangsheng told them that they would not have to oppose it because punishment was not substantial anyway.</p>
<p>Even if this voting seems to let the party scandal come to an end, another video appeared yesterday, showing that the conservative party workers held a party during the epidemic prevention blockade in December 2020, but the public was banned from engaging in social activities or meeting with relatives and friends at that time. Essence</p>
<p>Former local development, house and community minister Michael Gove apologized for this film.</p>
<p>Goff told BBC (BBC) that the film was "penetrated" and "did not justify."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-19T08-02-42/1-1687161159.jpg" />North Korean leader Kim Jong -un (middle) at the party meeting(Reuters)According to official media reports, senior North Korean officials have promised to try to launch military spy satellites again, and call the first launch test of their country's failure last month as the "worst failure" this year.</p>
<p>According to a report from the DPRK, the promise was made at the administrative North Korean Workers' Party Conference held on Friday to Sunday.</p>
<p>The North Korean Society stated that the expansion of all conferences require staff and researchers to analyze the reasons for the failure of the launch, and "severely criticize" the person who is responsible for the mistake.</p>
<p>North Korea tried to send its first military spy satellite into the orbit on May 31, but due to the rocket failure in Pyongyang, the aircraft and its effective load fell into the sea shortly after the launch.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-19T08-02-42/2-1687161176.jpg" />The largest on -site fire exercise in the history of the United States and South Korea(Peninsula TV Station)The crash has led North Korea leader Kim Jong -un to obtain the heavenly foundation surveillance system to better monitor the efforts of the United States and South Korea.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul condemned the launch on May 31st, saying that it violated the United Nations resolution that banned Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology to conduct any test. Analysts pointed out that there is a significant technology overlap between the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the capacity of space launch.</p>
<p>The report from the North Korean Society did not specifically explain that North Korea might try to make the second launch date. However, the Korean spy agency told the legislators earlier that Pyongyang may need "more than a few weeks" to determine what the first experiment was.</p>
<p>South Korea said today that it has successfully salvaged a large piece of wreckage of crashed rockets from Haidilao. Seoul spent more than two weeks for salvage, because these fragments can help scientists understand Pyongyang's ballistic missiles and satellite surveillance programs.</p>
<h4>"major progress"</h4>
<p>Kim Jong -un has promised to obtain several high -tech military assets to cope with the hostile operations of his so -called American as the United States. This spy satellite is one of the one. In addition, multi -warhead missiles, nuclear submarines, and solid propulsion intercontinental ballistic missiles and hypersonic missiles are also other weapon systems that Kim Jong -un wanted to own.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, North Korea has conducted more than 100 missiles, including some of them related to the spy satellite on the development of Kim Jong -un and other powerful weapons.</p>
<p>In April, North Korea tested the solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. The fuel of this missile has been installed in it, so they are more mobility than rockets using liquid pushing agents, and it is more difficult for outsiders to find before launch.</p>
<p>According to the North Korean Society, during the Labor Party's meeting, members of the Politburo claimed that "major progress" was made in the efforts to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles, and they claimed that this provided support for the government and the enemy's "positive confrontation" policy.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that members of the Politburo also analyzed the "reckless war move" due to its competitors, which caused the region to "extremely deteriorate the security situation", which obviously refers to the expanding US -South Korea military exercises.</p>
<p>It is reported that they have unanimously approved the unsatisfactory counterattack plan.</p>
<p>According to the DPRK, members of the Politburo of North Korea have formulated "important tasks" that have not been explained in detail, aiming to defend national interests and strengthen the unity of countries that "oppose the strategy of American robbers' world hegemony".</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed that the food supply can be self -sufficient by increasing the national agricultural output and completing the annual grain production goals.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the South Korean Ministry of Unity stated that the food situation in North Korea "seemed to deteriorate."</p>
<p>This isolated country has been strictly sanctioned due to its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. In addition, the country's economic situation is further nervous because of the strict border blockade of the new crown epidemic.</p>
<p>In addition, the North Korean Society reported that Jin Yingzhe, who had previously served as the Minister of the United Front Department and Kim Jong -un, was appointed as an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>A Korean legislator said at the time that Kim Yingzhe was degraded after failing to reach an agreement with the US summit in 2019. He led the summit negotiations with the then American colleagues and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>

<p>The obvious overloaded fishing boat was photographed many times before sinking.</p>
<p><strong> A immigration ship sinks on Wednesday (June 14), and hundreds of sneaks are unknown. The BBC has evidence that the Greek Coast Guard has doubts about the description of the incident. </strong></p>
<p>The reporter analyzed the navigation trajectory of other ships in the sea, and believed that the overloaded fishing vessels remained in place within seven hours before sinking. The maritime police insisted that during this period, the fishing boat sailed towards Italy and did not need to be rescued.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities have not responded to BBC's survey results so far.</p>
<p>The shipwreck killed at least 78 people, and the United Nations said that the whereabouts of up to 500 people were unknown. There is a voice questioning that Greece should have taken more actions to start comprehensive search and rescue.</p>
<p>In this regard, the United Nations calls for investigation to deal with the practice of this is the practice. Greek officials insisted that the staff on board showed no help, and until the moment before sinking, the fishing boat was not dangerous.</p>

<p>104 people were rescued, and the United Nations claimed hundreds of people who lived and died.</p>
<p>The BBC obtained a display <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/">Marinetraffic</a>Computer animation that tracks data, this is a maritime data analysis platform.</p>
<p>Their data shows that a small seas that of immigration ships later sinking for a few hours of activities, and these data brought questions about the official statement of navigation of fishing boats without difficulty.</p>
<p>The fishing vessels are not equipped with tracking equipment, so they are not displayed on the map, as well as the maritime police and naval ships because they do not need to share their position.</p>
<h3>The official incident of the sea police sequencing suspect</h3>
<p>The EU Border Administration (Frontex) said that the bureau first discovered the immigration ship at 08:00 at 08:00 last Tuesday (13), and knew that the Greek authorities would be known as the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Alarm Phone, a hotline for emergency help for immigrants at sea, said that they received calls at 12:17 GMT, saying that fishing boats were in critical condition.</p>
<p>We use the BBC facts to identify authentic videos and photos, as well as court documents and maritime records to analyze the next hours of ship dynamics.</p>
<p>Marinetraffic animation shows that a ship named "Lucky Sailor" suddenly turned north at 15: 00GMT. The "Lucky Sea" Ship East provided its Log Book to the BBC, and confirmed that the maritime police asked the ship to be close to the immigrant ship and provide food and water to the other party.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, at 15:35 GMT, the marine police helicopter found the immigrant ship. Greek officials still claimed that the fishing vessels were still sailing at the time.</p>

<p>The yellow mark on the map is the place where the immigrant ship sinks. From the direction of the ship's movement there, a few hours before the shipwreck, the fishing boat has not moved.</p>
<p>But two and a half hours later, about 18:00 GMT, another ship "Faithful Warrior" sailed to the same sea area, and also supplied immigrant ships.</p>
<p>The "Loyal Fighter" shipowner reminded BBC to inquire with the investigation authorities.</p>
<p>A piece of video was reported from the video of the "Loyal Fighter", which claimed that the ship was recorded on the migrant ship with a rope on the sea, and no other ships were seen in the clip.</p>
<p>The BBC facts verified the video and confirmed that the appearance of the boat was in line with the immigrant ship seen in the photo -and it did not move in the clip -the weather conditions also met the report at the time. The shooting time of the video is unknown.</p>
<p>Between 19:40 GMT and 22:40 GMT, Greek officials originally declared that immigrant ships maintained "stable routes and speed".</p>
<p>The authorities' initial statements said that they kept cautiously and observed immigration ships, but they later released a close -up photo -and it was taken during this time -showing that the immigration ship did not go.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/_130128897_bdb6f606-fca8-41ae-8320-ff8d3634928f.png" />Image source, Greek Coast Guard</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The Greek Marine Police released this photo on Thursday (15th), which was taken by the sea police a few hours before the fishing boat sank.</p>
<p>A Greek government spokesman later said that the sea police had tried to board the immigrant ship for risk assessment, but someone on the ship unlocked the cable and did not want to be aid.The proportion of animation maps shows that the immigration ship sailed for a few nautical miles. It is expected to be within the expected ship where the immigration ship is in the most deep place in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The anxious person on the boat causes the ship to sway, and it will also promote such movement.</p>
<p>During this time, Greek officials insisted that the immigration ship was not dangerous and instead sailed to Italy safely. Therefore, the maritime police did not try to step forward to rescue.</p>
<p>By 23:00 GMT, the immigrant ships of hundreds of people sank, and the ship tracking animation showed that many ships rushed to the scene for rescue.</p>
<p>One of them was CeleBrity Beyond, a cruise ship. Someone on the boat took a photo after the maritime and sent the clip to the BBC.</p>
<p>The luxurious yacht "Queen Maya" was then ordered to rescue 104 survivors and send them to the shore.</p>
<p>The rescued people were sent to Kalamata, who returned to a safe place, but also left a series of questions for Greece's overall response.</p>

We have celebrated the text of the text in March. But (the treaty (treaty ) After passing, I really pave the way for a step. "</p>
<p>This milematic, The High Seas Treaty will establish a legal structure to expand the scope of environmental protection to an international waters that account for more than 60 % of the world's ocean area.</p>
<p>After more than 15 years of discussion, including 4 years of official negotiations. The UN member states have been finalized in the final marathon negotiation in March this year, and the text of the treaty is finalized.</p>
<p>A group of scientists wrote in the medical magazine "Lancet": "The healthy ocean, from coastal waters to remote public sea, to the deep sea bed area, are an indispensable part of human health, well -being, and survival."</p>
<p>Because there are a large number of oceans in the world in the jurisdiction of the exclusive economic zone of individual countries, the protection tasks of "Gonghai" require international cooperation.</p>
<p>The "Gonghai Treaty" of the "Gonghai Treaty" refers to the international waters that all countries have the right to fish, navigate and do research. At present, only 1%of Gonghai is protected.</p>
<p>Governments of various countries passed a historic agreement in Montreal in Montreal, Canada last December to agree to protect 30%of the world's land and oceans worldwide by 2030. For this goal, the Gonghai Treaty is very important.</p>
<p>The non -governmental organization believes that after the UN General Assembly passed the treaty, the approval of 60 member states to take effect can be achieved. This threshold should be achieved, because there were about 50 "High AmbitionCoality" that promoted the Gonghai Treaty. Countries, including EU countries, Chile, Mexico, India and Japan.</p>
<p>However, there are 193 member states in the United Nations, 60 countries are generally adopted by countries, and there is still a way to go.</p>
<p>The High Seas Alliance (High Seas Alliance) issued a post on a community platform Twitter (Twitter) appealed: "(Gonghai Treaty) quickly approves and takes into effect." It is important!"</p>

<p>On June 19, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange launched the "Hong Kong dollar-RMB dual counter model" on the first day. China's official media quoted "industry insiders" that this move will enrich the investment channels of RMB, promote the circulation of the RMB in the offshore market, and promote the internationalization of the RMB.</p>
<p>However, after the Hong Kong "Ming Pao" querying the relevant dual counter service on the day of the "Ming Pao" found that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange had previously pointed out that most brokerage trading was equipped with RMB pricing product transactions, but cross -counter services depending on whether the broker decided to add it. As of now, there are no cross -counter transactions including medium and large retail investors, Futu, Huasheng and Tiger Securities. Most of the securities firms participating in the first stage are Chinese securities firms or banks. Industry insiders expect that investors do not have much interest in stocks at the RMB counter. Only about 20 % and a half interviewees believe that their customers are interested in this, and the rest thinks that interest is generally or not interested.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is currently the world's largest offshore RMB trading center. Since 2010, the local securities market has also launched RMB bonds such as RMB bonds and futures to prize financial products. According to Xinhua News Agency, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange launched the day of the dual counter, and 24 securities including Hang Seng Bank and Sun Hung Base Real Estate became dual -counter securities. Nine exchanges including China Bank International Securities Co., Ltd. and China International Financial Hong Kong Securities Co., Ltd. have begun to conduct dealer activities or provide circulation activities. It is reported to describe the above -mentioned dual counter mode is the "upgraded version" of the internationalization of the RMB.</p>

<p>Last month, a mainland passenger who took Cathay Pacific flights from Chengdu to Hong Kong, because of disputes with the flight attendants in English and Cantonese, accused the company of employees suspected of discrimination. Related incidents quickly triggered the criticism of Chinese official media and government officials including Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao, and many crew members were fired.</p>

Brinken met with Chinese Foreign Minister for seven and a half hours in Beijing. This is the first time that the Secretary of State has visited China since 2018. The tension between the two countries delayed this visit for a few months: Brin Ken was originally visited China in February this year, but it announced in the Pentagon [China Review Balloon] in the Pentagon.(https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230206/balloon-china-united-states/)It was postponed after Piaoyue.</p>
<p>Blint and other US officials expressed their hope that this visit would start a more constructive diplomatic era. But China has maintained in recent weeks <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230617/blinken-china-us-xi/">confrontation position</a>As a result, people are worried that the meeting between the two parties in Beijing may eventually be more hostile than friendly.</p>

<p>During the two -day meeting, both sides came with a series of complaints and questions. Their talks may provide a key point for whether China and the United States can repair the relationship immediately.</p>
<p>Blint started the first talk on Sunday afternoon. He and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang walked into a room in the Diaoyutai State Guest House together. Until a few months ago, Qin Gang had been the Chinese ambassador to the United States.

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman posted on Twitter <a href="https://www.kzaobao.com/cngov/2023-06/18141109.html">I used an optimistic tone</a>When it comes to the meeting between the Supreme Leaders of the two countries last year, they vowed to stabilize the relationship at the time.</p>
<p>"It is expected that this meeting will allow Sino -US relations to return to the consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries at the Bali meeting last year," a spokesman Hua Chunying wrote.</p>
<p>The official Chinese minutes of the meeting released by the official news media are not so optimistic. It is reported that Qin Gang asserted that US -China relations were the lowest since the restoration of normal diplomatic relations in 2019. Qin Gang also pointed out that the issue of Taiwan is the biggest risk facing Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>"The Secretary of State clearly stated that the United States will always defend the interests and values of the American people and cooperate with its allies and partners to promote our vision of a world of free, openness and maintenance based on international rules," the United States Minister wrote.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, Brinken was going to return to the National Hotel to meet with Wang Yi, the highest foreign policy official in China. In February, the two held a fierce talks during the Munich Safety Conference. It was that weekend that Brinson publicly stated that Chinese officials were considering providing lethal military assistance to Russia for the killing of the Ukraine War.</p>

<p><strong> What are the problems on the list of Brutken? </strong></p>
<p>U.S. officials emphasize that resumed high -level diplomatic contact is <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230615/blinken-china-visit/">their primary tasks</a>Essence They said that the two sides need to establish communication channels to ease the tension relationship that may be upgraded at the time of crisis. For example, the naval ships or planes of the two countries collide in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Safety issues may be the top priority of discussion. American officials are increasingly worried that friction with the Chinese army around the sea of China. The United States is also paying close attention to the establishment of military bases in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and warns China not to provide lethal military assistance to Russia.</p>
<p>Kangda(Daniel J.Kritenbrink)Said that Brintken intends to discuss with Chinese officials that the two countries may have common interests, including climate change and global economic stability.</p>
<p>Blingken may also ask China to release several American citizens who have been detained, imprisoned or prohibited from exporting, and tried to restart some civil exchanges, which may include increasing the number of journalist visas issued by the two countries to each other.

<p><strong> What can China be mentioned? </strong></p>
<p>China is expected to put forward a series of dissatisfaction that reflects Beijing's views. The Chinese government believes that the United States is the hegemon that is declining, and is determined to curb China in terms of economic, military and diplomacy to maintain its status.</p>

<p>The head of the list of China is the Taiwan issue. Beijing claims that this independent island is its own territory, and the United States has given Taiwan military assistance.</p>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping described Taiwan as "the core of China's core interests" and accused the United States of supporting the "Taiwan independence" forces and interfered with China's internal affairs.</p>
<p>China may also be highly dissatisfied with the efforts of the United States and restricting China to obtain advanced semiconductor chips and manufacturing equipment. The United States said that in order to prevent US technology from falling into the Chinese army, it is necessary to take restrictions. This restriction may delay China's technological development for many years. China regards restrictions on the ban as an example of "zero and competition", and believes that this competition is promoting the confrontation between the two countries.China's ultimate goal is to treat China as the same country as the same country, so that it has an equal right to speak on the global stage, so as not to feel that the US military existence in Asia pose a threat to itself.</p>
<p><strong> Will Xi Jinping meet Brinken? </strong></p>

However, officials on both sides have been formulated the final details of the Blingken schedule in the past week. Whether the two may meet at the last moment may be determined, and a large extent depends on the talks on Sunday and Monday morning.</p>

<p>Some workers sent out from the scene <a href="https://www.douyin.com/video/7232096082895981824">video</a>From the "Party Mass Service Center" and "New Era Civilization Practice Station" brand, the camera slowly moved to the five -star red flag on the top of the building. Intersection</p>
<p><a href="http://www.szsuccess.com.cn/yxwl/index_13.aspx">Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd.</a>Established in 2004 and listed in 2009.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">In 2019, Yushun Plant received a written notice from the Changzhen Community</a>, Make a relocation within 3 years. Three years later, in February last year, the company received a written notice from the Changzhen community, requiring the lease relationship before May 31 last year, and August 10th. The lease of Yushun Factory's plant did not expire until July 2024.</p>
<p>So, for the first time in 2019, the company has received the community relocation notice for almost 4 years. Has the Yushun Factory Trade Union conducted negotiations on the compensation plan on behalf of the employee?</p>
<p>In addition, the factories were relocated to the Changzhen community, and the Changzhen Community Trade Union Service Center worked with the Community Party and Mass Service Center. So, is the Changzhen Community Trade Union on the relocation plan that may affect the rights and interests of the workers, and negotiate with the community service center to ensure that the interests of employees can be guaranteed during the relocation process?</p>
<p>In particular, the Changzhen community requires the Yushun plant to relocate before the lease expires, which will inevitably affect the factory's operation, thereby affecting the company's ability to make reasonable compensation for workers. Does the Changzhen Community Trade Union participate in the negotiation of the company's participation in the enterprise and the Changzhen community on behalf of Yushun Factory. It is suggested that the Changzhen Community suspend the lease early to make additional compensation to the enterprise to ensure that the company has the ability to make reasonable compensation for workers?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the workers have gathered in the Changzhen Community Party and Mass Service Center (office with the Changzhen Community Trade Union) for help, do the community unions come forward to represent the workers and negotiate with the community and the factory?</p>
<p>Half a year ago, on December 13, 2022, Yushun Co., Ltd. issued the relocation <a href="https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H2_AN202212121581022248_1.pdf?1670882016000.pdf">Announcement</a>It is mentioned that employees will follow the factory area to relocate and fail to follow the factory area relocation personnel. The company will legally terminate labor relations in accordance with the relevant provisions of the labor law.</p>
<p>So, in the next half of the year, the Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Trade Unions, Guangming District Trade Unions, and the Shenzhen Federation of Trade Unions, each to avoid the situation of the situation.</p>
<p>According to the data, the Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions announced a legal service that cost 170,000 yuan last year <a href="http://www.szgm.gov.cn/xxgk/xqgwhxxgkml/gzgg/content/post_10136621.html">work plan</a>Essence This plan was announced in September, and in October, the goal was that by the end of 2022, the coverage rate of legal consultants in the first and secondary community trade unions in the street reached 100%. Level -level labor communication and negotiation mechanism.</p>
<p>So, did Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions assist Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd. to negotiate the relocation compensation plan in accordance with the work plan that he formulated and announced?</p>
<p>There is another thing. In June last year, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">more than 50 workers in Yushun plant have complained</a>At the Shenzhen Housing Provident Fund Management Center, the factory said that the factory had not paid the housing provident fund for front -line production workers. Before that worker went to the Provident Fund Management Center to complain, did he come to the union for help and ask the union representative workers and the enterprise to complete the supplementary payment through negotiation?</p>
<p>The Yushun Factory was established for 19 years and was listed for 14 years. It did not pay the housing provident fund for front -line workers. Are the corporate unions, Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Unions, and Guangming unions knowing this?</p>
<p>Please listen to these questions and talk to the Changzhen community staff.</p>

Although the employment population decreased by 63,000 year -on -year, the employment rate rose, which reflects the changes in the Korean population structure.

Stein Mel emphasized the importance of US -China relations on "global security and cooperation"</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) The topic of the Chinese State Council's visit to Germany has not attracted much attention in China so far. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin just announced the schedule on Thursday on Thursday. The official media did not focus much on the intergovernmental consultation between Germany and China, and not much voice pointed out that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与中国压力山大的伙伴关系/a-65941273">The attitude of the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party in the Berlin to treat the Chinese government. Criticism. </a></p>
<h3>The environment is not the past</h3>
<p>In the opinion of the scholar of the European Research Center of the Shanghai International Institute of International Issues, China's party and state leadership now needs to respond to Germany's different policies to China in the past.</p>
<p>This foreign policy researcher believes that compared with Merkel's administration, many factors in Germany and China have changed, "including the international environment, regional security situation, and the German internal affairs environment."</p>
<h3>is how to re -position relations with China</h3>
<h3>bilateral relationship becomes more complicated</h3>
<p>Wu Qiang, a political scholar in Beijing, analyzed a deeper analysis of the relationship between the two countries. In his opinion, Germany and China relations have currently entered a "self -reflection" stage -and this coexistence at the same time with each other.</p>
<p>Wu Qiang is one of the few international political scholars who are in China and are still publicly expressing criticism. He taught at Tsinghua University, but was later fired for publicly publishing his criticism of the CCP.</p>
<p>"Mutual dislocation between China and Germany involves the issue of Taiwan and the Russian and Ukraine War." Wu Qiang said in an interview with Deguanglian reporters. How to continue the question. "</p>
<h3>Facing problems in German companies</h3>
<p>Although China is the largest trading partner in Germany, for German companies, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济遭重创-在华德企商业信心探底/a-64092035">China's political environment has brought them more and more difficulties</a>Essence The Chinese authorities have put forward more requirements for international enterprises that have carried out business in China than in the past, hoping that they can completely avoid getting involved in the political field, especially not to ask for criticism of politics and human rights.</p>
<p>It is expected that the German government will also mention China's anti -spy law at this government consultation meeting. This law can make Chinese authorities more easily convicted of foreign companies and their staff, such as the assessment of Chinese national statistics.</p>
<h3>Questions about German National Security Strategic Files</h3>
<p>Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang is expected to have a strategic document to China that is about to introduce the German government, and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国出台首份国家安全战略-中国是对手也是伙伴/a-65912004">The national security strategy just announced recently</a>A lot of questions are raised -the German national security strategy released last week mentioned six times in the text.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has criticized this document, because in Beijing's view, this is a evidence that democratic countries in the world feel that they have received the threat of Chinese nationalist policy.</p>
<p>Scholars Wu Qiang analyzed: "The most headache for Beijing is the so -called collective security order established by the United States and the West -this pattern has included the Western Pacific and Southeast Asian countries. Build this security pattern together. "</p>
<h3>China's interests in the Asia -Pacific region</h3>
<p>Beijing also noticed that more and more Germany showed concern about the security situation in the Asia -Pacific region, and China originally regarded this area as its own sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Therefore, when German Defense Minister BORISPISTOSRIUS announced in early June that it would send German naval ships to the Asia -Pacific waters for cruise next June, it also caused China to be vigilant. This topic is expected to be mentioned in Berlin's government consultation.</p>

<p>On June 19, local time in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Brillings ended a two -day visit to China and held a press conference before leaving Beijing. Brinken said that his trip conducted in -depth discussions with Chinese officials on a series of major international, regional challenges and bilateral issues.</p>
<p>"In Beijing, I had a very important dialogue with President Xi Jinping, and also had a frank, substantial and constructive talks with Director Wang Yi and Qin Gang of Qin Gang. The country has expressed concerns about the provocative operations of the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. The two parties agree that it is necessary to stabilize the relationship. "</p>
<p>Blint also reiterated on the Taiwan issue that the United States has not changed based on the three joint communiqués of Taiwan relations, the United States and China, and the sixth China policies related to Taiwan, and encouraged cross -strait to resolve dialogue on peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Brinken said, "The United States does not support Taiwan independence, and it is an attempt to unilaterally change the status of the Taiwan Strait." He said, "We keep the obligations stipulated in the Taiwan Relations Law, including ensuring that Taiwan has enough weapons for self -defense."</p>
<p>On the afternoon, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Blingken in the Great Hall of the People. Brinken made it clear to Xi Jinping that the United States had no intention of conflicting with China and looking forward to maintaining smooth communication with China and responsible control. In addition, Broskere also told the United States Colombia Broadcasting Corporation after meeting with Xi Jinping that as of now, the United States and China have not yet reached any agreement on the restoration of direct exchanges between the two countries.</p>
<p>Blindken is the first US Secretary of State to visit China since 2018. Dozens of international human rights organizations appealed to the U.S. government to pay attention to human rights issues in China before the visit of Blingken. Blint said at a press conference held on Monday that the United States and many countries in the world seriously concerned about China's infringement of human rights, and the Chinese infringement involved Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. He also raised the problem of being unjust by Chinese citizens in China to China, "nothing more important than ensuring the personal safety of American citizens overseas."</p>
<p>It is generally believed that Brins are dedicated to controlling the upgrading of tensions in the United States and China. However, at the regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, a spokesman Mao Ning said the question about whether China plans to arrange Biden and Xi Jinping in the next few months that she "had no news that could be provided."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65959172/16383236"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-19T11-13-00Z/16383236_303.jpg" /></a>The European Union has developed a risk -going strategy</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) on Tuesday, the European Commission will announce a "economic security" strategy. Reuters reported that a series of measures of the European Commission include reviewing foreign investment and export controls, which aims to prevent China and other countries from getting valuable technologies from the European Union and prevent related technologies from being used by competitors for military use. The European Commission will introduce the "economic security" strategy to EU members and member states. Next week, the European Union will also hold a meeting in Brussels to discuss relations with China.</p>
<p>According to the German "Business Daily", the basic elements of this strategy include more stringent investment supervision and export restrictions, research and development of auditing mechanisms involved in security, and creating more tough supply chains. Bloomberg specifically pointed out that there are currently 5 types of tools in the European Union that can be used to suppress China's geopolitical rise, which are anti -economic coercion measures, supervise and control the EU's overseas investment, strictly review foreign investment in the EU, Hong Kong strategy, and promote the trade agreement. Essence</p>
<h3>Anti -economic stress</h3>
<p>The Voice of Germany earlier this month has reported that the representatives of the EU Parliament and the government representatives of various member states will be a new <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟出台反制工具-对外来经济胁迫说不/a-65849853">anti -economic coercion tool</a>Reach consensus. In the future, if the third country tries to interfere with the political decision of the EU or its member states with improper economic sanctions, the EU will be able to counter the country's improving punitive tariffs. Other response methods also include restricting the country's direct investment in the European Union and bidding in public projects in the European Union. In addition, the European Union also stated that restrictions on the relevant transactions of the service industry will also become possible sanctions.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the EU and its member states have become the target of economic coercion of the EU foreign countries many times. For example, China has implemented trade restrictions on Lithuania. The European Union believes that such restrictions do not comply with the relevant provisions of the World Trade Organization, and also have a joint impact on the EU's internal market exports.</p>
<h3>In the face of Chinese investment, how should Europe be dealt with?</h3>
<p>Vice Chairman of the European Commission, Valdisdombrovskis, vice chairman of the EU Commission, said that sanctions should only be used as the last means when they are unsuccessful. Non -EU countries have dialogue. When the dialogue is unsuccessful, the possibility of mediation, arbitration or judicial trial should also be considered.</p>
<h3>investment and export</h3>
<p>At the same time, the European Commission is brewing to restrict European companies such as European companies such as China such as China. At the end of May this year, the "[Trade and Science and Technology Council" (TTC) held a meeting in Sweden at the end of May this year.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欧经济高官会晤-协调经贸政策应对中国/a-65773297)The topic includes export control and investment supervision. In this regard, the United States' position on China makes the EU more sharp and tough.</p>
<p>Next month, a new regulations on foreign subsidies will begin to take effect, which will give the European Commission's power to prevent foreign -containing opponents who have obtained subsidies in other countries in unfair benefits in the EU market. Bloomberg reports that the tool stipulates the reporting obligation to all companies involved in large EU public bidding or mergers and acquisitions transactions.</p>
<h3>Hamburg Port "Blessing Land" to attract Chinese capital is a blessing or a disaster?</h3>
<h3>Key infrastructure</h3>
<p>The European Parliament will also consider making new restrictions on foreign companies that intend to invest in key European infrastructure. Chinese companies have owned shares in the ports of at least 10 EU member states. Since last year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国政府批准中远入股汉堡港-最高参股2499/a-65589368">Hamburg Port</a>The plan of a container terminal caused huge controversy in Germany, which also led to a wave of approval procedures. The final project was approved, but China had to reduce the proportion of equity. A factor of "error decision" focused by critics is that the whaper is not listed as "key infrastructure" in Hamburg Port.</p>
<h3>Trading Agreement and Global Portal</h3>
<p>In order to reduce its dependence on China's supply chain, the European Union is negotiating and signing a trade agreement with Chile and Australia, which will help the EU's key material for electric vehicle batteries-lithium. The European Commission is also negotiating an agreement with the Southern Common Market Trade Group, including Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Union launched its "Global Portal" initiative to respond to China's "Belt and Road" plan to improve its economic influence in Latin America, Central Asia and Africa. The initiative plans to invest 300 billion euros, mainly for infrastructure investment.</p>

Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.</p>

<h3>Chinese attitude becomes focus</h3>
<p>According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, it was Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There was no red carpet at the scene and no welcome team.</p>
<p>Joshrogin, a Washington Post columnist, said on Twitter that Chinese officials sent relatively low -level officials to welcome Blink at the airport. "Maybe Beijing intends to humiliate him, hope not."</p>
<p>However, French entrepreneurs living in China, ARNAUDBERTRAND, said in response to Luo Jin's tweet that this is just a Chinese standard diplomatic etiquette and no dwarf; Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) Scholar Paultriolo said "there is no signs of humiliation at this stage."</p>
<p>According to photos posted by Betron, Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State of the US President Obama,)When Johnkerry visited China in 2012 and 2013, Xie Feng, then the director of the North American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, was also the same as Yang Tao at the same level. However, it can be seen from the photo that when Hillary visited China in 2012, the Chinese official was prepared to welcome the red carpet at the time.</p>
<p>As for the talks with Qin Gang on Sunday (18th), Bonnieglaser, the Director of Indo -Pacific Research Director of the Marshall Foundation (GMF) in Germany (GMF). The expected positive, China has shown that it is committed to building a stable, expected, and constructive Sino -US relations, "this is important." The United States mentioned that Brinton and Qin Gang held a "frank, substantial and constructive" talks. Although the word "Coopic" was not mentioned, it was still positive.</p>
<p>Ge Laiyi pointed out that the outside world's previous expectations for this visit were very low, but as of now, it seems that it has been quite smooth, and both sides seek stable bilateral relations; Brinken may meet with Xi Jinping. She said that if Brinton really can see Xi Jinping, this will be the most important meeting.</p>
<h3>Chinese official media: Hope to respect each otherThe editorial said that the United States showed a positive attitude towards Bronken's visit to China, which can also be said to "as a last resort." In the outside, the international community, including its allies, hopes that Sino -US relations will stop falling and stabilize to avoid shaking the foundation of world peace and stability.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/秦剛晤布林肯75小時-指中美關係處最低谷/a-65955570) 。</h3>
<p>社論還說，希望布林肯的訪問能為中美接下來的更多溝通開一個好頭，也希望他能將在中國得到的信息準確帶回到美國社會，這些信息簡而言之就是相互尊重、和平共處、合作共贏，「它只有短短十二個字，卻值得華盛頓仔細掂量」。</p>

<p><em>The author of this article is Patek asset management(Pictet Asset Management)Senior economist</em></p>
<p>Poor bond investor. After suffering the devastating losses of dual digits in 2022, the fixed income market is still more fragile than any time since the subprime crisis. Estimated by the volatility of the bond price of the bonds closely tracked(MOVE)The index has recently touched the highest level in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>What is even more worrying is that the instability of US Treasury bonds, as a gang rails in the global bond market, is particularly obvious.</p>
<p>In just one week in March this year, the two -year US Treasury yield raised the largest single -day decline since the collapse of the stock market in 1987, and the largest single -day increase since 2009. This is not a manifestation of defensive asset categories.</p>
<p>Indeed, in view of the radical measures taken by central banks in various countries to overcome inflation, the bond market is destined to suffer turbulence. In the United States, the fastest speed since the 1980s has risen since the 1980s, and in just 14 months, it has increased from zero to 5%to 5.25%in just 14 months.</p>
<p>However, the recent violent fluctuations in the market show that there is a new motivation. We believe that bond holders have become the core conflict of the central bank's policy formulation.</p>
<p>The current problem is the Federal Reserve(Fed)And other central banks can also put anti -anti -inflation in another official mission -how long to maintain financial stability -how long.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the transformation of the preferred matters of policy makers may be earlier than many investors think earlier. The interest rate has risen to the point where the debt crisis may cause the debt crisis; maybe it won't be long, the interest rate will be lowered, which will cause a rebound in the bond market.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion that we have obtained by analyzing the trend of public and private debt in major economies in the world. Although the economic recovery after the epidemic has helped reduce government debt and GDP in China last year(GDP)The ratio of debt to economic output is still much higher than the level of 2020.</p>
<p>It wandered around 96%of GDP. However, what is even more concerned is that in many developed countries, the number of public and private debt is growing in a long -term unsustainable speed.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the vulnerability of a country's debt crisis, we compare the current growth rate of a country's public and private debt to GDP with the long -term historical trend. The higher the average level, the more vulnerable to a country is affected by debt liquidation.</p>
<p>Analysis shows that economies such as the United States and the euro zone are in a potential dangerous situation. At the end of 2022, the ratio of credit to GDP of these two economies was 268.2%and 254.2%, respectively.</p>
<p>According to our calculations, if the United States wants to make its debt burden sustainable for a long time, the cost of borrowing needs to be reduced by about 1.5 percentage points. For the euro area, the required decline is even greater because it is because of the unstable public finance in Italy. We found that the interest rate level of the entire euro area is nearly 3 percentage points higher than the level required to avoid the credit crisis.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is surprising that Switzerland is also close to the dangerous threshold, and the ratio of credit to GDP reaches 315.1%. Our model shows that in Switzerland, as long as we have a moderate interest rate hike twice, it will threaten the country's long -term debt status.</p>
<p>All this does not mean that the central bank will suddenly change the string and start to reduce the cost of borrowing.</p>
<p>However, as the global debt level is much higher than the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, policy makers will understand the risk of further interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>European Central Bank(ECB)In the recent semi -annual "Financial Stability Evaluation"(Financial Stability Review)It also admits this.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank warned in the report that the recent monetary policy tightened the "cracks and vulnerability" of the entire financial system. It said that rising interest rates have begun to put pressure on governments, enterprises and families in the entire European region, and the real estate market seems to be particularly affected.</p>
<p>Therefore, for bond investors, the conclusion is that this period of high interest rates may eventually be not a new normal they are preparing to welcome, but may soon be proven to be an exception.</p>

<p>Weilai Group(NIO.US;9866.HK)It has always been widely praised for its advanced electric vehicle, but last week it found that it was facing an unprecedented situation because it announced that it was an object of a netizen laughed at after the announcement of the price of all electric vehicles by 30,000 yuan. Just two months ago, Li Bin, CEO of Weilai, also claimed that he would definitely not join the price war that is currently stifling the industry, saying that this blind price reduction will only lead to "malignant competition."</p>
<p>Weilai's transformation highlights the current dilemma of Chinese electric car companies, because they are trying to go through an unexpected change, and analysis agencies say that this change may continue for a while. The situation of small companies is the most difficult, because further price cuts will erode their meager profits. But refusing to participate in this price reduction game, it will face the sales flow to BYD(1211.hk; 002594)Tesla(TSLA.US)Waiting for industry giants to risk.</p>
<p>Let's look at the recent price war, how can we affect the ideal car including the ideal car(LI.US; 2015.HK), Zero Running Cars(9863.HK)He Xiaopeng Automobile(XPEV.US;9868.HK)And Weimar Automobile, Chinese local small electric car companies. But first of all, we have to look back at how this price war has continued for months, how it evolved.</p>
<p>Everything started in October last year. At that time, Tesla raised the price of its Model 3 and Model at a maximum of 9%. By January of this year, the price reduced further, a maximum of 13.5%. The two rounds of price reductions have prompted other companies to follow suit. Among them, Xiaopeng Automobile announced in January that the G3I SUV and P5 and P7 cars had a maximum price reduction of 13%. BYD joined the following month. In 2021, the "Han EV" model was reduced by 20,000 yuan in Beijing. The 2021 style "Qin EV" model was reduced by 15,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Other brands, from domestic giants such as GAC, SAIC, FAW, to foreign brands such as Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Toyota, they also joined this bloody battle. Before the price cut, the Chinese government canceled a major electric vehicle purchase incentive plan at the end of last year. Earlier, the plan had helped the industry sales in 2022.</p>
<p>This price war also spread to the field of fuel vehicles, and major car companies were anxious to clean up the inventory before the new emission standard took effect in July.</p>
<p>According to data from the domestic media First Financial, the third -party consulting company Lisi strategic positioning consultation data said that as of the end of March, more than 40 car brands had been involved in this price war, and launched electric vehicles and fuel vehicles subsidies or price reductions. The data compiled by another domestic news media product "China Automobile Market" stated that with the increase in price cuts, about 20%of the passenger cars sold in China reached or exceeded 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p><strong> Promote integration </strong></p>
<p>The price war has shown signs of promoting integration in this crowded industry. The growth of the industry is largely promoted by the government's strong incentive measures, and these incentive measures are now being canceled rapidly.</p>
<p>With the continuation of the price war, the leaders of large companies are becoming more and more stable, while smaller companies are facing a downturn in sales. According to the China Passenger Car Market Information Joint Meeting(Cpca)In the first four months of this year, BYD, Tesla and GAC Ean's three companies in the pure electric vehicle market increased by 50.1%, higher than 42.7%of the same period last year. BYD led a market share of 24.9%, an increase of 7.4 percentage points year -on -year.</p>
<p>As large brands get more market share, many small brands have continued to lose their markets. Xiaopeng Automobile is the representative of this group. It fell out of the top 10 ranking of electric vehicle manufacturers in the first four months of this year, which is symbolic. Weilai Automobile's market share increased by 0.3 percentage points, but its 27.1%of the increase in car delivery increased far behind BYD and Tesla, because the latter two recorded more than 60%of the year -on -year increase.</p>
<p>Facing the slowdown of growth, it is not surprising that Weilai Automobile's joining the price war is not surprising. But whether this will increase its sales significantly, it remains to be observed.</p>
<p>Xiaopeng's experience is the opposite. The company's significant price reduction in January failed to boost sales. In the first three months of this year, the company's total car delivery volume actually decreased by 47.3%.</p>
<p>Another smaller electric vehicle startup Zero Running Motors also recorded the same bleak performance after launching a large price reduction measure. According to its latest quarterly report, the company's car delivery volume in the first quarter decreased by 51.3%to 10,509 vehicles.</p>
<p>Not all small -scale companies have been affected. In the intensified price war, the ideal car was the last persistence -52,584 vehicles were delivered in the first quarter, a year -on -year increase of 65.8%. During this period, the company also recorded a net profit of 934 million yuan to make it one of the few profitable electric vehicle manufacturers. BYD and Tesla were recorded during this period, while Weilai Automobile, Xiaopeng Automobile and Zero Running cars suffered losses.</p>
<p>The poor performance of small companies is also reflected in their profit margins that lag far behind large -scale peers. The gross profit margin of Weilai, Xiaopeng and Zero in the first quarter was lower than 2%, far lower than BYD's 17.9%, and Tesla's 19.3%higher number.</p>
<p>This pulls back to the dilemma facing the smaller company is now, and they will find that it is increasingly difficult to launch a long -term price war, because it will consume their cash reserves that are constantly shrinking, and investors with skeptical attitudes are not too much. It may provide new funds. As of the end of March, Weilai's cash shrunk from 45.5 billion yuan three months ago to 37.8 billion yuan, while Xiaopeng's cash was reduced from 38 billion yuan to 34 billion yuan in the same period. If the price war continues, the reduction of cash may continue or even accelerate.</p>
<p>The price war has brought some of the smallest major electric vehicle manufacturers on the verge of bankruptcy. Weimar Automobile is one of them. This company was once ambitious and now faces a financial crisis. According to reports, it has greatly reduced employee wages at the end of last year and 2023 and laid a large -scale layoff. Data from CPCA showed that Weimar Automobile sold only 457 vehicles in the first two months of 2023, a year -on -year decrease of 92.4%.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping held a meeting with US Secretary of State Brills on Monday. On the same day, the Kyodo News quoted the "Japanese Government Related People" pointed out that Japan is more concerned about how to manage long -term competition compared with the improvement of US -China relations. The Japanese side believes that the possibility of the Chinese posture is very low around the problems of the islands (China known as the Diaoyu Islands) and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is reported that the purpose of the Japanese government's attention to the direction of the dialogue between the United States and China is that the opposition of the United States and China tends to lead to the unstable relationship between Japan and China. Japan will maintain a consistent pace with the United States at the level of security, and at the same time strives to promote dialogue between Japan and China, thereby building a constructive and stable relationship.</p>
<p>In April this year, Japanese foreign minister Lin Fang was visiting China and held talks with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang. In September of this year, the Twenty Group (G20) summit will be held in India, and the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit will also be held in the United States in November. Japan will use it to coordinate whether the Japanese and middle summit talks can be achieved.</p>
<p>However, the report pointed out that recently the relevant China has strongly opposed the plan to the Tokyo Electric Power Company Fukushima's first nuclear power plant to deal with the water rowing sea programs and a Japanese male company executive detained by relevant Chinese departments. It is unknown whether it can create a positive environment.</p>

Although some Asianan countries include the current rotating chairman of Asia, the rotating chairman, the country India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, they are absent.</p>
<p>Critics have stated that the Thai -Detention Government's measures have destroyed the efforts of the Asian Simpan unity to respond to the Myanmar crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Thai Foreign Minister Pamwanina, which was convened by the talks, said in a visit to the Thai Public Television (Thaipbs) on Monday that the Myanmar crisis forced Myanmar's refugees to enter the neighboring country and severely hit the border trade.</p>
<p>"If we let this situation continue, Thailand will suffer the greatest influence." He said, "We can say that in Asia, Thailand is the only country that hopes to solve this crisis as soon as possible (solve Myanmar crisis) is good for us. "</p>
<p>Two sources who understand the talks told Reuters that the Myanmar military government's appointed Foreign Minister Than SWE will attend Monday's talks.</p>
<p>However, some member states of the Asianima refused to participate, and some of the Ayanan countries only sent lower officials to participate.</p>
<p>Last year, Prak Sokhonn, a special envoy of the A -Sanian Myanmar issue, sent his deputy to the talks on Monday.</p>

I hope that China and the United States will coexist and cooperate with friendly cooperation.

But it is very regrettable that China and the United States, especially the United States, cannot correctly understand the motivation of China's foreign policy, and the impact on China's development on the world. There is no very correct impact on the United States, which is in line with actual understanding. This is one of the most important reasons that lead to difficulties in Sino -US relations. "</p>
<p>"China is willing to sit down with the United States. If you want to come up with a way to solve the problem, I think this is a realistic attitude, and it is in line with the interests of both parties and the interests of the world."</p>

<p>VOICE: On the evening of the 19th, US Secretary of State Brosky held a press conference in the US Embassy in China to summarize the two -day trip to China. He said: "At each meeting, I emphasized that the direct contact and continuous communication of high -level high -levels are the best way to manage our differences responsiblely and ensure that competition will not evolve into conflict. The same is the same. We all agree that it is necessary to stabilize our relationship. "</p>
<p><strong> Brinten emphasizes the importance of maintaining direct communication between high -level direct communication </strong></p>
<p>Blingken said that during Beijing, he held an important conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and had a "frank, substantial and constructive discussion" with Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, director of the Foreign Affairs Office, and Qin Gang, a member of the State Councilor and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>For the three goals set before this visit, that is, establishing open communication channels, directly asking questions about attention, and seeking cooperation in the aspects of common interests. Brinken believes that he has done it in this interview. The progress is difficult, it takes time, and this is not a result of a visit, a trip, and a conversation. "He pointed out that both parties believe that" responsible management of this relationship. "</p>

<p>[US Secretary of State Brilling Kenkeng Beijing Press Conference]&gt; Since China has always called Taiwan's issue as the core of China's core interests, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%B8%83%E6%9E%97%E8%82%AF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> #Bollingken&gt;</a>&gt; It was mentioned at the press conference that he discussed with the Chinese issue with China.

</blockquote>
<p><strong> Worried about China's provocative operation, Brincken reiterated the US policy to Taiwan </strong></p>
<p>In response to the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits issues that are concerned about from all walks of life, Brinken said: "I have proposed the concerns of the United States and more and more countries' provocative operations in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The long -term 'one China' policy. This policy has not changed. "</p>
<p>On the issue of Taiwan, Brintken reiterated that the United States has not changed its policy based on the three joint communiqués of Taiwan relations, the United States and China, and one of the six guarantees on Taiwan. He also said that the United States does not support Taiwan independence and also opposes any attempt to change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait unilaterally. He also pointed out: "Our obligations stipulated in the Taiwan Relations Law, including ensuring that Taiwan has enough weapons for self -defense."</p>
<p>Blindken also mentioned the recent close contact with the United States and China, and once again emphasized the importance of restoring military communication channels between the United States and China. However, he revealed that China did not agree with its suggestions, "At present, China has not agreed to promote this process. I think this is a problem that we must continue to solve. It is very important to recover these communication channels."</p>
<p>When it comes to the Russian and Ukraine War, Brinken also reiterated that China and other countries are welcome to play a constructive role in solving the Russian -Ukraine conflict based on the principles of fairness and peace in the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p><strong> Blinden emphasizes the supply chain "de -risk and diversified" </strong> **</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th, Brinken held a round table meeting with the American business leader in China to understand the problems faced by these companies, including the recent "punitive operation" of China for American companies.Regarding the "decoupling" of the US -China economy, Brinken emphasized at a press conference that what the United States has done is "de -risk and diversified" instead of seeking to curb China economically: "As I said, we are not decuming to be decoupled . We are reducing risks and diversification. "</p>
<p>However, scholar Wang Weizheng believes that no matter how much the United States guarantees to Beijing anymore, I am afraid that it will not be effective, because "China may have identified it, and the future competition between China and the United States is basically a competition in science and technology and economic strength."</p>
<p>Brinken also said that the trip also specifically mentioned to China the US citizen citizen and people who faced outbound banned by the Chinese side, and said they would continue to work hard to ensure that they were released and returned to the United States safely.</p>
<p>Wang Weizhi believes that if Beijing wants to release some goodwill to the United States, these people can be released, but the Bayeng government will never use this.</p>
<p><strong> There are more high -level interviewers in the United States and China: bilateral relations are still difficult </strong></p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the US State Department spokesman Matthewmiller on the 19th, the two parties emphasized that the United States and China should work together to deal with the common transnational challenges such as climate change, global macroeconomic stability, and anti -drug. The two sides also agreed to restore personnel exchanges and will increase direct flights between the two countries. In addition, Qin Gang agreed to accept the invitation of Brincken to return to Washington at the right time of each other and continue to discuss. Blingken also said at a press conference that it is expected that in the next few weeks, senior US officials will visit China more. The United States also welcomes Chinese officials to visit the United States further.</p>
<p>Wang Weizheng pointed out that China originally hoped that the US Treasury Minister Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Raymond to visit China first, but Biden also hoped that Brins would go first in order to meet with Xi Jinping at the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. Essence He said: "In the next 3-4 months, the visit of senior US-China officials may recover, but the situation of competing with each other will not change."</p>
<p>Experts believe that this time Xi Jinping and Brinken held a 35 -minute short -term meeting, showing that China is willing to cooperate with the United States and strive to stabilize the relationship. However, Bonnieglaser, director of the Asian project in the German Marshall Foundation in the United States, also pointed out that it should not exaggerate the results of this trip, because the future relationship is still facing many difficulties.</p>
<p>She specifically pointed out that in Wang Yi's statement, China clearly pushed all the responsibilities of the deterioration of US -China relations to the United States: "This is not the basis for us to stabilize each other's relationship. The United States cannot accept such an interpretation. The signal still exists. In the future, these will still be a challenge. "</p>

<p>"Reuters" recently quoted sources, saying that the British Security Secretary of State Tomtugndhat (14th) and the Minister of Development, Tang Feng, who visited the United Kingdom, met and discussed the common security interests. Although Britain currently has an office in Taipei, it only has formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. Therefore, according to past practice, British senior ministers generally do not meet with Taiwanese officials.</p>
<p>"Inter-Parliaments" (IPAC) Executive Director Luke Depulford said that according to his understanding, this is the first meeting of British-oriented officials and believes that it has been an important way to get an important thing. One step: "We welcomes this meeting very much, and this meeting has sent the right information. We should congratulate the Security Minister to overcome the pressure of other departments and create a precedent. In the future, all British ministers can imitate it."</p>
<p>However, neither Britain or Taiwan officials have not officially confirmed the meeting. However, Tang Feng uploaded a photo about Togen Dart's works on Twitter last Thursday (15th), expressing his hope to obtain the scriptures from Togen Dart to reveal it vaguely in this way. A certain form of contact was performed.</p>

<p>The Chinese Embassy in Britain issued a statement on Sunday (18th) to describe Taiwanese officials' visit to Britain with "visiting", criticizing English -Taiwan officials to meet, violating the "one China principle", and sending an error signal to the "Taiwan independence" forces. Strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition: "The Chinese side urges the British to effectively abide by a Chinese principles and the basic criteria of international relations, stop any official exchanges with the Taiwan authorities, and stop promoting the" Taiwan independence 'split forces.

<p>Li Yantan, a professor at the Politburo of Taiwan, said in an interview with this Taiwan that the CCP has been suppressing any sovereignty in Taiwan in the world. Interaction is also natural.</p>

<p>He believes that if China responds fiercely, it has even canceled the British Foreign Minister's visit to China, which shows that the overbearing of the Chinese Communist regime is not reasonable.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-19T14-04-07-04-00/000000.png" />On June 16, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in Beijing <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-06192023134313.html/@@images/image">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-19T14-04-07-04-00/000001.png)</a>美联社图片  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-06192023134313.html/@@stream">Audio-1-Link：https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-06192023134313.html/@@stream</a>Hello, audience, I am Wang Dan. On June 16, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in Beijing. This meeting is more interesting, partly because it is the first time that Xi Jinping has received foreign entrepreneurs in recent years. For Western companies invested in China, which is represented by Bill Gates, can see Xi Jinping is also a rare high specification in recent years. This obviously deliberately arranged meeting was to give Xi Jinping a chance to convey some messages to the outside world. These messages do not necessarily be very clear, but in combination with the current situation, we can still hear some voices outside the string.</p>
<p>One of the most important points is that Xi Jinping said in the meeting that China has hoped to be in the American people, and the foundation of Sino -US relations is in the people. There are two sounds outside the string here: First, the so -called sentence pattern of the so -called "hope to the people" was used in cross -strait relations in the past. The background is that the DPP has been in power for a long time. The purpose of achieving the United Front Taiwan is very disappointed. Speaking in Sino -US relations is not common in the past. Especially picking on the eve of the US Secretary of State Brinkeng's visit to China. Xi Jinping said this to show that he could reach an agreement between the governments of the Chinese and American countries, and it was no longer hopeful. Hua's assessment is "walking through the field, showing". From Xi Jinping's statement, we have seen that he is ready to face the situation that Sino -US relations cannot improve for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Second, the so -called "foundation of Sino -US relations in the folk" has also appeared in the past, but now Xi Jinping's high -profile proposal shows that the focus of the CCP's future focus on the US policy will be adjusted to strengthening the pro -China Chinese and China -China pro. Paids. In fact, where the "folk" comes from, China's penetration in the United States has no ability to achieve the level of "folk". Xi Jinping's "folk", the Chinese Communist Party will strengthen the object of work in the future, in fact, it is a large American company, multinational enterprises, Wall Street investors, etc. represented by Bill Gates. In this set of techniques, China uses a lot of fire in European countries. Some large German companies use their own policy influence to strive to oppose the claims of "economic decoupling" and gain a certain degree of success. Obviously, the CCP wants to copy the European model in the United States. By the way, if the CCP thinks so, I am afraid it will be disappointed. The United States is not Europe. Of course, Wall Street has a certain influence on the policy formulation of the White House, but such influence has been received by many other forces, such as media, think tanks, and NGO organizations. Essence</p>
<p>Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates high -profile, and the third voice outside the string also shouted to foreign investment, hoping that they could continue to invest in China. Foreign capital has always been an important pillar of China's economic development, but in recent years, due to Xi Jinping's policies, foreign capital has led to leave. According to the Wall Street Journal, representative Western investment institutions such as Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America have abandoned their fundraising plans in Hong Kong. The discourse of global investors has made the recovery of the Chinese economy more difficult. Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates high -profile, and some senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party's economic and financial systems recently shouted to foreign capital. From the side, China's economic growth has indeed reached a critical point. They urgently expect Western investment to return to China again.</p>
<p>However, recently, the former Canadian global public relations director Bi Kald Picad publicly protested the CCP's interference in the operation of the Asian Investment Bank, and resigned and escaped from China. The reason why foreign investment escaped was not the economy but politics. Therefore, such a shout like Xi Jinping, even if there are people like Bill Gates endorse, I am afraid that it will not have much effect. The above is a comment that Wang Dan, a special commentator of Liberty Asia.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Cathay Pacific airline announced on Monday that it will start a operation in July to expand the scope of Mandarin services and improve service cultural training. These include recruiting air passengers in the Mainland. The Hong Kong airline had previously trapped the vortex of public opinion because of the "blanket storm", and was fired by the flight attendants accused of discriminating against passengers.</p>
<p>A Cathay Pacific Internal "Employee Letter" obtained by Reuters shows that since July, the Cathay Pacific Association provides a new training for the service culture of the cabin waiter, which requires all cabin waiters to participate. In the future, we will further extend relevant training to other customer service teams. Lin Shaobo, chief executive of the company, also said in a letter: "Considering that the customers who speak Popular calls are increasing, we must expand the scope of the Mandarin service team of the cabin service team accordingly."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-19T14-07-00Z/65715755_401.jpg" />Cathay Pacific incident has caused heated discussion on the Internet (the picture shows Sina Weibo screenshot)</p>
<p>In May this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/國泰航空遭指歧視中國客-官媒重拳整頓/a-65715856">Some netizens reported the real name of Cathay Pacific Airport discrimination against non -English passengers</a>And exposed dialogue recording. When a passenger asked the flight attendant to ask a blanket, because of his inadequate English, he mistakenly used the term "carpet". Recording shows that afterwards, several flight attendants teased at the rest and laughed at the passenger: "If you do not speak English blankets in English, then you will not get the blanket ... Carpet is on the ground, you want Lie just. "</p>
<p>The recording of this dialogue spreads widely on the Internet, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/国泰事件中国网络反崇洋媚外浪潮高涨/a-65732354">quickly becoming a hot topic on social media in mainland China</a>Essence Chinese official media and Hong Kong government officials, including the Chief Executive Li Jiachao, also published strict criticism of the incident.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific fired the flight attendant after the incident was fermented, and issued an apology statement. The airline also clearly mentioned in this internal letter that the most important thing is to ensure that all Cathay Pacific employees must respect passengers from different backgrounds and culture, and provide professional and consistent services in all service areas.</p>

In fact, this definition is too reluctant. Compared with the previous leaders such as Hu Jintao, such "head of state" has faded. Not only the number of heads of state is greatly reduced, but also the country is very different. Most of the western heads of Western countries exchanged with Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping, either the heads of state and North Korea, or the heads of state in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, or Central South America. Speaking of cold.</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese Communist Party has received the visit to the two billionaires in the United States, both of which are the richest level. Elon Musk is the richest man in the United States and the founder of Tesla; Bill Gates is the former richest man in the United States, founded by Microsoft, founded people. Among them, Bill Gates and Xi Jinping met (June 16), and Xi felt that this was "the first American friend he saw this year." This language shows the coldness of Sino -US relations. Near the Cold War.</p>
<p>From the head of the head of state to the richest man ’s diplomacy, can Xi Jinping do so? That is, can the United States be convinced that the United States stops the communist China and restarts Sino -US relations? This relationship has been defined by Beijing as the top priority. Today, the Xi authorities pretend to be full of carelessness. Although, the heart is full of anxiety.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates and said such a word: "I always think that the basis of Sino -US relations is in the people. I hope that I hope that the people and the American people refer to the American people?" In China, there is no folk at all, because, as a party dictatorship, Chinese folks or Chinese people not only cannot control Sino -US relations at all, but even Chinese politics cannot be controlled, but can only passively accept slavery and brainwashing. As for the American people, how can they have any good opinions on the universal value of democracy, freedom, human rights, and rule of law based on their deep -rooted democracy, freedom, human rights, and rule of law?</p>
<p>Does Bill Gates represent the American people? impossible. Elon Musk is also impossible. They are the richest people in the United States, which represents at most the American business community, but can only represent a limited business community. Beijing's attempt is to win and drive the American business community by winning Gates and Musk, and let them continue to invest in China. This means, the CCP calls the United Front, is just a wishful thinking. An irreversible general trend is: US companies and US -funded, just like other foreign companies and foreign capital, slow or fast, are being evacuated in China. Walk to other countries, and open up another way to open up new industrial chains and supply chains. Mexico, India, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries are their popular options.</p>
<p>A few days before Bill Gates's visit, Microsoft made a sudden decision to transfer the top artificial intelligence experts who were originally in the Chinese branch to Canada, intending to prevent the Chinese -side digging Microsoft talents. This is regarded as a signal that Microsoft evacuated in China by the outside world.</p>
<p>In fact, seeing the business leaders of foreign or Hong Kong and Taiwan, in the past Chinese leaders, are commonplace. Xi Jinping met Bill Gates, but it was just the CCP routine. However, the timing is special. Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates and deliberately rushed before meeting with US Secretary of State Brinken. It seems that I played a trick. The subtext is: Since you are a democratic country, if I can't open the relationship at the level of your government, I can open the relationship from your people.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, it is precisely because the United States is a democratic country and the US government's policy on China is precisely the embodiment of American public opinion. This is completely different from China's situation, and the Chinese government's policy can be exactly the same as the public opinion, or even the opposite. It can be seen that Xi Jinping's trick is not a clever trick.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Xi Jinping also said: "At present, the world's unreparable changes have accelerated the evolution. I proposed the global development initiative, global security initiative, and global civilization initiative. The purpose is to provide a Chinese plan to solve global challenges. "</p>
<p>The so -called "unremarkable change in the world for a century" is the self -definition of the authorities. It has their own meaning, such as "eastward and west", which has been proven to be separated from reality and self -righteous. The language that was originally promoted to the country had moved to the international stage.</p>
<p>Does the so -called Chinese plan refer to reform and opening up? It was the Chinese model before the Xi era, and it was destroyed by Xi Jinping himself. Does the Chinese plan refer to what is the era of Xi today? Internal enhancement of dictatorship and monitoring, threats and expansion of the outside world. That is exactly what the West is the most alert and disgusted. The word "purpose" is not concealed, and can only make the outside world fear and chestnut.</p>
<p>If there is still some rational, if there is still some sincerity that eases Sino -US relations, if there is still some perception of the status quo of Sino -US relations, Xi Jinping meets Bill Gates, and he should not say those words. However, he didn't open any pot, and he said these words in a lot. Too extra, too layman. It reflects his own subjective, rigid and solid. Perhaps Xi Jinping does not have the ability to perceive the outside world and is always outside the situation. What is the world of the world today? Wu Zi sit down and watch the sky, make the frog at the bottom of the well. Talk to myself all day, saying myself.</p>
<p>In the outside world, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have been invited to visit. Xi Jinping did not see Elon Musk, but saw Bill Gates. What is mysterious? There are several possibilities here. First, Xi Jinping may secretly meet with Musk without announcement. After all, Musk met many senior officials including Ding Xuexiang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. Second, when Musk's visit, Xi Jinping may not have figured out whether to meet. Then I decided to meet Gates. Third, Peng Liyuan met with Gates (2019) and in the name of the Career Ambassador of the World Health Organization, and Gates was named in the name of the co-chairman of the Melinda Gates Foundation. At the time, Gates seemed to be very dumped to Peng Liyuan. Perhaps, Xi Jinping looked at Gates with another look and found that he could be united to fight him, which was called "old friend".</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) According to the Hamburg Port and Warehouse Logistics Company (HHLA), the relevant agreement has been signed on Monday. Through this agreement, China COSCO Group will buy 24.99%of the Tollerort Tollerort.</p>
<p>This acquisition has triggered fierce disputes within the German government. COSCO Group initially plans to acquire 35%of the shares of the Tollerort container terminal in Hamburg Port, which is rejected by the German government.</p>

<p>In October last year, despite extensive political concerns, the German government approved the transaction from the Hamburg Port in Burger Port in principle. However, under the pressure of multiple ministers, COSCO Group was only allowed to obtain not more than 25%of shares.</p>
<p>In May this year, after the final review of the shares, the federal government turned on the green light for the transaction.</p>

<p>Because of the increasing influence of Chinese capital to important German companies and infrastructure, this transaction has been criticized by some sharp criticisms. The Hamburg Port filed a defense, arguing that the transaction <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉堡港年初利润锐减-福地码头来帮忙/a-65628820">can provide a guarantee for the company and the future business of Hamburg Port. </a>Hamburg Port is an important transit hub for trade in Germany and China. The reason why the transaction is restricted by the federal government's investment restrictions is because COSCO Group comes from non -EU countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65961679/62238410"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-19T14-18-00Z/62238410_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) "Business Daily" commented that after a serious confrontation in the past few months, China's relations with the West have signs of ease: US Secretary of State Broskere visited Beijing, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Berlin Essence This comment entitled "Breaking Silence" believes that Beijing's dialogue with the West is a good thing anyway.</p>
<p>"Returning to the diplomatic track is actually due to interests. In the past five years, this is the first time that the US government has visited Beijing. Sino -US relations have fallen into the edge of the rupture. In the face of the fierce competition for the fight against the world in the world, Europe It seems to be at a loss.</p>
<p>Half a century ago, the trip to Beijing President Nixon opened the process of integrating the international community and the global economic system of the People's Republic of China. But if Blint's trip to Beijing was compared with Nixon's visit to China that year, it was obviously a wishful thinking.</p>
<p>After all, the situation is very different from that year. Nowadays, the United States is no longer concerned about whether China is incorporated into the world's big families and cooperation between Chinese and Western cooperation, but how to effectively curb China. The anti -China atmosphere in the American and Congress has never been as strong as today.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-19T14-18-00Z/65957793_401.jpg" />As the top official in the United States who visited China in five years, US Secretary of State Brillin held talks with Xi Jinping, a Chinese party and state leader Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>If there is any consensus between the severe opposite Republican and democratic parties, then the tough route to China is the only consensus between them. The pro -Russian position held by Beijing in the Russian and Ukraine War is no longer the key to the problem. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯告诉习近平拜登认为美中有义务处理好关系/a-65956287">The United States cares about how to adopt more convincing deterrent methods in the Taiwan Strait dispute, as well as how to be safe, climate, and trade policy fields. Carry out limited cooperation with hope. </a>Because, even in the United States, they are unwilling to accept the scene of the world economy divided into two major camps. "</p>
<p>Comments pointed out that Bill Gates and other people in the United States and scientific and technological circles have visited Beijing, which shows that Americans do not want to be completely decoupled with China.</p>
<p>"In the process of recovering with Beijing with Beijing, Europe can also play a constructive role. The significance of the upcoming German -Chinese government's consultation cannot be underestimated. Proposal should be the highest principle of development in China in the future. "</p>
<p>Regarding the upcoming German -Chinese government consultation, the "Daily Mirror" published by Berlin commented that when the German government dealt with China, one principle pursued for a long time was to avoid sensitive issues and emphasize the common points of both parties. However, China under the rule of Xi Jinping has strengthened the inside and is more aggressive. Therefore, the German Red, yellow and green co -government is time to make a bright stand:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-19T14-18-00Z/65956578_401.jpeg" />Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Berlin and held talks with German President Steinmier.</p>
<p>"During the talks with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, German Chancellor Shrz must clearly emphasize the interests of Europe, and the German ministers who participated in the consultation should also hold the same position. In November last year, Shawrtz visited the Prime Minister for the first time after he took office In Beijing, he had warned the possibility of 'martial arts in Taiwan. "Now it should be more clear: in April this year, when German Foreign Minister Bell Berbak visited Beijing, it was pointed out that once China launched an attack on democratic Taiwan, it is not only It will trigger the 'horror scene', and it will also marked the end of the existing German -China relations. As Russia launched the war of invasion, China will immediately fall into isolation.</p>
<p>Continue to maintain a soft voice and avoid contradictions, or show a self -confidence gesture, which is the choice facing the German government now. When Chinese leaders emphasize their own interests, they never care about each other's feelings. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国对华政策在自我反思和不信任之间/a-65958853">The strong will be respected. In view of this, the German government, please come up with confidence and courage</a>Intersection "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-19T14-26-00-04-00/000000.png" />Chen Minle Reuters information picture [Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuazhuazhongnanhao/gx -Gx -Gx-@曾 曾 曾 曾 曾 曾 曾(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-06192023114452.html/@@stream)While Cai Qi, at the top of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping was "the Secret of the State -level National -level". It is likely that because of the "accident" of the second and thirds of his men, his secrets were also unable to "enter "Chang" Chen Minle became the first member of the Politburo of the Politburo in the history of the Communist Party of China in the history of the Communist Party of China. This may mean that he will still have the same opportunity as Cai Qi in the 20th CPC National University in the future.</p>
<p>The previous article in this column has reviewed the readers and audiences in the Central Political Bureau of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October 2017, Xi Jinping's direct political friendship during the Zhejiang period was arranged in the Zhejiang period. Four, according to the ranking of age and old, in turn, Cai Qi, Huang Kunming, Li Qiang, and Chen Minle. The first three are the so -called post -50s, and Chen Minle, the post -60s, is the deepest political qualifications among the four of them.</p>
<p>Based on the official disclosure of the CCP's resumes, Chen Miner was first announced as the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee as early as December 2001. Minister, 42 years old. At this time, Li Qiang of the core members of the other "new army" was that Xi Jinping was transferred to the secretary -general of the Provincial Party Committee from the Wenzhou Municipal Party Secretary to the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and then he was announced to enter the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee. The promotion of the deputy provincial and ministerial levels, such as the two people, were Cai Qi and Huang Kunming, who were announced within two months of Xi Jinping's departure from Zhejiang.</p>
<p>With the then Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Zhang Dejiang, "enrolled" at the First Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Starting in October 2002, Chen Minle worked under the leadership of the new provincial party committee secretary Xi Jinping. When the author wrote many years ago, when he introduced Chen Miner many years ago, a staff member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee told the author: Xi Jinping's highest position was the provincial administrative leader when he was working in Fujian. After a few "tofu pieces", naturally I dare not set up their own columns on the provincial party committee. After arriving at Zhejiang, the primary function of the Provincial Party Committee's report was to be carried out around the leader of his provincial party committee. The idea of opening a column in the provincial party committee's report may start with Xi Jinping himself, but Xi Jinping's name of the "Zhijiang Xinyu" column title is Chen Minder's suggestion adopted by Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>At that time, at least some people in the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee knew that during the time when Zhang Dejiang served as the secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, Chen Miner suggested to Zhang Dejiang to open the "Qianjiang Langhua" column in Zhejiang Daily and become a "Zhejiang Daily" in the future. The big "brand", Xi Jinping began to come up with the "Qianjiang Xinyu", which was suspected of "Dong Shi Xiaoxiao", so Xi Jinping specially called Chen Miner to discuss the name of his column. Chen Min was brave to suggest that it was slightly straightforward with "Zhejiang". It might as well switch to "Zhijiang", and said to Xi Jinping's "blindness": Since ancient times, Zhejiang Province is named because of the river; Qiantang River is "Zhi" because of "Zhi". Fonts, known as "Zhijiang" in ancient times, also known as "Zhejiang". Xi Jinping immediately revealed the joy of joy, because he felt that using "Zhijiang" was definitely more like "Zhejiang" and seemed to be a "cultural secretary secretary."</p>
<p>As for the selected pseudonym "Zhexin", it is rumored that Chen Minle, then the Propaganda Minister of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, took Xi Jinping. It is "philosophy", which is not only the same word of Zhejiang's "Zhejiang" character, but also the meaning of "philosophy"; "Xin" is the same sound of the "new" word of "new words". "Zhexin" implies the meaning of Zhejiang's new leaders, and has taken the meaning of "Xinran", "Appreciation" and "Xinxin Rong", which means that "Zhejiang Province will be under the wise leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the New Provincial Party Committee, , I am prosperous, the people are happy, officials are happy, the central government is pleased ... ", Xi Jinping was so happy. After Xi Jinping was ascended to the throne, the "Xinyu Xinyu" published by the Chinese Communist Party was introduced by the CCP official media that the book was a collection of articles written by the then Zhejiang Provincial Party Secretary Xi Jinping on the Zhejiang Daily, with a total of 232 articles. In the outside world comments, these 232 articles are actually said to the author of Chen Miner's sword. The aforementioned Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee believed that most of the content of the "column" should be Xi Jinping's "point" first, and often Xi Jinping said in a public occasion or internal meeting. If you are regarded as "important", Chen Miner will write down the meaning of Secretary Xi to hundreds of words in person to write or organize his men in person. After more than four years, more than two hundred essays of the tired essays have become an important "theoretical basis" for Wang Huning's "new ideas" to make Xi Jinping's "new ideas".</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2007, Xi Jinping was transferred to Shanghai. Three months later, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee was re -elected. Chen Miner was re -elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and later served as the executive deputy governor of the provincial government.</p>
<p>The story that happened was that Chen Minle, 5 years younger than Cai Qi, was arranged as a central alternate member at the same time as the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Political Bureau in the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October 2017. Five years later, Chen Minle was promoted to the Central Committee as a member of the Central Committee as a new Guizhou Provincial Party Secretary at the eighteenth of the Communist Party of China. As of this, Cai Qi is still the so -called "double non -".</p>
<p>After the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, although Cai Qi at that time was already a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Chen Minle's old qualifications and the age advantage of two years younger than Chen Miner decided in those years. Among the top 20 high -level personnel analysis content of the Communist Party of China, the successors of Wang Huning's "Deputy Secretary" are concentrated on Chen Miner or Ding Xuexiang. Few people are optimistic about Cai Qi.</p>
<p>In late May of this year, the author published "Twenty is far from Xi Jinping's considering" successor "for himself in this column. Ding Xuexiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Secretary of the Secretariat and Director of the Central Office of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in September. However, Ding Xuexiang, the only post -60s of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee of the Central Committee, was also 60 years old at the conference, and Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao on the 16th National Congress 20 years ago were just over 60 just over 60. The age of the age has been successively successively successively. Ten years ago, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, who were 59 and 57, took over the party and political leaders respectively. Today, the only post -60s post -60s, Ding Xuexiang, who is just 60 years old, is just a succession of a executive deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>In this way, when you can fully explain that Xi Jinping is considering the twenty high -level personnel arrangements, while determining that he is re -elected for the third and five years, in fact, there is no perspective from the "age echelon". That is, the issue of the "first -one hand handling" problem held by the Planning Council at the Twenty -first class held around October 2010.When four candidates of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Twenty of the 20 assigned specific positions, Xi Jinping also seemed to consider how to avoid the problem of "successor".</p>
<p>Theoretically, under the premise of Xi Jinping's "big inner manager" Ding Xuexiang, who is the leader of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and his second general secretary, Ding Xuexiang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee, should replace it. Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 19th Central Committee, has a job from the perspective of logical and familiar analysis. It is the most conducive to continue to serve Xi Jinping. So why not arrange this?</p>
<p>Imagine that if Xi Jinping after the 20th National Congress must make Ding people "enter", it is not because Ding is not arranged as the executive deputy prime minister of the State Council, but is arranged as a de facto party "Deputy Secretary" Then, whether it is inside or outside the party, there will definitely be Xi Jinping's nine -year -old Ding Xuexiang who is nine years older than himself.</p>
<p>In comparison, Xi Jinping arranged for Cai Qi, who was in the age group as the party's second leader, and did not constitute the "age echelon", which would not cause unnecessary conjectures of "successors".</p>
<p>As the current political commentator Li Yanming's analysis of the Epoch Times reporter, Cai Qi is 68 years old and is not threatened to be at the age of 70.</p>
<p>Professor Takaya University, who is familiar with Chinese politics, previously told Nika News that Xi Jinping's appointment with Cai Qi also had his political purpose. "Because (Cai Qi) is 67 years old and cannot be a successor, Xi Jinping is more at ease."</p>
<p>In addition to the analysis of the above angle, when Xi Jinping lay out the personnel arrangement of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, did Xi Jinping also considers the question of "first arrival" from the perspective of his age?</p>
<p>The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October last year was undoubtedly the last chance for Cai Qi, born in 1955. Everyone knows that in the 19th Central Politburo, Xi Jinping's most trusted person was then a member of the Politburo, Secretary of the Secretariat and Minister of the Central Team. Therefore, Chen Xi, born in 1953, failed to advance to the Standing Committee of the Politburo in the 20th National Congress. Of course, he was not re -elected as members of the Politburo, just like Huang Kunming and Li Hongzhong, who were born in 1956. Judging from the so -called "seven, eight and down", Cai Qi, born in 1955, just played a "wiping ball".</p>
<p>If the analysis is analyzed, will Chen Minle, who is 5 years younger than Cai Qi, will be treated like Cai Qi at the Twenty University of 2027?</p>
<p>A current political analysis article published on December 23, 2021, Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" said: There are many variables of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China next year, and they may create new records. The Chongqing Municipal Party Secretary is one of them. Bo Xilai, the first person who entered the position, had fallen into the horse before the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Sun Zhengcai, who was successor, also repeated the same mistake. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was dismissed. The current Chongqing Secretary Chen Minda is regarded as a friend of Xi Jinping. Whether it is promoted to the Standing Committee of the Politburo or the Shanghai Secretary of the Shanghai Secretary next year, he will become the first person to break the curse.</p>
<p>The "curse" referred to by Hong Kong media, in addition to the Wang Lijun incident in the former Chongqing outbreak of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, led Bo Xilai to fall, and the subsequent municipal party secretary Sun Zhengcai hit the arrow on the eve of the 19th National Congress of 2017. At least include:</p>
<p>After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chongqing No. 3 characters at that time, deputy secretary of Chongqing, who was full -time party under Chen Mindle, and Ren Xuefeng, a member of the 18th and 19th Central Central Committee, died strangely during the meeting in Beijing in November 2020. At the age of 54.</p>
<p>In October 2021, he was the mayor of Chongqing and the 19th Central Alternate member. It was rumored that Tang Liangzhi, a relative of Xi Jinping's family, was suddenly announced at the age of 61.</p>
<p>Another factors that have been considered directly affecting Chen Miner's "entry" is his wrong reuse of his secretary Yan Wei.</p>
<p>Yan Wei was born in September 1973, and was 13 years younger than Chen Miner. After graduating from Zhejiang University, he was assigned to the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee hosted by Chen Miner at the time. After Chen Miner transferred Guizhou, Yan Wei followed his former to live, and he was the deputy director of the Emergency Management Office of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government.(Located from), Then he was promoted to the deputy secretary -general of the Guizhou Provincial Government, and the official to the deputy department level.</p>
<p>After Chen Minde was promoted to the Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, he promoted Yan Wei to the executive deputy secretary -general of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee in April 2017, and the official to the main hall level. At that time, the youngest cadre of the main hall of Guizhou Province at that time.</p>
<p>In October 2019, he served as Secretary of the South Bank District Committee of Chongqing City and also served as Secretary of the Party Working Committee of the Chongqing Economic Development Zone.</p>
<p>In July 2017, Chen Minde was transferred to the secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee. Three months later, he entered the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and then transferred Yan Wei to his side. Two years later, he arranged him as the secretary of the Chongqing Nanan District Party Committee and Secretary of the Party Working Committee of the Chongqing Economic Development Zone. Since then, Chen Minle, who is about to "enter" in the 20th National Congress of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, has already started to cultivate his successor of his Chongqing Municipal Party Secretary.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2021, the news that Tang Liangzhi revealed that Yan Wei received huge bribes for Chen Minle for Chen Minle, and Yan Wei was captured by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Although this news has not been confirmed so far, before the news came out, Yan Wei has been reduced from the position of the secretary of the Chongqing Nanan District Party Committee and the party secretary of the Chongqing Economic Development Zone to the "State -owned Enterprise Leader". Secretary of the Party Committee and Chairman of the Bonded Port Development Management Group Co., Ltd.. This Chongqing Bonded Port Development Management Group was established by the Chongqing SASAC in December 2008. It is the so -called "city -owned state -owned key enterprise", and its leadership is a deputy department level. Therefore, when Chongqing City announced the news, it also emphasized a "normal personnel change" without silver. It also proves that this Yan Wei has already planted on the career.</p>
<p>As of the above, it should be one of the factors that affect Xi Jinping's promotion of Chen Minle in the 20th National Congress. However, under the premise, Xi Jinping did not let Chen Miner "leave" before "out" and then renewed as the vice -level duty, nor did he let him be as a member of the Politburo, but he was re -appointed as a member of the National People's Congress. In a place, he also served as the secretary of the municipal party committee directly under the jurisdiction. This seems to show that Xi Jinping, the 21st of the Chinese Communist Party of China five years later, is not as the possibility of turning Chen Miner to the special division of "holding off the boots".</p>
<p>Of course, it is not unreasonable that the outside world's "marginalization" statement is not unreasonable. After all, after leaving Chongqing, Chen Minle was not arranged to be the most important secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee in municipalities, nor was it arranged as a secondary secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, but "Quju" Tianjin.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

For more than a week, the controversy continues to ferment.</p>
<p>In the photos that caused controversy, a Ms. Han lady hollowed out the middle of the cricket and hung the collar on the neck; the Uyghur people who saw the photo thought it was a great disrespect, and the Han people thought it was a small Uyghur topic.</p>
<p>Uighurs have a proverb. When the Uyghur people accused those who were arrogant and ignorant and short -sighted, they would say, "With two crickets, knock one as a hand drum." It means that when you eat your stomach, you will start arrogant.</p>
<p>The Han people also have a proverb: "Do not do good but not to do it, do not use evil for small"</p>
<p>Cultural differences are small things in outsiders, but it is a big deal for the people of the personnel; it is a big deal for the Uyghur to hang the hollowing the collar around the neck. Great disrespect. Not only is disrespect for the symbol of Uyghur food culture -馕, but also disrespect to the Uyghur traditional culture.</p>
<p>Because 馕 occupies extremely important positions in the Uyghur diet and traditional culture, and the current Uyghur's racial and cultural extermination of the Chinese colonial government's racial and cultural extermination, which is currently encountered by the Uighurs, is also a cherished food that the Uighur is very cherished. As a gimmicky behavior, it is equivalent to the Uyghur in the suffering.</p>
<p>Overseas Uighurs have been cut off for a few years with their hometown. I do n’t know that parents and relatives are dead, nor do they get any information about relatives and friends. They live in my hometown every day, miss their loved ones, remember the past and work hard to save the traditional Uyghur traditional culture overseas. In the difficulties, it is difficult to restrain your anger in seeing such photos of this kind of desecration of Uyghur traditional food culture.</p>
<p>For Uighurs, 人 (food), salt, and water are extremely precious. The Uighurs have respect and cherish from the inner heart for the inner heart. The Uyghur's respect for tadpoles, salt and water is first of all from a deep understanding and cherishment of their fragile environment.</p>
<p>One of the old Uighurs I heard from a young age is: "馕 is the partner of the journey." The Uyghur's cricket can be stored for a long time after a little air drying. The Uyghur's preparation for travelers generally use milk, butter, sesame and other grilled. Even if it is stored for a long time, as long as it is put in milk tea or water, it will be soft instantly; The first choice of essential food.</p>
<p>Children must travel long, and parents and relatives will inevitably bake the fresh Toghach (Xiaoyuan 馕) that is convenient to carry.</p>
<p>I am the late father, and it can be said that it is a master of baked. After his father lost his parents since he was a child, his relatives were sent to Master Kashgar Bakery as an apprentice, and later participated in the National Army of the East Turkestan (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), and was assigned to the cooking class to be responsible for a soldier's diet. Continue to bake for the National Army soldiers. Later, he was transferred to the railway as a worker, but he always liked to roast it at home.</p>
<p>I went to college for five years. Before I returned to school, my father would bake me small oil for two or three days in advance; bake baked buns one day in the winter vacation. Later, my classmates knew that I must have a special small oil and baked buns that I had to bake in school. Every time I returned to school, I took my classmates the most; when I returned to the dormitory, everyone sat on the table and ate roasted. Buns and small oils, talking about the endless talk of hometown. That scene expresses our infinite nostalgia and love for our hometown.</p>
<p>Later, after graduating and working, I always felt that I always felt too much. After returning to Yili to visit my grandparents, I returned to Shihezi. My grandmother said that she wanted to bake off, and I resolutely refused; I told my grandmother that I could buy it everywhere, and there was no need to bring it. But grandma still baked a small oil -filled carton. In order to prevent grandpa and grandma from being sad, I was reluctant to take a small box of oil.</p>
<p>When I went to Ili to live in a relative's house, I got up the next morning, I deliberately forgotten the oil at relatives' house, hurriedly came to the long -distance bus station of Yili World, and opened the station at 9 o'clock; more than an hour later, I came to Bayanyu When I had breakfast, I found that my wallet was gone. I turned left and right. I had nothing except tickets and a travel bag. Gu Gui, no one who knew the car had to sit hungry; I was in my heart, as long as I could go to Shihezi that day, I would be hungry for a day!</p>
<p>What is not smooth and everything is not smooth. When I go to the Guozigou bus, I am thinking that the driver can repair the car as soon as possible and drive to Shihezi at night. However, it was in the afternoon when the car was repaired; obviously, I could not arrive at Shihezi that night.</p>
<p>I pray that the car can go to Jinghe or Wusu earlier. I have friends in these two places. As long as you arrive before dark, I can find friends to borrow money. But it was dark soon, and the car did not stop in Jinghe. I started to look forward to the rain. As long as it does not rain, it should not be difficult one night in Wusu; however, when the house leaks in the rain, when the car enters the Wusu Passenger Station, it starts the wind and rain outside.</p>
<p>I was hungry and tired, and ran into a Uyghur restaurant near the station with a backpack. A pair of Uyghur husbands were dining. I told them that I was a teacher of Shi Hezi, lost their wallets, and were willing to sell watches, or suit on the body; My suit asked how much money me sells, I told him 10 yuan. I just want to have a place to live, if you may eat a bowl of rice.</p>
<p>I am about to take off the suit and let the young man look at it. His wife cannot speak doubt: "Who is not in trouble, not to mention that this gentleman is still a teacher. Take it out in the pocket. "In this way, the couple took me to a hotel next to the passenger station to help me pay for the accommodation; Hungry and unable to fall asleep; all night, the sound of the rain hit the window in the ear, and the gurgling sound of the stomach, and the little oil was boiled in front of her grandmother. Intersection</p>
<p>That night, for the first time, I realized the meaning of the ancient proverb of "Journey to the Travel". Since then, I have never rejected my grandparents, or the roasting of my grandparents, or my parents and siblings.</p>
<p>Even in the United States, as long as it is possible, I will bring it on long -distance travel.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, I drove to Maryland to meet. The meeting with a colleague was over before noon, but we must leave the meeting with another group of three colleagues. Their meeting was delayed until three pm to end before the end EssenceI asked my colleagues if it was a bit hard and liked, he said it was particularly delicious; I said it was the Uyghur's cricket; I intended to lead the topic to Uyghur topic; beyond me, he said that he knew the Uyghur and also ate it. Passing the Uyghur's cricket; of course, he also knows the racial extinction we are currently encountered. Half a piece, and the distance between me and my colleagues closer again. On the way, we talked a lot.</p>
<p>For Uighurs, 人 is not only a journey partner, but also an important part of Uyghur traditional culture; 馕 and salt are also the most important part of the Uyghur marriage ceremony. Men and women who are about to become husbands and wives. After the religious person hosts the wedding ceremony, someone will definitely bring a small bowl of salt water soaked in salt water. Both men and women should eat them together, indicating that the two sides will be loyal and never separated.</p>
<p>传 and Salt are also sacred certificates used by traditional Uyghurs to swear. In the case of major events or accused, the oath or the accused will vow to prove that they are telling the truth in the sore and salt, and they will not lie.</p>
<p>Uyghur children have been educated by parents and teachers since childhood to respect, salt and water. If you want to eat it, you must not take the whole piece of crickets. You have to open it. Eat a small piece and a small piece to avoid ca n’t be a waste; Repent; if you see a block that falls on the ground on the road, be sure to pick it up and put it on a high place, or feed poultry and livestock.</p>
<p>Alas, it is also one of the must bring gifts for Uighurs to visit relatives and friends. So far, the rural and some cities Uighurs visit relatives and friends. Ladies generally bring their own freshly baked fresh and visit relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Alas, it is also the first important food for Uighurs to receive guests. The family of inviting guests generally bake the hobby of the guests first; to welcome the 馕 at the guest table, it must be a fresh whole piece; after welcome the guests into the house, the owner first respects the tea (clear tea or milk tea), and then The owner will make the whole puppet into a few pieces to ask the guests to drink tea; after that, it is the other traditional food.</p>
<p>The Uyghur educating children cannot pour garbage and dust into the water, let alone urinate in the water; wash your hands and wash your face and wash your face. You must use a kettle. You cannot wash the clothes from the river and the canal.</p>
<p>When I was in school at the Hami Railway, I made a pull strip at home. The water below, because of salt, parents asked us not to pour the noodle soup into the garbage dump and the soil road in front of the door to avoid being stepped on; This was the one I had the most headache.</p>
<p>Obviously, these taboos of the Uyghur are not unreasonable dogma, but the care of the Uyghur's environment from the Uighurs, which stems from respect for nature!</p>
<p>Of course, modern life has changed us and the Uighurs have also changed; but the Uyghur's nostalgia and respect for salt, salt, and water has not changed; and from the perspective of modern environmental protection, we look back at the Uighur tradition. It is necessary to change, and it should be more promoted.</p>
<p>Now, for our overseas Uighurs, we are no longer just an integral and symbol of our traditional culture or food culture. Hope; at the same time, 是 is also our thoughts on our hometown. It is an concern to our parents, relatives and friends, and a symbol of our Uighurs to resist the extinction of the Chinese government, inherit and continue the Uyghur traditional culture; It is a blasphemy for our culture.</p>
<p>For example, the old Uyghur "There are two crickets, and a person who knocked a drum of a hand" and two days after eating a full meal, they forgot that the parents have experienced the hungry, Yizi, and eating the era of the Uighurs. When the collars hang on their necks, they are essentially the same. They are all arrogant and ignorant and short -sighted people. They do not know what respect and cherish, nor what they are humble and respect.</p>

<p>Jin Yingzhe, who had led the talks between North Korea and South Korea, and the United States, returned to the Politburo of the North Korean Workers' Party.</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reported that during the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Labor Party on Monday (June 19), Jin Yingzhe became a candidate for the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>At the eight major of the Labor Party held in 2021, Jin Yingzhe was degraded from the secretary of the work of the United Front. At the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Labor Party in June last year, the Minister of the United Front Department was taken over by Li Shanquan. At the seventh meeting of the 14th Supreme People's Conference of North Korea, the positions of the permanent committees of Jin Yingzhe have also been lifted and became "one -souted grass people".</p>
<p>Some observations believe that as Jin Yingzhe re -served as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, he may re -responsible for work against Korea in the future. The Labor Party reported the "Labor News" on Monday, which also published photos of Jin Yingzhe, and marked the title of "Consultant of the United Front Department".</p>
<p>At the same time, Wu Xiurong, who was lifted by the Labor Party Secretary and the June of the Labor Party in June last year, was re -elected as secretary and minister at the plenary session. The North Korean Society did not disclose his responsibility, but "Labor News" published his photos and marked the title of "Minister of Economic".</p>
<p>Wu Xiurong served as the electronic industry from 1999 to 2009, and was promoted to the Cabinet Deputy Prime Minister. Since 2014, he has served as the party secretary and the Minister of Economic and led North Korea's economic work. As Wu Xiurong returns to the Economic Command Tower, he may be able to play a leadership role in North Korea's grain problems and promoting the economy centered on the cutting -edge industry.</p>

<h1>The Thai Election Commission approves the election results to advance the party to become the largest party of the House of Representatives</h1>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Bangkok, 19th) The Election Commission (Electes) today confirmed the results of last month. The owners defeated political parties supported by the military and have governed Thailand for nearly 10 years in the election.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-19T15-02-10-00-00/000000.png" />The election committee officially approved the voting results of the 500 seats of the House of Representatives, making the Move FORWARD PARTY (MFP) that won 151 seats became the largest party.</p>
<p>Pita Limjaroenrat, the leader of the Party, is a strong candidate for the Prime Minister, although he is facing an investigation that may make him qualified.</p>
<p>The Election Commission is investigating about 200 complaints on the May 14th election.</p>
<p>The Secretary -General of the Election Commission Sawang Boonmee said at a press conference: "We decided to announce the approval of the election results because not all complaints can be handled within 60 days."</p>
<p>Thailand law stipulates that the election results need to be approved within 60 days, but the election committee can investigate complaint cases for one year.</p>
<p>The parliament will hold a meeting within 15 days and choose the Speaker of the House of Representatives. When the new Prime Minister is elected, there is no fixed timetable.</p>
<p>The APPC said that it has alliances with the 2nd largest party including the second largest party (PHEU THAI), which will allow them to occupy a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>However, in order to ensure the position of the Prime Minister, Pitta needs to win a majority support in the two hospitals, including the Senate selected by 250 seats by the previous military government.</p>
<p>Last week, Pitta encountered the latest setbacks. The Election Commission set up a special committee to investigate whether he was qualified to run for public office.</p>
<p>The investigation involves the issue of Pitta's ITV that has been dissolved in the current media company. According to Thai law, those who hold media shares cannot run. If he is sentenced to guilty, he may be disqualified and faces a maximum 10 -year imprisonment.</p>
<p>Pitta said he inherited ITV shares after his father's death, and ITV stopped operating in 2007.</p>
<p>Because voters rejected Prayut Chan-O-Cha CHA, who had rejected the commander-in-chief of the Army and launched a coup in 2014, the Thai party who won 141 seats in this election occupied the upper hand in this election.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-19T15-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Volker Turk, a UN Human Rights Commissioner Volker Turk, said at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), saying: "I have great concern to the approach to several countries to kill civil society."</p>
<p>In the opening speech of Turks in the new session of the Human Rights Council, people who cooperated with the United Nations and tried to ring the alarm for their domestic infringement were attacked and expressed particular concern.</p>
<p>Tucker did not mention a specific country, but said his concerns, including the behavior of some countries in the 47 member states of the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p>
<p>China, member of the Human Rights Council, is one of the countries that have been repeatedly accused by human rights groups and non -governmental organizations.</p>
<p>Tuk said: "The attack on the United Nations is a particularly insidious non -cooperative means, and it may have a chilling effect in the Civic Space."</p>
<p>He pointed out that UN Secretary -General Antonio Guterres has published 13 reports on instability and revenge over the past 13 years, including 700 cases or events in 77 countries.</p>
<p>Turk said the report in 2022 "contains allegations of incidents in 42 countries", "12 of which are members of the Human Rights Council."</p>
<p>However, Tucker warned that the annual report on revenge was "not the whole picture of the whole situation."</p>
<p>"When the instability and oppression of the civil society are so strong that people do not dare to take risks to cooperate with international institutions at all, we will not receive a notification on revenge, because no one dares to interact with us."</p>
<p>The UN Human Rights Council President Vaclav Balek told media reporters last week that he recently handled two cases involving revenge, but did not provide more details.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Balek told the Human Rights Council member state that he would not have such behavior at the four weeks of meeting.</p>
<p>"The active participation of human rights agencies of civic society and social and social state is one of the basis of the Human Rights Council."</p>
<p>Balek emphasized: "As the chairman, I will continue to track all individuals or groups who have worked with the Human Rights Council, their mechanisms and procedures, and are accused of retaliation and intimidation." Political 1)</p>

<p>Description: On June 18, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang opened his first foreign visit during his tenure. The target country of this trip was Germany and France. Time is too late than his former Li Keqiang and Wen Jiabao. The latter two first visits were on May 19, 2013 and April 29, 2003, respectively. Perhaps this does not mean anything, but maybe it is a symbol of a certain history: Li Qiang is the prime minister in March, but compared to his predecessor's "spiritual style", it seems that the "low -key" is unusual.</p>

<p>The Thai Election Commission certified the results of the election last month and paved the way for the first parliament before the establishment of a new government in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the Thai Election Commission said on Monday (June 19) that the winners of all 500 seats in the house have been recognized. The joint meeting of the legislature of the hospital voted on the Prime Minister's candidates.</p>
<p>The Freedom Democratic Party of Thailand and the Thai Party won more than half of the parliamentary seats in the House of Congress in the election on May 14. The APM party won 152 seats among the 500 seats in the house; 142 seats for the Thai party, 71 seats in Thailand proud of the party, 40 citizenship of the Citizen Bavavi, and 36 seats in the Thais of the Prime Minister Bayu.</p>
<p>The opposition has formed an eight -party alliance, which is expected to support the party leader of the party party as the Prime Minister, and may set up a joint government next month. However, it is uncertain whether it can get enough support to become the Prime Minister, because this requires 376 votes in the upper and lower houses.

<p>The APIC's Alliance will meet on Thursday (22nd) to decide the candidates for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p>Prime Minister of Malaysia <a href="http://www.zaobao.com/keywords/anwar-ibrahim">Anwar</a>It was revealed that after the Anti -Corruption Commission conducted a detailed investigation of the Appeal Tribunal Judge Nazlan, he believed that Nazlan had not committed any criminal crimes.</p>
<p>Anwar said on Monday (June 19) in the House of Representatives. The Anti -Corruption Association had thoroughly checked the allegations faced by Nazlan and confirmed that Nazlan had no crime. "The General Procuratorate also recognizes the results of the investigation."</p>

The Federal Court rejected Najib's ultimate appeal on August 23 last year and maintained the original judgment of the Gao Court. Najib was immediately in prison.</p>
<p>Before Najib repeatedly pointed out that Nazlan served as a judge, he served as the general adviser to the Bank of Malayan and had a relationship with Liu Tezuo. Therefore, there was a conflict of interest in the SRC case.</p>
<p>During the SRC case appeal and interrogation, the blog that often made controversial remarks Raja Bertela wrote on April 19, 2022 that the bank account of Nazlan had a source of unknown RM1 million (about S $ 300,000) deposit. It also said that the payment was part of the "providing service" for the Nazlan's wanted criminal of the Malaysian Company.</p>
<p>Nazlan subsequently reported the case. The Anti -Corruption Association announced on April 23 last year that it received a report and investigated Nazlan, which caused controversy in intervention in justice.</p>
<p>On February 20 this year, the Anti -Corruption Club reported to the Federal Court Chief Justice Donggu Mai Run, stating that Nazlan violated the judge's professional exercise and suggested that Macro's disciplinary actions against Nazlan. The Federal Court stated that the investigation of the Anti -Corruption Council refused to accept the investigation conclusion that it did not conduct in accordance with legitimate procedures.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-19T3-02-42/1-1687161159.jpg" />North Korean leader Kim Jong -un (middle) at the party meeting(Reuters)According to official media reports, senior North Korean officials have promised to try to launch military spy satellites again, and call the first launch test of their country's failure last month as the "worst failure" this year.</p>
<p>According to a report from the DPRK, the promise was made at the administrative North Korean Workers' Party Conference held on Friday to Sunday.</p>
<p>The North Korean Society stated that the expansion of all conferences require staff and researchers to analyze the reasons for the failure of the launch, and "severely criticize" the person who is responsible for the mistake.</p>
<p>North Korea tried to send its first military spy satellite into the orbit on May 31, but due to the rocket failure in Pyongyang, the aircraft and its effective load fell into the sea shortly after the launch.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-19T3-02-42/2-1687161176.jpg" />The largest on -site fire exercise in the history of the United States and South Korea(Peninsula TV Station)The crash has led North Korea leader Kim Jong -un to obtain the heavenly foundation surveillance system to better monitor the efforts of the United States and South Korea.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul condemned the launch on May 31st, saying that it violated the United Nations resolution that banned Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology to conduct any test. Analysts pointed out that there is a significant technology overlap between the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the capacity of space launch.</p>
<p>The report from the North Korean Society did not specifically explain that North Korea might try to make the second launch date. However, the Korean spy agency told the legislators earlier that Pyongyang may need "more than a few weeks" to determine what the first experiment was.</p>
<p>South Korea said today that it has successfully salvaged a large piece of wreckage of crashed rockets from Haidilao. Seoul spent more than two weeks for salvage, because these fragments can help scientists understand Pyongyang's ballistic missiles and satellite surveillance programs.</p>
<h4>"major progress"</h4>
<p>Kim Jong -un has promised to obtain several high -tech military assets to cope with the hostile operations of his so -called American as the United States. This spy satellite is one of the one. In addition, multi -warhead missiles, nuclear submarines, and solid propulsion intercontinental ballistic missiles and hypersonic missiles are also other weapon systems that Kim Jong -un wanted to own.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, North Korea has conducted more than 100 missiles, including some of them related to the spy satellite on the development of Kim Jong -un and other powerful weapons.</p>
<p>In April, North Korea tested the solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. The fuel of this missile has been installed in it, so they are more mobility than rockets using liquid pushing agents, and it is more difficult for outsiders to find before launch.</p>
<p>According to the North Korean Society, during the Labor Party's meeting, members of the Politburo claimed that "major progress" was made in the efforts to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles, and they claimed that this provided support for the government and the enemy's "positive confrontation" policy.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that members of the Politburo also analyzed the "reckless war move" due to its competitors, which caused the region to "extremely deteriorate the security situation", which obviously refers to the expanding US -South Korea military exercises.</p>
<p>It is reported that they have unanimously approved the unsatisfactory counterattack plan.</p>
<p>According to the DPRK, members of the Politburo of North Korea have formulated "important tasks" that have not been explained in detail, aiming to defend national interests and strengthen the unity of countries that "oppose the strategy of American robbers' world hegemony".</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed that the food supply can be self -sufficient by increasing the national agricultural output and completing the annual grain production goals.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the South Korean Ministry of Unity stated that the food situation in North Korea "seemed to deteriorate."</p>
<p>This isolated country has been strictly sanctioned due to its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. In addition, the country's economic situation is further nervous because of the strict border blockade of the new crown epidemic.</p>
<p>In addition, the North Korean Society reported that Jin Yingzhe, who had previously served as the Minister of the United Front Department and Kim Jong -un, was appointed as an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>A Korean legislator said at the time that Kim Yingzhe was degraded after failing to reach an agreement with the US summit in 2019. He led the summit negotiations with the then American colleagues and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>

<p>Description: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ended a two -day visit to China on Sunday evening. Although both the United States and China have expressed the need to stabilize the relationship between the two countries, analysts point out that the peaceful intentions of the two sides cannot solve the fundamental differences between the two countries. Some analysts believe that there is indeed "unsurprising differences" between the United States and China, but it is not important whether it can be attached to the difference. It is important to manage differences. Some people believe that, given that this "structural" tension exists, US -China relations will eventually worsen.</p>
