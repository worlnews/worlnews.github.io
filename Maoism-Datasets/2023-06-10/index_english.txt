 At the recently -ended Shangri -La dialogue, the Minister of Defense of China and the United States was shaking hands behind the shaking hands and accusing each other, so that the outside world was worried about the status quo of the relationship between the two countries. This shows that the recent relationship between China and the United States is described as "Spring Blossoms", which may be more appropriate.
"Spring Warm" means that compared with the "balloon incident" in March, high -level contacts and dialogue stops in the two countries have recently restored high -level dialogue. Wang Yi, director of the China Foreign Affairs Office, and US National Security Consultant, Sarawon, talked about eight hours in Vienna for two days. When the Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao participated in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC) Minister of Economic and Trade, he held talks with US Secretary of Commerce Raymondo and trade representative Dai Qi. Xie Feng, the ambassador to the United States in the near future, has been in Washington to take office, and meet with the Deputy Secretary of State of the State Council and the Deputy Minister of Finance.

 Since the Ukraine War, Ukraine has acknowledged that Ukraine could not join the new international alliance before the end of the war. But from last year, from the perspective of far away to now, the United States' attitude towards Ukraine's joining NATO has changed rapidly. Ukraine's joining NATO seems to be a difference: everything has everything, only the east wind is owed (the end of the war). What if the Ukrainian counterattack failed? Is it expected whether NATO will absorb Ukraine and deal with Putin together. Although this sounds incredible, NATO's bottom line of Ukraine has retreated again and again, flexible as if there is no bottom line.
From July 11th to 12th, NATO will hold a peak meeting in Vernis, the capital of Lithuania. Ukraine will join NATO's routes in the key content. The most hesitant country today is the United States and Germany. In addition to Britain, the most resolute one is the Nine Kingdoms of the Balterst (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, all of which belong to the former Soviet Union). These countries issued a joint statement saying: "We expect to raise the political relationship with Ukraine to a new level in Vilnius, and start a new political track. Once the conditions are allowed, Ukraine will be assisted in the NATO organization."

The fourth anniversary of the Hong Kong "Removal Delivery" Movement: Forbidden Books, Forbidden language, self -examination, and Hong Kong people have been "educated" 
June 9, 2023 Image source, getty images
The Hong Kong government announced the revision of the "Real Delivery Central" demonstration waves that swept the entire Hong Kong in 2019, and officially characterized it as the "color revolution" and the iron fist suppression. In 2020, Beijing bypassed the Hong Kong Legislative Council's promulgation of the "Hong Kong National Security Law", marking Hong Kong's "secondary return". BBC Chinese interviews, media, media, civil servants and other frontline personnel, they all said that they felt tremendous changes, and said that the official was culturally transforming Hong Kong from culturally. 
"Now teaching can not speak China and the mainland. I want to talk about the country. I was not used to it at first, but now I have changed my mouth automatically." Teacher Eu (pseudonym) taught in a middle school in Jiulong said to BBC Chinese. "The Education Bureau will be randomly learned, and you will be considered unprofessional to catch you wrong."
A large number of teachers were "ash" (reporting) during the "Removal Division" campaign in 2019, and "White Terror" continued to this day. She said that she is still very careful now, especially her teaching is regarded as "high -risk subjects" "citizens and society" Development Division (referred to as communes).
The discipline was formerly known as the "General Education Department". The course was open. It aims to cultivate students to care about social affairs and multi -angle thinking. In 2020, the government announced the reform course and became dominated by national conditions. At the same time, according to the "Hong Kong National Security Law" requirements, "national security education" was implemented in primary and secondary schools.
Teacher Ou is currently taking into account the relevant coordination of the school. She said that before the Education Bureau went to the school last year, she summoned Chinese and historical teachers to review the collections of the library in the school and removed the seemingly sensitive books.
"We even took away the books that Professor Lu Dile talked about Hong Kong culture and were not politicized at all. He thought that everything was lost, but they (the Education Bureau) still found the so -called banned book, which was some English books about Chinese history. Of course, they did not explain to it. The reason, but everyone guess it was because of the "six four '" in it. "

After the "anti -repair" movement in Hong Kong in 2019, a large number of young people were arrested and imprisoned for related protests. BBC interviewed the "anti -repair" motion demonstrators from prison, as well as supporting networks for helping people into prison for social movement cases.
In May of this year, the Hong Kong Public Library took more than 200 sensitive books under the name of "Clean up illegal or National Security". Most of them were the works of democratic people, which caused social uproar. But in fact, this political review has long penetrated the campus of primary and secondary schools.
"The British Literature Division of our school has used George Orwell's" Animal Farm "for many years. The teacher (pseudonym) said.
She was also arranged to be responsible for the national security education in the school after 2019. She said that colleagues were uneasy to face the fuzzy standards. "The bureau has never announced a list of banned books, nor does it stipulate what cannot be said. It will only give some course goals and guidelines. You can guess what you can't say."
She said that according to the hand -arranged by the school, teachers in other disciplines must also teach the science of junior high school. The authorities have threatened to significantly modify the relevant courses. "We have adopted the most conservative approach. This part of the teacher is not as good as this announcement, but my colleagues are still very nervous, and constantly ask me, can these things be taught?"

The "Hong Kong National Security Law" came into effect on June 30, 2020. Since then, the Hong Kong government will launch the "National National Security Day" event on April 15 each year.
According to the Hong Kong Police Department, from June 9, 2019 to December 31, 2022, the police arrested 10,279 people during the demonstration, of which 4010 were students. After the "National Security Law" came into effect on June 30, 2020, more than 250 people have been arrested by the law, and their age is 15 to 90 years old.
Zhong Jianhua, a Hong Kong social policy and public administrative scholar who has moved to the United Kingdom, analyzed the BBC Chinese analysis that Hong Kong has entered the era of authoritarian, and authoritarian governance is based on power, not tangible provisions and laws.
"In fact, there is no standard. It depends on the governance team at the time. The National Security Law is the best example. Mainland China is a long -term use of this method. When some people cannot know the objective standards, they can only guess by themselves, and he also wants you to guess, and you naturally dare not touch the sensitive things. This is a typical authoritarian political characteristics. ""Excluding sensitive police rights, I taught Hong Kong's multiculturalism and race in the other section, quoting the Basic Law that everyone has equal rights, including religious freedom and freedom of speech. At this time Is there a freedom of speech in Hong Kong? Other students are anxious to stop. "

Hong Kong protests the four -year year: "Removal China" movement back and end to the end
Teacher Xu admits that students are affected by the major environment of the society, and the self -examination from the bottom up is very serious. "In 2019, we can also discuss the benefits and disadvantages of demonstrations in the classroom. It is very rational. After three years, even if I want to discuss students, I don’t want to participate. The academic atmosphere is very poor. Everyone will not express themselves freely. "
Chen Jialuo, a professor at the Department of Political and International Relations of the Hong Kong Baptist University, pointed out to BBC that officials have continued to suppress and arrest in the past three years to create ripple effects. "Everything is national security. The atmosphere of this infinite outline and no far -end hats has made the public make adjustments, and everything avoids everything."
He said that the people of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in history have also experienced this life model. After the "Prague Spring" failure in 1968, Czechoslovak Fall. (Normalization) plans to launch political cleaning and high -pressure governance, detain different segastes, and monitor the people with secret police.
The late Czech President Harvel (Václav HAVEL) described it as a "post-totalitarianism" at the time. Everyone had a red line in their hearts, rooted and internalized political authority. Essence Chen Jialuo said: "The same is true in Hong Kong today. There is no need to take the official shot at all.

This social atmosphere made the "Hong Kong Drifting" reporter Andy (Andy) feel that he had known each other. He said that the "Hong Kong Drifting" friends around him were all liberals and occasionally discussed the current politics, but everyone was alert. "Always talk about half of it, someone panickedly, whether the phone will be recorded, will it be reported, everyone has left China, but it is still in a state of fear. It used to be like this with mainlanders. Now The same is true for friends in Hong Kong. They will say, don't talk about it anymore, be careful of being caught by Guoan. "
Andy moved to Hong Kong in 2018 and joined the English media. In 2019, he interviewed the "Counterfeit Middle" movement at the front line and experienced the great changes in the press in recent years.
He said that at the beginning of the exercise, the police pulled up the "Orange Belt" blockade to prevent the reporters from shooting. "I arrived first, and I wanted to turn around when I saw the orange belt. Then a large group of Hong Kong reporters arrived. They saw that all the orange belts were scolded together and scolded the police to hinder the freedom of the press. . At that moment, I woke up. It turned out that I had a problem. I used to be detained and questioned in the mainland. I was very afraid of the police. The instinctual response was to run away. Dogs, but Hong Kong reporters know their rights very well. "
However, the police expanded during the "counter -delivery" movement. A few months later, he encountered similar incidents in an interview. By July 1, 2020, the "National Security Law" took effect the next day, a citizen went to the streets to protest. The reporter at the scene even saw the police's defense line actively avoided it. This change made him sigh. "I came to work in Hong Kong in freedom of news. How do I know that in just a few months, Hong Kong reporters have become the same as that of my mainland reporters. The whole environment has changed."
After 2019, the role of the media as the fourth power and the public supervision agency (Publicwatchdog) has weakened significantly. The charged, according to the annual press freedom index of no borders, the 73rd in 2019, the 73rd in 2019 to the 140th in 2023.
In addition to tangible suppression, there are also intangible transformations. Hong Kong Radio, Wired News, and NOW News successively have a large earthquake in personnel. Government officers and pro -Chinese people who have no broadcasting experience in airborne are high -rise, and they have made controversy in the handling of many news.
MAPLE (pseudonym), a senior reporter who worked on the TV station, described the current "standing is heavy, professional as the deputy", and the inferior coins expelled good coins. With the interview director and senior colleagues of the "veteran opening veterans", she also had a year ago. Saying. "Previous Taib (TVB) news was accused of very 'river crab" ("harmonious" homophonic), and also experienced this kind of personnel change, but that's the process of ten years. Now we are completed within two years. The emergency and huge, we have worked hard for many years, and the credibility of many years is gone. "
The professional level of the media has declined, and the objective effect is the increase in official discourse. MAPLE said that the news editor room has a relatively lighter journalist. They lack practical experience, and their superiors cannot provide help. "So you will see many sections of the follow -up officials. No reporters are questioned and questioned. Speaking of the law, this allows the official to monopolize the entire discussion. " British MPs reprimand the government waiting for Li Zhiying's foreign minister to pay attention to contact with China Hong Kong "Apple Daily" stopped: What does this mean? "Apple Daily" was suspended, Hong Kong reporters encountered "sealed door" and "sword on the top of the head" Hong Kong News was founded for five years, it was announced that the suspension of farewell words said "the wind and the waves were in severe situation" The largest case of the Hong Kong National Security Law: Most of the 47s of democratic factions and 47 people have been "primary prisoners have not been tried" for two years ### "Political Language" How to change the narrative?

After 2019, the authorities reforming the election system at all levels of Hong Kong have been greatly reduced to reduce democratic composition and direct election seats.
After 2019, the outbreak of immigration broke out in Hong Kong, which applied for a BNO visa -that is, the British national (overseas) visa -150,000 people who moved to the UK. A survey of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in April this year showed that 74%of the company faced the problem of talent shortage, and 70%of the employees resigned were due to immigration.
However, while the people voted with their feet, the official promoted the "National Security Law" to "chaos anyway" in Hong Kong. The new stage of Xing "". The SAR Government has also launched a series of activities such as "Hello Hong Kong" and "Happy Hong Kong" to actively "tell the story of Hong Kong."
Scholar, who has moved to Britain, said that these political slogans are like Owaer's "NewSpeak" in the political fable novel "1984". rule. "This is a textual wand used by the authoritarian government. The so -called" Patriot Governing Hong Kong ', and the "Patriot" is defined by him. Packing the front and beautiful words, thereby changing everyone's cognition. "
He said that this set of language techniques was very successful in mainland China. People have been immersed and polluted for a long time, and they will slowly be led by this set of logic. "This is why the" little pink "phenomenon appears. Hong Kong people have experienced the stage of civilization. In addition, there are still freedom of network freedom, and the resistance of resistance will be higher than that of the Chinese people. This is worth worrying about. "
He continued that the official was using language to control narratives to set the tone of political events. "If you set the tone, you can't discuss it again. The source of the 'counter -delivery' movement is that Hong Kong citizens are worried that the amendment to the" Fugm Regulations "violates the guarantee of the rule of law, but officials cannot use the dialectical process to persuade you, and use the language of the struggle to label you. 'Color Revolution', talk about the slogan of some conclusive, and put the nature of the whole thing into his frame, there is no need to debate. "
In August 2019, officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council of China publicly stated that the anti -repair example demonstration was the "color revolution", and then the official repeatedly referred to as "black storms" and "foreign forces". In April 2023, Xia Paolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office, also said that although the Hong Kong version of the "Color Revolution" was not successful, this is a scar that can never be wiped in Hong Kong history, as if hanging on his head on his head The alarm bells must always be alert to street violence, "soft confrontation" secretly chaos and overseas Hong Kong activities.
Subsequently, Hong Kong Government officials followed Xia Baolong's argument. In the recent organ donation disputes, the Chief Executive Li Jiachao emphasized that he should be alert to the risk of Guoan and be careful to prevent "soft confrontation". The Hong Kong police arrested four people who suspected of stealing other people's information and used them to try to cancel the registration of organ donation. The Hong Kong version of the color revolution is similar to provoking contradictions through various reasons to create destruction of inconsistent reality. "
Scholar Chen Jialuo said: "Any people's livelihood incident can be promoted to the level of 'Color Revolution'. If you have a little dissatisfaction, he will help you think about it, it is called 'soft confrontation'."

The SAR Government has launched plans such as "Hello Hong Kong" and "Happy Hong Kong"
For this new political context, civil servants must also re -adapt. Jing En (pseudonym) in the middle level in the Hong Kong government's trading department revealed to BBC that some used words have become sensitive. For example, the "independent customs zone" must be changed to "separate customs zone", and "refueling" cannot appear in government slogans and " Copywriting, so as not to make people think of the demonstration slogan "Hong Kong people".
She also said that in recent years, almost every document has been changed to its all -recognition. The upper -level officials will join the political terms and slogans of mainland China and put the Hong Kong policy under the framework of the national policy. "'Fourteenth Five -Year Plan', 'Guangdong -Hong Kong -Macao Greater Bay Area', 'Belt and Road", now all documents must be added to these words, politics is correct. Related projects can be very good. "
She also noticed that the domestic officials began to penetrate the civil servant system. "I opened the email that day, and our emails were written in English, but the attachments actually wrote what 'boss difficulties'. At first glance, it was not a word used by Hong Kong people. Everyone saw it."
"Double -sided person" under normalizationImage source, getty images 
After the 2019 "Counterfeit Central" campaign, the authorities asked civil servants to swore to support the Basic Law and loyal to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and even deleted "political neutrality" in the Civil Servant Code. Civil servants were also required to complete more "political tasks". In December 2022, the former Chinese President Jiang Zemin died, and the Hong Kong government rarely asked all civil servants to watch the memorial service and silent for three minutes.
Jing En recalled that at that time, each department was empty, and all colleagues had to let go of their jobs and mourn. Unless they asked for leave that day to "spare". "Many more than there is KPI (key performance indicators) above. Each department must take pictures and upload it to Facebook pages to make work. There are more and more things that make everyone anti -white, but there is no way, you dare not dare to dare If you don't do it, everyone is helpless. "
Under the National Security Law, the education community also has more "facade kung fu" to do. The authorities stipulate that primary and secondary schools must hold a flag -raising ceremony every week and participate in the mainland inspection team. Teacher Ou, who taught the social science science, said: "Knowing that it is a political task, but I will take students to the Mainland to inspect and want them to learn things. After all, it is not a bad thing to know the national conditions. It is spent in 7 hours in 11 hours, and there is no educational significance for the poor schedule, just to do it. "
Authorities also stipulate that each subject must have elements to maintain national security, and even surgery is no exception. "Our sports teacher thought for a long time before thinking about how to add some national security elements. For example, when explaining the ball, as the citizens need to abide by the law, players must follow the ball. In fact, it is very ridiculous."
Professor Chen Jialuo said that after 2019, Hong Kong's "secondary return", the new style in the new era and new normal is mimicking. "Everyone has to make great work, red, fighting left, and rotten. Of course, we are very embarrassed, but those who are power are very happy. This is part of the means of maintaining stability. Climbing must show loyalty. "
He quoted former Czech President Harville's "The Power of thePower" in his masterpiece "The Power of thePowerless". Get up!"Poster, this slogan is not his true thoughts, he just obeys the power to avoid trouble.
"Hong Kong has also formed a different culture in the table, which is getting closer to mainland China. The regime does not care if you are sincere, but only care about whether you are obedient and cooperative. When the exterior walls of the building and the newspapers are all overwhelming expressions, come to him It's as if there is a cheerleading team, which proves how popular you are. Compared to the police and shots, this is the low -cost maintenance method. "

The person staying "How good is"?

Political scholars have pointed out that in the current system and political atmosphere, how much the former value can be preserved in Hong Kong will depend on the people's cooperation.
Scholar Zhong Jianhua quoted Harveil's claim that in the post -ending era, "Living Intruth", "Hong Kong has no room for space, and now rely on overseas Hong Kong people to continue to speak and tell the truth." Professor Chen Jialuo believes that it is also a persistence without leaving his position. "The key is how good the people staying, how serious they are."
Middle school teacher Ou said that she should "do less" as possible in the patriotic activities in the school stipulated by the authorities. For example, the weekly flag -raising ceremony should have a "state of the country", and she did not fully implement it. "I have many relatives and friends in the mainland, and some are teachers. They say that schools in the mainland will not say this every week '' national party '. The mainlanders are very smart. Hong Kong is too crazy, too brain, and too stupid. "
Teacher Xu also pointed out that the current teacher's social sciences are light and lightly described on the issue of "violating conscience". "You forced me to talk about the" Color Revolution "in 2019. I really can't tell, so let the students go back to take a note of their own notes. Anyway, this family has been castrated. Why should I be so seriously helping the official 'political propaganda'? Or explain the 'to improve the election system' and 'patriotic governance Hong Kong', and say it as a half joke -if it is used to look at it from a humorous perspective, Hong Kong is very funny now. "

She said that because the trials of the commune department were changed to only two levels of "reaching standards" and "not reaching standards", it was very difficult to meet the standards. The attitude of students in class became perfunctory. "They either do not cooperate, noise rebellion, or they just ignore you and do other subjects. Hong Kong's education system is very utilitarian. The atmosphere of indifference and cynicism is very strong. In the future, a group of smart but no moral elite will be raised in the future. "Mid -level civil servant Jing En said that people who are willing to express their loyalty after 2019 are quickly on the top, but not all civil servants must compete for the superiors, and more people are safe and silent.
"It can be understood that the people above should be charming, but we will not obey blindly. The suggestions for handing over will still be written according to professional judgment. If you really want to add political slogans, use a compromise method, add it in an inconspicuous place, and find it. Find it. Numbers (requiring requirements). I don't know how long I can persist, but at least I have to be at ease, don't be too disgusting. "

June 9, 2023 Image source, getty images
On June 7, the data released by the General Administration of Customs showed that in the US dollar, China exported 283.5 billion US dollars in May, a year -on -year decrease of 7.5%; imports were US $ 217.69 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 4.5%. The total imports and exports were US $ 50119 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 6.2%. 
Compared with the previous months, the data in May is a bit ugly. Beginning in October last year, China's export volume continued to decline. After the release of the epidemic and the Spring Festival, exports began to increase, exports increased by 14.8%year-on-year, and exports increased by 8.5%year-on-year. %.
A report issued by a credit rating agency "Oriental Jincheng" in China believes that the high increase in March was mainly due to centralized production. In April, due to the low base effect brought by the peak of the epidemic in April, the short -term factors in May faded, plus overseas overseas, plus overseas overseas The impact of the decline in demand showed that the other side evidence was the new export order index in the PMI (purchasing manager index) in April and May in April and May continued to be in the contraction range.
In other words, the export volume in March was due to the previous months of backlog order, which was delivered after the Spring Festival; the exports in April were relatively high because the city was closed in Shanghai last April, which caused the export volume last April to be extremely low, which caused this year to 4 this year. The increase of the month seems very high.
The data in May is ugly, and it also has the effect of a certain "high base effect". In April last year, the outbreak of the Shanghai outbreak broke out. The exit of the month rose 14%.
It is worth noting that according to the RMB pricing and the decline in the US dollar, the decrease of 7.5%at the US dollar is 7.5%, and the decrease is 0.8%at a price of RMB, mainly due to the sharp depreciation of the recent RMB against the US dollar.

The Vladivostok is near the junction of Russia, Central, and DPRK. It is facing the sea three, and it is the largest port on the Pacific coast. Since 2022, with the significant increase in trade in China and Russia, the transportation capacity of container ships from the port from the southeast coast from the port from the port from the southeast coast to the Vladivostok port, and the capacity of the ship's return is increasing. Indirectly stimulates the attraction of rotation through the port.
Vladivostok transformed into a China Internal Trade Port? The reality and history of the interaction between China and Russia and the Far East Chinese farmers take over the Far East? When a large number of new residents surge on the land From the perspective of China's export destination, the share of China's main trading partners is quietly changing -Japan, the United States and other export destinations that have occupied the main positions all year round, and the share is declining; the proportion of Russia and ASEAN is rising rapidly.
According to the RMB, the import and export of China fell by 5.5%year -on -year in the past May, an increase of 3.6%to the European Union, and a 3.5%decrease in Japan.
At the same time, the import and export of China's imports and exports to Southeast Asian Alliance countries in the past May increased by 9.9%, and Russia increased by 51.9%.
ASEAN also surpassed the European Union and became China's largest trading partner, and the European Union, the United States, and Japan ranked second, third, and fourth.
Except for Russia, China ’s exports to major trading partners in May have declined sharply.
The growth of ASEAN trade is mainly because after the "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement" (RCEP) in the beginning of last year, it has promoted a significant role in promoting the relationship between China and ASEAN trade.
The growth of Russia's trade was that after the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War in February last year, European and American economic sanctions on Russia gradually increased. Russia could not even use the international fund liquidation system (SWIFT) settlement, which caused Russia to increase trade in China.

The Federal Reserve ’s tenth consecutive interest rate hikes are expected to be approaching the end of this round of interest rate hikes * How to sweep the "inflation monsters" under the epidemic As well as
The main trading country to take care of China is not good. In May, South Korea's exports growth rate was -15.2%year-on-year, and it continued to decline by 0.9 percentage points on the basis of April. In May, Vietnam's exports fell 5.9%year -on -year, and it has declined for four consecutive months.
Reuters quoted analysts saying that in the past 12-18 months, the sharp tightening of global monetary policy, as well as recent pressure on the Western banking industry, has brought anxiety to the road of recovery in China and the world.
In May, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the tenth consecutive time. After the interest rate hike, the Federal Fund interest rate increased to 5.00%-5.25%, which was a new high since 2007.
After the interest rate hike in May, the Fed Chairman Powell said that the interest rate cut is not suitable now. He believes that inflation will decline, but the speed will not be fast, and it takes time to decline.
"If this prediction is generally correct, then the interest rate cut is inappropriate, and we will not cut interest rates." He further stated that if the demand is weakened further, there are more signs of softening in the labor market, so we may consider the interest rate cut.
The purpose of the Federal Reserve ’s interest rate hike is to curb inflation, but after continuous interest rate hikes, it must be maintained at a high level, making the cost of borrowing enterprises and individuals higher, suppressing the needs of major global markets.
Foreign trade data also shows that foreign -funded enterprises are not good in China. In the first five months, foreign -invested enterprises imported and exported 5.1 trillion yuan, a decrease of 7.6%. In contrast , Increased by 13.1%, the import and export of state -owned enterprises was 2.76 trillion yuan, an increase of 4.7%.
Other data also confirms the predicament of foreign capital in China. According to data from the Chinese Bureau of Statistics, the total profit of foreign companies, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan business-investment enterprises in China in January to February reached 35.7%.

Description: The new strategy of the German federal government has been brewing for a long time, and one major reason is that the German national security strategy as its foundation is difficult to produce.

On March 18, 2022, the Green Party's German Foreign Minister Berbak officially announced the launch of the national security strategy formulation work
(Voice of Germany) on June 14, but there are still very few precise news about Germany's national security strategy. Comprehensive information on multiple parties, the only information that can be determined now is: the file may have 37 pages long, the parties quarrel around it for several months, and the release date is dragged again and again. If this document can really be officially submitted to the Federal Cabinet Conference on June 14, and the Federal Parliament will be submitted shortly after, it will inevitably shrink significantly compared to the initial.
As early as the fall of 2021, the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party set a goal when setting up the cabinet: formulate the first national security strategy in Germany's history. At that time, the Russian and Ukraine War had not erupted.
In March 2022, Russia and Ukraine War Nearly a month after the outbreak, the Green Party's German Foreign Minister Belbak(Annalena Baerbock)Formally announce the launch of the national security strategy formulation work. At that time, the German Prime Minister had proposed the "Times Turning", and domestic and foreign countries were looking forward to Germany to introduce a national security strategy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the main purpose of formulating this document is to "protect the freedom of our lives."
Federal parliamentarian Alder retired before the German Major of Germans
According to the initial plan, this document should comprehensively explore the foreign and security policy environment under the concept of "overall security". Social Democratic Party member Alt(John)In an interview with the Voice of Germany, "overall security" contains many aspects, and educational policies, health policies, environmental policies, grain policies, and fiscal policies are all included.
Opposition members also support the government to formulate a national security strategy under the concept of "overall security". Endel(ThomasErndl)To the Voice of Germany, "Considering the hybrid threat, such as the supply chain, economic dependence, and even the dependence of the medical field, we obviously need overall general general considerations and find answers." He praised the federal government to handle the task.
Endel, Vice Chairman of the Federal Parliament
There are differences everywhere 
However, Endall also pointed out that the document has delayed the release date many times. He believes that the reason why this document that affects almost all political areas is difficult to produce, "obviously because there are differences in core issues within the government."
Heisen State Peace Research Foundation(HSFK)Political scholar Witt(AntoniaWitt)It is believed that the German federal government should not have given you too much time on this document. After all, this is a complex project involving all aspects. It requires extensive communication within the government. "Challenge", "What threats do we face in the future", "What methods Germany want to take", and "what goals should be available for security policies should" and other questions. Witt pointed out that the process of formulating a national security strategy "must cover many political controversial topics, and therefore will inevitably lead to disputes and delay.
Reuters recently disclosed that the main differences between the federal government are the arms export trade and cyber security policy. It is reported that the Ministry of Justice, headed by the Liberal Democratic Party, opposed "violent violence" and believes that it should not use hackers to fight back at the attacker after being hit by hackers.
In addition, whether the "national defense expenditure should exceed 2%of GDP" clauses stipulated in the NATO regulations into the national security strategy, the federal government is also controversial. Witt disclosed to the Voice of Germany, "The key to" this problem lies in whether to introduce strict military expenditures and non -military expenses at the same time. That is, if you invest in a military field, you should also invest a piece in the field of non -military measures. Money. The so -called non -military measures, including crisis diplomatic mediation, foreign development assistance, etc. "
Where will the German policy of China be driving? 
Do not set up the National Security Council 
The German government has also conceived the establishment of the "National Security Council", but this goal has long been abandoned. Witt believes that the agency can have become cross -department coordination agencies, allowing different government departments to find plans to respond to crisis and challenges. She guessed that the main reason for giving up this goal was: there are a lot of disputes about the "committee should belong to which department should belong to which department". It is reported that the Prime Minister's Palace and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once started to fight.
The opposition member Endel also criticized the government to abandon the plan to establish the National Security Commission just because of differences. He also believes that the agency can have a cross -department coordination.
The Social Democratic Party member Aldter interpreted from another angle: "We have no strategic cultural traditions in Germany. In the past 70 years, we have always lost strategic issues to NATO. We have some conceptual documents, but have never formed strategies. This is a new cultural change, it takes time. "
The difficult national security strategy has caused direct consequences: based on it, Germany's new strategy to China can also be released before the German -Chinese government on June 20 。

Together with Trump's other investigations, the United States will encounter a situation that has never been before before the 2024 presidential election.

 The Republican Party's Trump has announced the 2024 presidential election, and the current momentum is far ahead among many competitors in the party.
Today, the US federal prosecutor sued him nearly 40 criminals because Trump's improper government secretly held the government, which means that Trump is likely to represent the Republican Party on behalf of the Republican Party when he was prosecuted. Essence
Trump has stated that he will not abandon the party's primary election and anti -control "corruption" political opponents in an attempt to interfere with the election.
"Mattshoemaker), a national security analyst, who was an intelligence official, said:" This incident may not affect the voters who have not yet decided to vote, but it will affect Trump, which may be shaken or switched to a candidate who has no burden of candidates. supporter."
In addition to being prosecuted by the federal case due to confidential documents, Trump was also sued in financial fraud by New York State for the sealing fee of porn actors. Fall.
But no one can guarantee that the two cases can end such a fast trial. In addition, Trump is also being investigated by Federal and State -level investigations due to subverting the 2020 presidential election.
In case of Sichuan Pu won the 2024 election, it is possible to destroy all the unfinished federal prosecution procedures through self -pardon. This situation has no previous cases in the United States, and a few can cause constitutional crisis; Essence However, Trump is now worried about the damage caused by these legal issues to the preliminary election of the party.
The federal prosecutor sued Sichuan Pu, and let the Florida governor Ron Desantis and former Vice President Mikepence, who also fought for the Republican presidential candidate, have the opportunity to criticize Sichuan's unsuitable office, but they The risk of losing Sichuan Pu's loyal supporters.
Trump paid the sealing fee to the porn actor "Stormydaniels" during the 2016 presidential election. Trust Trump. So many Republican opponents stated that Trump was standing up, and maybe he wanted to wait and see before Trump was completely out.
Trump is currently investigating the Federal Survey of the Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021; the Washington Post also quoted earlier this month that the sources were disclosed that Georgia's suspected intervention of the Trump campaign camp was suspected of intervention in the 2020 election. Expand activities to Washington and other states.
"The opponents hope Trump will eventually go out due to a series of prosecutions, including on January 6 (Congress Building Riot) and attempt to overthrow the election," said the University of Virginia. It is their strategy. Take the initiative to take the initiative? Before they succeed, Trump bit his throat step by step. "
The recent survey of "Yougov" of the International Municipal Corporation found that only half of the interviewees believed that the Trump camp was "serious crime" for the Trump camp for hidden seal expenses. However, two -thirds of the interviewees believed that Trump took away government confidential documents from the White House and obstructed the government's recovery of serious crimes.
Among Republican respondents, 28%of them believed that forging commercial records were serious crimes, and 42%believed that taking away confidential documents was serious crime. This gap shows that due to confidential documents by the federal prosecution, it may become a turning point in the Trump Party's primaries.
Dissent ranks second in polls, but is quite different from Trump. He has always maintained restraint and does not comment on Trump's lawsuit. But for a few weeks, the words of the two -party camp have become more and more intense.

This time it was related to the confidential file processing after he left the White House. Last year, the Federal Investigation Agency searched for his private villa in Florida, Mar-A-LGO, and seized thousands of documents, including about 100 confidential documents.
According to a public prosecution on Friday, he was charged with 37 charges, saying that he hid highly sensitive documents such as US military and nuclear plans in the villa, placed in the ballroom, bathroom and even shower.

According to a public prosecution on Friday, he was charged with 37 charges, saying that he hid high sensitive documents such as US military and nuclear plans in the Mar-A-LGO of private villas, placed in the dance hall, bathroom and even even Shower room.
BBC reporters Jude Sheerin and Rebeccaseales reported from Washington that the 49 -page indictment states that the confidential documents placed in the box contain the following information:
Prosecutors said that when Trump stepped down, he transported about 300 confidential documents to his private villa Haihu Manor, which was also a large private club. Tens of thousands of members and guests went to the manor to attend the event, including a banquet hall in the discovery of the document.
Prosecutors said Trump tried to obstruct the investigation by the Federal Investigation Bureau. He had suggested that lawyers "hidden or destroy" these documents, or told investigators that he did not have these documents.
According to the indictment, Trump said to one of his lawyers: "If we directly tell them that there is nothing better here?"
Trump is expected to appear for the first time in the case of the case a day before his life on Tuesday and 77th.

Haihu Manor (Mar-A-Lago) bathrooms are stacked with boxing files.
The court documents show that Trump was charged with 37 criminal crimes, including unauthorized owning confidential materials, hindering judicial justice, and fake statements to law enforcement agencies.
These allegations include 31 charges that deliberately retained national defense information in accordance with the Spy Law.
The prosecution pointed out that the maximum sentence of these charges is 10 years.
The other four charges involve co -workers, detention or concealment documents, and each crime period is 20 years.
The last two charges, that is, plan to conceal and false statements and expressions, each crime period is 5 years.
"These charges are extremely serious," said Carltobias, a legal professor at the University of Richmond, Virginia. "There is a lot of details in the files, most of them are very harmful."
He added that these details and "very disturbing" allegations about the processing of sensitive national security data constitute "strong evidence of the government".
He said: "Of course, all of this must be confirmed, but (in the indictment) has a lot of information for me, and it is very likely to the jury. Obviously, for the jury Say this is the case. "
When will Trump be arrested?

In 2022, the Federal Investigation Bureau seized thousands of documents while searching in Trump's Haihu Manor.A law enforcement official told the BBC American partner CBS News that the US Special Service has met with the former president's staff and arranged for his special service staff on Friday.
The news on Friday confirmed that Trump would go to Miami the night before appearing.
Will he be handcuffed and press the fingerprint? 
Prior to the report of the prosecution, the legal professor Tobeis told BBC that the form of Trump's arrest may be similar in April. At that time, he was accused of forging a business record and an adult movie actress Daniels ( Stormydaniels) paid the sealing fee and was prosecuted by criminal prosecution.
Trump surrendered in New York and appeared in court in April to deny his control. He pressed his fingerprint, but he was not locked in handcuffs, nor did he take a big head photo of the suspect.
Professor Tobeis believes that Trump is unlikely to be locked in handcuffs or take big head photos this time.
He said: "I think this is unlikely, because there is the status of the former president, and the risk of his flee is very small. He will have to negotiate or defense ... but I don't think they need to use such procedures ","
Once Trump's arrest documents are completed, he will be regarded as arrested and detained. After the file is handled, he will be tried, which means that he will listen to the crime and defense in court.
What is the case?

Trump went to New York to surrender and appeared in court in April to deny the crime. He pressed his fingerprint, but he was not locked in handcuffs, nor did he take a big head photo of the suspect.
Trump should hand over all presidential documents when he left in January 2021, which is regarded as federal property.
Federal officials, including former presidents, are illegal to take away or retain confidential documents at the place of authorization.
But just a few months after Trump left the White House, the National Archives of the United States found that some documents were missing.
These include a letter from Trump's communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong -un, and a letter left to Trump when the former President Obama stepped down.
The authorities asked to provide these records, and Trump handed over some of them.
In August 2022, the Federal Investigation Bureau searched Trump's private villa Haihu Manor, seized 11,000 documents, parts of confidential or highest confidential documents, and some "TS/SCI", which may cause US national security to cause national security "Special serious" damage.
Other items include a photo clip, a handwritten note, an unknown information about the French president, and the amnesty application letter written by Trump's old friend and consultant Roger Stone.
Prosecutors believe that Trump has retained some of the documents under the informedness and tried to hinder the investigation and prevent the documents from being retrieved.
What are the response to Trump? 
Trump responded an angry response, saying that it was a "scam" for political motivation. He also claimed that he "had nothing to hide" and had "openly" provided relevant documents.
In a series of Truth Social posts and a film, Trump repeatedly said that he was innocent and said that the complaint was a "political war" before the 2024 election.
He used various arguments to defend his own way of processing documents, including that he decrypted the files before the document was found.
Although there was also a president directly decrypted the documents in the past, there was no evidence that Trump had done so or followed any existing procedures.
Trump also said that some documents are personal files and are protected by administrative privileges. They do not need to be transferred to the National Archives when they are out of office. This is the prerequisite for this case.
He said, "No one may be allowed to see the personal documents I brought from the White House. This is not wrong."
Legal experts have largely denied this argument.
Davidsuper, a Professor of Georgetown University Law Center, told BBC that Trump's lawyer may argue that the former president is just a "very bad archiver."
One of the keys to the case may be a recording. It is said that Trump said in the recording that he intends to retain the documents and acknowledge that his ability to decrypt the documents is limited.
Professor Speel said that if the recording was true, "this almost made him sink, because it showed that he knew the words he said in public was not true."
Criminal prosecution will affect the president of Trump?

According to US law, public office can be caminated even if they are prosecuted by criminals.

(Voice of Germany) Anna feels uncomfortable recently. The young startup entrepreneur from Virginia in the United States did not know where to go. In addition to feeling nausea and panic, her dog also performed abnormally. Lulu is a poodle, who is more willing to stick to Anna than Anna's husband. But in the past few days, Lulu suddenly didn't want to approach the hostess.
After that, Anna found that she was pregnant -although the so -called "discovery" was actually after she had symptoms of major bleeding and was taken to the emergency room of the hospital.
The doctor told Anna that even if the fetus could survive, she would face high risk pregnancy.
Anna and her husband returned home. It was the most difficult day in her life. She just wanted to lie down and hug her dog. But Lulu was unwilling to get close to her.
To protect privacy, the Voice of Germany used a pseudonym in this article. Anna said that she was very angry at the time, and she felt that Lulu was very indifferent to her throughout the stage of her physical discomfort.
"Since we adopt it, it sleeps next to me every night, but now it is unwilling." Anna recalled. "It is only willing to sleep next to my husband. After the day, the fetus in Anna stopped her heartbeat. Anna felt that she had never rely so on, but Lulu was still unwilling to approach her. The abnormal behavior of the dog caused her a heavy blow.
"I think the dog should give the owner unconditional love," she said.
Dogs can smell the change of the owner Horman 
A few days after Anna underwent the curettage surgery, Lulu's behavior returned to normal. Now it is "more loving". As Anna's body is gradually cured, it likes to snuggle with the hostess again.
But how can the dog's behavior have such abnormal changes?
"The dog can smell the smell of hormones, and the owner will change the smell during pregnancy or abortion," explaining the dog coach Sissy Leoniekreid. After graduating from the University of Wakhunnn University in the Netherlands, she founded a "dog college" in Germany.
When the dog is confused or at a loss, it may temporarily alienate you
Crede pointed out that changes in hormonal chemical levels will affect the behavior of dogs. But this is not the only possibility of Anna and Lulu.
"People will change their behavior after experiencing abortion, such as depression, and even sadness. Dogs cannot understand this change, and they also need time to adapt." Cred analyzed.
And this is exactly the case between Anna and her dog.
"Now I know, Lulu must be very confused at the time. But I was just angry at that time," Anna said.
Cred said that when the owner's hormones are re -adjusted to the normal level after a change like abortion, the dog's behavior will return to the same way. Usually, it takes a few weeks to adjust the behavior of dogs, but sometimes it only takes a few days, just like Anna's poodle Lulu.
Dogs are more spiritual than pregnancy test sticks? 
Because of the sensitive sense of smell, search and rescue dogs can find the lost people in the forest, or survivors buried under the earthquake ruins Essence They can also be to identify patients with cancer or long -term new crown sequelae by olfactory. 
Smell the new crown virus? Dogs can! 
"Before I found that I was pregnant, Lulu began to refuse to get close to me," Anna recalled.
For many years, Creded, who had been on the hundreds of thousands of dogs and his owner, said that when the smell in the air changed, the dog could be sensitive.
"For dogs to know what these changes mean, we have not proved scientific data, but from the perspective of their behavior, we can judge that they obviously know that something is different from the past." Creded added.
From pseudo -pregnancy to guard dog behavior 
Ben Nidik is a fitness coach from Bonn, Germany. He firmly believes that the pet dog Meile at home aware of his wife's first child.
"Meile suddenly created a certain urge to build a nest." Ben Nidic said, "It has a lot of plush toys and created a comfortable corner for himself. It looks like it is pregnant."
The changes in the behavior of pet dogs during pregnancy also include sudden relying on pregnant women, sticking her all day, or excessive protection of her.
"Dogs may become very desire to control and protect, and even people who do not allow it to sit next to the pregnant owner." Pet dog expert Cred said, "They even facing the noise from outside Bark loudly. "
She suggested that when a dog appears such anomalous behavior, he can seek help from pet dog behavior experts. Because such behavior abnormalities may increase after the baby is born. An American researcher conducted a survey in 2014 and found that some dogs will have jealousy to the owner's newborns.
"(In this case) The first reaction of the dog must be sympathetic understanding." Cred said, "When a baby is about to be born, this is an uncertain situation for dogs. Humans sometimes cannot adapt to this situation -but dogs have much weaker control of emotions, so it will become nervous and even nervous. At this time, the most important thing is to show understanding. "
Let your dog be prepared for your baby's birth 
If you are pregnant, then you better let the dog prepare for the arrival of the new family members.
You can first let the other members of the family feed the dogs or take it out for a walk. In this way, even if you can't do these things because of your fatigue during pregnancy or postpartum, your dog will not feel much change.
In addition, it is also a good way to let the dog learn to adapt to the baby's voice, so that they "will not jump up or barking when you are holding the crying baby", Crede suggested.
However, she also reminded that the newborn should not have a room with the dog alone.

"As the second largest economy in the world, Trade between China and Russia Growing rapidly. In the West, Russia was despised for invading Ukraine. Today's German -China relations are not damaged because Beijing supports Moscow's support. China's threat to Taiwan, Germany considers reducing dependence on Chinese business These factors are all pressure on Germany -China relations Essence "
"Therefore, it is even more important to choose a good future. In recent years, the unhappiness accumulated in bilateral relations in recent years cannot disappear overnight. The crisis is very in line with the interests of Germany and the European Union. Therefore, the communication channels for China at all levels cannot be cut off. "

So bad, Ukraine is expected to start a successful counterattack Essence
"Many places in Russia have already appeared uneasy under the autocratic rule of President Putin. The latest progress on the battlefield is more likely to allow the Russian people to completely deviate from Putin. Putin's dream of resurrected Tsaristian Russia will be broken. Can't pose a threat to Europe and the world. "
"If the Russian and Ukraine War can end, the world will get a positive impact. US President Biden will also get the opportunity to alleviate the tension of the United States and China. At present, China itself is undergoing economic cooling, which may make Xi Jinping more inclined to tend to be more inclined Yu and the United States reached an understanding. Biden did not seek to change the Chinese regime. He just wanted to consolidate the status quo of the Taiwan Strait. "
"If Russia was defeated in the Ukrainian battlefield, Sino -US relations ease , Governments around the world will have more space to focus on climate protection. After all, human civilization is facing a threat of destruction. However, there is only a narrow and twisting path to this goal. Therefore, whether democratic countries can survive too many crises are still a question mark. "

China's youth unemployment rate reaches the highest history
(Voice of Germany Chinese) For Annie (pseudonym) and many other young people, survival in big cities in China is like an endless struggle.
"Young people are particularly difficult to find a job now, and the level of income has begun to decline." The young woman who was unwilling to disclose a full name told the Voice of Germany.
Although since the end of last year, the Chinese government has abandoned the strict zero -epidemic prevention policy, the overall economic situation has recovered, but youth unemployment rate Still at the highest level of history. Official statistics show that in April this year, about 20.4%among groups 16 to 24 years old are unemployed. Compared with the unemployment rate of 5.2%of the overall employment population, the unemployment rate of young groups is almost four times higher.
In addition, with the arrival of the graduation season, millions of university graduates will also enter the employment market.
"In the next few years, the problem of unemployment of young people in China may only become more and more serious." Sahzadqazi, executive director of the "China Beige Book". The headquarters in New York is committed to providing independent survey data on the Chinese economy.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Education of China, Chinese college graduates are expected to exceed 11 million in 2023
In the past 20 years, China has maintained its continuous economic growth. However, as the economic development model has shifted from the low -cost processing industry to the pillar of high -tech and service -oriented industries, the unemployment rate of young people is rising at the rate of higher than other ages.
There is also one factors that produce negative effects, that is, during the epidemic, the Chinese government has combined and rectified technology, education, entertainment, and real estate industries, which aims to strengthen the country's control over large enterprises. This has led to the technology industry giants including Tencent, Alibaba, Sina, etc. have announced significant layoffs in recent months -and these companies are often employed by young people who have received higher education.
New crown epidemic caused a blow to the service industry 
For millions of young college graduates In terms of lack of attractive employment opportunities, it has become a cruel reality they have to face.
"Many people lose their jobs during the epidemic, and when they are trying to find similar jobs in business, finance, media and technology industries, they will find that many of the well -paid positions are for those who have worked for several years. The experienced person was prepared, and Annie told Germany.
According to the investigation and research by the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs, in the economic downturn, young people are more vulnerable to affected because their work experience is relatively less. In China, this disadvantage was worsened by the new crown epidemic, and the service industry was particularly serious.
"Decent work" is getting less and less 
The above -mentioned Goldman Sachs report also mentioned that the skills obtained by college graduates in colleges and universities are often deviated with the skills required by enterprise employers. This phenomenon is particularly obvious in education and sports industries.
Some experts have pointed out that the lack of "decent work" is common in China and other countries in the world. "People often say that college graduates do not want to work in the factory, but the current trend of China and the world is that they have less and less decent work -this means that they can provide high work guarantee, salary and benefits. Elifriedman, a generous and enabled young people to stand in a large city in a big city ", and the Chinese laborers market developed as the focus of the Chinese labor market as the focus of research.
Vinson (pseudonym) is a young Chinese in his 20s. He told a Voice of Germany that since the epidemic, many companies have required employees to extend working hours, but at the same time, they have to reduce wages or no more wages. Faced with such changes, many of his friends chose to give up struggle and lay flat. Some people are brewing "Run" abroad.
"Run" culture reflects questioning of the system 
In order to reduce the unemployment rate, the Chinese government introduced a fifteen -point plan It includes providing vocational training for young people, promising to increase employment in state -owned enterprises, and support young people to start a business.
"China Blood Book" executive director Kazaki said these measures are important, but Beijing also needs to focus on the vitality of restoring private enterprises and SMEs, so as to create more investment and employment.
Although young people do not seem to have a political threat to the Chinese government, experts agree that young people in some cities may realize that in today's China, "national power is not limited."
Professor Friedman of Cornell University pointed out that young people's urge to "moisturize" may also show that they lack confidence in China's political system. "If they lack confidence in the stability of the system, and at the same time feel that they have no ability to change the status quo, then leaving may be a rational response to this situation."

One -quarter fourth -year German students cannot complete normal reading
(Voice of Germany) Heinz-Petermeidinger, Chairman of the German Teachers Association, believes that German primary schools should cancel English classes, and teachers should use this course to improve their children's German reading and mathematical ability.
In an interview with the Deguanglian ARD on Friday (June 9), it is wrong to use English lessons as a key subject for primary schools. "We believe that English classes are optional. You can focus on reading lessons and other ... Education in elementary education, we must pay more attention to some basic knowledge, such as reading, writing and arithmetic."
Chairman of the German Teachers Association Matteoge
Where does this suggestion come from?
Midinge's statement was proposed after the International Primary School Reading Survey (IGLU) last month. The test results show that compared with their peers in many other countries, German elementary school students have poor performance. A quarter of German fourth -year students cannot complete normal reading Essence

A study by the University of New South Wales in Australia believes that with the increase in marine temperatures caused by climate change, more than three -quarters of corals around the world will be ill in the next century, which will seriously affect the marine ecosystem.
Xinhua News Agency reported that unlike albinization, coral diseases are caused by damage by coral immune systems, and most of the sick corals will die. With the death of corals, the ecosystem of the entire coral reef will be affected.
Australia studies and analyzed 108 research on coral health, compared with the disease of corals with the changes in the temperature of the marine surface temperature. Researchers have found that the prevalence of corals increases with the rise of the ocean temperature. In the 25 years of 2018, global corals have doubled to 9.92%.
The model of this study predicts that according to the current heating trend, in the worst case, the prevalence of global corals in 2100 will reach 76.8%.
Researchers say that corals are a sensitive creature. The temperature, salinity and water quality of the seawater will affect the survival of corals. The rise in marine temperatures will cause corals to "feel pressure", affect the immune system. At the same time, the rise in marine temperatures has also enhanced the reproductive ability of pathogens such as fungi and bacteria, increasing the risk of coral being infected.
Berke, a doctoral student of the University of New South Wales, who led this study, said that coral reefs play an important role in marine ecosystems, which is also closely related to the development of fisheries and tourism. Coral disease is an important reason for global coral death and coral reef degeneration. The model of this study shows that even if the ocean heated up at a more conservative rate, the situation will continue to deteriorate. This also highlighted the importance of quickly taking action to slow down climate warming.
Research from the University of New South Wales in Australia has been published in the monthly journal of Ecological Communication.

 Chechen's receiving Chinese armored vehicles caused by fear of invading Ukraine's doubts Associated Press Picture
After uploading the online film of Chinese armored vehicles this week, Chechen President Kadrov caused Chinese equipment to be used to support Russia's military operations.

The current film of Chinese armored vehicles also caused other doubts, including the intention of Kadrov uploading the film.
Shaanxi Baoji Special Automobile Factory did not respond to email questions. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it was unclear and emphasized that China complied with its "not arched fire or fueling" policy. The Kremlin did not respond to the request immediately.
The Wall Street Journal cannot confirm when and how they enter Chechen, and what they use.
According to the Institute of International Peace of Stockholm, armored vehicles were the second largest export military products in China last year, with an export value of 392 million US dollars, second only to the aircraft $ 73 million. Data show that China exports many national armored vehicles, including Afghanistan, Cambodia and other countries.
