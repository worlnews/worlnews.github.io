<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65661636/64828142"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-17T14-15-00Z/64828142_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) "New Zurich" commented that May 4th is the Youth Day of China, but this year's "May 4th" does not seem to have made young people happy to have a holiday. It has exceeded 20%, which is the highest record since relevant statistics. This article entitled "Xi Jinping's call to the countryside to wake up the pain of pain in the countryside" and wrote:</p>
<p>"Chinese young people use‘ we are the last generation ’on social media, which is reminiscent of the hopeless atmosphere of Western young people in the early 1980s. Protestion. There is no doubt, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338"></a>Essence This situation is likely to evolve into social explosives that threaten the CCP's rule. The younger generation has shown the courage to express dissatisfaction with the system: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/11月27日亲历北京亮马桥/a-63950713"></a>Essence This time, it is publicly criticized by college students. In China, about 80 college students participated in the protests. Their actions did put pressure on the authorities. Two months later, Xi Jinping announced the cancellation of epidemic prevention measures.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-17T14-15-00Z/63908386_401.jpg" />In November last year, young Chinese people walked on the streets of the mountains to protest the "clearing policy" of the authorities.</p>
<p>If the crisis faced by the younger generation further intensifies, normalized, or a emergencies set off a larger -scale protests among young people, what will happen? The Beijing authorities are very clear that the younger generation hides special risks that affect social stability. In view of this, school education does not allow free thinking and questioning, but to cultivate a younger generation who obeyed command and death. Now, in order to better control the younger generation, Xi Jinping obviously wants to take further measures: he wants to send young people to the countryside.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping has previously emphasized the suggestions for young people to go to the countryside. However, this proposal appeared on May 4 this year's "People's Daily" on the top version of the important position, which has never been before. Xi Jinping issued a warning that young people should take responsibility and prepare for a hard life. Young people should go to the countryside to find a job to revitalize the local economy. Those young people who leave the city and help poverty alleviation in remote and backward areas are worthy of praise. Xi Jinping left Beijing at the age of 16 and began his life in the mountains. Xi Jinping said: 'Seven -year rural life is a good exercise for me. '"</p>
<p>The comments pointed out that at the end of 2019, the China Youth League organization had proposed a plan to allow 10 million college students to go to the countryside to find employment, and Guangdong and Shandong also made relevant suggestions.</p>
<p>"In China, the rural life is not much related to the rural poetry, which means that the prospects are dim. But in order to ensure social stability, the Communist Party still wants to exile the younger generation of the future and educated younger generation of the country to the countryside.</p>
<p>This measure worked in the Mao Zedong era, and it also worked in the Xi Jinping era: dispersing young students to remote mountain villages across the country, and they will not be able to protest. Although they have been used to a large degree of personal freedom in the past three decades, such as freedom of travel. However, the long -term clearance policy shows that when facing crisis, the government can completely force the number of people to give up personal freedom. However, the Communist Party will also pay heavy economic and social costs for its continuous overweight suppression policies. The younger generation's sense of distrust of the government will also be increasing day by day. "</p>
<p>While the government calls on young people to enter the countryside, there are indeed many unbearable urban young people who take the initiative to go to remote areas. "Editorial Network" wrote here:</p>
<p>"The new sacred place for the countryside is the northernmost tip of China's remote mining city: Hegang. This small town near Russia is known as the lowest cost of living in China '. In the past few months, hundreds of each day Young people come to this city. Because even if there is not much savings, they can realize the real estate dream here: less than 80,000 yuan can buy a small apartment, and the heating fee is borne by the municipal government.</p>
<p>However, the cost of low living costs actually requires a high price: the temperature in the winter of Hegang can be as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the recent hospital also takes a few hours of drive. "</p>

<p>On the 17th, the China State Council refers to the Eight Banners editor -in -chief Fucha (Li Yanhe). The working group of Fa Chalian Department said on the 18th that everyone was worried about whether they would be charged with the same crimes, and the negative impact had been arisen.</p>
<p>Acting for Fuchalian's work group has two responses to the China State Council Office. First, the working group is pleased that the Chinese side arranges Fucha's wife to "call and communicate" with him in Shanghai. But from the speech of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, it seems that Fucha's wife has no way to see him. Fucha was not able to hire a lawyer and get a consultation for himself. The working group is very worried about the current health and psychological conditions of Facha, and hopes that the Beijing authorities can ensure the complete legal guarantee he should enjoy.</p>
<p>Second, although the Taiwan Affairs Office emphasized that Fucha is a case, the working team emphasized that most of the time, Fucha work and live in Taiwan. The arrest of the sin of the country will indeed worry that many Taiwanese people are worried that even if it is a normal behavior in Taiwan, is it likely to be arrested and detained in Shanghai? From the perspective of supporting as many as three or four hundred people, the Fucha case has made Taiwan's knowledge and cultural circles highly. I dare not go to mainland China. Negative impacts have been arisen, and they are definitely not as "cases" called by the State Council spokesman. It is hoped that the Shanghai National Security Bureau will be having a truth as soon as possible, and it will be fair.</p>
<p>The working group called on all walks of life to let the Beijing government know that the freedom, security and rights of Taiwanese should be absolutely respected and guaranteed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65666897/64857653"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T02-43-00Z/64857653_303.jpg" /></a>The US Congress and the state government have become increasingly alert to TIKTOK, and they are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), the United States Republican governor of Montana, Greggianforte, signed a legislation on Wednesday (May 17) to prohibit Tiktok from operating in the state, saying that this move will further "protect the Mongolian Mongolian people free Monitor of the Communist Party of China. " After the bill takes effect, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全面禁止tiktok美国蒙大拿州先行一步/a-65333928"></a>Essence</p>
<p>The ban stipulates that Tiktok will not be downloaded in Montana, which means that applications such as Google and Apple are not allowed to "illegally" to provide TIKTOK. Whenever someone uses TIKTOK, whether it is "providing the ability to use this application" or "download it", TIKTOK or App Store will touch the France, which will face a fine of up to $ 10,000 a day.</p>
<p>The bill is expected to take effect on January 1, 2024, and punishment will not apply to the user.</p>
<p>On the 17th, a Tiktok spokesman Brookeoberwetter issued a statement saying that the bill was unconstitutional and "violated the freedom of speech of the people of Montana." She said, "We want to guarantee the people of Montana, and they can continue to use Tiktok to express ourselves, make a living, and join the community, because we continue to work hard to defend the rights of users inside and outside Montana."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T02-43-00Z/65096240_401.jpg" />In March of this year, the chief CEO of Tiktok went to the US Congress to testify, and the hearing president has been in the past 6 hours.</p>
<p>The first amendment to the US Constitution stipulates that no law formulated by Congress shall violate the basic human rights of citizens, which contains freedom of speech.</p>
<p>In 2020, the then US President Donaldtrump tried to stop downloading Tiktok and WeChat through the norms of the Ministry of Commerce, which was blocked by multiple courts and never took effect.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全盘禁止tiktok-美国民主党内有反对声音/a-65213817)It also supports American users to maintain the right to use Tiktok in order to exercise freedom of speech.</p>
<h3>Tiktok's ban is feasible?</h3>
<p>The Associated Press quoted an analysis of online security experts. This ban has no incentive measures except for the fines, and no incentive measures make relevant companies willing to comply with regulations, so "full law enforcement will be very difficult."</p>
<p>In addition, compared with China's control of citizens' access to the Internet, the United States does not have any similar means or tools. The decree also excludes online service providers.</p>
<p>A member of the members included a representative of Apple and Google's trade group TechNet that the Associated Press told the Associated Press that the application store was unable to "geographical fence" in specific applications in different states, so it was impossible to prevent Tiktok from being downloaded in Montana. The organization also said that the application itself should decide the running range, not an app store.</p>
<p>Odedvanunu, the product vulnerability director of the Internet Security Corporation, also believes that it is difficult for app stores to isolate the application download of a single country. He suggested that it is more feasible to comply with the rules by Tiktok, because the application itself has the right to "adjust the settings according to the user's geographical location or IP address."</p>
<h3>Disabast</h3>
<h3>American Stepping Tiktok</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体不断升级的tiktok之争/a-65171272"></a>They are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform and thus requires the application of the application nationwide. However, it is not easy to face many difficulties in Montana, a state of more than 1 million; it is not easy to expand the scope of the ban to more than 150 million TIKTOK users throughout the United States.</p>
<p>March this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/抖音执行长赴美国会作证前夕-专家怎么说/a-65078532"></a>The hearing president has been in the atmosphere for nearly 6 hours. Both members of the parliament questioned that the Tiktok's parent company Bytedance will enable the Chinese government to obtain user data or affect American users in the application.</p>
<p>In this regard, TIKTOK constantly denied that it had shared data with the Chinese government and said that if it was asked, the platform would not do so.</p>
<p>At present, TIKTOK is undergoing an initiative called "Projecttexas". It wants to create an independent entity to store data from American users on the US server and operate by American technology company Oracle.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T04-36-00-04-00/000000.png" />China's A -share transaction volume has shrunk day by day, whether it is caught in a bear market to focus on the focus. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm1-05182023043606.html/@@images/image"></a>Reuters information. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm1-05182023043606.html/@@stream"></a>China's A -share transaction volume has shrunk to 900 billion yuan. Whether A shares have fallen into a bear market have become the focus of market attention. Another data that is positively related to the transaction amount is a stamp of securities transactions. From January to April this year, it fell more than 40 % year -on -year. In addition, the offshore RMB's exchange rate on the US dollar fell below the "Seven" mark on May 17, the first time this year.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt2-05172023073438.html"></a> </em>*  * </strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm2-02032023082721.html"> </a>***<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/bx2-01062023103250.html">After the epidemic in the epidemic era, China Economic Difficulties International expectations are expected to be sluggish **</a>According to the news of China's "Economic Daily", "no need to pay attention to the stock market turnover" pointed out that after the transaction volume of Chinese A shares exceeded the trillion yuan in consecutive trading days, some investors eagerly look forward to the arrival of the bull market, but then immediately The market volume can suddenly change, and it has shrunk to about 900 billion yuan in succession, and some investors are worried that they will fall into a bear market.</p>
<p>The A -share market has always had the saying of "quantity", so it is regarded as the watershed of trillions of transactions as the watershed of bulls and bears as an important or even basis for judging the trend of A shares. The report said that under the structural market, some hot spots receded, and short -term funds were fulfilled. "Once a new hotspot stands out, it will attract a lot of funds to return to the venue and return to the trillion yuan transaction amount again."</p>
<p>On the other hand, according to the Financial Association, the Ministry of Finance of China showed that the stamp duty revenue from January to April was 163.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 14.2%. Among them, securities transactions were 71.6 billion yuan, a year -on -year decrease of 42.7%. Market traditional cognition, securities transaction stamp duty is closely related to transaction amounts.</p>
<p>Huang Chongzhe, Dean of the Taiwan Financial Research Institute, said in an interview with this station that Chinese leader Xi Jinping went to Xiong'an New District to inspect a few days ago. At present, the Chinese economic leadership team is unknown, and it cannot be seen that it is led by Xi Jinping or Li Qiang. For more than half a year, no matter whether it is a digital economy, retreating forests and other policies, no new economic prospects can be seen.</p>
<p>Huang Chongzhe believes that the Chinese economy is still in the falling stage and still cannot see the stop. "China's prices or labor prices, foreign capitals will run away if they find it inaccurate. The manufacturing industry will not be improved. After the unblocking, the retail industry cannot get up. You don't know how deep the swimming pool is very scary. It's not that it hasn't rebounded, it's the process of not seeing it, and it is still declining. "</p>
<p>"I think the mainland's stock market will follow its economic growth this year." Zhu Chengzhi, chairman of Wanbao Investment Counseling, made the above interpretation of the station.</p>
<p>Zhu Chengzhi analyzed that the Chinese People's Bank of China had a preparation rate for the two deposits in November and January this year, released a large amount of funds, and stocks and economic activities would rise, and rising will definitely be pulled back to sort out. "There are a lot of trading volume, and a slight impact of 10 % off a little bit, has not changed the trend of the entire bulls."</p>
<p><strong> RMB against the US dollar has fallen below the "7" mark for the first time this year </strong></p>
<p>Another topic that China's financial market has recently been hotly discussed is that "both onshore and offshore RMB to the US dollar exchange rate have doubled '7'." On the morning of May 17, the exchange rate of offshore RMB to the US dollar fell below the "7" mark, the first time this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T04-36-00-04-00/000001.png" />The exchange rate of offshore RMB to the US dollar fell below the "7" mark on the 17th, the first time this year.

Although China's export data is still stronger than expected, the willingness of exporters to settle foreign exchange is low, resulting in the disconnection of the RMB trend.</p>
<p>"The main reason for the recent depreciation of the exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar is the slowdown in the return of the domestic economic recovery, the effective demand is still insufficient, and the market has expected interest rate cuts." With the gradual recovery of residents' cross -border tourism, the service trade deficit rebound, the trade surplus of goods has narrowed due to weakening the external needs, and the exchange rate will also cause phased pressure.</p>
<p>"The spread of the United States has appeared, and its economic and trade performance is directly reflected." Huang Chongzhe said.</p>
<p>Huang Chongzhe further analyzed that the central bank of China was putting water on the currency surface, but in the substantive economy, the past three -driving troiders include sluggish exports and government expenditure infrastructure due to financial difficulties. To the balance point. At this time, the currency was loose and the release of funds to the market, but it was impossible to create employment or creative demand. What I saw was the reduction of residential liabilities, so some people said that (like) Japan's (shrinking) situation occurred early.</p>
<p>"Economic Observation Network" mentioned that Lu Ting, Chief Economist of Nomura Securities, analyzed at the Chief Economist Forum of Tsinghua Wudaokou in early May that in the second half of this year, the pressure resistance faced by China's economic recovery was still not small. In addition, from the perspective of short -term macro policies, although there may be no need to add loose stimulation, it is not yet time to withdraw from the loose policy, but it is also necessary to carefully care for the results of the current recovery.</p>

<p>Description: With the opening of the Seventh -way Group Summit in Japan, leaders of various countries are trying to find a common method to deal with the challenges brought by China. Some experts believe that the G7 can reach consensus on economic security, but in the face of China's increasing military threat, whether the G7 can have a coordinated response, some experts have skeptical attitudes.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) On Friday (May 19), the Leaders of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) will gather in Hiroshima, Japan to hold a three -day annual summit. I hope to form a united front to deal with the increasing challenges brought by China.</p>
<p>Anonymous U.S. officials have recently told Reuters that in response to the objects of assisting Russia and weakening Western sanctions, the G7 countries will reach unanimous opinions to launch potential new measures. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美官員g7成員將團結一致應對中國/a-65632187"></a>This will also be included in the joint statement.</p>
<p>In addition, the G7 will also launch another written proposal, which will mention tools that G7 countries use to fight against coercion, no matter which country from the coercion. Face <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美財長g7將聯手反制中國經濟脅迫/a-65597554"></a>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said on Monday (15th) that the G7 should ask the United States to "stop split the world into two major markets," and said that "this is the primary threat facing the current world economy."</p>
<p>U.S. officials told Reuters that anti -Chinese economic coercion was for "risk" rather than "decoupling" with the Chinese economy. However, some experts believe that the intention behind these discussions is to promote the consent of the United States allies to follow the United States, that is, connect China's political system with economic security.</p>
<p>Song Wenyi, a Chinese research expert at the National University of Australia, said: "The United States will not force allies to make a thorough binary choice between China and the United States, which makes them feel assured."</p>
<p>Song Wendi told DW that using "de -risk" to create unity may also make China feel at ease, because this can avoid the situation similar to the Cold War, and at the same time leave space to Beijing, which can launch "divide and rule" some democratic countries can "divide and rule". Strategy. He said: "Risk -going strategies also rest assured that (the United States) allies and China."</p>
<p>During the Treasurer Conference held in Niigata, Japan last week, countries focused on <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7财长谈供应链多样化-未如预期提中国/a-65612383"></a>However, in terms of foreign investment restricted by China, some countries do not agree so much. German and French officials have emphasized that G7 is not a "anti -China Alliance"; the Chinese government has always had such criticisms on G7.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T06-34-00Z/65612465_401.jpg" />On the 12th, the G7 Finance Minister and the central bank meeting were held in Niigata, Japan.</p>
<h3>Emphasizing "order -based order"</h3>
<p>The anti -Chinese economic coercion will be the main focus of G7, but countries will also discuss China's aggressive military activities around Taiwan and the South China Sea. Different from the unanimous stance on economic security issues, some experts believe that the G7 is unlikely to propose any specific measures to fight against China ’s increasing ambitions in the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p>Robertward, the director of the Geographic Economy and Strategic Project of the Institute of International Strategy (IISS), said: "I guess that G7 countries will not want to fight against China positively, because they can only deal with several fronts, and the Ukraine issue will be quite the main major. of."</p>
<p>Song Wendi, an expert at the National University of Australia, added that the joint statement of the G7 may be included in values -based sentences, emphasizing that they are concerned about the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, and reiterating to maintain the rules -based global order.</p>
<p>Song Wendi said to DW: "I don't expect the G7 joint statement to state strongly on the safe face, but I think they will continue to use value -oriented statements, showing the stable support for Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The core element of freedom of navigation at sea. "</p>
<p>At the G7 Foreign Minister's meeting last month, a member country <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7外长向中俄发出明确信号/a-65357733"></a>And emphasize the importance of peace and stability in Taiwan. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to the bulletin as an interference with China's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Although China has continued to set Taiwan as a domestic issue, Scholars of the Institute of International Strategy, Ward, said that Japan is actively positioning Taiwan as an international issue that everyone needs to pay attention to. He told DW: "(Japan believes) everyone needs to participate in maintenance (both sides of the Taiwan Strait) stability."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T06-34-00Z/65270974_401.jpg" />On April 9, a photo of the Japanese Defense Provincial Provincial Provincial Provincial province showed that the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong took off and land in the southern waters of Okinawa.</p>
<h3>Coperly play a role in the China Challenge Group Meeting</h3>
<p>In addition to the G7 member states, this year's Hiroshima Summit is characterized by the attendance of several non -G7 countries, including Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, Brazil, and African Union President Guomoro, and the Pacific Island Forum Chairman of the Kuku Islands. These observer will attend a foreign meeting and will also participate in bilateral or three -sided talks on the side of the summit.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the group meeting is to persuade these countries to follow up other democratic partners and oppose Russia's war against Ukraine. However, scholar Ward, a scholar at the Institute of International Strategy, told DW, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/防备中国-拜登将与巴布亚新几内亚签署防卫合作协议/a-65577668"></a>Essence He said: "There will be many group meetings at that time, overall <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國的鄰國如何看待北京的軍事計劃/a-64928148"></a>, Especially in territorial disputes in Taiwan and Nanhai. "</p>
<p>Japan hopes to adopt a tolerance method to organize this year's G7 summit, and it is also expanding the late Japanese Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/安倍晉三遇刺任內修補對華關係-卸任後高調挺台/a-62403894"></a>,emphasize <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本2023年展望-鞏固自由陣營關係與強化防衛/a-64304324"></a>Essence</p>
<p>"This is the continuation of Abe's 3rd term during the second term. It is necessary to ensure that Japan forms a network in this region and surpass the traditional US -Japan security relationship." For example, Ward said: "For example, we will see that Japan and South Korea may might be likely Further relax the relationship. They are all allies in the United States, and Japan, South Korea, and the United States coordinate the security of East Asia, which is in line with the interests of everyone. "</p>

<p>Description: The Kuomintang has determined that the current mayor of New Taipei City, Hou Youyi, is a candidate for the party's 2024 Taiwan presidential election. Guo Taiming, the founder of Hon Hai Group, who had previously nominated Hon Hai Group, also said that he would support it, but it also emerged from the sound of the Party Central Committee. What impact does this have on the Kuomintang election?</p>

There are also Kuomintang Chairman Zhu Lilun (second from left), Taipei Mayor Jiang Wanan (first from left), and Taoyuan Mayor Zhang Shanzheng (first from the right).</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Kuomintang Chairman Zhu Lilun announced at the Middle School held by the party department that when Hou Youyi was on behalf of the party, the party building was <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座評論台灣政治人物的必要技能/a-65584045"></a>The supporters shouted to the slogan to express their dissatisfaction with the Party Central Committee and their attitude of "not Guo." The "heavyweight" party members announced the party to escape the party for this, so that an occasion that should have been showing a big solidarity was covered with a shadow.</p>
<p>And said it was a big solidarity, but the scene was less "contrast" <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欲角逐台灣總統-郭台銘勿讓民進黨執政/a-65234414"></a>Although Guo Taiming is not a member of the Kuomintang party, nor is it the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, so according to Guo Taiming's statement, "there is no invitation." The reason seems reasonable, but it seems unreasonable. Shooting Zhu Lilun and Hou Youyi held up and shook the slogan. Why did not invite Guo Taiming to the scene? The three of them co -produced together? Moreover, it was not a closed -door meeting at the time. This treatment was not just "how to love" Guo Taiming, who had been looking down to the Kuomintang in the past few months. In contrast, Guo Taiming posted an article "My Hearts <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座評論中華民國的世說新語/a-65487601"></a>》的長文，承諾會全力支持國民黨候選人之外還恭賀侯友宜，看在「擁郭派」的「郭粉」眼中何止是心有戚戚焉、可能更多的是不捨和不甘。</p>
<p>國民黨拿出了民調對比、黨籍縣市長是否支持、黨籍立委是否支持等等的數據，向外界解釋爲何是侯友宜出缐，不過顯然無法説服部分所謂的「擁郭派」，朱立倫的臉書專頁上3千多則留言，大半都是指責國民黨並且宣稱將轉向支持其他政黨，或許這些不滿的人不是國民黨黨員，但是起碼他們都自稱曾經是該黨的支持者，這些人的不滿情緒可能也不是單靠國民黨就能夠安撫下來的，何況朱立倫甚至都已經被他們形容是「民進黨的臥底」。</p>
<p>但是國民黨大概也很難開口請郭台銘來幫忙「拆彈」，畢竟人稱「霸氣總裁」的郭台銘在2020年還有這次對國民黨客氣的程度都到了「低聲下氣」的地步。媒體形容，郭台銘對國民黨是「真心換絕情」，忍氣吞聲之外還要幫忙安撫「郭粉」的話，困難程度勢必不低，即便坐轎子的人想要下來，多少也得看擡轎子的人肯不肯。如果講要所謂的整合，主要責任似乎不是在郭台銘、更多是看國民黨接下來如何做，做的不好可能會有嚴重的後果。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T07-44-00Z/63903855_401.jpg" />The Kuomintang Chairman Zhu Lilun has the title of "political actuary" in Taiwan. This time, whether the layout of the 2024 presidential election he led this time has the opportunity to let the Kuomintang compete for governing power.</p>
<h3>"Change Incident" will repeat it?</h3>
<p>However, there is also a hint of "Guo Fan", thinking that the Kuomintang is "nothing impossible", and moved out of the 2016 presidential candidate from <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/專訪洪秀柱與對台二把手汪洋談了什麼/a-61060170"></a>Change to Zhu Lilun's "post -pillar change incident", pointing out that the year can be, so there is nothing now; in the minds of "Guo Fan", Hou Youyi and Guo Taiming have the difference between heaven and earth. However, the Kuomintang did not give Guo Taiming to prove his ability for any opportunity for "a bunch of reasons". Describing that he is "unprecedented self -run cannon", and Guo Taiming's "most of the net worth in the mainland" worried that it would become a burden during the election, so the opinions of the two factions in the party were quite fierce.</p>
<p>But what puzzled the outside world was why Zhu Lilun "recognized" after the night meeting of Zhu Lilun before the night meeting Guo Taiming? What kind of persuasion of Zhu Lilun to persuade Guo Taiming "Mingjin to close"? But Guo Taiming had swallowed this bite and was described as "bird gas". Isn't it difficult to come back in the back? On the other hand, don't the Kuomintang not worry about Guo Taiming's follow -up leading "Guo Fan" to start his own way and find other political parties to join forces? Wouldn't this give the "non -green party" like the people of the people to split the Kuomintang? Or is the Kuomintang certain that Guo Taiming will not do this?</p>
<p>Throughout the reports and analysis of various media, there is also a view of private exchanges and expressions in politicians. Guo Taiming does not seem to ask the world without asking the world. This "key minority" is the first challenge of the Kuomintang's future integration. For party chairman Zhu Lilun, nominated candidate Hou Youyi, and the entire Kuomintang, the dissatisfaction caused by this nomination can definitely be said to be the first priority, but in the past When the Party Central Committee is not trusted and nominated, how to achieve this goal is not just the wisdom and political wrist of the Kuomintang's senior management.</p>

<p>UN Secretary -General Gutres welcomes another two months of extension of the Agricultural Products Foreign Transportation Agreement of Heihai Port.</p>
<p>Gutres said on a press conference at the United Nations headquarters of New York on Wednesday (May 17), "We have some positive and important development development." It's good news.</p>
<p>Gutres said the agreement and the Memorandum of understanding of Russia and the United Nations at the same time on facilitating Russia's grain and fertilizer exports are essential to global food security. According to the agreement, more than 30 million tons of grain was exported. Some key food supply has been delivered to the most vulnerable areas and people in the world, of which 30,000 tons of wheat are shipped to Sudan by ships leased by the World Grain Planning Administration.</p>
<p>Gutres said that there are still affordments about this agreement, and representatives of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations will continue to discuss. He hopes that all parties will reach a comprehensive agreement on the extension, expansion and improvement of the agreement. Earlier, he had sent a letter to the president of Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey to make suggestions on this issue.</p>
<p>On July 22 last year, under the leadership of the United Nations, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations jointly signed the Black Sea Port Agricultural Products Foreign Transport Agreement with an agreement of 120 days. The agreement extended for 120 days in November last year. <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230315-1372600"></a>At that time, Russia emphasized that its food and fertilizer exports were still blocked, and only agreed to extend the agreement for 60 days. After the renewal, the agreement will be extended to July 18.</p>

<p>However, the military has not confirmed to find the four missing children.</p>
<p>The authorities dispatched more than 100 soldiers and sniff dogs to find minor victims who fell on the day; the accident caused three adults including pilots and children, including pilots and children.</p>

<p>Pei Zhuo provided more information about where they were rescued or how to survive in the jungle alone.</p>
<p>The armed forces said earlier that after the rescue personnel found that "the temporary asylum built with wooden strips and branches", I believe that there are still victims survived, so they strengthened their search operations.</p>
<p>According to the photos released by the military, you can see the branches of scissors, shoes and hair bands falling on the branches on the jungle ground.</p>
<p>Before the temporary asylum built with jungle vegetation, search and rescue personnel found a baby bottle and half of the fruits.</p>
<p>This small plane equipped with a 7 -person was originally scheduled to fly to San Jose Delguaviare, one of the main cities of the Rain Forest of Colombian Amazon, but crashed unfortunately on the way. The pilots and two adult remains, one of them is 4 mothers of surviving children. (Translator: Liu Wenyu/Calculating Draft: Chen Zhengyi)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T09-00-00-04-00/000000.png" />At the ritual of Dallanara on March 8, the tenth -year -old Tenzoba Zun Danba gave a confession to the Dalai Lama. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023141126.html/@@images/image"></a>The picture is taken from VOT</p>
<p>Me: India is indeed a very complicated country, multi -nation and religion. You say that Indian strategic people do not want the Himalaya to spread Buddhism, but this world is not only military is power, and economy is power, no. If you have a gun, you have the greatest power, or if you have money, you have the greatest power, not necessarily. From the perspective of human history, religion is a greater power related to the spirit of human beings and human souls. It is born in life, can compete with weapons, and can compete with money. The power of faith is intangible and cannot be estimated. Otherwise, how many countries in the world are replaced, politicians rotate, what about guns, what about money? Religious beliefs have always existed, Buddhism has been for thousands of years, and Christian Islam has also been.</p>
<p>In addition, I also thought that it should be a very important ritual in Dallanasala during the March. At the ritual, the key rituals were also specially authorized. In fact, in the hearts of Mongolian believers, Garva Rinpoche is also important in the hearts of Mongolian believers such as Bridge, Tuwa, Carmec and other Mongolian regions. So is the incident of stigma, what response does this incident have? But we don't know yet. The relationship between Britt's regions and totalitarian countries such as Russia is destined to be sensitive areas, and now they are in the Russian and Ukraine War. Many people are killed on the battlefield and are considered by Putin's cleaning of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Friends: I know more about Mongolian countries and Mongolians. It is also more complicated and related to history. They were influenced by communist thought. After all, it has been ruled by Communist Soviet for more than 70 years, and the two generations have not been educated by Buddhist culture. But they also have historical memories. Buddhist culture is very important for them. Basically, there are three kinds of people in Mongolia. One believes that Mongolia does not need Buddhism. Mongolia has only Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan decides everything. Some people think that we are Buddhists, but we are Mongolians, so we are Mongolian Buddhists, not Tibetan Buddhists. The Mongolians have little impact on Tibetan Buddhists. Of course, some people believe in other religions.</p>
<p>The Mongolians are distributed in two countries, part of them in Russia, and partly in Mongolia. Because of the relationship with China, from economic and political considerations, many words do not say, unwilling to say. Moreover, because there is no Buddhism in seven or eighty years, although it is slowly there now, many people are still confused and cannot find their own path. If you communicate with Mongolian scholars, you can know that they have a sense of insecurity. They don't know where to go? Therefore, Mongolia does not respond to the incident of the His Holiness, which is understandable.</p>
<p>The question is not whether Mongolia should respond, or will it go to the streets. The problem is something else. As I said earlier, first of all, from a person's perspective, there is nothing wrong with the Dalai Lama. This is the fact that this is now recognized by the world. Whether it is a religious person or a scholar, such as a psychologist anthropologist, etc., the Dalai Lama has not made mistakes. Of course, some people think he is wrong, which has become a challenging issue. A person does not make mistakes, but is considered to make mistakes, so how to solve this problem? This has become a big problem. For believers, including Tibetans and the Himalayas, the Dalai Lama was originally a lama, a high -level lama, but now it has become another level of lama, a living bodhisattva. Existing divinity.</p>
<p>Some of the choices in India have two ideas: one believes that Buddhism in the Himalayas, or Tibetan Buddhism may be more conducive to India's control, so they will establish a lot of connections between the Indian government and the Dalai Lama. There is also a Tibetan Buddhism in the Himalayan region, and even further, that is, the Dalai Lamaization of the Himalayan region, so that there is uncertainty. In other words, India is not sure if the Dalai Lama is a problem one day, what will happen to the Himalayan area? Therefore, some people think that Himalayan can Tibetan Buddhism, but Himalayan should not be Dalai Lama. In the past, in the Tibetan community in exile, the exile Tibetans in the school and the temple were clearly divided into people in the Himalayas. We are Tibetans and you are from the Himalayas. There are fewer and fewer students and monks from Tibet. On the other hand, more and more people from the Himalayas are, and the education systems of schools and temples are all Tibetan culture and Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore It is inevitable to stimulate such a big response in the Himalayas. This is obviously wrong.</p>
<p>Not to mention China. Chinese decision makers are all Han. They want to use this to attack the Dalai Lama, which is completely wrong. I think the Chinese government has made a big mistake. They do not understand the influence of religion and the power of faith. They are just very rude, very simple, to handle this matter in a way of self -righteousness.</p>
<p>The Westerners' understanding of the Dalai Lama has not been as much as before, but I just heard of the name of the Dalai Lama. I have observed many Western websites and a website of more than 100,000 people related to Tibetan Buddhism. After this incident, they said that I saw the Dalai Lama more than ten years ago more than 20 years ago. , But I have forgotten it slowly, so another motivation has appeared. They want to know who the Dalai Lama is and what his thoughts are? As they understand, they realize that he is innocent, but they will support the Dalai Lama. If the Dalai Lama has made a mistake before and now makes a second mistake, it will be considered by Westerners. But the Dalai Lama is not wrong. If you do n’t accept it, it is not the problem of the Dalai Lama, but the problem of those people. Of course, many young people do not understand. They are easily affected by the publicity of the Internet, but they will soon be attracted by new hotspots.</p>
<p>Me: From April 20th to 21st, the first Global Buddhist Summit was held in Delhi. His Holiness took a plane on the 19th. On the same day, Dallanasara dropped the heavy rain. Early in the morning, he took a car to the airport before he was loud. Many people sent Hada to the rain. On the 20th, His Holiness took a day off at the hotel. Yesterday I attended the conference and made a speech. I returned to Dallanasara today, this time is very tight. From the Internet, I saw that Garva Rinpoche returned to Lan Sara from Delhi. Numerous Tibetans lined up and welcomed them, singing and dancing, and the scene was touching. It is a home, a holy place. And this is of course because of His Holiness.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T09-00-00-04-00/000002.png" />On April 20, His Holiness Dalai Lama presented the statue of the Buddha to the Supreme Fa of the Karga Karju. (The picture is taken from Facebook) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023141126.html/66708rfa535a5ba22-003.jpeg"></a>His Holiness met a lot of people on the day of the rest of Delhi. I noticed that there are about five photos seen from the Internet. The first group is to meet with the Supreme French king of Naigong Kaga. After leaving Lhasa, the earliest in the Radakh Customs Repair France for many years. Many temples in Radakhs are the temples of Naigong Kagawa. He has a very high prestige in Radakh. Radak's influence will be great.</p>
<p>The second group of photos was a meeting with a minister of Sikkim. He looked like a Tibetan and was also very devout. And where is Sikkim? It is a country that has been annexed by India and is now a region in India. Like Radakh, it is actually the Himalayan region of Tibetan Buddhist belief. The third group of photos is the sister of the seventeenth Karmapa. Because Karmapa's temple Rond Temple is in Sikkim, Karmapa specially published a public letter supporting the Dalai Lama. The fourth group was Ladakh officials to meet the His Holiness. He was very respectful. Like believers, he must be also a believer. There is also a group of photos of Arunecchal's head of Twitter. He has 260,000 fans. He brought the whole family to worship the respected, hoeed his head, and presented Hada. These groups of photos have deep meaning.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T09-00-00-04-00/000003.png" />On April 20, the chief chief of Arunachel and the family brought the family to the Lama Lama. (The picture is taken from Twitter) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023141126.html/66708rfa535a5ba22-004.jpeg"></a>The first Global Buddhist Summit held in Delhi is important. This importance makes me think it may be the incident of the stigma of the stigma and ferment at this time. Maybe it is related to this, because some people may want to make obstacles.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw the Global Buddhist Summit's speech at the Global Buddhist Summit. I believe many people are very happy. Obviously, although His Holiness is getting older and bigger, he is 88 years old, but his thinking is agile. The scriptures are a large -scale back, and tens of minutes of speeches do not need to read manuscripts at all. Without any degradation, his wisdom is very amazing. At the summit, it is also expected. There are so many monks and scholars in the Mahayana Vajrayana, and so many scholars. This scene is as beautiful as the Buddha recorded in the scriptures and many bodhisattvas. One of the words was impressed by me: "At first glance, as far as our current situation is concerned, it is indeed false and difficult to do. In terms of, the more violations, the higher the wisdom and experience value, the more you can get close to the way to become a Buddha. Therefore, French friends must strengthen the Bodhicitta and empty opinion. This is very important. This is very important. . When you know how to turn violations into Taoism, it is equivalent to removing all violations. "</p>
<p>Of course I still get angry when I think of it. This world similar to "others is hell" requires His Holiness Dalai Lama for all compassion and love for the older life of 88 years and the future. His dedication. On the other hand, when the world's dilemma almost forgotten the Tibetan people, His Holiness Dalai Lama re -blame the world to "see" Tobert in this way. At the same time, most of the Tibetan Tibetan Buddhists who belief in Tibetan Buddhism are condensed together. It is also like Buddhism often talks about the inverse edge into a smooth fate. The facts have proven that all karma has reversed. And the emergence of this incident may be very close to the future, so I agree with what you said, this is not a bad thing but a good thing.</p>
<p>Oh, we have talked for a long time, or that's it, it will be very long if I want to sort it.</p>
<p>Friend: Okay, see you, the weather is so good. (over)</p>

<p>_ "Reporter" interviewed a number of young and senior directors. Can this box office "Xiaoyangchun" last? How to find other ways outside the Chinese market? _ _ _ 吧 _</p>
<hr />
<p>Hong Kong in May has been hot, and the young director He Jue sweats all day, rushing to the Hong Kong theaters to thank the votes and interact with the audience. At the age of 36, he is one of the representatives of the new generation director in Hong Kong. He first launched his head in the box office of Hong Kong restricted films in one fell swoop in the box office record of Hong Kong. "Forty -four when the dead corpse and death", telling how to facing the price of houses in different generations to face the price of houses, is also a house, which is also Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Both of them are Hong Kong production films, and they are in Hong Kong at home. He Jue Tian tried to thank the tickets, hoping to attract more citizens to watch the show. On the most full day, he has to run more than a dozen games. He not only thanks his tickets for his own works, but also often runs next to the theater. Together with other young directors to publicize "Day Youth" and "Lights and Lights", such as "Difficulty Movie. This group of new generation of Hong Kong directors has cooperated together at the end of last year, because the names of the first movie are exactly four words, and they have been named the name of the "four -character director".</p>
<p>He Juetian told the "Reporter" that most of the former generations of directors in Hong Kong were born in red pants (Note: Red pants refer to the training of formal film schools, work on the set until the director of the director), and the new generation of "four -character director" Most of them are colleges; in the golden age of bidding farewell to China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong films, most of the young directors hope to stay in Hong Kong to make movies. Because of the growth background and receiving information, everyone wants to involve social themes. "In the past 10 years, we have experienced many incidents in Hong Kong, and have a stronger feeling for society," He Jue Tian said.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past, Hong Kong films have gone downhill since the 1990s. After the SARS epidemic in 2003, the SARS epidemic began to embrace the Chinese market. In the era of China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -co -production films, senior directors have developed northward. Films, police bandits, martial arts films, relaxed love comedy and so on. While repeated high box office in China, these movies have also triggered discussions on "Hong Kong movies are dead". Hong Kong production films have poor reputation, while co -production films have routines.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 years later, after a severe political turmoil, after three years of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hong Kong films unexpectedly ushered in a small Yangchun. On the occasion of the new generation of directors in turns, pure local works have also detonated the phenomenon -level box office -the first movie "Poisonous Tongue" of senior screenwriter Wu Weilun was released in the Spring Festival this year. The total box office of Hong Kong production films in the local theater.</p>

<p>Before having the opportunity to make a movie, Wu Weilun devoted himself to the China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong film industry for many years.</p>
<p>"I often embarrassed when I call myself" new director "," Wu Weilun said with a smile. In the film industry, he has worked for 20 years, and many Hong Kong box office blockbusters have his participation.</p>
<p>In the early millennium, he joined the team of director Lin Chaoxian, who was famous for action films and police bandits, started from the field. Later, he cooperated with Lin Chaoxian for a long time as a screenwriter. At this time, Hong Kong films have gone through the peak period, and again meet the SARS epidemic, scarred. Wu Weilun said that he did not work at the time, and ran to write TV series, and returned to Lin Chaoxian team a few years later.</p>
<p>At this time, Lin Chaoxian began to try the China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -co -production model. In 2003, the Chinese authorities signed the "Arrangement of the Mainland and Hong Kong on Establishing Closer Economic and Trade Relations" (CEPA). CEPA provides convenience for Hong Kong movies to enter the Chinese market. It stipulates China imported China is not restricted by quotas. Many Hong Kong filmmakers have ever embarked on the "China -Hong Kong Hong Kong co -production" model. Lin Chaoxian is the representative of it. Since then, he has paid more attention to China and has a huge production cost.</p>
<p>At that time, a large number of senior directors in Hong Kong were cast in China and Hong Kong, under the pressure of funds or box office, and Hong Kong production became less and the box office was bleak. Looking back on data, the Chinese market brings far more than Hong Kong films that far exceed the local market of Hong Kong. Cooperating with the subject matter and review of China has become a necessary evil for Hong Kong film issuers.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-00-00-04-00/000002.png" />Hong Kong films have embraced China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong co -production model for many years.

<p>Chinese movies have always been reviewed, including the proposal before the start of the shooting and the dragon label (movie screening permit) before the release. The relevant affairs have previously returned to the State Administration of Radio and Television directly under the State Council of the State Council of China. By March 2018, China officially announced that it would be unified management of the film work by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee (referred to as the Central Propaganda Department). One month later, the "National Film Bureau" was established under the Central Propaganda Department to independently control the film's control to other broadcast media. Since then China has become more stringent for film censorship.</p>
<p>The Film Bureau has the final decision to shoot, release, release, scheduled films of each film, and even the content and actors. The National Film Bureau released the "Fourteenth Five -Year Plan" China Film Development Plan in 2021. It planned private enterprises to participate in the production and development goals of the main themes from top to bottom to completely change the ecology of the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>There are rarely reported by the Chinese media about these review logic and sliced information, and people can only see according to some films that cannot be released. The small -cost movie "Hidden Dust Smoke" released in 2022 was suddenly withdrawn after reaching the 100 million box office. For the premiere of the overseas film festival and the subsequent shown in China, the review has become strict. In 2022, the director Tian Zhuangzhuang revealed that the new work "Bird Ming" was sent as early as 2020, but there was no audio for two years: In response to this, some Chinese online media have sorted out 2019. Failure to be released, including well -known directors such as Zhang Yimou and Zhou Xingchi. Jia Zhangke, the director of the National People's Congress of China, said last year that Chinese filmmakers felt "unsatisfactory" about the current film environment and called for "to give all the movies an equal and certain environment."</p>
<p>"Emperor Film" is also a big player in China and Hong Kong. The helm of Yang Shoucheng recently revealed to the Hong Kong media that the "Detective War" released in China in 2022 was personally seen by Yang himself and director Wei Jiahui. The interpretation of the script this time should be required to modify the script and the film to be accepted to the end of the game to be released smoothly.</p>
<p>Li Zhaoxing, a Hong Kong film critic in Changju China, analyzed the "Reporter" that "Detective War" is a issue that Hong Kong films have often filmed in the past. This time, it is difficult to encounter difficulties in censorship. Domestic films are also tightened. However, such censorship has always been proven that the scale of censorship can only be passed on to the ears between the producers.</p>
<h3><strong> The opening miracle of Hong Kong production films: "Poisonous Tongue" set a Hong Kong box office record </strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the tightening of the red line, the COVID-19 epidemic became the last straw that overwhelmed the filming. China ’s 3 -year -old zero -anti -epidemic model makes it difficult for theater to open and operate.</p>

<p>For the market positioning of the film, Wu Weilun knew nothing at the time, and only knew that he would not make a co -production film this time.</p>
<p>When writing the script of "Poisonous Tongue", Wu Weilun said that he did not consider balanced the Chinese market. He hopes to write a story to let the audience understand "the importance of conscience": "The audience's viewing court films all have the same mind that hopes to see the victory of justice and evil." This movie is invited to come. Hong Kong talk show (Hong Kong is called "Dong Du Xiao") Huang Zihua, the great god, is the leading actor, and other actors are mostly new actors in Hong Kong. When the editorial ended, Jiang Zhiqiang told him that the film should be released in Hong Kong in the Spring Festival, striving to be called the first New Year movie in Hong Kong in the past three years, and then entered the Chinese market in a "introducing film" way.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-00-00-04-00/000005.png" />"Poisonous Tongue" is the first work of director Wu Weilun, but he is not a newcomer. Previously, he had been working in the film industry for 20 years and started from the field. He has been engaged in screenwriter for a long time. (Photography / Chen Langzhang) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-05162023091850.html/4.jpg"></a>After the movie was released, Huang Zihua asked the player to invite the entire crew. "Zi Hua guess 55 million Hong Kong dollars (about NT $ 210 million) that night," Wu Weilun recalled that night, "I am more bold than him: 58 million."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, "Poisonous Tongue", which talked about Hong Kong's judicial stories, became the highest local box office Hong Kong film in Hong Kong history. It was then introduced to China. , Taiwan, Britain, Canada and other places were released.</p>
<p>In order to enter the Chinese market, "Poisonous Tongue" has only made a change, re -dubbed Huang Zihua's lines "In the face of the law, the poor with twist" and changed to "the poor". (Note: "Poor people with twisted" are Cantonese, similar to "poor people eat shit", "twist" is a swear words, male genitals; "poor people" means "poor people must die")</p>
<p>The success of "Poisonous Tongue" has created a new direction for Hong Kong films. Tan Yinuo, assistant professor and film critic of Lingnan University in Hong Kong, analyzed that in recent years, China has been wary of the introduction of Hollywood movies, and the number of imported western films has decreased. At this time, Hong Kong films fill the vacancies by introducing imports and enter the Chinese market. Tan Yinuo pointed out that compared with China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong films, the benefits of introducing films are that they do not have to face the review of the film bureau in the process of establishing, production and publicity, and at the same time, they can harvest the box office in Hong Kong. In addition to "Poisonous Tongue", in 2022, the Hong Kong comedy movie "Fan Tie Entering the Heart" also entered the Chinese market with the introduction of films. It was renamed "still think you best" and harvested 100 million yuan box office.</p>
<h3><strong> Director of the North Hong Kong Director New Treatment: Regaining small cost production, "Lao Shi Shou" and the new generation of Qi Qi </strong>However, the fate of China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong co -production is compared to the following.</h3>
<p>Hong Kong senior director Zheng Baorui has been developing for many years, and it feels that the production model of China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong co -production films has reached the bottleneck. In the early spring of this year, he kept a horse in Hong Kong and promoted the new Hong Kong local "Murder Case" he directed. "It's not just that we are tired of shooting. In fact, the (China) mainland audience has seen dullness," Zheng Baorui said that in order to pursue stable box office figures, Chinese film investors have become more conservative and safe in recent years. Action films and types, "It's not that Hong Kong people can't think of new things, but because you go to the (China) mainland market, the investors in that class don't want you to have new things."</p>
<p>Zheng Baorui entered the industry in the 1990s. Starting from the production assistant, the film style is violent, direct and blood as the mark. He has directed works such as "Dog Bite Dog", "Accident", "Robot" and other works. In 2012, he went north to China and made 3 high -cost "Journey to the West" in a row, which won nearly 3 billion yuan box office. Looking back at the choice 10 years ago, Zheng Baorui said that he had a clear goal at the time.</p>
<p>"I just measure it like this. If the movie is my career, it is not just interest, then contact with a blockbuster is a step that I need to take, just that the film is called" Journey to the West "." The ideal work sometimes makes some "transactions".</p>
<p>In 2017, Zheng Baorui directed his personal style "Wisdom tooth" and filmed a serial murder with a unique Hong Kong old community landscape. However, this Chinese -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -co -production film did not obtain a dragon label in China. Zheng Baorui revealed that after the film, they waited for one or two years, and finally gave up. They were only briefly released in Hong Kong in 2021, and then launched the streaming platform.</p>
<p>"After" Wisdom tooth ", I think there are still many things in Hong Kong worth shooting." Zheng Baorui's new work "Murder Case" returned to Hong Kong's local small cost production. The investment of 7 million Hong Kong dollars was closely linked to Feng Shui, numerology and blood cases. The personal style was strong. He knew that because of the monster theme, he could not be released in China, and it was difficult for the box office to reach billions of levels.</p>
<p>"Actually, Hong Kong people are good Flexible, and the changes can be great. I grow up here. I have grown in this movie circle. I have shot a very bad three -level film (restricted movie). It is a good thing to do a small film. It is good to give you a chance to explore. It is better than sitting at home all day long. I am the kind of person who likes to go out, "Zheng Baorui told the reporter.</p>
<p>In the interview with the Hong Kong media by the producer and screenwriter of the "Murder Case", he believes that he believes that the "Xiaoyangchun" that resumes the vibrant of Hong Kong films is mainly dominated by the emotional leadership of local audiences in Hong Kong. With this momentum, more filmmakers have made better works. "</p>
<p>Zheng Baorui said that according to his years of experience, the second work of the new director is more critical than the first one: "The new director is the first movie, and the filmmakers in different positions will of course be the assistance of the city. The inner station is steady, in fact, depending on the "second part": Without government funds, can they find investors with their own abilities? "</p>
<p>He believes that Hong Kong movies are in Xiaoyangchun or truly ushered in spring and summer. The key is the work of every filmmaker: "New director, our" old shit "(Cantonese, derogatory name for elders). Whether we have the ability to make a movie that can continue to let the audience enter the venue. "</p>

<p>"We have been out in the pattern of (China and Hong Kong)." After graduating from the Television and Film Academy of the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts in 2012, He Jue Tian also participated in the production of China -Hong Kong co -production films, but now it has changed. I have learned from Hong Kong filmmakers. "</p>
<p>It is not easy to return to the homeland.</p>
<p>He Jue Tian said that pure local production is difficult to have big investments, so everyone rarely involves action movies, but returns to the story and the plot itself. In addition to He Jue Tian, "Four Character Director" also includes Lin Sen ("Narrow Road Dust"), Jia Shengfeng ("Flowing Water Falling Flowers"), Liu Guorui ("Day Youth"), Zeng Xianning ("Light"), Zeng Qinghong ( "Over time."). These works attempts to bring the audience to Hong Kong on the edge, showing the human nature and experience of grassroots characters.</p>

Speaking of the status quo of Hong Kong movies, she is fast -moving, and bluntly said that Hong Kong movies have long been burned by a fire: "When our entire house has been burned, there is no, we have to admit that we have nothing left. restart."</p>
<p>After graduating from the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, Wen Peiqing started from the screenwriter, and later joined the Hong Kong branch of the Singapore Film "MM2NERTAINMENT" as a producer. She presided over the "New Directors Plan" and held two sessions so far. A total of 6 directors received a total of 6 directors. Two opportunities to shoot the plot, and plan to launch two long films such as "turbid water rafting" and "narrow road".</p>
<p>Wen Peiqing said that he is also a newcomer and cooperates with the new director. Everyone is willing to do things in the new model. The actors and the entire team are selected after interviews and auditions. They are no longer pre -arranged by investors or directors. For example, the "New Director Program" winning proposal and "Narrow Dust" directed by Lin Sen, when the heroine was selected, he made a audition again and again. After seeing more than 20 girls, he finally chose the heroine.</p>
<p>In Wen Peiqing's view, the most important thing for the Hong Kong film industry is "Don't be obsessed with the glory of the past", and don't sing well for the recent Xiaoyangchun.### <strong> The Chinese market is uncertain and the foreign market is difficult to sell. Where is Hong Kong movies? </strong></p>
<p>During the golden period of 1980s and 1990s, Hong Kong films produced more than 100 per year, and fell all the way in the late 1990s. So far, there are only 40 to 60 units each year, including co -production films and Hong Kong production films. Although the box office of some movies has risen in the past year, the overall output is still sluggish. The data in 2022 has not been announced.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-00-00-04-00/000009.png" />Hong Kong Film farewell to the peak in the 1990s, the box office and output fell / reporters <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-05162023091850.html/7c219ad43-99996e2f96fb5f71905e744ee34e2d544a52259ad85cf06642671f-7968623f548c752291cf57474e0b8dcc-58315c0e8005.png"></a>During the peak of Hong Kong films, the Chinese theater market was still not open. In addition to the local box office, Hong Kong films mainly depended on "selling ports" to profit, exported to Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. The producer also sells "film flowers" to overseas investors to attract investment with shooting plans, star lineups and trailers. Sometimes the movie has not finished shooting and has returned to the book.</p>
<p>To this day, if the road to China and Hong Kong is not taken, Hong Kong movies are not easy to return to the local market alone. In addition to production, there are also costs such as publicity and distribution. "10 million filmed. If there are 20 million box office, I still have to lose money. If you don't think about other markets, you can't afford the film industry at all," Zheng Baorui said. Essence</p>
<p>"Of course, the co -production film can continue, but in addition to Hong Kong and mainland China, are there any other markets?" Zheng Baorui said that in the past ten years, Hong Kong filmmakers have mainly relied on China and Hong Kong. Actively find "third legs".</p>
<p>This is exactly what Wen Peiqing wants to do. She judged too much uncertainty in the Chinese market, hoping to "bring Hong Kong works out of Hong Kong and face the entire Asia again." However, she admits that the road ahead of the road is bumpy, "Hong Kong movies can no longer go out of the world as high as ever, let Xingma Hantai look up, not like this, we are just going out now (nothing)!" Wen Peiqing bluntly said that Essence</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-00-00-04-00/000010.png" />Producer Wen Peiqing said that Hong Kong films are not as good as in the past, and it is "nothing" to go to overseas markets now. She hopes to bring Hong Kong's works out of Hong Kong and face the whole of Asia again. (Photography / Chen Langzhang) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-05162023091850.html/8.jpg"></a>Wen Peiqing has been engaged in overseas distribution for many years. It is clear that Hong Kong movies are now difficult to go to sea. For example, "Fan Shi Step in the Heart", such as "Fan Tie Shin", such as "Fan Shi", such as "Fan Shi", such as "Fan Shi", such as "Fan Shi" in Hong Kong, it was "miserable and deserted" like Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. She believes that this is because the vision of the Hong Kong film script is still not enough to connect overseas audiences: in Taiwan, Hong Kong films with good box office are often large and Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong co -produced blockbusters. Badness; in Southeast Asia, "investors still only have confidence in movies that are the types of action and the older generation of actors, because the local market will still pay attention to the elements of these millennial Hong Kong movies."</p>
<p>However, Wen Peiqing pointed out that with the discrete of Hong Kong people, in major cities in the United Kingdom, North America and Australia, some Hong Kong films are good at local box office: "The issuers of the three places (Britain, the United States, Canada, and Australia) are still watching it to receive receiving receiving receiving receiving. How much (box office), and they have just developed the business, but I just developed the business, but I think it is positive.</p>
<p>He Jue Tian believes that relying on foreign ports is not feasible for the time being. Taking the "Justice Corridor" as an example, only about NT $ 600,000 in Taiwan's box office, and only more than one million Hong Kong dollars in Britain and North America. He borrowed experiences such as "Fan Tie Entering the Heart" and "Poison Tongue", and believed that he first focused on the Hong Kong market, and then entered China by introducing films, or exploration, but do not move to create creation for China.</p>
<p>"If you have a mentality, you can introduce it. If you ca n’t introduce it, you do n’t need to accommodate some subject matter," He Jue Tian said.</p>
<h3><strong> Xiaoyangchun later see the true chapter: face the normal market again, take a good work a year </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-00-00-04-00/000011.png" />Many Hong Kong filmmakers feel that after the spring of 2023, it is the moment when Hong Kong films see the true chapters. (Photography / Chen Langzhang) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-05162023091850.html/9.jpg"></a></strong></p>
<p>Entering April this year, the phenomenon of Hong Kong production film -level box office began to be unsustainable.</p>
<p>Director He Juetian said that when Hong Kong cleared with international and China, citizens have revealed a lot of revenge and travel, and the cinema immediately deserted, and the number of local celebrities' support for the subcontracting also decreased significantly. The box office of his new film "Forty -four" is slower than expected; the box office of "Day Youth" and "Light" at the same time, the release of the Golden Horse Award after the Golden Horse Award, and the film of the Golden Horse Awards.</p>
<p>Many Hong Kong filmmakers feel that after the spring of 2023, it is the moment when Hong Kong films see the true chapters. In addition to letting the film face the normal market, it also depends on the quality, reputation and box office of the second and third works of the new generation of directors.</p>
<p>In a real -time chat group called "Four Characters Director", He Jue Tian, Lin Sen, Zeng Qinghong and other directors often chat. "We now have a feeling of a stove. Box office, "He Jue Tian said.</p>
<p>For Wen Peiqing, in any case, the big house in Hong Kong's film has been burned by the fire, but this also means that everyone can come from scratch, and at this moment, the change has begun. She was very happy to see the director of the new generation of generations in cooperation and benign competition.</p>
<p>Wen Peiqing is frank that at present, the Hong Kong film industry must creatively rely on different external forces. For example, it can be Hong Kong funds, Taiwan or Japanese directors, and foreign companies to make post -production. "We want to grow, we have to learn," she said. The most urgent task of Hong Kong films at present is to take as much as possible and grow more.</p>
<p>He Jue Tian sometimes enviouss that Hong Kong filmmakers can start several movies in the golden age. "It is already good to make a movie today a year." He Jue Tian said, thanking the theater in the busy theater, thanks to votes in the theater. In addition, while he took the advertisement, he conceived the next work.</p>

<p>One of the satellites of the European Union Space Program Copernicus mission, which regularly monitor the very strong greenhouse gas methane in the atmosphere. The resolution of this satellite scanning the entire earth is several kilometers, so it is difficult to accurately lock the exact sources. At this time, private companies come in handy.</p>
<p>The Canadian environmental monitoring company GHGSAT currently has 9 small satellites on the track, each with a large microwave oven. Their mission is to fly over the above of petroleum and natural gas facilities, and monitor whether methane is leaked. Through running on a low -height track, these satellites can check the status of each facility in detail.</p>
<p>GHGSAT founder Stephanegermain told AFP: "Think of satellites as a wide -angle lens camera instead of telephoto lens camera." Copernicus team often contacted GHGSAT and told Ghgsat where the camera lens was aimed at.</p>
<p>After GHGSAT, it sold its information to oil companies, such as Total Group, Chevron, EXXONMOBIL, and Shell Group.</p>
<p>"More and more companies are interested in this, because they realize that they must understand their carbon footprints more." Especially because their customers insist on more properly calculating the life cycle of carbon row.</p>
<p>GHGSAT estimates that it has prevented 10 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, that is, 1.3 million families for a year of energy usage.</p>
<p>Companies such as AbsolutSensing in France also plans to enter the field. Although another company Kayrros does not have its own satellite, it is analyzing Copernicus's data to track the largest methane leakage. (Translator: Chen Yuting/Calculating Draft: Chen Zhengyi)</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Taiwan Presidential Election 8 months, [] [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/確定參選台灣總統-國民黨侯友宜怎談兩岸/a-65659181"></a>With the DPP Lai Qingde and the people's party, Ke Wenzhe competed for Taiwan's leaders. According to the Wall Street Journal, with the intensification of the China -US wrestling and the rising situation of the cross -strait situation, this election will have a significant impact on the relationship between the top two major economies in the world.</p>
<p>Before the major parties determined the candidate, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣總統大選戰爭與和平之間的抉擇/a-65415439"></a>Essence Cai Rongxiang, a professor at the Department of Political Science of the National Chiang Kai -shek University in Taiwan, told the Wall Street Journal that if voters choose a candidate for China more friendly, it will trigger doubts about how to continue the American Indo -Pacific strategy.</p>
<p>In the past, the Kuomintang, which advocated that the close relationship with China, has always occupied a dominant position in Taiwan's politics. DPP.</p>
<p>In March of this year, when the President of the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party visited the United States, the former KMT President Ma Ying -jeou also visited it again, and once again showed that the topic of cross -strait issues was always the main topic of the presidential election next year. In recent years, the Kuomintang has also been working hard to find a balance between "maintaining friendship with China" and "Taiwan people's negative perception of Beijing".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T10-20-00Z/65667806_401.jpg" />Hou Youyi, Mayor of New Taipei, Taiwan (second from right), is expected to accept the Kuomintang's call for the 2024 presidential election on the 17th</p>
<p>At present, three presidential candidates in Taiwan hold the arguments on both sides of the strait strategy: Hou Youyi is considered to be blurred and "middle routes"; Lai Qingde claims to be "Taiwanese pragmatic workers" and believes that this election is a "democracy and dictatorship" choice; Ke Wenzhe In the near future, the slogan "Taiwan's autonomy and cross -strait peace".</p>
<p>From their positions, we can see how political parties will face the issue of Taiwan Straits and how this election will affect the future trend of Sino -US relations.</p>
<h3>The Kuomintang moves: playing the "eclectic" card</h3>
<p>Expert analysis is that the Kuomintang nominated Hou Youyi for the president of "extraordinary".</p>
<p>Cai Rongxiang, a professor at the Department of Political Science of National Chiang Kai -shek University, told the Wall Street Journal that Hou Youyi was different from most Kuomintang's senior officials. His family had taken root in Taiwan before the Civil War of the Communist Party of China in 1949. At the age of 66, he was twice elected as the mayor of New Taipei, Taiwan, and was the director of the Police Department. During the period, he rarely published a cross -strait position or publicly talked about political party politics.</p>
<p>Analysis pointed out that Hou Youyi's background and pragmatic style of this province made him popular among voters. For example, when he delivered a candidate speech, he sometimes switched from Mandarin to Taiwanese, which made Taiwanese feel kind, because fewer and fewer Taiwanese thought they were Chinese, and using Taiwanese was a kind of local culture. Approve.</p>
<p>However, Hou Youyi seems to lack experience in dealing with Beijing or Washington. His cross -strait discussion is relatively vague compared to other political candidates.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, he used to be a metaphor for the "Cup Water Theory" to compare the Republic of China and Taiwan, emphasizing that the two are symbiotic relationships, and said that he opposes the "one country, two systems", and "ensure that the sovereignty of the Republic of China in China is not eroded, and the free democratic democracy constitutional system will not be damaged. "However, he also stated that he opposed" Taiwan independence ", saying that" Taiwan independence has no legal basis "because according to the constitution, [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座評論中華民國的世說新語/a-65487601"></a>Essence</p>
<p>Cai Rongxiang analyzed that, compared with other leaders of the Kuomintang, Hou Youyi seemed to try to take a more intermediate position on cross -strait relations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T10-20-00Z/65636419_401.jpg" />Hou Youyi (pictured) who partnered with the President of Taiwan and Vice President of Taiwan, and the most popular possibility for the current most popular may be the uncle of Taiwan University Guan Zhongmin.</p>
<p>Before he was determined to run, Guo Taiming, the founder of Hon Hai Group, had expressed his willingness to represent the Kuomintang. Guo Taiming appealed to voters: "The DPP who voted to" holding high Taiwan independence, revenge and anti -China "is dangerous." He also said that Taiwan should avoid "forced to choose a border station." "".</p>
<p>Compared to Hou Youyi, Guo Taiming's attitude seems to be more in line with Beijing's expectations. Fan Shiping, a political scholar of Taiwan Normal University, told DW on the 17th that China more hoped that people like Guo Taiming intend to launch a unified political negotiation with China, but Hou Youyi said that he would refuse to develop in this direction.</p>
<p>However, China has increased its military operations against Taiwan and has increased Taiwan voters' doubts about the "pro -China" policy. The New York Times reported that the Kuomintang then hopes to pin it on a new type of candidate: a local leader who is popular and rarely handle Chinese affairs to the outside world. Hou Youyi became the ideal candidate of the Kuomintang, and was expected to find a compromise plan on cross -strait issues.</p>
<h3>Democratic Progressive Party receiving moves: shift from "Anti -China" to "Anti -Communist"</h3>
<p>As the Kuomintang candidates are determined, the Cross -Strait discussions of the DPP have attracted much attention. In the Taiwan presidential election in 2020, the DPP won most of the votes with "anti -China -China". Questions within the party.</p>
<p>last year end, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台湾地方选举落幕-谁将角逐2024总统之位/a-63906623"> </a>DPP defeats, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/民进党九合一选战受挫-蔡英文辞党主席/a-63901321"></a>, Lai Qingde, Vice President of Taiwan and the President of the Democratic Progressive Party, took over. Since then, Lai Qingde has repeatedly mentioned the "Taiwan of the Republic of China" and "peace".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T10-20-00Z/65656818_401.jpg" />As the President of the Democratic Progressive Party, Lai Qingde was asked by the student whether he was worried that the United States was not assured that his "Taiwan independence" color was not assured of his president.</p>
<p>2018, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/賴清德如何出線-還有誰想選台灣總統/a-65005404"></a>It emphasizes that "Taiwan is an independent country with sovereignty, and does not belong to China." It was responded by the State and Taiwan Office spokesman. Lai Qingde's remarks were "very dangerous and self -impatient."</p>
<p>On the 16th, at a seminar of a political university student, Lai Qingde was asked if he was worried that the United States was not assured that his "Taiwan independence" colors were afraid of improving the risk of war, and he was not assured that he was the president of Taiwan. He replied that "pragmatic" is based on the fact that Taiwan's regular rectification of the government is already a country with sovereignty and independence, so it is not necessary to declare independence separately.As for the shift from "Anti -China -Baozai" to "Peace Paidai", it means that the DPP's cross -strait discussion has changed. Some people of the DPP told the Lianhe Daily that the positions have always been consistent. When the Chinese Communist Party of China or military threats or military threats, of course, they are anti -China -China. They usually work hard to negotiate peacefully and not provocate.</p>
<p>The party insiders pointed out that Lai Qingde also talked about a party affairs executive meeting that the "resistance" of anti -China -China Baozai was to resist aggression, not to fight against China; in the future team's internal consensus was more focused on "anti -communist".</p>
<p>Huang Kuibo, a professor of international relations at the National University of Political Science, told the New York Times that if Lai Qingde wins, it may mean that China will continue the current Taiwan policy and exclude Taiwan from any high -level contact, and the close relationship between Taiwan and the United States will continue. And if Hou Youyi won, he may re -open the communication channels between China and Taiwan, alleviate the situation of military tensions, and thus reduce the pressure of Taiwan to strengthen contact with the United States.</p>
<h3>The third force is there any chance?</h3>
<p>In addition to the two major parties, the Taiwan people's party established in 2019 also determined that the party chairman and former Taipei mayor Ke Wenzhe were elected. In early April, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/柯文哲将以台湾总统大选参选人身份赴美访问/a-64899690"></a>, To exchange opinions with the United States on "diplomatic and cross -strait relations".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after Ke Wenzhe officially registered for the president in the party department, he immediately posted on Facebook that Taiwan needs a rational, pragmatic, and scientific leader who will develop a stable area with "Taiwan Autonomous and Cross -Strait Peace" as its core to develop a stable area. Economic and trade relations and communication dialogue with the other side, pragmatic strive for the largest living space of Taiwan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T10-20-00Z/65656798_401.jpg" />Ke Wenzhe, a candidate for the President of the People's Party, positioned the party as the third one between the two major parties in Taiwan</p>
<p>In March of this year, he also pointed out in a party speech that Taiwan did not have the "1992 Consensus", and the "1996 Consensus" was in line with Taiwan's current situation. The "1996 Consensus" was proposed by former Taiwan Vice President Lu Xiulian that after the first election of the president on March 23, 1996, Taiwan has been clearly established as a sovereign country and is not controlled by other countries.</p>
<p>Although the people's party has not been established for a long time, and only 5 seats in the 113 seats of the Taiwan Legislative Yuan, the people's party positions themselves as the third way out between the two major parties, which is quite attractive among the middle and young voters.</p>
<p>Ke Wenzhe has criticized the Democratic Progressive Party to China "Pro-WAR" (good), and the Kuomintang is "TOODEFERENTIAL", which is two extremes. He pointed out that the best strategy for peace on both sides of the strait is to "avoid war", but at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen preparations and not fear of war; the people's party is expected to put forward more specific national defense strategies and military service systems in the election campaign.</p>
<p>On the 16th, before the Kuomintang announced the candidate, the polls announced by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that among the "Lai, Hou, and Ke" 2024 presidential campaign, Lai Qingde supported the highest support and won 35.8%of voters support. 27.6%), Ke Wenzhe at the bottom (25.1%) at the bottom (25.1%).</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), also known as the "Twin City Forum" Taipei City and Shanghai official dialogue activities <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/記者手記台北上海雙城論壇從熱鬧到冷清/a-62546805"></a>It is about to be held this summer, which is also the first Twin City Forum that the current mayor of Taipei Jiang Wanan.</p>
<p>Jiang Wanan confirmed in a media interview on May 18th that he had sent representatives of the municipal government to Shanghai to discuss the Shuangcheng Forum and other matters. He mentioned that Wang Qiu Dong, deputy secretary of the Taipei City Government, who has arrived in Shanghai, will also meet with Shanghai Taiwanese business groups in addition to discussing tourism, sports, and Shuangcheng Forum.</p>
<h3>For the first offline forum for the first time in three years</h3>
<p>Affected by the new crown epidemic, the Shuangcheng Forums from 2020 to 2022 were held in videos. Last year's forum was hosted by Taipei City. This year, with border control, it is expected that this forum will be held in Shanghai offline.</p>
<p>In an interview, Jiang Wanan pointed out that he will participate in the Shuangcheng Forum in the principle of "peer dignity, goodwill and mutual benefit". But for media questions, will he go to Shanghai this time? Jiang Wanan only replied: Many details are still planning and discussions.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese businessmen expressed support</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a Shanghai Taiwanese businessman told the Central News Agency: Because of the epidemic and other reasons, the bilateral exchanges of these three years have faded, and the hosts in Taipei and Shanghai have changed. Therefore Cross -strait relations blew the warm wind. "</p>
<p>Since the time of Taipei Mayor Hao Longbin in 2010, the Shuangcheng Forum is hosted by Taipei and Shanghai each year, visiting each other and exchanges with each other. Until 2020, the new crown epidemic was changed to video.</p>
<h3>How do Chinese military exercises continue on both sides of the strait?</h3>
<h3>"Only the machine does not disturb the Taiwan"?</h3>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國軍演擴及台灣東部-或成圍台新模式/a-65270238"></a>Whether to continue holding the Shuangcheng Forum has also become the focus of political theory in Taiwan. During the campaign of the mayor last year, Jiang Wanan said that the premise of holding the Shuangcheng Forum premise was that "the co -aircraft does not disturb the Taiwan, the other party is interpreted with goodwill, and the two parties must be equal."</p>
<p>However, in an exclusive interview with the Lianhe Daily at the beginning of this year, he said: The public has arbitrary expectations for the entity organizing forums, and the Shuangcheng Forum has also gained substantial results. Therefore Continue to run, especially its importance in the current situation on both sides of the strait.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T10-26-00Z/19495970_401.jpg" />In 2016, the then Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Sha Hailin on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong attended the Shuangcheng Forum</p>
<h3>Forum past results</h3>
<p>Ke Wenzhe, supported by the DPP in 2014, has been elected Mayor of Taipei. The political topics involved in the Shuangcheng Forum have risen from the original municipalities to the cross -strait level.</p>
<p>After Cai Yingwen, the Democratic Progressive Party, was elected president in 2016, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, the MAC, the Maritime Association, and the Maritime Foundation and other cross -strait communication channels stopped. Therefore, the Shuangcheng Forum is currently the only official exchanges between the two sides of the strait and still held regularly every year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T10-26-00Z/15606874_7.jpg" />Taipei's garbage classification garbage bins</p>
<p>In 2018, when Zhou Bo, then deputy mayor of Shanghai, went to Taipei to participate in the forum, listed the garbage classification in Taipei as the focus of inspection. Shanghai official later also referred to Taipei experience through the "Shanghai Municipal Domestic Waste Management Regulations", <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/你是什么垃圾-上海人成垃圾分类排头兵/a-49446153"></a>Essence</p>
<p>From 2018 to 2020, the official rectification of Shanghai's official rectification includes river bank landscapes including the Suzhou River and Huangpu River, and open up the riverbin corridor and the waterfront and green space. Inspired, it became a well -known result of the Shuangcheng Forum.</p>

He accepted an exclusive interview with this station that his identity was exposed after receiving the prize on behalf of Zou Xingtong, but he was not afraid of the risk of banning Hong Kong and the mainland. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hk-chow-05182023104009.html/@@images/image"></a>Cantonese group drawing</p>
<p>The largest human rights organization "Gwangju 5.18 Memorial Foundation", the largest human rights organization in South Korea, awarded the Human Rights Award to Zou Xingtong, the former vice chairman of the Hong Kong Branch Federation of Hong Kong. The Secretary -General of the South Korean Human Rights Organization, who was awarded by Zou Xingtong, accepted an exclusive interview with Zou Xingtong. It symbolizes the hope of Hong Kong. He said that his identity was exposed after receiving the prize, or he was banned from Hong Kong and the mainland since then, but he was still fearless. He has known Zou Xingtong for more than 10 years. Although he is in South Korea, he will go to the Chinese Embassy to order candles every year. He hopes that Zou Xingtong will be released home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"She is like a candlelight, the hope of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement, so she is qualified to win the Guangzhou Human Rights Award."</p>
<p>"Although I am in South Korea, I want to make a candlelight for her. Before she was released, I would insist on doing the same thing outside the Chinese Embassy every year."</p>
<p>——Dou Xingtong has known each other who has known each other for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The award on behalf of Zou Xingtong is Na Hyun-Phil, headquartered in Seoul, who is headquartered in Seoul and focusing on global human rights issues, "Korean House for InternationalSolidarity). When he spoke, he choked and wrote a word for Zou Xingtong. It mentioned that this award belongs to each Hong Kong person who is free to fight for freedom. "This human rights award represents it. Everyone is with Hong Kong people."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-47-32-04-00/000001.png" />Luo Xianfei received the prize in the last generation of the "Guangzhou 5.18 Memorial Foundation". (Guangzhou 5.18 Memorial Foundation YouTube Live Screenshot) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hk-chow-05182023104009.html/9075cc2a-e200-4db6-9073-b1a78eea93a5.jpeg"></a>** If Zou Xingtong receives the prize, the identity is exposed.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei was interviewed by this station and was asked why Zou Xingtong received the prize on behalf of Zou Xingtong. Luo Xianfei first sighed, saying that Hong Kong people could not come to the scene because of safety reasons. He also focused on the issue of Hong Kong's human rights.</p>

All information is public. This means that the Chinese government will recognize the award -winning person. In order to protect Hong Kong people, they think that I am more suitable as Koreans and can protect her family or friends.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei said that after receiving the invitation, he also thought about it. In the end, he resolutely accepted his mission and was willing to take the risk of banning Hong Kong and the mainland.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei said: Because Chinese officials already know my actions, I don't know. I hope to go to Hong Kong to meet other friends in Hong Kong, but I think the risks are very high. I think of Hong Kong, but I am not sure of the safety of myself and other friends, so I think I will give up this opportunity and no longer go to Hong Kong or China mainland.</p>
<p>** Friends Zou Xingtong held a candlelight to the Chinese Embassy every year after he was prison for release.</p>
<p>On the eve of the "June 4th" anniversary of 2021, the Hong Kong police banned Victoria Garden for the second consecutive year on the grounds of epidemic prevention. Zou Xingtong said that he would commemorate in the "personal name". On the day of the "June 4th", Zou Xingtong was arrested by the Hong Kong police on the grounds that he was "suspected of promoting the collection of unprecedented assembly".</p>
<p>On the day Zou Xingtong was arrested, Luo Xianfei was impressed. He said that after seeing the news that day, he was in Seoul and went to the Chinese Embassy alone to lit the candlelight for Zou Xingtong.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-47-32-04-00/000003.png" />After Zou Xingtong was arrested, Luo Xianfei went to the Chinese Embassy in the Chinese Embassy in the 333rd anniversary of the 64th. (Provided by the respondent) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hk-chow-05182023104009.html/1897ac2f-de5c-437b-9954-68e2d0c276b6.jpg"></a>Luo Xianfei said: I saw the news. Later, a person took a candle to the night outside the Chinese Embassy in Seoul and urged the authorities to release Zou Xingtong. Although I was in South Korea, I wanted to hold a candlelight for her. Last year, "June 4th", I also did the same thing. I took the candle to the night outside the Chinese Embassy. I may have the same action this year. Before she is released, I will insist on doing the same thing every year.</p>
<p><strong> Knowing with Zou Xingtong for nearly 12 </strong> <strong> Years refer to her "Heart Chinese Democratic Movement" </strong></p>
<p>Luo Xianfei and Zou Xingtong met for nearly 12 years. The two met for the first time. At a joint meeting in Taiwan in 2011, they discussed the issue of labor rights and interests with representatives of human rights organizations in other countries. Zou Xingtong was an initiator of Chinese labor rights and interests in the early days. Before Zou Xingtong became a lawyer, the two had a friendship and met in Hong Kong or South Korea. Luo Xianfei described that Zou Xingtong was a good friend and was impressed by her.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei said: She is a very sincere person and is very interested in workers. She insists on doing the right thing. It is very principled to be a person, that is, as long as she thinks it is the right thing, she will put it into action. She was really enthusiastic and held a candlelight event for the Tiananmen incident. She was proud of being able to hold a candlelight rally in Hong Kong. I was very impressed.</p>
<p>** It is difficult to study the issue of Hong Kong after disintegrating the National Security Law of Hong Kong.Luo Xianfei said: There is no action on Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is currently a silent society, we can't find a way to fight for Hong Kong democracy. But in any case, we will observe the situation in Hong Kong and hope to find a way.</p>
<p>Although the center of gravity is shifted, Luo Xianfei has paid attention to the disintegration of Hong Kong's citizens. It is a pity that Hong Kong Labor Organization has contributed to improving labor rights and interests from all over the world. He remembered that at that time, the Workers' Alliance had spoiled the topic of South Korean workers, including the South Korean consulate in Hong Kong in 2016 to protest the Korean government's arrest of the chairman of the Democratic Labor and Labor of South Korea and demanded to release all members of the arrest and cancellation of control.</p>
<p><strong> "Zou Xingtong is like a candlelight, the hope of the Democratic Movement in Hong Kong" </strong></p>
<p>Three Chinese consulate members had previously requested the organizer "Guangzhou 5.18 Memorial Foundation" to withdraw the Human Rights Award to Zou Xingtong, which was eventually rejected by the organizer. Luo Xianfei believes that the visit of Chinese officials even proves that Zou Xingtong's award is the correct decision, and it also makes the human rights award more meaningful, reflecting the organizer only focuses on human rights and does not accept political suppression, and the incident also stimulates more Koreans' support for Zou Xingtong.</p>
<p>Regarding Zou Xingtong's award, Luo Xianfei believed that she was deserved, and her award also symbolized Hong Kong's hope.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-47-32-04-00/000004.png" />Luo Xianfei urged the authorities to release Zou Xingtong as soon as possible. (Provided by the respondent) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hk-chow-05182023104009.html/620ee982-5149-4a33-bf97-18ece2d67b00.jpeg"></a>Luo Xianfei said: She is like a candlelight, the hope of the Hong Kong Democracy Movement, so she is eligible to win the "Gwangzhou Human Rights Award."</p>
<p>In the end, Luo Xianfei made a message to Hong Kong people saying: "The Koreans have not forgotten Hong Kong, we will support the Hong Kong democratic movement."</p>
<p>Zou Xingtong was selected as the "2023 Guangzhou Human Rights Award" winner in early May. It was the first time that Hong Kong people won this award. The Evaluation Committee described Zou Xingtong with the "human rights lawyer of democratic movement and democratic struggle", and also pointed out that Zou Xingtong was awarded to Zou Xingtong as "resisting the anti -democracy of the Hong Kong government and the courage and hope of human rights activities and citizens around the world."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T11-05-00-04-00/000000.png" />Shen Boyang, the chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Laboratory, is in the "Asia very much want to talk" program, exposing the Chinese online military technique <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm2-05182023094929.html/@@images/image"></a>Screenshot from the program <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm2-05182023094929.html/@@stream"></a>The CCP's propaganda of various countries is pervasive, and Taiwan is at the forefront of the Communist Party of China. Shen Boyang, the chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Laboratory, analyzed in the program "Asia's Asia very much". Recently, China has operated suspicious theory in Taiwan not only to let the people hate the United States, but also attempts to balance the attitude of Taiwan to the people of Taiwan. In addition, what are the methods of the CCP's cognitive war?</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hx1-05152023090516.html"></a> </em>*  * </strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/9-05032023162715.html"> </a> <strong>  * </strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-04212023044114.html"> </a>***<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/8-04072023143833.html"><strong> Taiwanese was fined 500,000 Taiwan dollars as a member of the Chinese CPPCC of China </strong></a>After the United States passed the "National Defense Authorization Act" to Taiwan's military assistance, some media in Taiwan created the so -called "suspicion theory", and it was not good for the hype of the United States. This topic has not receded from the nine -in -one election last year before the election.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation has been investigated in January this year. If the US military aids Taiwan, will Taiwan push Taiwan to the war? 53 people do not agree with this statement, but young people aged 20-24 have more than half of the young people(51.5％)agree. The report at that time showed that "suspicious and American theory is not yet a climate, but it is enough to attract attention."</p>
<p>"China believes that their main enemies are not Taiwan, but the United States, so the most important discussion they are in public opinion in the world are all doubts." Shen Boyang, co -sponsoring with Black Bear College, made the above analysis in the "Asia Talking" program.</p>
<p>According to the data found by Shen Boyang's team from Facebook, suspicion and American theory broke out in Taiwan. It is the traditional Chinese world alone, of which 60-70%are made in China, which does not include simplified Chinese. "Suspected the United States' focus is that they do not want everyone to hate the United States. He wants to balance or not like China."</p>
<p><strong> The spread of suspicion and American theory destroys the trust foundation of cooperation between Taiwan and the United States and Japan </strong></p>
<p>Shen Boyang mentioned that China ’s doubtful and American expositions in Taiwan have also dragged Japan. The manufacture of the United States and Japan wants to swallow Taiwan and ask the Guo Shenshan Semiconductor TSMC to set up factories. It is to empty Taiwan. He had conducted a survey between universities and asked the source of overseas as an amazing discovery.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T11-05-00-04-00/000001.png" />Shen Boyang, the chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Laboratory, exposed the Chinese online military techniques in the "Asia."(Screenshot self -program)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm2-05182023094929.html/6c884f2f6d0b.jpg"></a>"More than 30 % of China, 20 % of the United States, and two % of Japan." Shen Boyang further explained, "That is, 20 % of college students believe that the United States and Japan have no news in Taiwan. It is completely inconsistent with reality. "</p>
<p>When he asked college students where this idea came from, he found that the teaching of the professor occupied the important part of the United Front work. After the narratives of China are continuously spreading, young people have skepticized the close interaction and cooperation between Taiwan and the United States and Japan, and then have deeper doubts about the Taiwan government. This is the power of the Chinese cognitive war. "Over time, when Taiwan chooses who to stand with today, he may choose to stand with the invaders. This is the public opinion he wants to cause."</p>
<p><strong> Purchase sensitive book personal leakage effect </strong></p>
<p>The penetration of the Chinese Communist Party is almost pervasive. Recently, some people bought "What to Do if the Communist Party Come" co -authored by the Eslite Book Company, but received a sensitive fraud phone. Consumers were worried about whether this book was sensitive and personal capital was leaked. Essence</p>
<p>Shen Boyang analyzed that the incident may be invaded by the victim by hackers, but on the other hand, the information of Taiwan bookstores is serious. When purchasing books, it includes address, ID number, and telephone related information. As soon as the war, these grasped data came in handy. "He can know what books these people have bought, assuming that he bought a lot of civil defense manuals, or those books we wrote. In war, these people are the first wave of the first wave of sniper."</p>
<p>Shen Boyang believes that this is not just the topic of a call. The collection and application of individual capital is widely collected. The importance of cognitive operations is that which areas do you need to persuade the most. People can do more united front work.</p>
<p>** The Chinese Communist Party is involved in the election method of Taiwan and the time changes.</p>
<p>Most of the Taiwan elections have been deeply involved in the Chinese Communist Party. Taiwan will hold a presidential election in January next year. Has the CCP's cognitive battle has heated with the election campaign?</p>
<p>Shen Boyang took the nine -in -one election last year as an example. The CCP's methods have changed. The CCP discovered that there were many issues in the past few times before the election, and the effect of intervention was not good. At present, the Chinese Communist Party has tended to create public opinion before the election. For example, several major public security incidents have recently occurred in Taiwan. China has taken the opportunity to operate the conspiracy theory of collusion between the DPP and underworld. "It's about to enter the election, but it will not fight. Anyway, the media in Taiwan will speculate, and it will be hot enough during the election. It does not need to make a kick." Shen Boyang added instructions.</p>
<p>The host asked which unit to issue a coordinated plan for China. Shen Boyang pointed out that after Xi Jinping got the order, the PLA and the Central Propaganda Department were responsible for implementing it. Among them, after the military reform at the end of 2015, the People's Liberation Army united all the web forces under the Ministry of Strategic Support Ministry in the Internet System Bureau, and completely regarded cognitive combat as a model and means of war. In contrast, the Ministry of National Security, the Communist Youth League, or the Taiwan Affairs Office of the National Taiwan Affairs Office belong to the edge -based cooperative units.</p>

The picture shows the Chinese tourist group in the Palace of Versailles</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Walking in the city center of Cologne, Germany, a intuitive feeling is, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国游客重返欧洲为何步履蹒跚/a-64606953"></a> 。 <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/tourismus-chinas-touristen-bleiben-fern-so-reagieren-europas-ferienregionen/29154534.html"></a>The phenomenon of "the number of Chinese tourists in Europe is obviously less than before the epidemic", indicating that the European tourism industry has not seen the recovery of relevant needs so far, and the turnover related to Chinese tourists is far lower than the level before the epidemic.</p>
<p>Many of them are obvious. Since the beginning of 2020, both China and Europe have been in the strict control of the new crown epidemic. Most European countries opened in early 2022 and tourism recovered; China ended at the end of 2022, and many people joined the Tourism Army this year.</p>
<p>In addition, some European countries have recently opened their travel visas to Chinese citizens. For example, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国将从5月1日起对中国公民重新开放旅游签证/a-65382583"></a>Essence</p>
<p>at the same time, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/飞越俄空域争议-抑制欧美往返中国航线的复苏/a-65626622"> </a>Essence For example, according to the "South Germany", TD COWEN stock analysis company data was cited. As of the end of April, Germany and China Airlines had decreased by 49%compared with 2019.</p>
<h3><strong> Chinese people spend more caution </strong></h3>
<p>Factors such as visa application and decrease in flight number have increased the threshold for Chinese people to travel abroad. In addition, there may be a more frugal trend that affects Chinese overseas.</p>
<p>As much as possible.</p>
<p>In the report, a Chinese girl who was studying for graduate students had only spent 2,500 yuan for nine days in China. Most of the time, she chose to take slow cars and buses. When accommodation, they chose the train to spend the night or cheap hotel bed. This example is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China show that China ’s domestic tourism is booming this year. During the May 1st period from April 28 to May 3, there were 274 million travels, an increase of 19%over 2019 before the epidemic. However, the total expenditure is 148 billion yuan, which is the same as 2019, which means that the average cost of each traveler is lower than in 2019.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that analysts said that China's difficult real estate market, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338"></a>And the extensive concerns of work stability, so that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国年轻人消费冷却10块钱一顿晚餐/a-63167019"></a>The Asia-Pacific chief economist of the Asia-Pacific region of the global asset management company, Alicia Garcia-Herrero, said: "The Chinese are not ready to spend as before, although the government tries to encourage consumption ..." She Said, "People need work and higher wages to start a lot of consumption."</p>

<h3>Roman holiday</h3>

<h3>Ticket price will not fall down</h3>
<p>The tourism industry has recovered, while the ticket price of travel continues to rise. According to the German Automobile Club (ADAC) estimates, this summer, air tickets departing from Germany compared with the same period in 2022, the increase may be up to 46%. The fares of Hansha Airlines and Swiss Airlines even doubled compared to 2021. The reasons include inflation, the high price of aircraft fuel, the lack of aircraft and the number of staff.#</p>

<h3>Hansha: Sales and prices are soaring</h3>
<p>Germany Hansha Airlines predicts that this summer will usher in a climax of passenger transport, and the company's marketing will reach a new high throughout the year. The Group's latest financial report shows that the number of passengers (including Swiss Airlines, Austrian Airlines, and European wings) of Hansha's routes in the first quarter of this year reached 22 million passengers, an increase of 70%over the same period last year, and sales increased by 40%.

<h3>Hotel, don't worry, no guests, no guests</h3>
<p>In Europe's favorable travel destinations, accommodation prices have also risen. Many hotels and homestays turned new houses and facilities during the epidemic, and began to welcome guests with a new look last year. Data in the summer of 2022 show that the price of mid -to -high -end hotels in popular tourist destinations is particularly obvious. The price of Italian four -star hotels has increased by 44%, and Greece rose 47%.</p>

<h3>Germans also favor domestic travel</h3>
<p>According to a questionnaire survey by the German Kil's vacation and Tourism Research Association (FUR), 70%of the Germans stated that they planned to travel this year, which was higher than last year (61%) and the previous year (49%). Continuing the trend during the epidemic, the seaside and the Alps in northern Germany are still popular options. The picture shows the beach of Rügen, Germany.</p>

<p>The German "Commercial Daily" article pointed out that tourist countries such as France, Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and other tourism countries have clearly felt the decrease in the amount of Chinese tourists. Regardless of Paris, Athens, and Lussen, Switzerland, tourism is currently hot, and the hotel is full and the attractions are queuing. However, the number of Chinese tourists is obviously less than before the epidemic.</p>
<p>Paris's response to this is particularly fierce. It is reported that Paris has high hopes for the increase in Chinese tourists this year -whether it is to visit the Louvre, Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees Avenue, or go shopping in Paris luxury stores. "Especially for Paris, tourism from China is very important." The head of the French Tourism Association, Christian Mantei, told the French business newspaper "Leséchos".</p>
<p>As a result, the tourism industry is pressured to the French government. The person in charge of the Paris Airport Company, Yaogao Hotel Group and Laosa Lafayette said that before the epidemic, China ’s flights to and from Paris are the most in European cities, with more than 90 weekly. They believed in French President Macron and demanded more convenient conditions for Chinese tourists.</p>
<p>The French tourism industry also accuses France of obstructing the restoration of normal state, because France, like other Western airlines, <a href="">when facing Chinese airlines, facing disadvantages because of a detour and avoiding Russian airspace</a>Essence The "Business Daily" said that the French government must weigh the advantages and disadvantages now: Is it the benefit of the French aviation industry or the interests of the French tourism industry?</p>

Lan, Yang Yan, Wang Mian and other talk show actors and screenwriters. In three years of the epidemic, watching the talk show online has become an important spiritual food.</p>
<p><strong> The artistic art "barbaric growth"? </strong></p>
<p>Laughing Fruit is unique in the Chinese talk show industry, and its ability to attract gold is increasing day by day. According to the Central News Agency, nearly 1,500 performances in 2021 covered 400,000 viewers, and the box office performed more than 80 million yuan in the year.

<p>Gong Yujian said: "Xiao Guo has attracted gold in China's business performance in recent years and earned a lot of money. As we all know, Chinese finances have fallen into a very difficult situation. Government departments have tried their best to cut chives. Smile culture. Some rich companies and cultural people in the second round of leek cutting will be fined to tens of millions of huge models. "</p>
<p>Gong Yujian mentioned that like a well -known Taiwanese artist Zhang Ting made a lot of money in China, he was also severely punished, but they also had Taiwan identity protection, and at least returned to Taiwan to have personal freedom. In China, there is no political belonging to politics and artistic to art. Sometimes when watching the Chinese united front show, Hong Kong and Taiwan singers who participated in the performance all laughed and advised them that "you have made a full RMB, and it may not be said that the evidence on the arrest book in the next second will be said."</p>
<p>Gong Yujian said that the cultural and artistic talk show with self -deprecation, irony as the soul, and charm performed the mines sooner or later. Xiao Guo is the ace of China and benchmarks. At that time, its "Tucao Conference" was empty, and the influence was very large. It was completely different from the North School cross talk. The laughter actor represents the middle class and has a high degree of education. The laughter actor had spit Chinese football and blue balls, which caused a sensation and caused a rebound in the Chinese sports industry. However, Xi Jinping's power rule and moved towards the Cultural Revolution at 29. The accident was historical necessity.</p>
<p>Gong Yujian said: "The origin of the Cultural Revolution is to criticize a historical drama. Hai Rui stopped the official.</p>
<p>Chinese media reports also mentioned that although the talk show is a playful industry, most of the well -known talk show actors under Xiaoguo are graduates and returnees from key colleges and universities. This time, House, who was permanently blocked, graduated from the University of Foreign Economic and Trade.</p>
<p>Smile is not the first time to turn over. Taiwan's media "Digital Age" is "a talk show, endangering the valuation of 4 billion yuan?" The report pointed out that House was voiced at the "Talk Show 5" last year. ST's intercontinental daily limit, the stock code in the show was later silenced, and the picture was added with "the stock market is risky and the investment needs to be cautious" warning. House's ridiculous paragraph "retail households worship me, the organization targets me, the Securities Regulatory Commission investigates me", but did not expect to come true.</p>
<p>In the digital era, this report was cited separately. In 2020, Kam, who had just won the second season of the "Talk Show", was exposed to drug use. One of the people Li Xuan issued underwear advertisements that they were "equipment that allowed women to lie easily to win the workplace" and was punished by "materialization discrimination against women". In February this year, Meng Chuan was banned by the platform for violating relevant regulations. Six people have been fined for three years.</p>
<p><strong> The official will take advantage of the hot "talk show" template touting Xi, Mao thought </strong></p>
<p>The talk show "Avenue Lingyun", launched by the Propaganda Department of the Jiading District Committee of the Communist Party of China, took advantage of the situation again, saying that it was the main line of promoting "Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era" and claiming to "cater to the taste of youth."</p>
<p>In the first episode of the program "people", the host Yang Ling said: "As the people, we are often by the general secretary 'Aite', and I will have no self." The motivation, then let us live up to the times to roll up our sleeves and work hard "," General Secretary Xi Jinping speaks of Jiangshan is the people, and there are more than 200 times in the 19th National Congress of the 19th National Congress of more than 30,000 words. To the people, this year celebrated the report of nearly 10,000 words at the Centennial Conference of the Chinese Communist Party this year, the people mentioned 83 times ... "Former Beijing Spring Magazine Editor -in -chief Hu Ping was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that "positive energy" was definitely impossible to succeed. The sarcasm and humorous performances have been criticized in ancient times. "</p>
<p>Hu Ping believes that the House incident is a text prison and sin in words. "This is not easy to give HOUSE to the crime of subverting the state power, and it will achieve the effect of killing a hundred and one hundred effects, resulting in a universal intimidation effect, and it will be so ruthless."</p>
<p>Hu Ping mentioned that Wang Shuo, a well -known writer in China in the 1990s, also spoke some unsatisfactory things in the Mao era, and formed a strong contrast and ironic. His novels were very popular. Now, under the political power, cultural and artistic performances have become the restricted area.</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan MAC: What are the standards for the Chinese government for nearly 14 million yuan in 8 -character fines </strong></p>
<p>Hu Xi, the former editor -in -chief of the Global Times of the Communist Party of China, posted a post on his Weibo, hoping that he did not want to kill the laughter company with a stick and was attacked by the small pink group. Netizens message: "Provide a hotbed for the Color Revolution!Inner thieves are the main threats", "when the country handles Hu Moumou", "public opinion, there are bad people in the entertainment industry," the country should take remediation. "</p>
<p>The Taiwan MAC spokesman Zhan Zhihong said at a regular press conference on the 18th that which country's talk show actor will be fined more than 14 million yuan for eight words? The problem is to judge the criteria, which should give the world a standard. They do not like any remarks and behaviors, so that everyone has some compliance.</p>

On April 26, the Taiwan Affairs Office of China State Office said that he was investigated by the harm of Guoan. The Shanghai National Security Agency took criminal compulsory measures on Li Yanhe, a suspect who engaged in the subversion of national criminal activities in accordance with the law. He also said that the case handling unit has arranged Li Yanhe's wife to call and communicate with him in Shanghai, and continue to protect Li Yanhe's legitimate rights in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Ma Xiaoguang emphasized: "Li Yanhe has committed the crime of inciting division of the country. This is a case.

<p>The irony of political reviews, political comics, and talk shows in Hong Kong have been very prosperous, but with the implementation of the National Security Law, various media have gradually reduced related review programs and topics. As early as 1989, the irony and disadvantaged show "Headline News" was also forced to stop broadcasting. Former host Wu Zhisen said that whether the power of the power can accept the criticism of the expression of the freedom of social speech with the criticism of the freedom of society.</p>
<p>Wu Zhisen: "Like the" Empress Dowager and Xiao Haozi "unit of the" Headline News ", in 2 to 3 minutes, tell the audience the most important and ridiculous points of the incident, giving people a feeling of laughter. I often say, If a society cannot tolerate irony and criticism, it is equivalent to not freedom of speech. This is an important vane for measuring the freedom of social speech. "</p>

<p>Wu Zhisen said that under the National Security Law, the Hong Kong Government started to operate in many fields such as news, creation, and book publishing. Retreat to authoritarian society.</p>
<p>Wu Zhisen: "Roughness is a new normal, (government) will not give you any opportunities to defense until you kneel down. In fact, does Zunzi have a criminal? No. Is Zunzi stepped on the red line of the national security law? Said, but the current situation is' Heart Leader 'and' There is a wrong killing, "because everyone has a" National Security Law "in the minds of everyone. Just like the era of authoritarian authority in Taiwan, everyone has a police headquarters in the minds of everyone, that is When punishing the unit, everyone must be careful when everyone speaks, write or talks with people, and is very similar to today's Hong Kong situation. "</p>
<p>Wu Zhisen, who has moved to the United Kingdom, said that although many people have suggested that he can use different platforms to resurrect the political reviews of "Headline News", he said that the significance and influence of political evaluation with self -media have been greatly different.</p>
<p>** Hong Kong Political cartoonist: The National Security Law has made the only sense of humor in the society.</p>
<p>The living space of political comics has also been greatly affected after the "National Security Law".

<p>VAWONGSIR acknowledge that political comics must be close to the times. He was worried that he could no longer create to move to Taiwan, but after discovering the National Security Law, he had more subject matter.</p>
<p>VAWONGSIR: "When I talked to my friends and said, I said with a joke. Now I want to listen to jokes and listen to what the Hong Kong government is talking about, so the subject matter of political comics is indeed more than before, but how to find the correct information is more difficult than before. Thank you very much for different. The media continued to report in Hong Kong overseas and gave me a reference, especially the inspiration for the discrete reports of the Hong Kong people to the overseas media. "<strong> Not only affects Hong Kong Chinese -style speech control, extended overseas </strong></p>
<p>Huang Zhaonan, assistant professor of the National Fa Institute of Taiwan Politburo, said that China ’s politics and commercial pressures are used to control the freedom of speech. Earlier, because of entering the Chinese market, it was a case for the sarcasm to remove the content of Beijing. It can be seen that the Chinese -style management and control remarks are expanding to Taiwan and overseas.</p>
<p>Huang Zhaonian: "The mode of speech control involved in the Chinese authorities is not just limited to the scope of more pure politics, and there are many cases that have spread to these sections that spread to literature and art. Local. The suppression of freedom of speech is in fact, in fact, from mainland China itself to Hong Kong, spread to Taiwan, and all parts of the world. "</p>
<p>Huang Zhaonian said that the creator's control of criticism of criticism through the influence of China's market through the media, depends on the dependence of the network platform used on the Chinese market.</p>

<p>However, in fact, the 313 seats are still not enough to make Pita smoothly become the Prime Minister, because the president candidate must have more than half of the 750 seats of the two hospitals, that is, 376 support, but the 250s of the Senate are almost the forces of the relatives, and most of them are in addition.

<p>(Voice of Germany) from 1830 to 1840, the voices of the German Federation's various territories demanded change. In particular, citizens and bourgeoisie in cities demand democracy and require the establishment of a unified German country.</p>
<p>The deer Deutschebund, which was formed after the Napoleonic Army in 1815, was a loose league composed of large and small feudal monarchs. Among them, Austria and Prussia ruthlessly suppress all movements pursuing democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>After experiencing <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/回顾1849年4月德国革命/a-4138798"></a>Later, the democratic forces finally achieved an important goal: they forced the feudal countries that the princes and nobles ruled by the princes and nobles to set up a liberal government and a constitutional national parliament that produced the scope of all morals through elections. "Under the huge fear, the vast majority of German princes made a compromise against their political beliefs," and the historian of Heidelberg said to Germany.</p>
<h3><strong> Church becomes a parliamentary hall </strong></h3>
<p>On May 18, 1848, members of the first elected German Parliament gathered in Frankfurt on the banks of the River to negotiate the first free constitution and established a national country. The need for space capacity (more than 600 members of the National Assembly), the conference was located in Paulskirche, where the city's largest lobby was at that time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T12-14-00Z/65641956_401.jpg" />The original Frankfurt Constitution in 1848</p>
<p>However, the demands of each faction in the parliament are far away. The conservatives continue to defend the existing privileges of various state countries and their rulers; liberals advocate the establishment of a federal country with constitutional monarchy; and radicals require the establishment of a republic of parliament democracy. The Historian Historian Haller, Germany, pointed out that the "serious ideology and regional differentiation" in the National Assembly hindered the formation of a unified position.</p>
<h3><strong> Basic rights list of model meaning </strong></h3>
<p>From today's perspective, the highlights of the first constitution in Germany include the "Empire Act on the Basic Rights of the German nation". Human rights and citizen rights -including news, speech and rally freedom were written into law for the first time in Germany. The bill even plans to abolish the death penalty, but in fact, this goal was realized after a hundred years.</p>
<p>The Imperial Constitution passed in March 1849, nearly a year later, the new federal unified German unified country will include all members of the Federal Federation of the Federal Federal Federation except Austria. The head of state is still the emperor. Although the constitution still gives the emperor a considerable power, he will be subject to the parliament. The parliament is elected by all (male) nationals, direct, and secret elections.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T12-14-00Z/65627375_401.jpg" />King Frederick-William IV</p>
<h3><strong> King does not want to be emperor </strong></h3>
<p>However, the constitutional plan of the National Parliament is not an acceptable solution to the ruler of the host (Frankfurt at the time). At that time, most members wanted to make King Frederick William IV of King Prussia a German emperor, but he refused. He believes that as the monarch himself is the only legal rule of the monarchy. Except for Frederick William IV, people did not consider other options at that time, because there was no cooperation with the largest Prussian, the constitutional founding of the country could not talk about it.</p>
<p>The efforts of all constituents and the establishment of a nation -state country have lost their efforts. The power of the royalist quickly took advantage of the wind, and the people's support for democracy became weakened.</p>
<p>The historian Engelhson pointed out that the reason for the failure is "the most wrong political strategy of the National Assembly." The Liberal Liberals who played the role of the Parliament "do not want to build a German Republic, but to establish a national country based on a constitutional monarchy, and believe that the princes will eventually accept this plan." When this result did not appear, the liberals could not come up with another solution to implement its goals.</p>
<p>In May 1849, the National Assembly of Frankfurt disbanded itself. The parliament's "residual department" moved to Stuttgart for several months. In the summer of 1849, the last revolutionary struggle was also suppressed by military. The German unity and the freedom democratic movement of the great hope was painted.</p>

<p>From February 6th to August 21st, 1919, the German Constitution of National Constitution was held in the former palace theater of Weima, Turinen. 423 candidate representatives faced arduous tasks: establish a temporary government, formulate the democratic constitution, and sign a peace treaty with the victory allies.</p>

<h3>Berlin Mainly Magnote</h3>
<p>Germany was defeated in World War I, and 17 million people were killed in this war. The allies have pointed out that Germany is responsible for provoking war. The emperor's exile and abroad. In the just -born Republic, protests and riots rioted one after another, and the civil war broke out. The picture shows a demonstration of Berlin workers on May 11, 1919.</p>

<h3>Imperial Parliament suffered</h3>
<p>In this case, the soldiers entered the Imperial Parliament of Berlin, which could not be used as a place for the National Conference. The construction management department of Berlin said in a report in May 1919 that the internal facilities of the parliament building were severely damaged and filthy. They must be completely disinfected and renovated first, and they could not be used as a parliamentary workplace.</p>

<h3>师 Weima</h3>
<p>As a result, members moved the meeting place to a relatively quiet small town Weimar. The venue -the former court theater was renamed the "German National Theater". Compared with Berlin, Weima is easy to defend. Thousands of people guard, and the entire urban area is prohibited from entering and exiting. The picture shows a postcard released in 1919. But what I can't see in the picture is that there are soldiers holding machine guns on the balcony around the streets around the theater.#</p>

<h3>"Intimacy"</h3>
<p>The venue space is limited, and members have to shorten each other's distance. The conference elected the Communist Party's Democratic Party Friedrichebert as the president. The Social Democratic Party is the largest party of the parliament, and the second and third largest parties are the Catholic Center Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. These three parties formed the "Weimar United Government". On July 31, 1919, the Constitutional Conference passed the new constitution.</p>

<h3>"National Power from the People"</h3>
<p>The Weimar Constitution is the first democratic constitution in Germany, and the draft is the liberal national jurist Hugo Preuß. Eduarddavid, Politicians of the Social Democratic Party, said that with this constitution, Germany is "the world's most democratic democratic country". From the perspective of conservative politician Konstantinfehrenbach, Germans have become "the most free on the earth on the earth The nation.</p>

<h3>The constitution of "Congenital Insufficient"</h3>
<p>On August 11, 1919, President Albert signed a new constitution at Schlosschwarzburg near Weimar. In the Weimar Republic, setting up the post of president is also a checks and balance force of the parliament. The term of office is 7 years. It is directly generated by the election and has extensive permissions.</p>

<h3>"Democratic countries without democrats"</h3>
<p>Albert (left) and Konradadenauer are two key politicians in German history. Adenner was the mayor of Cologne at the time, and after 1945, he became the first prime minister in German history. The reason why the Republic of Weimar failed was that the ordinary people and elites in Germany had not yet established democracy. The Republic of Weimar is known as "democratic countries without democrats."</p>

<h3>No answer to the answer</h3>
<p>When Albert sworn in the Constitution on August 21, 1919, no celebration and grand ceremony were held. However, many people gathered on Weimar's theater square. Today, a topic that people are still arguing after 1995 are to to to torson to to what extent the "innate deficiency" of the first democratic constitution in Germany has accelerated the decline of Weima Republic and the rise of Hitler.</p>

<h3>'s lesson</h3>
<p>The foundation of the Federal German political system today is the Basic Law. Compared with the Weimar Republic, the president's authority is obviously weakened; at the same time, the possibility of the public through the referendum directly affects political decision -making. The role of political parties in shaping political will is clearly written into the constitution. In addition, the parliament set up a 5%threshold for voting rates to prevent the parliamentary parties from split into many small parties. On the 95th anniversary of the Constitutional Conference of the Weimar Republic, the Berlin Museum held a special exhibition on February 7.</p>

Although it has passed for nearly half a year, the participants of the white paper movement are still rare to tell the real situation of the movement. Ms. Shi from Beijing recently accepted an exclusive interview with this reporter Wang Yun, telling the scene of the Beijing Liangmaqiao and White Paper Movement she had witnessed, and analyzed the current situation of Chinese society. The interviewees were unwilling to disclose the full name for safety reasons.</p>

<p>Ms. Shi: I work in Beijing. My education is completed in Beijing. I have studied trade undergraduate. Then I am in the United States. This master's degree is related to technology. The career experience is basically in foreign companies, it is an American company, and then my job is to consult, about three or four years; I later do my own company, which is equivalent to my own business.</p>
<p>Reporter: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: Yes, my home is doing business. It has been done for a long time, but then I also did it myself. My own business has nothing to do with the one at home.</p>
<p><strong> "All the cars on the Third Ring Road are pressing the horn" </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: You went to the white paper campaign in Beijing's Liangmaqiao. What day is it? What did you do at the time?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: On November 27, 2022, I went to it when I was dark, and I went at night, and then left until three or four o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Reporter: If you leave so late, have you encountered harassment or arrest of the police?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: I saw this activity in WeChat's "Friendship Circle", only to find that there were so many people there. I realized that there must be the kind of rally similar to Shanghai there. Before that, I planned that if Beijing happened, I would go right away. At that time, after seeing the news, I didn't hesitate. I packed and asked my friends to go together. But when I went, I found that if we entered the Liangma Bridge along the East Third Ring Road, we must drive from the main road to the auxiliary road, and we can enter the scene. However, near Liangma Bridge, the road that can drive the car down and enter the auxiliary road is basically blocked. A lot of cars are in this slow state on the main road. At that time, I could hear the sound of shouting slogans. At that time, it was quite spectacular. All the cars on all the third ring roads were pressed by the horn. They also used the horn to show that I came to support. Then our car was slow at that time, and when I was about to be, I was more anxious. At that time, the isolation band of the main road and the auxiliary road was the isolation of the shrub. There was a gap in the middle. Then I hurried at the time. I got out of the bus to the auxiliary road from that bush, and then walked to that event. on site. But when my friend stopped and returned, he did not come in. He said that there were all police officers there, and he would not let it go at all.</p>

<p>Ms. Shi: Of course. Because it is not a large empty field, it is a few intersections from the main road, including the kind of intersection, including the city that does not take the ring in the city, and you have intercepted those roads. In fact, you can't get in at all.</p>
<p>Reporter: Do you go to the scene to express support?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: Participate at the scene.</p>
<p><strong> "I can't wait for the face to face the face" </strong> **</p>
<p>Reporter: We know that some of them shouted political slogans. Have you participated in such actions?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: I have been walking towards the slogan and speech, which is equivalent to saying that they have reached the center. At that time, everyone surrounded them a few laps, so I drilled inside. Then I want to take a picture too, I want to record this, so I kept drilling in, and then I kept holding my phone, from my arrival at the scene, to the departure, I have always been at their scene (participating) Essence Later, I also saw it from other video channels. In fact, those characters in the center of the field were actually around them, in a relatively core area. Including the police later, when a large number of policemen came to disperse, in fact, I also stood at the forefront. I also had in my video. I was the police in front of me. I was the first. Face.</p>
<p>Reporter: During your time in Beijing's Liangma Bridge, did someone you knew were arrested?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: No. Because I just passed with my friend, in fact, I didn't know if anyone I knew was inside. At that time, I didn't ask. The people I saw around me were strangers. Then, I knew that those who were caught were also afterwards. After the end, I knew that I saw the arrest on the media.Reporter: Can you explain why you want to participate in this operation, especially you are your child's mother, why do you think you have such courage to participate in white paper sports.</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: What do I think, that is, this white paper movement should be regarded as the largest anti -government movement in China after the June 4th Studies Games in 1989. During this period, many years, the government replaced leaders, including the development of economic development and various events, but China was in a state of silence. In recent years, speech control and such policy pressure have been too strong, and it is too backward. This is a political level; the other is the epidemic. In the past three years of the epidemic, the physical control of human flesh, the spirit of the human spirit, the spirit of the human spirit in the past three years. Best imprisonment, I think it is the feeling in a very, very, very, like a high -pressure cooker. I think this is a very, very exciting, and a very rare opportunity. It is one of the most basic dignity that everyone can show a person. I think this is an opportunity to realize self -realization or self -reliance. Mr. Peng, who wrote a banner like the Sitong Bridge, is too brave after all. He is a lonely hero. A behavior like him, few people have this courage, that is, the one who lives and dies, the one that is relieved and depends on In the case, I can't say that I can reach that kind of state, but this shouting slogan stands with them to express my wish, and I think I must do this.</p>
<p><strong> "What will be changed" </strong> **</p>
<p>Reporter: So, do you think you do this and go to the white paper movement of Liangma Bridge, the danger is not very high. Is this that?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: I think there are danger. Because I experienced the "June 4th" when I was young, everyone who had experienced June 4th knew that this danger was sudden, and the danger was not in your prediction. No one predicted that I was not dangerous. No one predicted that I would definitely be in danger. Because this government's behavior or the development of this movement is not transferred by your personal will, maybe it was really too excited at that time. Then the government may have some very violent measures, which are possible. Someone at the scene told us that the police were here immediately, and then everyone was ready. Maybe they would have the tear gas. They said that this possibility was available. We also thought at the time, okay, anyway, we are already here, it doesn't matter, what's the situation.</p>
<p>Reporter: When you are standing in the ranks of this white paper movement, do you think your actions can change?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: In fact, it has changed. The most basic thing is that the sealing control is over, right, but we did not expect that in the end, we stopped abruptly and suddenly turned 180 degrees. Then I think this is basically the result of the white paper movement after pressure on the government. There is another change, I think it means psychological changes. In a state where the country is now so powerful, in a state of power, and power, when you do n’t say it, I do n’t say that when everyone is silent, in fact, anyone is in the heart, that is, may Different, his thoughts are different from me, or he really did not intend to say that he would stand up when he needed him. At this time, everyone is speculating, because in the Chinese environment and the environment of Mainland China are very sensitive and very sensitive. In fact, in our WeChat circle, even when relatives and friends have to speak very cautiously, they dare not fully open their hearts and let others see your own wishes. However, a very good result of the white paper movement is that everyone sees it. Oh, so many people are actually the same as themselves, and they have the courage. When they need them, they can stand up. Then you Not very lonely.</p>

(Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/wy-05182023103404.html/2022-11-27t000000z_1994578084_rc2kux9jum8x_rtrmadp_3_health-coronavirus-china.jpg"></a>Reporter: You are talking about some changes after exercise, including changes in policy. My problem is that when you are participating, you feel that this action can change something, right?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: It will definitely change, because it will have no such large demonstration and such spontaneous emotions for so many years, it will definitely work. And its scale is so wide, isn't that many cities have erupted?</p>
<p><strong> Why are women standing in front? </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: In this campaign, we see that women, especially young women stand in front, are outstanding in their performance, and most of them seem to be caught.</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: First of all, women are more emotional from her emotion, because the outbreak of this incident is the fire incident of Urumqi, Xinjiang, including the bus incident before before. This news. In fact, in this process, I feel that like women are emotional stimulus than men, and they are also for women. In fact, this process is only more complex than men. Persemed and complex, including work, family, children and society ...</p>
<p>Reporter: You are a mother. What you just said is your personal experience, is it?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: Yes, first of all, I think the tentacles of women are more keen and wider, because children and parents involved in the family also need to balance work and family. These things are actually very depressed in the process of sealing and control. It is also unimaginable by men, and anxiety is also unimaginable by men, and in the case of women's emotional affection, her courage may be stronger than men. Men will think more.</p>
<p>Reporter: From the perspective of the whole movement, everyone said that this movement is decentralized, but we noticed that it happened in many large cities across the country. Do you think this is completely spontaneous?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: I think it must be spontaneous. Because the source of people on the streets is many aspects, not like the June 4th Student Games in 1989, they started mainly from young students. As soon as the white paper movement comes up, it is a mixture, which is the class of all aspects of society, triggering it, or the last straw that overwhelm the camel, isn't it constantly controlling? This kind of unscientific and unscientific policy continuation, then this kind of thing is actually penetrated into every family cell, whether you are a worker family, a professor family, a doctor family, your face face, your face face That policy is the same, and your feelings are the same. Therefore, the source of the participants in the exercise is all aspects. He is not a very organized, forming a core concept in a group, and then how to do it, it is a complex towards this street. Therefore, I think it is spontaneous overall.Reporter: You mentioned that this movement involves all strata of society. Now the movement has passed for half a year. In the past six months, many major events have occurred in China. Not only white paper movements, but also some social events such as Foxconn workers' strike. After that half a year later, what do you think of the depressed dissatisfaction and anger in this society?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: I am now abroad, but I can also realize that I can feel the domestic situation. I think that because the sealing and control at that time was an informal thing. It was not completely spiritual. It was a state of tortured by the flesh. People have reached the limit. When you open this cage, you will be opened. Although it is said that this cage is opened, you will have some feelings from the flesh, but does your spiritual cricket still have not changed? Then I think that when the flesh gets a little liberation, people's pressure will be soothing. Many people can continue to work. He will have a little income. Some people's economic conditions will sooth. Soothing. But after the epidemic, your political atmosphere is still the same, and the control is still stricter. Then there are such slowly economic sluggish economic sluggish, and the employment market has deteriorated sharply. This kind of pressure is a panic and dissatisfaction in his heart.</p>
<p>"<strong> There are many panic and dissatisfaction" </strong> **</p>
<p>Reporter: You personally do small enterprises, and you are also a family with a business background. From this perspective, what do you think of the current Chinese economy for the environment of private enterprises?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: Of course it is not good. There are so many tide of the company's failure, and the industry does not hear which friend around him says that doing things is very smooth. It is very difficult or some simply stagnate. There are also a lot of immigrants, because if they have some savings in their hands, they may not be able to see hope.</p>
<p>Reporter: Do you still have a lot of dissatisfaction in society. Do you think China may still happen similar to white paper movement?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: It depends on this, I think it depends on how high this society is squeezing to people? But I think this government, this Communist Party is also amazing, that is, when he pressures to the limit, or when he is fragile to the limit, he always seems to have a magic when he can't do it. Not really falling down. I think that his control is too strict, that is, his mental control is really too important, and from force to culture to all aspects, his control is subtle to capillaries, including this epidemic prevention and control is also subtle In the community, this mandatory control ability is indeed too powerful. I think that in fact, the pressure is large enough, and the dissatisfaction of the people's dissatisfaction with the government is great enough, but can it evolve into a fierce event or a spoiler, I think this is caused by a balance. What is your courage and how large the scale is, and then how much the government's balance and suppression are. I think unless there is a large -scale mobilization now, I think he will be very powerful for that kind of mild sports signs. And discovered in time, he has this ability.</p>

Many people think that this also reflects the vulnerability of this system. What do you think of this problem?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: Of course, he has a way to suppress it. When white paper moved, he did not use the extreme means of "June 4th", but when he needed it, he would use it as a last resort. This is the lesson of the front car. Absolutely, if you use that, everyone will be afraid, to be honest, that real knife and real gun, shooting such things, can he not suppress it, at least it will be extinguished for a period of time, right? Essence When the gun is in the hands of a person, how can he not suppress it, and he can definitely suppress it.</p>
<p>Reporter: As you said, the guns are in their hands. Then, in addition to the actions like white paper movements like white paper movements, do you think you can still use other disagreement to promote the country's changes?</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: I think there are many ways, that is, according to your own, such as your own cognition and your location in society. For example, some people can write some articles. Some friends around me have the courage to repost the very sensitive article that will be deleted immediately. This is already very courageous. As an individual, I think it can only be said that within the scope of my ability, I have a little courage, whether some words, and some articles can be reposted, and give some people around them. If you don't care about yourself, don't say anything you dare not say anything.</p>

"We are happy with this progress." Huang Yingxian said at a joint press conference held at a joint press conference with Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo during his visit to Manila. "We really believe that eliminating these trade obstacles is beneficial to both parties." <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳外长在北京愿促两国明智地处理分歧/a-64178269"></a>Australian Finance Minister Jimchalmers said that China's decision to cancel the wood ban is a step ahead of the goal of stable economic relations between China and Australia. "This is a vital market for us. We hope to stabilize this relationship. Welcome to make any progress in canceling trade restrictions." Chammer told reporters.</p>
<p>The Australian Limelin Products and Paper Industry Association also welcomed China's decision. Joelfitzgibbon, CEO of the association, said in a statement, "When the ban took effect more than two years ago, it brought huge turbulence and uncertainty to many wood exporters and other forestry departments. We welcome This decision. "</p>
<p>China is the largest trading partner in Australia, with a total bilateral trade of 287 billion US dollars last year.</p>
<p>In April, Australia withdrew appealed to the World Trade Organization on the barley ban in China. In return, China agrees to re -consider the decision to impose 80%tariffs on Australian grains. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/关系改善-中澳将谈判解决大麦争端/a-65277773"></a>(Associated Press)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05102023174311.html"></a>It is mentioned that the Australian Institute of Strategy (ASPI) revealed the image of the Communist Party of China using spam to create a network influence and fully creating the image of the American "network hegemony".</p>
<p>ASPI also analyzed the cooperative account number on social media, and found that the Yancheng Public Security Bureau was closely related to the actions of the honeypot. Through the details of the publicity post, it further revealed that the online company <a href="https://www.qianxin.com/"></a>Contact network with other Chinese government agencies.</p>
<p>ASPI shows that Qi Anxin, which belongs to Pangu Lab, may support the CCP's network influence operation by providing publicity materials. As a part of the actions of the honey, Qi Anxin Company has taken the influence of its own network security services to promote the product to the Belt and Road countries.</p>
<p><strong> The mysterious mission of the Yancheng Public Security Bureau </strong></p>
<p>ASPI collects accounts that spread the article "One of the U.S. Hegemony" articles and find that the relationship between these accounts is connected to the Salt City Public Security Bureau. Some of these accounts are photos of police or police stations. This is closely related to the China Salt City Public Security Bureau. Contacting the network also points to China's public security agencies may be one of the key actors of the Chinese propaganda system on the American and Chinese social media platforms.</p>
<p>"Tell the story of Yancheng Police and show the safe image of Yancheng." In 2018, Wang Qiaoquan, deputy mayor of Yancheng and director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, <a href="https://www.yancheng.gov.cn/art/2018/6/8/art_94_1447409.html"></a>Say this way.</p>
<p>ASPI explained that since 2019, political and legal organs across China have always followed Xi Jinping's instructions to comprehensively improve the ability to guide public opinion and spread propaganda. The Yancheng Public Security Bureau is famous for police propaganda work. In June 2018, the Ministry of Public Security of China held a seminar on the title of "the first Pearl of Ping An China?" Members learn from salt city.</p>
<p>China's political and legal system is also known for controlling "network commentators". Chen Yixin, then Secretary -General of the Central Political and Legal Committee in 2018 <a href="https://www.voachinese.com/a/news-china-build-up-web-forces-20180906/4560222.html"></a>Political and legal cadres, police and propagandists have opened social media accounts, "focusing on cultivating the big V of political and legal Internet celebrities, studying new strategies, new battlefields, and new warfares", affecting online public opinion and controlling hot topics.</p>
<p>** How do Chinese government agencies hiding behind spamouflage?</p>
<p>However, ASPI also mentioned that although the police of the Public Security Bureau may participate in coordinating the SPAMOUFLAGE publicity activities, production content and operation of certain social media accounts, they are extremely unlikely to directly control all fake accounts, because most posts are mainly working hours. Published.</p>
<p>ASPI pointed out that when Chinese government officials, including police, published comments on Chinese social platforms in a hidden manner, they are usually published outside of working hours. However, this wave of Spamouflage's publicity activities are all "996" in Beijing time (work at 9 am, get off work at 9 pm, and work 6 days a week.) Published. ASPI speculates that the fake account operation on most community media may be outsourcing for a group of specially trained network commentators. They are employed by the Yancheng Office or a commercial company of the China Internet Information Office (CAC).</p>
<p>ASPI passes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221115214948/https:/www.bidcenter.com.cn/newscontent-118477922-4.html"></a>Find the most direct evidence of commercial company intervention -Salt City Public Security Bureau signed a contract with Beijing Smart Starlight Information Technology Co., Ltd. to provide online public opinion monitoring and push notification services.</p>
<p>In addition, ASPI is in 2021 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221202031801/https:/www.sohu.com/a/447895005_120178083"></a>It is confirmed that Yancheng hirs network commentators, and reports that the Yantong Municipal Party Committee's Internet Information Office organized the social benefits of the city's Internet information service units in 2020, and online commentators were invited to it. and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230116050427/https:/www.sohu.com/a/449238029_120178083"></a>Dong Guangwei, then director of the Yancheng Cyber Information Office and deputy director of the Yantong City Propaganda Department, insisted on asking the local government to build a "Internet Iron Army" to implement rectification.</p>

In 2018, the two units jointly held the "City Public Opinion Safety Fair" in 2018. The network environment.After confirming the employment of the Yantong Network Information Office, ASPI analyzed a name [] in the spamouflage network(https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23319046-xin-yuan-jie-yi-zhi-hu)It is determined that this person is likely to be an online commentator hired by the Internet Information Office.</p>
<p>ASPI pointed out that before 2022, "Aragaki Yui" suddenly reposted a large number of American hegemonic articles, and the male perspective of "couples traveling together is easy to break up", and another article "Which men may not know that women may not know "Common sense", it is speculated that this account is likely to be operated by a young man.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T13-34-00-04-00/000003.png" />A Zhihu account called "Aragaki Yui" has collected many men's perspectives in the past.

Those who do not have a college degree cannot become government civil servants. This is also the reason why ASPI inflection of this wind direction operation is not directly intervene by government agencies.</p>
<p><strong> How do Qi Anxin Company expand the public opinion arsenal for honey? </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Yancheng Public Security Bureau, the weapon in this entire public opinion battle was owned by Qi Anxin Company <a href="https://www.pangulab.cn/"></a>The network security report was launched.</p>
<p>In December 2017, at that time, China Network Security Company Qi Anxin still operated business in the name of "360 Enterprise Security Group". At the launching ceremony of China's "Network Space Security Military and Civilian Innovation Center", the chairman Qi Xiangdong pointed out that "cyber terrorist attacks, network terrorist attacks, networks, networks, networks, network terrorist attacks, network terrorist attacks, network terrorist attacks, networks, Economic crimes and cyber public opinion chaos has become a global public. Cyber security is related to national security, regime consolidation, social stability, and victory in war. "</p>
<p>At that time, Qi Xiangdong was also a member of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Daping (Network Security). The organization was under the jurisdiction of the United Front Work Department. Fan Youshan, deputy secretary of the Party Group of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, praised that the committee did well in controlling the public opinion of the Communist Party of China and helping China to become a "online power".</p>
<p>ASPI believes that these remarks strongly show that Qi Anxin is intended to pursue the CCP's goals through manipulating the public opinion of the Internet under the leadership of Qi Xiangdong.</p>
<p>Qi Anxin Company was known as the 360 Enterprise Security Group and was a subsidiary of the 360 Group. In 2019, Qi Anxin and the 360 Group were officially separated. In 2020, the Qi Anxin was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>When Qi Anxin was still known as the 360 Enterprise Security Group, he signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Yancheng Public Security Bureau, and also launched two new cooperation centers. Cooperation Center "and" Cyber Prevention and Campaign of International Cooperation Research Center ". Essence In 2020, Qi Anxin provided a firewall system for the Jiangsu Provincial Government, including salt cities.</p>
<p>In addition to the cooperation on the countertop, Qi Anxin and the Yancheng Public Security Bureau also inferred that Qi Anxin was closely related to this Spamouflage through some indirect evidence.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T13-34-00-04-00/000004.png" />While ASPI points out that Qi Anxin cooperates with the Chinese government strategy, it is also closely related to the Spamouflage network. (ASPI Report Picture) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05182023132518.html/4-aspi9ede51fa59475b894fe182074e2d570b653f5e9c7b56756554084f5c7684540c6642-4e5f8207spamouflage7db28def67095bc6520795dc806f3002-aspi5831544a57167247-1.png"></a>Some SPAMOUFLAGE accounts use the logo of 360 companies in the picture stickers, suggesting that Chinese network security companies are defending themselves to resist NSA's network attack. ASPI pointed out that the SPAMOUFLAGE network has never used the Chinese corporate logo in propaganda materials. It is currently unclear, but it may be to promote China's network security company.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T13-34-00-04-00/000005.png" />The yellow -green logo in the picture is the trademark of the 360 Enterprise Security Group.

<p>Aspi believes that, like other Chinese companies, business activities are often consistent with the interests of the CCP's foreign policy. According to Wu Yunkun, the current president of Qi Anxin, Qi Anxin exported network security services to the Belt and Road countries to protect Chinese companies such as Huawei or China Electronic Information Industry Group.</p>
<p>In 2019, Qi Xiangdong, chairman of Qi Anxin, and the chairman of the Indonesian Ag Group, Tomywinata, signed an agreement at the Belt and Road International Cooperation Summit forum to establish a network threatening infrastructure platform.</p>
<p>Guo Safeng is a wealthy Chinese businessman in Indonesia and is closely related to Chinese political and business. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-feb-06-mn-61708-story.html"></a>Guo Shufeng assisted the Chinese military intelligence department to donate funds to the US Democratic candidate through Charlietrie illegal channels, which became a part of the US campaign in 1996.According to Qi Anxin, cooperation with AG Group is the first large -scale overseas network security infrastructure project launched by AG Group. According to ASPI analysis, the Chinese Communist Party may regard the agreement as an opportunity to establish a closer relationship with Indonesia's politics and military elites.</p>
<p>In addition, ASPI also pointed out that Qi Anxin is a key role in Chinese technology diplomacy. One month after the Pangu Laboratory of Qi Anxin published the APT attack report of the National Security Agency, Qi Anxin invited 20 military military officers from 18 Middle East and African countries to show Qi Anxin's full set of network security products. ASPI believes that Qi Anxin issued this report to persuade the military and political elites of the Belt and Road countries, and China Cyber Security Corporation has the ability to monitor American network operations.</p>

<p>The Internet influence of the Communist Party of China is still part of the global public opinion and enhanced China's "international discourse" strategy, but ASPI believes that the Chinese Communist Party's secretary strategies and tools that affect international public opinion are very Big change.</p>
<p>ASPI pointed out that these actions promoted public opinion facing a more favorable position to the CCP, and even interfered with the political decision -making process of other countries. Through the use of emerging technologies of Chinese local network security companies, these actions have given the CCP's secret action on the Western social platforms to give new new actions on the Western social platforms.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T13-48-00-04-00/000000.png" />The CCP frequently scares Wu Tong Taiwan. Many netizens in the mainland said that they did not want to fight or let their children go. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05182023121606.html/@@images/image"></a>Reuters information picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05182023121606.html/@@stream"></a>Audience friends, hello everyone. What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Talk about the situation of the Taiwan Strait today.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has caused heated discussions in the Chinese Internet. The sound of clamoring Taiwan's Taiwan has been questioned, and it is considered unrealistic and even dangerous. Under a strict review system, these remarks have not only been deleted, but also kept on the Internet. This can not help but make people associate, perhaps the Beijing authorities have acquiesced and let it spread and fermented in the Internet, so as to calm the tension atmosphere and the image of poor soldiers brought by Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong> Multiple fronts surrounding ring </strong></p>
<p>"Nikkei Asia" (Nikkei ASIA) Katsujinakazawa, president of the Chinese branch, analyzed on May 11th that some anonymous writing articles that have completely denied China "Wolf Diplomacy" are reproduced on major websites. These articles Emphasizing that China may fall into the "four fronts" surrounded. Another opinion made more and more people believe that those who shouted Wu Tong Taiwan were extremely stupid.</p>
<p>The first front of the four fronts is in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas, and the Chinese army will face the US, Japan and Taiwan troops. Article 2 The front is on the Korean Peninsula, and the Chinese army will confront the US and South Korean troops. Article 3 The front is in the South China Sea and the South Pacific. The Chinese army will face the US and Australian troops. If the United States controls the Malacca Strait and counterattacks China in the South China Sea, Beijing will see that China's energy supply is interrupted and cannot maintain economic development. In the South Pacific, the Australian army has the key to geopolitical. Article 4 The front of the front is on the border between China and India. In 2020, the first conflict and casualties in the 45 years in China and India have been deadlocked.</p>
<p>In March last year, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi explained China's strategic situation at the press conference of the two conferences and was surrounded by the "Indo -Pacific Strategy" led by the United States. He said that the United States excreted the "May 432" formation in the Asia -Pacific region, including strengthening the "Five Eye Alliance" (the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), and promoted the "four -sided mechanism" (the United States, Japan, India, Australia, QUAD, QUAD ) The establishment of the "three -sided security partnership" (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Aukus), and the United States tightened the bilateral military alliances with Asia -Pacific countries.</p>
<p>Wang Yi also said that the real purpose of the "Indo -Pacific Strategy" is to try to engage in the "NATO" of the Indo -Pacific version. The implication is to curb and block China, just like NATO to be siege in Russia.</p>
<p>In fact, the five -eye alliance, four -sided mechanism and three -sided security partnerships do not include military obligations. The United States and Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia bilateral military alliances are also different from NATO's common defense principles. However, China has determined that these multilateral security mechanisms are all targeted at China and also cover the relevant countries in the four "front lines". These countries have a joint intersection, both bilateral or multi -sides emphasize the importance of maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T13-48-00-04-00/000001.png" />Xi Jinping's criminals will be caught in many ways. (Reuters picture) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05182023121606.html/image.png"></a><strong> Live and move the whole body </strong></p>
<p>It can be said that the Taiwan Strait Front in the "Four Front" is the core interest of China's strategic interests. For China, other fronts may be distinguished. Only the Taiwan Strait Front involves the so -called sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The "Strategy Studies" published by the Chinese military described Taiwan, which is a must -have place from the East China Sea to the South China Sea, Northeast Asia to Southeast Asia, western Pacific to the Middle East and Eurasia. It is a strategic breakthrough point in China's strategic breakthrough and coastal defense barrier that cross the Pacific Ocean's strategic breakthrough to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>If Taiwan is split from China, China will lose its depth of strategic defense at sea, the portal of the sea is open, and the large marine land and marine resources will fall into the hands of others. The foreign trade and foreign traffic lines of China ’s opening up and economic development of the country will be under the monitoring and threat of hostile forces, and China will always be closed west of the Western Pacific No. 1 Island Chain. As a result, China's national security is not only seriously threatened, but the strategic space for national rejuvenation will also be strangled.</p>
<p>Conversely, if China occupies Taiwan, the geopolitical pattern of Asia -Pacific's geographical strategy has changed. The other three fronts pose a major threat to China.</p>
<p>The "Strategic Studies" published by the PLA states that the war that China may face in the future is to protect the unity of the motherland and defend the national territorial sovereignty and marine rights. No matter which strategic direction, it involves complex international backgrounds, and multiple forces may join forces to deal with China. In particular, the war of maintaining the unity of the motherland and the defending territorial sovereignty and rights in the direction of the ocean will be carried out in an unusually complicated international context, and the possibility of "multiple parties involved in multiple parties" will appear.</p>
<p>Under earlier, the PLA should put the preparation of the preparation of the war planning on the challenges that can meet the challenges of China. At the same time, make full use of the advantages of China's great powers to create favorable strategic trends from the fields of politics, diplomacy, and economy, minimize the strategic risks of external forces to deal with China's strategic risks, avoid triggering chain reactions, fall into multi -line operations, and grasp the strategic focus. In the same period, there can be only one main combat direction. Therefore, it can be understood in this way. Once multiple fronts appear, the Taiwan Strait area is the main battle direction, and the other is the secondary battle direction. The war resources are also allocated according to the primary and secondary differences.</p>
<p><strong> War action nature type </strong></p>
<p>The works of the PLA National Defense University pointed out that war operations are divided into three types: prevention of military operations, urgent (or controlled) military operations, decisive (or decisive) military operations.</p>
<p>The so -called preventive military operations are in the strategic direction that is about to occur or has already occurred. China develops military deterrent or combat operations that prevent the crisis from exacerbating crisis and deterioration. Its nature is generally a major non -war military operations and small -scale and low -intensity operations. Including real soldiers exercises, border warning, emergency combat preparation, or setting up forbidden zones and navigation areas, implementing special operations and small -scale joint operations. In 1996, the Taiwan Strait missile crisis was a famous case. The military exercise was long and strong, and the essence was preventive. It stopped Taiwan's "Taiwan independence".In terms of decision -making (or decisive) military operations, China conducts a combat to protect the fundamental interests of the country in the main strategic direction that seriously endangers the threat of the national security war. Its nature is generally secondaryly in a comprehensive war, or a large -scale combat operation, with a decisive battle, similar to the Korean War in the early 1950s (known as the Anti -US Aid War in China), which has been fighting for 3 years. The essence is decisive, curbing the US military to the side of the Yalu River, and endangering the security and stability of the entire Northeast and even the whole country.</p>
<p>During the Korean War, China faced two battle directions. One on the Northeast border of China is directly facing the US military's pressure; the other is the Kuomintang Chiang Kai -shek army who wants to counterattack the mainland in the southeast. Mao Zedong finally decided to move north, using the northeast as the main battle direction, concentrated his forces to face the US military, and refused to enemy the country. The southeast direction turned into a secondary battle direction and put on the attack on Taiwan. Today's strategic environment has changed, and the southeast coast has become the focus of all strategic directions.</p>
<p>According to the nature of historical experience and the nature of war actions, how will China deal with multiple fronts at the same time in the future?</p>
<p><strong> The probability of war on Taiwan's decisive war is very low </strong></p>
<p>A reasonable reasoning is that once multiple fronts appear in the germination stage of crisis, China will carry out preventive military operations as much as possible, and take military deterrence as the main means to avoid increasing crisis and deterioration. If the deterrent cannot be achieved, it will change the military operations of acute (or control), control the situation, and prevent the upgrading of war.</p>
<p>If you can solve the problem through military deterrence, you will not resort to force; if you can solve the problem with a small war, you will not develop or develop towards the medium -sized war or war. Twenty years ago, the PLA proposed a strategic guidance on the war, emphasizing the preparations for doing combat tasks in the two strategic directions: while implementing decisive operations in the main strategic direction, in another secondary strategic direction Preventive or urgent and controlled strategic operations and operations.</p>
<p>To this day, the important works of the PLA proposed that China may face multiple front fronts that may face multiple strategic directions, and may face the situation of multiple opponents to deal with China. The situation is more complicated than 20 years ago. in this way. The Taiwan Strait front moves and moves the whole body.</p>
<p>For the nature of war actions, from the three types of prevention, urgent (or control) to decisive (or decisive), are still applicable to today. It can be said that the Taiwan Strait Front is the only area that may launch a decisive war in the eyes of Beijing. Other fronts will be limited to the scope of preventive and urgent and controlled military operations.</p>
<p>However, it should also be seen that within 10 years, China's probability of launching a decisive war against Taiwan is very low, and it will hardly happen. Because there are many strategic deterrence methods to Taiwan or the United States to intervene in the Taiwan Strait. In addition to using joint military exercises many times, it can also use restricted military operations similar to blocking and forced isolation, as well as a small -scale warning military for a specific target of Taiwan. Strikes, there is relatively broad space for deterrence.</p>
<p>No signs show that Beijing will abandon more gray areas tactics and directly in place. Choose the most cost -effective decisive war war in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Description: A few days ago, the China International Relations Expert Group, who participated in a global think tank summit, called on global relations to be more "tolerant", saying that the West and China should "help each other".

<p>(Voice of Germany) from May 15-16, 2023, the annual Global Solutions Summit2023 was held in Berlin, Germany. Think tank experts from the world discussed with a number of issues such as global multilateral relations, environmental protection, digital construction, economic, social welfare and sustainable development.</p>
<p>At the two "China-WestDialogue) talks on May 16, China exchanged active exchanges with European and American scholars. The two sides strived to emphasize that China and the West should have in -depth exchanges and open mentality, and basically avoided the topic of direct relationship with the Sino -US game.</p>
<p>Chen Dongxiao, director of the Shanghai Institute of International Issues and a member of the CPPCC, is the most noticeable expert at this summit. In June 2022, he published a signature article in China, "The serious impact of the Russian -Ukraine conflict on Sino -US relations". In this article, Chen claimed that the Chinese side believed that the Bayeng government was suspected of using <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯入侵乌克兰/t-60868685"></a>Inciting the opposition of "terrorist Russia and terrible", and unremittingly spare no effort between its Western allies to shape the "double curb" international environment of "curbing China" and "down Russia".</p>
<h3>"China is by no means against the West"</h3>
<p>Colin Bradford, a senior researcher at the global economic and development project from Brookings Institution(Colin Bradford)He is the host of the talks between China and the West. He said at the beginning that at such a "cold moment", Europe should play a balanced role before the United States and China, and "no one wants to choose the side station in such a two -pole situation." This is a positive response from the Chinese and European experts present, saying that "wrong bipolar thinking" has no benefits to the international community, and the discussion consensus is set to the reconstruction exchange and promotion collaboration.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T14-04-00Z/62238410_401.jpg" />"Europe should play a balance between the United States and China"</p>
<p>Chen Dongxiao believes that China always adheres to the "Goldenmiddle" attitude in the "Goldenmiddle" in the face of international issues. The two most concerned problems are: First, in the current diversified world situation, many complex reality has been excessively simplified in recent years; second, China and the West exchanges are far from enough. At the same time, he also proposed that the West and China should make concessions when facing different differences. But what do you need to "concession" and cooperate? And how to achieve cooperation on issues such as climate? Experts from Chinese and Western talks have not begun.</p>
<p>The use of vaccines also uses traditional Chinese medicine; but "China is by no means against the West." Western has too many misunderstandings about China. The two sides must understand each other, "Because we have a common future", Wang Yili said.</p>
<h3>For the same as "value"</h3>
<p>"SharedValues" is one of the focus of Chen Dongxiao. He said that countries should re -establish consensus, such as science and technology development, because the current world is a multiply (Multipola), and highly connected and interdependence ( Hypoconnectand International) World. Even if there is ideological conflict, countries should not overestimate the weight of "value difference".</p>
<p>The senior researcher at Yale University School of Law, Susanthornnton, agrees that countries should discuss each other's similarities with a humble attitude, instead of accusing who wrong who is wrong. "China and countries around the world are facing many similar issues. We should focus on these things, not in the difference. "</p>
<h3>Different from "organization and ideology"</h3>
<p>Wang Huiyao, chairman of Chen Dongxiao and China and Globalization Research Center (CCG), has repeatedly mentioned the emphasis on German Prime Minister Shulz, at present <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/肖尔茨欧盟不应成为美中之外的第三强权/a-65564276"></a>the concept of. Chen Dongxiao has emphasized that in modernization, China has always believed that the government's reliability, effective market, and vibrant society.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T14-04-00Z/65626447_401.jpg" />German Prime Minister Shulz also attended the summit last year</p>
<p>Regarding ideology, Wang Huiyao said that the international community should not only discuss the differences in "Autocracy andDemocracy", but should find a balance between each other. He said: "The West needs China and China also needs the West."</p>
<h3>Trust or tolerance first?</h3>
<p>At the end of the global solution summit, Chen Dongxiao's claimed core of international relations was "tolerance". However, in the Chinese and Western talks, experts have not been able to discuss the specific matters and methods that need to be solved in addition to expressing the urgent expectations of each other's understanding of each other. Some issues such as geopolitics and people's livelihood are only mentioned slightly.</p>
<p>In the closed talks of the second Sino -Western relations, Wang Yili, who had written the "NATO Research" series (ten volumes), proposed that the concept of "derisk" was misunderstood. He claims, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体脱钩与去风险/a-65647188"></a>(Decouple); at the same time, the experience that countries should learn from the Russian and Ukraine War are not about Russia's issues, but in Europe's security architecture.</p>
<p>In addition, individual experts advocate that geopolitics should not be allowed to dominate Sino -Western relations. Researcher Jonathanleher, a researcher from the Körber Stiftung from Germany, raised his objections that looking at the living crisis of various politics and battlefield people brought by the Russia -Ukraine War, geopolitics is the key to all issues of all issues. It is difficult for us not to be dominated.Keishabrown, a historical professor at the State University of Tennessee, is the only expert who proposed the "human perspective" in Sino -Western relations. She said that among the current so -called "polarization" differences, the people of China and the United States are often blurred, especially after the outbreak of the new crown, the relationship between the Chinese and American people has been severely damaged due to the situation of the game between the two countries. Brown proposed that the people's daily lives and exchanges should be distinguished from political differences to ensure that the communication between other levels such as studying abroad and non -profit organizations is operating normally.</p>
<p>In addition, the problem of trust between China and the West has been briefly mentioned. Researcher at the Institute of Public Policy (GPPI), a Berlin Global Public Policy Research Institute (GPPI), questioned: "If we know more about China, we will not feel threatened, but the problem is many things in China. We have no way to do it at all. to understand". Mareikeohlberg, an expert at the German Marshall Fund of the University, said that she can no longer enter China for her own experience.</p>

<p><strong> In less than a year, Sonak twice "rapid turns" </strong></p>
<p>When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was competing for the conservative party leader with Liztruss last July, he defined China as "the biggest long -term threat of Britain and the world economy and national security, and criticized Beijing uses Confucius Institute to expand soft power and penetrate British universities, threatening to close it after taking office. However, after taking office, he arrested the election commitment twice. Not only did he set China as a "threat" in the latest national defense diplomacy evaluation, but also "sharp turns" on the issue of the Confucius Institute.</p>
<p>Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader and a member of China, admitted that he was disappointed and criticized Sonak's "fundamental mistakes": "This is ridiculous, Confucius Institute and Language are completely complete It doesn't matter. The fact is that they are used to monitor specific Chinese students, especially Hong Kong students, track them, monitor them, and give feedback to China. This situation has been for a long time, but the government does not take action. Now there are at least 4 China in the UK. In the illegal police station, all governments are taking action. The Netherlands and the United States are severely cracking down, but we have no action. "</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Trask's speech in Taipei on Wednesday (17th) urged his successor Sonak to list China as a "threat" and immediately close the Confucius Institute in the UK. Essence</p>

<p>Samgoodman, the "Hong Kong Watch" policy and initiative, who has been paying attention to the topic of the Confucius Institute, analyzed to this station, relying on Taiwanese and Hong Kong people to undertake Confucius Institute's Chinese education and teacher training in Britain It is unrealistic: "There is a practical problem here, that is, after without the Confucius Institute, how can we train a whole generation of Chinese teachers? To deal with the authoritarian regime, we urgently need a Chinese teacher. So I think there is still a practical here. Demand issues. "</p>
<p>Earlier reports have disclosed that the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs has an average of only fourteen employees who receive training each year to use Chinese fluently. Goodman believes that retaining Confucius Institute has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that more British people learn Chinese, analyze and study original materials from China to help Britain better understand China's economic, diplomatic and security issues; however, Confucius; however, Confucius The college is directly controlled by the Communist Party of China and screened by the Chinese side by China. It spreads the CCP's ideology in various countries, and has long exceeded the role of ordinary language schools.</p>
<p>He believes that the British government must establish a sound mechanism to keep the Confucius Institute in order to ensure that its teachers are not assigned by China, and their teaching content is monitored to avoid the history of the CCP version and the Great Pass.</p>
<p><strong> Behind the Confucius Institute: The UK hopes to re -contact with Beijing </strong></p>
<p>Recently, British Foreign Minister James Cleverly emphasized in a speech on China that Britain will have a "strong and powerful and constructive" contact with China. It is expected to visit China this year.</p>
<p>Goodman believes that the British government's refusal to customize the Confucius Institute, in addition to the consideration of Chinese education and worrying about being retaliated with the British Culture Association in China, the background that cannot be ignored is that the British government is fully adjusted to China. In contact, I was careful everywhere, and I didn't want to make China unhappy.</p>
<p><strong> What is the Confucius Institute? </strong></p>
<p>The Confucius Institute is managed by the "China International Chinese Education Foundation" and is behind the "Office of the National Chinese International Promotion Leading Group" under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. Chinese officials declare that the Confucius Institute is a friendly relationship between China and foreign countries to enhance the people's understanding of Chinese language and culture. However, in recent years, many countries have begun to be alert to the CCP's use of the Confucius Institute for infiltration and successively close the Confucius Institute in the country, but there are still thirty in the United Kingdom.Reporter: Lv Xi Editor: He Ping.com Editor: Hong Wei</p>

<h3>SWIFT Bank Trading System</h3>
<p>Cutting off Russia's connection with SWIFT's financial transfer system will be one of the strongest financial sanctions steps that Europe and the United States can take to Russia. The Swift (Global Bank Financial Telecom Association) headquarters in Belgium is connected to more than 10,000 banks, and half of the world's main cross -border transfer transmission data through it. If it is decoupled from it, Russia's international financial transactions, including oil and gas export income accounted for more than 40%of the country's total income, will be cut off, and its economy will be immediately affected by long -term.

<p>The United States itself has one of the most powerful financial weapons against Putin, one of the most powerful financial weapons, to disconnect Russia's access to the US dollar. All transactions conducted in US dollars were finally settled through the Fed or US financial institutions. That is to say, foreign banks must complete the US dollar transactions through the US financial system. The United States has punished financial institutions that violate Iran, Sudan and other countries, and prohibit their settlement from settlement. Unlike other financial means, the United States can sacrifice this sanction separately. Biden had hinted that this was one of the options for sanctioning Russia. It cannot be settled in the US dollar, and Russian companies and individuals are hindered when conducting the most conventional transactions, such as paying or buying things.</p>

<h3>Putin Girlfriend? Circle of friends?</h3>
<p>A usual method of sanctions in the United States is to sanction relevant leaders, members of relatives, their families, and military and cultural officials.

These members also urged the sanctions on Russia's upper -level people, including Putin's family, and a woman who was said to have a scandal with Putin -the 2004 Olympic gymnastics gold medalist Arinakabaeva.</p>

<p>A team remotely controlled submarine on a special ship consumed the length and width of the wreckage for more than 200 hours, and took more than 700,000 photos from various angles to rebuild the complete 3D image of Titani.</p>
<p>Gerhard Seifert of Magellan is responsible for leading the project. He said that this was the largest underwater scanning plan.</p>
<p>He explained: "The depth of the Titanic is close to 4,000 meters, which means that this will constitute a major challenge. There will be sea flow at the scene, and we cannot touch any wreckage to avoid damage."</p>
<p>"Another challenge is that each square meter must be surveyed, including the bland part, such as the soil of the fragments area, but we need these to fill all the gap between all the parts worthy of attention."</p>
<p>This scanning work can not only present the size of the hull, but also make people find tiny details, such as one of the serial numbers on the propeller propeller.</p>
<p>The severe rusty bow can be identified immediately even if it sinks into the bottom of the sea for hundreds of years. There is a large hole on the deck, which makes people see the original main stairs of the cruise ship no longer exist.</p>
<p>However, the sternum became a pile of messy metal, and this part collapsed when the ship sank into the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The surrounding fragments are scattered, including gorgeous metal products, statues from the boat, and champagne bottle that have not been opened. You can also see personal items such as dozens of pairs of shoes.</p>
<p>Stephenon, who studied Titani for many years, said that when he saw 3D images for the first time, he was surprised and happy.</p>
<p>"This shows the shipwreck scene that is absolutely impossible to see from the submarine, and you can see the entire ship, which has both details and vision. And the real state of the shipwreck is now presented in front of you."</p>
<p>He said that the research on scanning content may provide a new understanding of the night when the fate of Titani decided in 1912.</p>
<p>"We really don't understand the actual situation of hitting the iceberg, and even don't even know whether the Titanic collision occurs on the width as it is performed, it may also be stranded on the iceberg."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Whether Beijing will attack Taiwan. If it really decides military attacks, when will it be? Munich Federal University National Defense University Intelligence and Security Research Center(Ciss)Scholar May-Britt Stumbaum predicts in an interview with the Munich Message that Beijing may attack Taiwan in January 2025, and the United States will interfere.</p>
<p>May-BrittStumbaum believes that it is crucial to Taiwan in the next two years. Chinese leaders first want to wait for the Taiwan presidential election in January next year, and hope that the Kuomintang of Beijing can win. "China will strengthen deterrence, until the Taiwanese finally said: Rather than risk the risk of war, it is better to put herself under the control of Beijing," she said. To this end, the Beijing side will erode the Taiwan system through the method of spreading false information and penetration.</p>
<p>In addition, Shi White believes that the US elections in early 2025 will also have a significant impact. "In recent years, we have repeatedly seen that in this case, the United States often has almost no ability to move within a few months. Many senior people have left a few months before the transfer of power, and the high -level administrative positions and ambassadors will be vacant. Long -term. The United States may be very weak in early 2025, and Xi Jinping will use this. "</p>
<p>Shi whitening predicts that China may attack Taiwan in January 2025. She told the Munich Ambassador, "If China really decides to attack Taiwan, then in January 2025, it provided a suitable opportunity for invasion. Taiwan Strait, the sea surface was relatively calm. In addition, the Chinese Spring Festival in 2025 was in January, hundreds of millions of people will travel across the country, and satellites can hardly find large -scale military dispatches. At that time, China only needed a month for a month. The round night and good weather. "</p>
<p>Shi White believes that if the military attacks Taiwan on Beijing, then a large number of troops will be sent to first try to occupy strategic places, especially the government's location and key infrastructure control center. China will also accept the cost of very high blood. She said, "In China, people are accustomed to making huge sacrifices. After canceling the new crown measures in Beijing, it is estimated that 1.6 million people will die within 4 weeks. The economic consequences of invading Taiwan will also be huge. Sanctions, China's GDP will fall 9%. But even such consequences will be accepted. "</p>
<p>Shi whitening predicts that if China attacks Taiwan, the United States will intervene. "If China controls Taiwan, China's submarine can sneak into the sea from (eastern Taiwan), and then reopen the water near San Francisco. This is why Americans want to intervene. They want to prevent the second Pearl Harbor from the second Pearl Harbor. . Do not let Taiwan fall into the hands of the People's Republic of China, which is in line with Americans's own strategic interests. "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>The World Daily published an article that the Baltic Small Citia showed how to successfully keep a distance from Beijing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-18T15-05-00Z/59893012_401.jpg" />In November 2021, the Taiwan representative office in Lithuania officially started operation</p>
<p>The article wrote that the Lithuanian government allowed Taiwan to open a real diplomatic representative agency in the capital Vilnius, which reduced the diplomatic relations with Lithuania and imposed economic pressure. "However, now, it is clear that Lithuania's proinstacper may have achieved economic victory. After a strong response in Beijing, the Taiwan government hopes to do everything to ensure that this Baltic country will not suffer any economy because of its position. Lost. Last year, the Taipei government allocated 200 million US dollars to invest in Lithuania. Although the venture capital company TAIWANIA can invest in the entire Central and Eastern European regions, so far, this money has mainly flowed to Lithuanian start -ups ..... In addition, the Taipei government has set up a $ 1 billion of financing funds. The joint economic projects of Lithuania and Taiwan companies can obtain cheap loans from this fund. "</p>

<p>In northern Italy, the Roman Nirvana has recently become a disaster, causing floods and mudslides. As of Thursday (May 18), 11 people have died.</p>
<p>The authorities reported that nine people were killed on Wednesday (17th), and tens of thousands of residents waited for evacuation, and warned that the worse situation may have not yet arrived.</p>
<p>On the same day, the world -class Formula Motor (F1) official also announced that due to the local severe floods, the F1 Imora venue racing prize will be canceled on this weekend.</p>
<p>The rainfall in part of the disaster area reached half of the annual average rainfall in just 36 hours. The heavy rain caused 14 rivers in the disaster area to built the embankment, flooding into towns, drowning farmland. Raverner, which is famous for the early Christian ruins, was severely affected. The local government said that about 14,000 people must evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The official pointed out that the flood invaded 37 towns and communities and led to about 120 mudslide accidents. At least one bridge near Bologna collapsed, some roads were destroyed by floods, and multiple railway services were suspended. Officials say that although the rain is weakening, the water level of the river is still rising.</p>
<p>The Italian authorities say that when the cabinet meets the relief measures on the 23rd, it will consider allocating 20 million euros (about 29.09 million yuan) to the disaster area.</p>
<p>This is the second time in the Emilia -Roman Nirvana area this month was severely attacked; at least two local people were killed in the storm in early May. Meteorologists said that the drought in this area had dried up the land for several months before, reducing the ability to absorb water, and exacerbated the impact of floods.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T15-59-00-04-00/000000.png" />The Chiefs Summit of the Seven Kingdoms will be held in Japan from May 19, 2023. The picture shows the G7 Hiroshima Summit logo. Agencence France -Presse <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zhongguotoushi/panel-05182023152545.html/@@stream"></a>Moderator: Chen Kuide</p>
<p>Sympotent: Mr. Li Hengqing, economist and political critics</p>
<p>From May 19th to 21st, 2023, the leaders of major developed countries including the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, and the European Union held the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan.(Fumio Kishida)Leaders of South Korea, Australia, Brazil, Kocro, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, Ukraine, and Vietnam attended the summit. This is the summit of the most important national forces in the world.</p>
<p>China, the world's second largest economy at hand, has not been invited, obviously because it is the goal of the G7 summit.</p>
<p>On the eve of this G7 summit, China and Russia are in the situation of the wind and rain internal and external.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Background </strong></p>
<p>1) The Russian and Ukraine War is striding towards Ukraine</p>
<p>President Zellezki recently visited the French and Britain's four top four countries, and has achieved a complete success in military and diplomacy. The four European countries-NATO resolutely support the four-point peace talks of Ukraine: <strong> withdrawal, the territorial sovereignty is complete, compensation, and trial </strong>; thereby closing the appeasement door and eliminating the short storm brought by Macron's visit to China. Zeelianzki publicly announced that Ukraine will defeat Russia in irreversibleness this year. Britain will support Ukraine <strong> cruise missiles </strong>, which is the first time that Ukraine has won this remote offensive weapon. Germany will give Ukraine more than US $ 2.7 billion in military aid in Ukraine in Germany.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government said on May 16 that the Ukrainian air defense forces continued to shoot down the six dagger hypersonic missiles launched by the Russian army from Monday night to Tuesday morning. It has confirmed the powerful interception capacity of the Patriot's air defense system, and breaks the myth of super weapons that is difficult to intercept the super weapon. At present, only Russia and China are claimed to use high supersonic missiles for actual deployment.</p>
<p>2) Recently on the Taiwan issue, Xi Jinping has been subject to the enemy inside and outside</p>
<p><strong> i. The US House of Representatives Foreign Committee 5/16 passed the "Taiwan International Unity Act" </strong></p>
<p>The bill will fight against China that is trying to distort in international organizations about Taiwan's matters. The bill emphasizes that the resolution of the 2758 United University of the University only handle the issue of China's representative rights and does not involve Taiwan.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives Overseas Committee reviewed the "Taiwan International Solidarity Act" on Tuesday. The ** Act will amend the "Taiwan AIA International Protection and Strengthening Initiative Law" (referred to as Taipei Law, TAIPEI Act), which took effect in March 2020 to fight against China to hinder Taiwan's participation in international organizations.</p>
<p>Michael McCaul, chairman of the Southern Court of the House of Representatives, and Gregorymeeks, chief member of the Democratic Party, have publicly supported the bill; McCawal criticized that the CCP's external mistakes proclaimed that the UN General Assembly 2758 prohibited Taiwan from having a speech in the United Nations in the United Nations. Refers to excluding Taiwan to harm the world outside.</p>
<p>With the support of the two parties, the bill was approved without objections, and it will be sent to the House of Representatives for consideration.</p>
<p>(The bill is co-chairman of the House of Representatives "Parliament Taiwan Wired" Gerry Connolly and Mario Diaz-BALART, and the Chief Member of the Democratic Party of the Outsourcing Committee of the House of Representatives AMI BERA (AMI BERA) , ** Democratic Party, Dina Titus, and the Republican Congress John Curtis, Andy Barr, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Mike Lin (Lisamcclin) was proposed together.)</p>
<p>Faced with the meaning of Beijing's long -term distortion of the United University of the United Nations University, and hindering Taiwan's participation in international organizations, the bill first clarified this.</p>
<p>The bill pointed out that the resolution acknowledged that the government of the People's Republic of China was the only legal representative in China in the United Nations. However, it did not deal with the issues of representative rights of Taiwan and the people of Taiwan in the United Nations or any relevant organizations. **, or contain any statement about Taiwan's sovereignty.</p>
<p>The bill emphasizes that <strong> The United States opposes any initiative to change Taiwan's status without the consent of the people of Taiwan </strong>. In addition, the bill requires the United States to represent the expression, voting and influence of opinions through the expression, voting and influence of opinions, and call on these organizations to resist China to distort Taiwan's resolutions, text, policies, or procedures.</p>
<p>During this major US Congress aid legal operation, former British Prime Minister Tras visited Taiwan for five days on May 15. As a symbol of the Tableki Symbol, which echoed by Britain and the United States, has increased the psychological pressure on the Xi.</p>
<p>Western countries do not want Beijing to invade Taiwan, but also want to avoid war. The current approach is to speak with a sound, which is a strong aggressive strategy to achieve an agreement. Otherwise, the Chinese Communist Party may mistakenly think that it can differentiate the West, just like flickering Macron last month, and Putin mistakenly believes that the West is too weak to prevent the invasion of Ukraine. The sound is consistent, and the scolding is effective.</p>
<p><strong> II. Why did Xi Jinping suddenly come down on the Taiwan issue? </strong></p>
<p>The strict network control and control in China has suddenly appeared in a number of comments that oppose Wu Tong, which can actually escape the review and not be liquidated. This means that Xi Jinping also felt that the nationalist emotions that have been mobilized for a long time are back to themselves. He pushed down the cliff or forced to enter the dilemma.</p>
<p>A typical network post in China: "<strong> What is difficult to say, everyone is responsible, when the benefits are issued, they have not given the same treatment when they enjoy state treatment. Whoever loves to go? I won't let my children go. </strong> "After forwarding, it attracted 3.27 million people to browse and tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>These words against Wu Tong are well -founded and even poured. At first glance, they are known from the hands of the Gao Education. "Nikkei Asia" analyzes these remarks, summarizes three main points:</p>
<p>1 The aimlessly criticized and advocated by Wu Tong Taiwan is a brainless fool **, pointing out that it is not only unrealistic, but also extremely dangerous to launch a war of invasion in Taiwan. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the lesson of the front car.</p>
<p>2 It is from the hands of people who have deep research on the history and status quo of both sides of the strait. They assert that once the invasion of the platform is launched, the PLA may face the dilemma of four -faced operations **, because North Korea, India and South China Philippine, Indonesia, Vietnam and other neighboring countries It may also take advantage of the situation to solve the problem of border territorial territories, not to mention that after Japan and South Korea have recently staged a big reconciliation, they all expressed their tough stances that would not sit and destroy the peaceful state of the Taiwan Strait.The above remarks cannot be made in the past. It can be circulated on the Internet at present, so it is obvious that Xi Jinping has known that his previous Wu Tong incited had approached himself, and he had to escape himself to save himself.</p>
<p><strong> 2, G7 summit arrow on the string </strong></p>
<p>1) <strong> Sword refers to Beijing's "economic coercion" economy risky </strong></p>
<p>Reuters revealed that the leaders of the Seven Kingdoms (G7) will mention in a joint statement that the concerns of using "Economiccoercion" in international actions in international actions (such as China ’s“ economic coercion ”on Lithuania and Australia). The statement is expected to include "a special part of China."</p>
<p>The G7 countries are closely linked to the Chinese economy in terms of economy. Now, in order to unanimously use the EU's "de -risk" statement instead of "decoupling", the wording is not too irritating the CCP, and the actual measures are still the same.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the economic decoupling of the United States and Europe is quietly in progress. According to a report released by the Merics Institute (Merics) earlier this month, China ’s investment in Europe (EU 27 countries+Britain) has continued to decline over the years. The point is only 7.9 billion euros, a decrease of 22%compared with 2021. This drop has brought Chinese investment to the 2013 level.</p>
<p>If the G7 can propose some systematic economic cooperation solutions, similar to the United States' <strong> Indo -Pacific Economic framework </strong>, etc., it will be quite effective. The G7 meeting drafted an extra details of the diversified supply chain. The finance ministers will propose a new partnership of the supply chain to open to other countries and require countries to reach the minimum standards in human rights and environmental policies to join. The planned partnership will be launched before the end of the year. In this way, these developing countries will gradually get rid of the market dependence on the CCP. In order to fall into the Western world throughout the strategy.</p>
<p><strong> 2) Global Strategy: G7 expansion, and then group camps </strong></p>
<p>In the era of globalization in previous years, the G20 summit focusing on the economy has greatly replaced the G7, but then the Ukrainian war and the CCP's ambition to change global order, quickly activate the core function of G7 to maintain global freedom and security. CCP's frontline international organization.</p>
<p>As the rotating country of the G7 summit, Prime Minister Kishida and Foreign Minister Lin Fangzheng visited Africa and Latin America in the G7. This summit was invited to 8 countries (South Korea, Australia, Brazil, Kook, Cook Islands, and Cook Islands. In India, Indonesia, Ukraine, and Vietnam), six are global southern countries. Beijing used to claim to be the spokesperson for the Southern Southern King The dependent diplomatic resources, G7's move, four or two pounds, transmitted to the CCP's sense of Chu, and made it cold.</p>
<p><strong> As a comprehensive strength of G7 above Beijing, the vertical and horizontal bumper is folded. In view of the existence of border disputes in India and the Chinese Communist Party, it is (China -Russia -dominated) ) Member of "</strong> Sifang Group (Quad **)". India and Brazil are members of the five -nation, including China and Russia. The invitation of India and Brazil obviously has the intention of differentiation of the five countries of the BRICS. After reconciliation with South Korea, Japan invited South Korea to participate in the G7 and clearly released signals to jointly confront the CCP in East Asia.</p>
<p>In the current era of increasingly divided division in the world, competitors are shortlisted and expanded their own sites. In the past few months, Japan and South Korea donated old grievances. The free camp in South Korea's entry into the alliance was a global strategic incident with a great static. In this regard, China and Russia are not good at it. Except for Beijing's accident, it matched Saudi Arabia and Iran, and it was almost zero. In fact, it entered the situation of lonely people.</p>
<p><strong> 3) Geopolitics: The core position of the United States, Japan and South Korea in the Indo -Pacific Strategy </strong></p>
<p>The Indo -Pacific region is the place where the soldiers must compete, the focus of contemporary world geopolitics.</p>
<p>In view of Japan's key contribution in geopolitical reorganization, Kishida Wenxiong has appeared on the cover character of this month's magazine.</p>
<p>The G7 summit, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, the three countries of the United States, Japan and South Korea are in Hiroshima, which is a historic moment. After the Japanese Kishida shuttle diplomacy strengthened the US -Japan Alliance, after the Japanese and South Korea's reconciliation in Japan, after the Yin Xiyue visit to Japan, it basically built the North Delta framework after signing the Washington Declaration of the US and South Korea. Then the United States and Fei signed a joint statement to build the southern triangle. These two triangles, coupled with military cooperation between Taiwan and the United States, extended from Northeast Asia to the South China Sea region, forming a very complete Indian NATO framework of the CCP.</p>
<p>Indo -Pacific strategy, two poles confrontation, three -sided cooperation, Quartet mechanism, five -eye alliance: the United States and China, the two -way mechanism of the United States and China, the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the key. Consider joining), the United States, Britain, Australia and the New Five Eye Alliance is the basic network, and now if South Korea joins the four -party mechanism, it will be expanded to the five -party mechanism.</p>
<p><strong> Three, China's last chance </strong></p>
<p>Beijing has tried his best to order in the Indo -Pacific region, and its last opportunity is in Europe. Can it play a certain role in mediation of the Russian and Ukraine? Essence</p>
<p><strong> Li Hui participated in the mediation </strong></p>
<p>Li Hui, a special representative of Eurasia's affairs and Zeng Moscow, who has been stationed in Moscow, set off on the 15th to visit Ukraine, Russia and Poland, France, Germany and other countries. In contrast to China on May 2nd in the United Nations, voted for resolutions that invaded Ukraine in Russia. Some countries interpreted that China may adjust its position; and finally promoted Russia and Ukraine to stop fire.</p>
<p><strong> International Suspicious Saves </strong> **</p>
<p>Yes, only Xi Jinping can speak with Putin, because Pu is asking for Xi. However, the problem is that the EU and NATO have endorsed the four conditions of peace in Ukraine: withdrawal, complete territorial sovereignty, compensation, trial, would China persuade Putin to accept any of them, such as withdrawal? Now? Obviously not.</p>
<p>In fact, the selection of Russian Li Hui as a special envoy is a bowl of "peaceful soup" that China drinks to Russia in a sense, trying to dispel Russia's concerns. Because some people in Russia have scolded Xi. The war has not reached the point where the war defeats, and Putin is never willing to obey Xi Jinping and withdraw troops. Xi (or Li Hui) may not even export the word "withdrawal". Under the situation of today's battlefield, how many countries believe that China is a peaceful founder or mediation in except for Iran, North Korea, Syria and other countries?</p>
<p>Regarding China ’s appointment of Li Hui as a special representative, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in a statement to the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) that Kiev hoped that Li Hui’ s deep understanding of the region would help him to have fair and effective parties with all parties. Communication.</p>
<p>The implication is that if it is not "justice and effective" -the four conditions of Ukraine's peace-, then don't talk about it.</p>
<p>And if the war has reached the point where the soldiers are defeated, what do you want Xi Jinping to do? Ukraine does not want, Putin does not need, NATO does not need him anymore.</p>
<p>Some observers believe that at a subtle moment in the war situation, there may be historical opportunities that need Beijing to participate to bring Russia to the negotiating table. By then, Beijing's international diplomatic status will be important.</p>
<p>Wait and see. My intuition is not the probability of not.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that in the context of increasing competition between the United States and China, Australia and the Philippines are strengthening the relationship between the two countries and also seek balance between the two major powers.</p>

<p>Matthewreynolds, a researcher at the US Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) economics project, introduced their latest report on anti -China economic coercion. Cases also discovered some commonality, including China more inclined to implement their measures through informal means, and more inclined to aim at projects with asymmetric advantages in the trade structure. At the same time, China hates the cost and risk caused by coercion.</p>
<p>"The most surprising discovery is how invalid China's economic coercion is. Generally speaking, Beijing has only achieved the result of the short -term goal of achieving its short -term goals. In fact, Beijing's bullying often allows China to bear long -term strategy. Cost. "Renaitz said that China took trade sanctions on Australia due to virus traceability and other issues, but as a result, Australia and the United States established a stronger strategic alliance.</p>
<p>Based on the report, Reynolds proposed to formulate a counter -control strategy to prevent China's economic coercion by enhancing toughness and providing rescue for target allies and partners. He said: "The first is to provide real market access for the signing countries through the negotiations of a free trade agreement; the second is to help identify and reduce the vulnerability of the country's economic coercion."</p>
<p>Renault pointed out that the United States should also seek response from multilateral allies by encouraging allies to adopt similar strategies. The United States can reduce the cost of coercion of allies and partners, further reduce the effectiveness of Chinese bullying, and prove to China that its actions are futile. Seeing that the Seventh Kingdom Group this week was discussing how to fight against China together, he was encouraged.</p>
<p>According to the White House press release, U.S. President Biden had a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Kishita on the 18th, and promised to closely cooperate and respond to the stress of China's violations of international law. South Korea, Australia, and India have cooperation in the cooperation between countries such as talks about countries, as well as Southeast Asia and Pacific Island countries.</p>

<p>At that time, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries were either cut off the relationship with Arded or relegated bilateral relations. During the conflict, Saudi also publicly supported Asedd to drive down.</p>

<p>The Malaysian government spends huge sums of fuel every year, and has a heavy financial pressure on the government, and related smuggling activities have been repeatedly banned. The authorities then launched a pilot plan without subsidy oil station in a specific oil station near the Malaysia country near the Thai border, so that these oil stations were sold at Ron95 gasoline and diesel without subsidies. The results were found that the effect was good and intentionally expanded.</p>
<p>No subsidy oil station is a plan responsible for the Ministry of Trade and Life Cost (KPDN). The authorities first started this plan in Badong Bada in the glass market and two oil stations in Wangji. The Malaysian government banned foreign vehicles from purchasing subsidy fuel.</p>
<p>The authorities found that the Ron95 gasoline and diesel volume sold by the oil stations participating in the pilot plan increased. This is because the price of non -subsidized fuel in Malaysia is still lower than that of similar fuels in Thailand. Many Thai people who drive in Malaysia have added fuel to Thailand before returning to Thailand.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahi on Thursday (May 18) at a press conference after the National Life Cost Action Council meeting, the government's pilot plan for the government promoted by the Matai border has been effective, and it has been in the country. About 5 million Ron95 gasoline and diesel subsidy funds of about RM5 million (approximately $ 1.48 million).</p>
<p>He said: "The report of the first two months shows that the sales of diesel and RON95 gasoline subsidized (glass market) decreased by 13.2%and 15.7%. Increase 43.27%. "</p>
<p>He pointed out that the price of no subsidy RON95 gasoline is RM 3.05 per liter, and diesel is RM3 per liter. "These prices are cheaper than Thailand. Thailand's RON95 gasoline is priced at RM 4.62 per liter, and diesel is RM 4.24 per liter."</p>
<p>He also pointed out that due to the good implementation of the implementation, the domestic trade and living cost department plans to extend the measures without subsidy oil stations to Jilandan, Jedie, Perak, Sarawak, Sabah and Johor.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-05-18T19-41/000000.png" />Another challenge facing American retailers is organized retail theft. Target is estimated that due to these theft, profitability has decreased by more than $ 1 billion. (Agence France -Presse)</p>
<h4>Target Corporation (New York Stock Exchange code: TGT)</h4>
<p>Although the quarterly performance released by retail chain TARGET overnight, the sales were almost the same year -on -year, and the group executives also acknowledged that consumers were more cautious about expenditure, but because consumers turned to buy more necessities, the profit performance of TARGET was still slightly a little slightly slightly slight It surpassed the average forecast of Wall Street analysts and drove the group's stock price to increase by 2.58 % overnight.</p>
<p>However, while released performance, the TARGET executives also predict that the overall sales of the current quarter will remain sluggish, and compaies will even decrease at a low number of individuals. Nevertheless, this large retailer still adheres to its previous outlook on the annual performance, and it is expected that the comparable sales of this fiscal year may decline in low single digits or increase in low single digits; It will be between $ 7.75 and $ 8.75.</p>
<p>CEO Briancornell said that even if consumers have rarely bought non -necessities, Target still has the ability to attract them to buy grocery, daily necessities and current popular products.</p>
<p>According to Target's first quarter performance report as of April 29, the Group's turnover was $ 25.320 million, and its net profit per share was $ 2.05. The average estimated number of analysts collected by Refinitiv is a turnover of $ 25.29 billion, and the net profit per share is $ 1.76. Compared with these two numbers, Target's quarterly performance is exceeded.</p>
<p>However, compared with the same period in 2022, the first quarter of Target's net profit was from US $ 1 billion or net profit per share of US $ 2.16 to $ 950 million or net profit per share of 2.05 US dollars. The turnover increased by a slight increase of 1 % from 25.17 billion US dollars a year ago.</p>
<p>"The group's chief growth officer, Christinahennington, said:" The sales in February this year were the strongest, and it began to weaken in March, and the overall consumption situation was further softened at the end of April. "</p>
<p>Among the many product categories, the sales performance of beauty products is the most powerful, and sales have increased by more than ten Pakistani. Foods and beverages increase in high single digits. With the support of health products and pet supplies, the sales of family necessities have also increased in low single digits.</p>
<p>At this time back to 2022, Target not only should cope with higher freight, but also faces the "hot products" of the epidemic, such as bicycles and kitchen utensils, which have gradually faded on the shelves and warehouses. Fortunately, Target's shipping costs have begun to decline, and its branches have also decreased due to the price reduction promotional activities of excess deposits, which shows its operations gradually returning to the right track. However, according to the talks published by Target executives in February, Target's operating profit margin may wait until the next fiscal year or later, which will return to the level before the epidemic.</p>
<p>In addition to talking about normal business, Cornell also proposed another challenge generally faced by American retailers: organized retail theft. He said: "Target has reduced profitability by more than $ 1 billion because of these theft. And unfortunately, the violence faced by our stores and the entire retail industry is still increasing."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 14 of Tipranks's 24 analysts were rated "buy" to the stock, 10 rated "holding", and the average target price of the one -year period was $ 180.92.</p>

<p>David Miles, a senior economist at the British Budget Responsibility Office, said that under the effect of slow population growth and popularity at home office, the era of great rising house prices in the UK may be over.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that in a speech in London, Melz pointed out that the changes in work habits, the level of population growth, and the decline in the decline in loan costs in decades have no longer reduced the possibility of rising house prices.</p>
<p>He said: "I think the factors that promote housing prices in the next 40 years will be much weaker than in the past 40 years. The unusual era of rising house prices may be approaching."</p>
<p>He emphasized that British house prices rose particularly quickly compared with other countries.</p>
<p>Melz said that the British population has increased significantly in the past 40 years, and the problem of enough housing needs to be built is quite sharp. As the population growth slows down, the pressure of housing demand will be relieved.</p>
<p>The shortage of housing has recently become a major economic and political issue in the UK. The Sunak administration and the Conservative Party they are located are also under pressure to formulate housing policies.</p>

<p>When the big water gradually retired, the local people began to clean up their houses and streets covered with mud and garbage.</p>
<p>Edoardo Amadori, the resident of Cesena, told AFP yesterday: "I have lived here in 1979. I have encountered floods, but I have never seen this."</p>
<p>Pope Francis has prayed for the affected people and thanked all people who helped the local victims in "this shocking disaster".</p>
