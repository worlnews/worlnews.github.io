<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65889684/65847980"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T-11-00-00Z/65847980_303.jpeg" /></a>The military exercise held in Germany this week is the highest in the history of NATO</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) after 4 years of preparation, NATO Air Military Performance, which is called "Air Defender 23" (Air Defender 23), started this Monday (June 12). This is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約將舉行史上最大空軍演習-看點有哪些/a-65855730">this kind of exercise in NATO in history</a>Essence From June 12th to 23rd, Germany will be the logistics dispatch hub of this exercise. Six military bases in Quande will be stopped at 250 aircraft, and 25 countries will participate. Among them, the United States will send 100 planes to fly over the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The exercise is performed in three airspaces: over a few areas in northern Germany, North Sea, East, and Southern. Relevant areas will take turns to implement non -flying flights within a few hours a day.</p>
<h3>All will obey NATO military exercise</h3>
<h3>Flight mistakes, but not canceled</h3>
<p>Europe is the most densely spaced airspace in global aviation activities, while Germany is located in the center of Europe. Therefore, at the same time as the exercise, it is a major challenge to maintain the daily operation of civil aviation.</p>
<p>During the 10 -day exercise period, the German airport will extend the operation time until the night to ensure that there is no flight cancellation. However, the German Air Force Director Ingogerhartz said that the possibility of the delay of aircraft takes off and landing is not ruled out.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T-11-00-00Z/65440036_401.jpg" />Exercise may cause delays for civil aviation flights</p>
<p>The European Airlines Association also estimates that no flight will be canceled, and even if there is a delay, it will not be very serious. However, because military exercises are held without interruption of civil aviation passenger transportation, the possibility of temporary adjustment is not excluded, and passengers should be prepared for psychological preparations.</p>
<p>Aviation expert Clemensbollinger explained to Germany that due to the busy aviation activities over Germany, the civil and military navigation safety systems in Germany have been integrated for 30 years. Different from the French Air Force in daily training, the civil aviation flights will be prohibited, and German military and civilian flights generally do not interfere with each other. "But we all know that there are many factors that can cause mistakes such as accidental weather, or too dense flights such as thunderstorms." At present, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/行业预测2023年航空业将复苏-亚非拉航司继续亏损/a-65829653">civil aviation passenger transportation is basically returned to the level before the epidemic</a>Essence</p>
<h3>, ground, underwater</h3>
<p>Torbenarnold, an expert in the Berlin Think Tank Science and Political Foundation (SWP), pointed out that NATO holding a military exercise while maintaining the normal operation of civil aviation is also a signal of a political deterrence: "If you are willing to show that we will defend every NATO alliance every country of NATO allies One inch of territory, even in such a busy airspace (holding military exercises). "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T-11-00-00Z/65847964_401.jpg" />Germany is the logistics hub of NATO military exercise</p>
<p>German Air Force Director Gelhaz said that more than 10,000 NATO national soldiers participating in the exercise will exercise various scenarios, including ground operations, such as "evacuation from an airport". Obviously, the chaotic scenes of the US and Allied Army's retreat from Kabul Airport in the summer of 2021 are still in memory, and this content has been included in the exercise. Other projects also include: air combat support for ground forces, air combat against enemy fighters, and intercepting medium -range missiles in NATO bomber. To this end, the United States dispatched the most advanced F-35 stealth bomber to participate.</p>
<p>According to Arnold, NATO will also practice to block local submarines or ships over the North Sea.</p>
<p>Speaking of "enemies", many people now think of Russia, which is invading Ukraine. However, when the Air Force Director Gelhaz introduced the "Air Guard 23" military exercise in Berlin before, he tried to notice the name of "Enemies from the East" as much as possible.</p>
<p>AmyGutmann, Germany, is more frank. "It (exercise) will undoubtedly prove the agility and rapidness of NATO Allied forces as the first reactor." The female diplomat said: "If any world leader not noticed the alliance's The spirit, that is, the power of this alliance, I will be very surprised. "She added:" This also includes Mr. Putin. "</p>

<h3>Ukraine calls the first batch of three villages that recapture Donetsk in the Russian counter -attack</h3>
<p>June 12, 2023<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T04-21-50.000Z/_130061235_ukraine.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p><strong> Ukraine said that the country's army has liberated three villages in southeastern Ukraine, which is the first victory of the long -awaited Ukraine counterattack. </strong></p>
<p>Social media films show that its army celebrates the victory near the residents' districts near Blahodatne and Neskuchne in Donetz.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine said that Makarivka nearby was also recaptured.</p>
<p>On Saturday (June 10), President Volodymyr ZELENSKY confirmed that Ukraine's counterattack against the Russian army's area has begun.</p>
<p>Although Ukraine has begun to advance at the southern front of the country last week, these three villages are the first batch of residential areas that Zelezzki confirmed to have been liberated since the beginning of the counterattack.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian dam was exploded and urgently withdrew tens of thousands of people, Russia and Ukraine denied the launch of the attack</p>
<p>Moscow has not confirmed that it has lost any village, but claims that it has repelled Ukraine's offense in the region.</p>
<p>In addition, Ukraine claims that Russia bombed another dam in the Zapolo area. Last Monday, the Khahofka dam near Hermuson in southern Ukraine was destroyed, causing a wide range of floods.</p>
<p>Ukraine said the dam was bombed by the Russian army. The Russian army has been controlling the dam since February 2022.</p>
<p>Valery Shershen, a national military spokesman, said that Moscow chose to bomb the second dam near Novodarivka, which "caused the flood".</p>
<p>She Shen said that Russia deliberately bombed the dam in the area to prevent Ukraine from being advanced to the occupied area.</p>
<p>Russia denied it that it had destroyed the Khahofka dam and attributed it to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russian and Ukraine War: a counterattack that may change the war</p>
<h3>"Under the country of Ukraine again"</h3>
<p>In social media, in the video shared by Kuyeland's account, you can see the Ukrainian flag from a burned building in Blahodat in Blahodat.</p>
<p>The video released by the National Border Defense Force showed that the Ukraine army announced that the "Nesskchne in the Donetsk region belongs to Ukraine's national underworld" and then shouted the battle slogan "Glory Between Ukraine".</p>
<p>At the same time, Hanna Maliar, deputy minister of the Ministry of Defense, claimed in a film in Telegram that the Ukrainian army also occupied the Village of Macarova.</p>
<p>A military spokesman said that these victories were the first local victory in the counterattack.</p>
<p>Although these three villages marked the biggest progress in recent days, these residential areas are relatively small. The population before the Blahodat's civil war was only 1,000.</p>
<p>The village is the center of fierce fighting in recent days. It is located on the road leading to Mali Ubol. Some analysts believe that Ukraine may seek to recapture this port city in the next few months.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that Kiev hopes to cut off the occupied land connection between Crimea and Donedsk, and the Russian army on the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>To the east, the Ukrainian army is also said to have also been advanced near the destroyed city of Bachomut, where the two Russian and Ukraine troops have long -term bloody fighting.</p>
<p>Senior officials of Kiev declined to comment on the details of advancement.</p>
<p>The mysterious Ukrainian intelligence head, Kyrylo Budanov, released a film on Sunday, repeating the mantra of "planning likes to silence", intended to emphasize that the counterattack needs to be confidential.</p>
<p>Ukraine's scope of action is unclear, but the headquarters in the US think tank "Institute of War" (ISW) said on Saturday that Kiev's troops are launching offensives in at least four front lines.</p>
<p>Ukraine suffered some setbacks while launching an attack on Russia's defense. A group of Ukrainian soldiers told AFP that during a operation in southeastern Zapolo, they lost several Bradley chariots made by several American Bradley.</p>
<p>They said that six of the nine cars were destroyed and added that they were worried that someone had leaked action information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65670095">Ukraine War: BBC discloses the defense deployment of the Russian army through satellite pictures</a>Analysts emphasized that Ukraine faces difficulties when trying to break through Russia for several months.</p>
<p>However, in other regions, Kiev's troops reportedly broke through the Russian troops in the weekend operations. It is reported that the Ukraine has deployed the German Leopard-2 (Leopard-2) tank.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, the railway transportation was suspended after a row of freight trains on Saturday night. In the past few weeks, Belgore's border area has been attacked by drones and artillery.</p>
<p>Kaluga Governor Vladislavshapsha Paluga governor in the north said two drone cranes occurred in the local area, which occurred near the village of Strelkovka, and another other. Together in the forest.</p>
<p>BBC has not independently verified these events.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-12T04-33-06-00-00/000073708_piclink.jpg" />Last week, the Chinese ambassador to South Korea, Xing Haiming, met with the largest party leader in South Korea, Li Zaiming. They caused a stir in South Korea on the current series of issues such as Sino -South Korean relations and East Asian diplomacy. Then Korean diplomacy and security officials publicly criticized the Chinese ambassador on various occasions, which has aroused great attention from East Asian public opinion.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that the Chinese ambassador did not name the Korean Yin Xiyue government. All his remarks are explaining the position of the Chinese government. It is also the normal work of any country's ambassador abroad. Therefore, the essence of the problem is that the Korean Yin Xiyue government is actually showing a posture to China, that is, South Korea has dared to provoke China.</p>

<p>Dmitry Mishaf: "I am a officer, not a crime together"</p>
<p><strong> The defective soldiers who fled to Russia rarely accepted the BBC interview, which described how heavy the Russian army was and how low the morale was. </strong></p>
<p>Dmitry Mishov, a 26 -year -old Air Force Lieutenant, surrendered to the Lithuanian authorities to seek political asylum.</p>
<p>Demitri said that with a small backpack, it was his last way to escape from Russia in such a dramatic way.</p>
<p>He is one of the few active officers who are known to escape from the country to avoid being sent to Ukraine to fight in Ukraine -also the only case of the Active Air Force personally known by the BBC.</p>
<h3>Seeking a way out</h3>
<p>Dmitry is an attack helicopter navigator stationed in the Puskov region in northwestern Russia. When seeing the plane began to prepare for the battle, Dmitry felt that the real war was coming.</p>
<p>He tried to leave the Air Force in January 2022, but the written documents he submitted until February 24 that Russia had not passed in Ukraine. He was sent to Belarus and drove helicopters to transport military supplies.</p>
<p>Dmitry said he never went to Ukraine. We cannot verify his statement, but his documents look real, and many of his claims are in line with the situation we learned from other sources.</p>
<p>In April 2022, he returned to the Russian resident, hoping to advance the retirement procedure. This long process was nearing completion at the time -but in September 2022, President Putin announced some military mobilization. Dmitry was told that he was not allowed to leave the army.</p>
<p>He knew that sooner or later he would be sent to Ukraine, so he began to find a way to get rid of this fate.</p>
<p>"I am a officer, and my responsibility is to defend the country from invasion. I don't need to be a conspiracy. No one has explained to us why this war begins, and why we must attack Ukraine and destroy their city."</p>
<p>He described the mood in the army, some people support the war, and some insisted on opposing. Few people believe that they are fighting Russia to avoid real dangers. This has long been officially said -Moscow has been forced to take "special military operations" to prevent Russia from being attacked.</p>
<p>According to Mishav, most people overwhelming in the army are generally dissatisfied with salary. **</p>
<p>He said that experienced Air Force officers still obtained up to 90,000 rubles (865 pounds, $ 1090) in pre -war contracts. As part of the official public publicity advertisement, the recruits were attracted to the army with a salary of 204,000 rubles (1960 pounds and $ 2465).</p>
<p>Dmitry said that although the attitude towards Ukraine may be different, no one in the army believes that the frontline war is good or the number of casualties is very low.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T08-54-59.000Z/_130055712_mishovdocs.png" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Mishaf's document confirms his military level and position</p>
<p>"No one in the army believes the authorities. They can see what happened. They are not civilians in front of the TV. The army does not believe in official reports because it is not true at all."</p>
<p>He said that in the early days of the war, the Russian Command claimed that there were no casualties and loss of equipment, but he himself knew some of the deaths.</p>
<p>Before the war, his troops had 40 to 50 aircraft. A few days after the invasion of Russia, six were shot down and three were destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Russian authorities rarely report military casualties. In September last year, the Minister of Defense Sergeishoigu said Russia lost about 6,000 soldiers. This number is considered underestimated by most analysts including the Kremlin bloggers.</p>
<p>In the recent update of the Russian -Russian military casualties in the Ukrainian war, Olgaivshina of the BBC Russian Ministry of Russia sorted out a list of 25,000 names, including many of them also included rank. She believes that, including those who disappear in action, the real numbers are much higher.</p>
<p>Demitri said the loss of personnel in the Air Force was extremely serious. This statement is long -term with Olga Iv Sina <a href="https://bbcrussian.substack.com/p/russia-elite-force-losses-in-ukraine">Research</a>The income is consistent. The survey found that Russia lost hundreds of high -skilled service personnel, including pilots and technicians. Their training was both time -consuming and high.</p>
<p>"Now they can replace the helicopter, but there is no enough pilot," Dmitry said. "If we compare this with the Afghan war in the 1980s, we know that the Soviet Union lost 333 helicopters. I believe We have suffered the same loss in a year. "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>In January of this year, Dmitry was told that he would be sent to "perform a task."</p>
<p>He realized that there was only one meaning -going to Ukraine. He tried to commit suicide, hoping that this would cause him to be retired based on health reasons, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>During the rehabilitation of the hospital, he read an article that a 27 -year -old police officer from the Provev area successfully escaped Latvia. Dmitry decided to imitate him.</p>
<p>"I don't refuse to serve the army. If my country is facing a real threat, I will play for the country. I just refuse to be a crime."</p>
<p>"If I board the helicopter, I will take at least dozens of people's life. I don't want to do that, Ukraine is not our enemy."</p>
<p>Dmitry asked for help on Telegram, planning a route passing through the forest to the EU border. He was as light as possible.</p>
<p>He said the process of walking through the woods was terrible because he was afraid of being intercepted by border guards.</p>
<p>"If they arrest me, I may spend a long time in prison."</p>
<p>He said that once, there was a plane flew by where he was close to him, and then there was another. He panicked for a while, fearing that it was the Border Guard to hunt him, so he started to run.</p>
<p>"I can't see the road in front, my thoughts are confusing."</p>
<p>He came to a wire mesh fence and climbed it. Soon after, he knew that he was successful.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T08-54-59.000Z/_130055768_mishovwoods.png" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Dmitry feels a moment when you can finally breathe freely (the simulation scene of remake)</p>
<p>"I can finally breathe freely."</p>
<p>Dimitri imagined that the Russian authorities would start criminal lawsuits against him. But he believed that many comrades in his army would understand his motivation.He didn't know what he would happen next.</p>
<p>But Dmitry said he would rather try to build a new life in the European Union, and he was unwilling to mention it in his hometown.</p>

<p>The Chen couple participated in the 612 rally in London with a pair of children for the third consecutive year.

<p>(Voice of Germany in China) The Ministry of Commerce of China issued a statement on Monday (June 12) that the United States incorporated some Chinese enterprises and individuals in the "Special Specific National List" on the grounds of so -called Iran.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that the United States lacks the factual basis, lacks legitimate procedures, and harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and individuals. The United States should stop the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies and individuals. The spokesman said that China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and individuals.</p>
<p>Last week, the US Department of Finance sanctions on six entities and seven individuals of mainland China, Hong Kong and Iran, on the grounds that they were suspected of helping Iran to obtain parts and technologies for developing ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>The sanctioned companies include Beijing Shiny Nights Technology Development Co., Ltd. (LTD), Qingdao Zhongrong Trade Development (Qingdao Zhongron Trade Development), and Hong Kong KE.DO International Trade Corporation ( Hong kong Ke.Do International Trade Co.)And Hong Kong Lingoe Processing Engineering (Lingoe PROCESSSENGINEERING LIMITED) and Zhejiang Qingji IND.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said that these Chinese companies transported a centrifugal metal, electronic devices and gyroscopes to the Iranian government agencies and private companies that have been working closely and involved in the construction of missiles to produce nuclear fuels. Washington is worried that Iran plans to develop nuclear weapons and loads it on the ballistic missile to threaten Israel and other countries.</p>
<h3>Tehran will create the Iranian version of the "Fire Great Wall"?</h3>
<p>The Foreign Asset Control Office of the U.S. Finance also to the Iranian military officer Da Ud Damgini(Davoddamghani)Sanctions, saying that the military officer coordinated the military -related procurement of Iranian end users, including Iranian defense and armed forces Logistics Department.</p>
<p>Sanctions are prohibited from US companies and individuals, as well as companies such as multinational banks with branches in the United States to trade with companies listed on the blacklist.</p>
<h3>sanction list is getting longer and longer</h3>
<p>The U.S. Treasury announced in March this year that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美制裁五中企-指其助伊朗獲無人機零件/a-64940191">five Chinese companies and one person on the sanctions list</a>Called it to provide components to Iranian drone manufacturers. The five Chinese companies are: Hangzhou Fuyang KOTO Machinery Co., Ltd., and its company Raven International Trade Co., Ltd., which is famous in Hong Kong; Guilin Alpha Plastic Technology Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Kas Polo Technology Co., Ltd., S &amp; Ctrade Pty Co., LTD.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury said that these headquarters in China "sold and transport thousands of aviation components to the Iranian Aviation Manufacturing Industry Corporation (HESA), including components that can be used for drones", and said that these companies are against Russia. There is an indirect relationship between Ukraine's attack and Iranian attack in the Gulf area, because in the incident, both Russia and Iran use the Shahed-136 drone manufactured by HESA, and the Iranian company is indirectly controlled by the Iranian Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported in February this year that the U.S. authorities are considering <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美媒美国考虑制裁中国监控设备公司/a-64611654">sanctions on Chinese monitoring equipment companies selling products to Iran's security forces</a>Essence At that time, the target was Tiandy Technologies, an electronic equipment manufacturer headquartered in Tianjin. It is reported that Tiandi Weiye sold products to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards.</p>
<p>Tiandi Weiye has been included in the trade blacklist by the US Department of Commerce in December last year because the company uses facial recognition technology to assist the Chinese government to persecute the Uighurs in the Xinjiang region and sell them to the security department, police and troops in Iran. Monitoring equipment.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Switzerland, Switzerland, 13th) cryptocurrencies have been resisting supervision for a long time, but there may not be many days of freedom, because the European Union has recently led the United States through comprehensive regulations on cryptocurrency assets, and the United States is still arguing about the cryptocurrency industry Which organ should be supervised.</p>

<p>As the first comprehensive regulatory regulatory regulations in the cryptocurrency industry, the "Crypto Assets Fair" is used to reduce illegal behavior including money laundering and protect investors and consumers.</p>
<p>Jerome Bailly, vice president of Crypto Valley, the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain center, said: "Crypto assets have a clear understanding of the assets."</p>
<p>He told AFP in an event that supported a startup company: "We are no longer the era of the Western Wilderness. Everyone in this industry wants the rules of the game."</p>
<p>Belry said that although everyone was hostile to "encrypted assets" at first, "in the end it has become a selling point of Europe," because it establishes a clear structure for the company and can organize their business operations accordingly.</p>
<p>He believes that a "European Group" will appear, and Britain and Switzerland will follow up the European Union to establish a regulatory area.</p>
<p>Belry warned, but on the other hand, "signals from the United States are obviously negative."</p>
<p>The United States Corporation has been weakened due to the closure of SIGNATURE Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Silicon Valleybank. These banks are key institutions for financing in large science and technology industries and startups.</p>
<p>In addition, since the closure of the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX and Genesis, the US authorities have begun to rectify the industry and accuse the world's largest cryptocurrency trading platform Binance and its opponent Coinbase violated the securities law.</p>
<p>Belry said the uncertainty of the US supervision is a difficult place for the company. The United States is fiercely arguing whether cryptocurrencies should be regarded as financial assets and are supervised by the US Securities Management Commission (SEC); or it should be regarded as a commodity, and it is supervised by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>"We see that many companies are escaping from the United States and Europe," said THOMASNAEGELI, a lawyer in Liechtenestein This industry. "If there is no correct answer, they will worry about being sued in the court by the regulatory agency on one day."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国据报将在古巴建窃听基地-美称报导有误/a-65861382">For the Wall Street Journal China, China has set up an eavesdropping station in Cuba</a>, American White House spokesman Johnkirby said on Monday (June 12) that the United States has expressed concern to the Cuban government, but this will not affect US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Essence</p>
<p>"We understand that bilateral relations with China are now nervous," Cerbin told Reuters, "But the president hopes that the facts of maintaining communication channels with China have not changed."</p>
<p>A few days ago, many media quoted news that Brintken was expected to visit China this Sunday (18th). On the 12th, he said at a press conference that the espionage of China in Cuba was part of the country's dedication to expanding the plan of its overseas military ministry.</p>
<p>Blinden emphasized that during the period of former US President Donald Trump, the Bayeon administration has made progress in solving this issue. He said that since President Joebiden took office in 2021, the government has adopted diplomatic operations to contact countries that are considering building a Chinese base. According to expert assessments, this method has slowed China's efforts in the global spy bases in the world.</p>
<p>"We have been quietly and carefully executed this method," Said Brinken, but said that the results of the results could not be disclosed.</p>
<h3>China Appraisal of the United States and self -conflict</h3>
<p>The Wall Street Journal took the lead in reporting the matter last week. At that time, the White House in the United States said the news was "inaccurate". A few days later, anonymous officials confirmed to major media that China has established military and intelligence facilities in Cuba since 2019. To collect American emotion.</p>
<p>In response to the US response over the past few days, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on the 12th that in just two days, the official and media of the United States "scattered a series of contradictory information" in this matter, staged a " The farce of the United States denying the United States ".</p>
<p>"What I want to say is that it is really impossible to fake, and it really can't be fake." Wang Wenbin said: "No matter how the United States makes rumors and discredit, it cannot destroy the sincere friendship between the Middle Ages, and it cannot hide the large -scale and non -none of the United States for the world's countries. Different from eavesdropping the stolen spots. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T00-37-00Z/57180908_401.jpg" />Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Latin America in 2014 to meet with former Cuban President Lalestro.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Cuban government claimed that the report was "completely wrong and unfounded information," and Wang Wenbin also said on the 9th that he did not understand the relevant situation. It was said that the United States was the world's strongest "hacker" and a veritable "monitoring country."</p>
<h3>Cuba eavesdropping standing for years?</h3>
<p>On the 10th, an unnamed U.S. official told CNN that the spy base existed during the former president Trump. At that time, China upgraded its spy equipment in Cuba to intercept electronic signals of nearby US military and commercial facilities nearby; After boarding the office, the relevant ministries also reported the situation to the government, and said that China is considering setting up similar facilities around the world.</p>
<p>The other two anonymous people also confirmed that China has been using Cuba base for spy activities for the United States for many years. Recently, Cuba agreed to let China build new spy facilities on the island in order The facility has not been completed.</p>
<h3>Why choose Cuba?</h3>
<p>The Wall Street Journal analyzed Monday (12th) that China has been building monitoring equipment in the South China Sea and other places for a long time, and Cuba will be China's first outpost in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Michaelmazarr, an international security expert in Rand Corp., said that in the past, the United States believed that security challenges from China were limited to the Indo -Pacific region, so they could slowly eat China's position in Asia, but "This is this "The day has passed" because Beijing is also starting in Latin America.</p>
<p>According to reports, if the Cuban base is completed, its eavesdropping equipment is only about 100 miles from Florida, USA. Experts point out that this is likely to significantly increase the number and scope of China that can be obtained by China, which also includes signals sent from satellites to southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Former Australian intelligence official Michaelshoebridge told the Wall Street Journal: "Just as during the Cold War, it is useful to Russians in Cuba. This base will be useful to the Chinese."</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union built an intelligence base that can accommodate about 1,500 engineers in northern Cuba, which was closed in 2001. It is currently impossible to determine whether China will use the same place.</p>
<p>Former US Navy intelligence personnel Carlschuster said that although China may have mastered the major military targets in the United States, the tracking signal provided by the Cuban base will give China a more comprehensive understanding of other potential goals.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T00-37-00Z/64280811_401.jpg" />The United States has embarked on Cuba, and the relationship between the two countries is not harmonious. The picture shows the US Embassy in Cuban</p>
<p>Another experts believe that at this stage, it is not only the situation after the base built. It is the ability to build advanced spy devices in China, which is enough to show that the strength of China ’s collection of intelligence is increasing.</p>
<p>Drew Thompson, a senior researcher at the State University of Singapore, said: "The prospects of the China-Cuban United Base are disturbing, not only because of its meaning, but also because of their potential military and intelligence." If the two countries integrate military capabilities in the eastern waters, it will have a significant impact on US security.</p>
<h3>Mei deliberately dilute the conflict?</h3>
<p>The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the establishment of eavesdropping stations in Cuba will give China the opportunity to return teeth to the United States, but China is unlikely to bargain with the United States, asking the latter to withdraw Toughness has also made cooperation commitments to allies such as Japan, Australia.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper analysis, compared with the "spy balloon" incident in February this year, the United States' response to the Cuban base was relatively calm, and it was likely that the situation was unwilling to upgrade the situation. The trip to China is rumored to start on June 18](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688)Essence In addition, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国计划放宽对古巴的若干限制/a-61822235">Because the United States has embarked on Cuba and the relationship between the two countries is not harmonious</a>If the big movement is pressured, it is likely to cause anti -effects.Faced with criticism, an anonymous U.S. official told the New York Times that US diplomats have tried to contact the potential countries that intend to build a Chinese base and exchanged their opinions. The official emphasized that expert assessment has delayed the speed of Chinese stations, but he refused to disclose more details.</p>

<h3>US -China Semiconductor War Entering the artificial intelligence AI chip in Deepwater District, why becomes the key</h3>

<p>Huang Renxun, President and CEO of Huida, delivered a keynote speech at the Grace Hopper super chip at the Computex exhibition on May 29.</p>
<p><strong> This summer, artificial intelligence (AI) chip (chip, Chip) application show index level growth. According to analysis, this is due to various AI products such as ChatGPT and Midjouney, and the performance of AI chip has soared this year. </strong></p>
<p>It was once considered that during the epidemic, due to excessive production of chips, it was expected to face the semiconductor industry that slows production this year, but because of the increase in the demand of AI chips, it became the focus of the world again.</p>
<p>This also allowed the leader of the development of AI chips, NVIDIA, Nvidia, Nvidia). ), Jensenhuang, founder of Huida, has also become a new focus of the international fintech industry.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Huang Renxun believes that a series of bans in the United States have caused Chinese semiconductor companies to start producing their own AI chips and compete with Huida's current heroic games, drawing and artificial intelligence processors.</p>
<p>However, the AI chip industry cannot avoid geopolitical issues, especially in recent years, in the United States, "spicy tricks" have been continuously produced in the United States to try to restrain the development of the Chinese chip industry. Whether the White House will ban the front -edge companies such as Huida and other AI chips in the future AI chips to Chinese customers (such as Tencent or Baidu, etc.) are waiting and seeing the world. In the face of the US tribute methods that the United States may use, how to accelerate its own production of domestic AI chips, becoming the focus of the next US -China semiconductor war.</p>
<h3>AI chip, the US -China Semiconductor War</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that like oil, semiconductor cannot escape regional politics. The United States launched a trade war on sanctions against the Chinese semiconductor industry a few years ago, which was almost fully launched. Since TSMC and other companies are required to ban the sales of chips to China technology leader Huawei in 2019, the latter ’s mobile phone production line has been cut off and has been fully stopped so far. The chip bill implemented in the United States in 2022 requires those who have American green cards and nationality, and they cannot serve among Chinese semiconductor companies, causing strong protests in China.</p>
<p>Last month, China announced the sealing of Micron products to China. Bloomberg said that this was Beijing's export control measures for the United States. ","</p>

Huida's customers in China include almost all China's technology e -commerce leaders, including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and Douyin's parent company. These companies are specially needed to sell AI chips on their sales products. AI chip technology is also an important technology involving military weapons and medical drugs, and its sensitivity is getting higher and higher.</p>
<p>Merchants feel particularly deep in the face of the US -China semiconductor war. In an exclusive interview with the Financial Times at the end of May this year, the host Huang Renxun said that in order to hinder the export control measures implemented by the semiconductor industry in China, Huida has "tied hands and feet". One sells several advanced AI chips.</p>

<p>Huang Renxun, an American technology entrepreneur born in Taiwan, founded Huida (Nvidia) in 1993.</p>
<p>Huang Renxun believes that a series of bans in the United States have allowed Chinese semiconductor companies to accelerate the production of their own AI chips and compete with Huida's current proud of the game, drawing and artificial intelligence processors. He emphasized that China "if there is no way to buy what you want, China will do it by itself, so the United States must face it with caution."</p>
<p>Professor Zhu Yuezhong, an expert in semiconductor industry and Professor Zhu Yuezhong of Nantai University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, told BBC in Chinese that Huida has not yet officially disclosed the proportion of Chinese revenue in the company's overall revenue, but he estimates at least 10%. In other words, the Chinese market has a great impact on the company. Zhu Yuezhong said that as a businessman, Huang Renxun was not surprising to have opinions on the United States' ban on China.</p>
<p>In addition, China's AI platform, such as Baidu or Alibaba, now develops the use of AI chips, and most of them still come from the US businessmen Huida and Chaou (AMD) before September 2022. Zhu Yuezhong said that the Chinese AI development platform is still not smooth like ChatGPT or Google. Therefore, after using high -end chips bought by the United States, China's AI development will inevitably encounter resistance.</p>

<p>American investors are also prohibited from holding or trading SMIC.</p>
<p>Of course, China has been developing domestic AI chips in recent years, including Cambrian, Haiguang Information and Baidu. However, Zhu Yuezhong believes that these AI chips need high -end chip factories to cooperate to mass production. However, the strongest company SMIC in China is now, and the highest chip process is only 14nm, so it is necessary to surpass the United States in a short time, and the possibility is very low.Tirias Research founder and semiconductor analyst Jim McGrego, the founder of Tirias Research, told BBC Chinese that the AI chip industry and the world need the United States and China to need more. It is elastic and willing to negotiate and lead development. He said: "Unfortunately, I don't think this will happen. We are moving towards a situation that forced industrial division and may cause economic disasters."</p>

<p>Some experts believe that chips have become "current oil" and are vulnerable to geopolitics and triggered the global crisis.</p>
<h3>AI chip?</h3>
<p>Like the oil of the last century, the chip was the main lifeblood of global technology operations. The chip is used in mobile phones, computers, military weapons (such as supersonic missiles) and automotoring. The use of high -end chips is the key to continuing to upgrade these products in the future.</p>
<p>AI chips were developed and produced in this context, and began to affect human life.</p>
<p>At present, it can be seen that the development of AI chips is accelerating the processing speed of machines and super computer learning and deep learning, so that users can make breakthrough progress in the fields of image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The emergence of AI chips has driven the development of autonomous driving, smart homes, the Internet of Things and other fields, bringing more intelligent application convenience and even risks to human daily life.</p>

<p>Can ChatGPT write the opening of "The Night of the News", but can artificial intelligence save the technology giant?</p>
<p>Global scientists are entering the research and development of AI in the semiconductor field, and this year has made great further breakthroughs. Associate Professor Huang Chaozong of the Artificial Intelligence Research Center of Tsinghua University in Taiwan explained: "If the AI application is like a car changes the way human transportation, then AI chip is an indispensable fuel. It is necessary to provide the amount of fuel of the same level, which is the importance of AI chips in today. "</p>
<p>Long -term study of artificial intelligence and chip, the Huang Chaozong told BBC that the main reason for the attention of AI chips is the rapid rise of the recent "Gen AI" neural network.</p>
<h3>Key: Generate formula AI</h3>

<p>Therefore, some comments said that after World War II, changes in the contemporary economy, from oil finance to chip financial, are now entering AI chip wealth.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that applications for "generating AI" applications, such as text generation and image generation, will be foreseeable to be integrated into the workflow of individuals and enterprises. For example, Bingchat, ChatGPT, Google Bard, Office365 Copilot, Midjourney, etc. have begun to be integrated. The development of Huang Chaozong said that the development of "generating AI" is the key to how AI chips can continue to produce.</p>
<p>Huang Chaozong told reporters that the bottleneck of the previous AI development was that it was impossible to effectively and stably train oversized networks, especially its training materials was a quite large text library or gallery. However, in recent years, scientists have successfully found a suitable training method and established a huge genetic network that was unimaginable. The quality of its generation has also achieved the degree of unable to distinguish between human beings.</p>
<p>He believes that the current bottlenecks of implementation have become "how to make hundreds of millions of users in order in order to make inferences."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-13T01-46-29.000Z/_121793474_militaryrobot.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,In response to the "generation AI", McGregor, a semiconductor analyst, told BBC in Chinese that in the next 10 years, AI will affect our almost all living needs, such as work, entertainment or education.</p>
<p>He pointed out: "AI's secret lies in Software, which is constantly developing." He emphasized that in the foreseeable future, AI is mostly used on very basic use cases, such as battery control, monitoring or control noise, accounting for about 90 %. However, with the advancement of technological, especially in the development of generation AI (Gen AI), "AI foresees a more challenging task, which we see in applications such as ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion."</p>
<p>Huang Chaozong said that in terms of education, it is foreseeable that AI will be a double -sided blade. One can accelerate the speed of self -learning students with high enthusiasm, but on the other hand, it may also weaken the ability of students to integrate knowledge by themselves: "At present AI owns It is based on the accurate guessing ability under the huge man, rather than the causal reasoning ability of human use, so he still must be quite careful in use. "He said to the BBC.</p>
<h3>Who leads the production of AI chips?</h3>
<p>In the context of the Silicon Valley Factory, which started to make a drawing chip (GPU),, the GPU is very suitable for AI computing, with the explosive development of AI technology and application products since the development of this year, many years of investment have gained an amazing return. There are several factors for analyzing the reason why Huida leads in the AI chip industry.</p>
<p>First, the company has a leading position in the field of graphic processing unit (GPU). The high parallel computing capacity of the GPU makes it an ideal choice for training and running large -scale neural networks. In addition, the company has been committed to developing hardware and software tools (such as Tensorrt, etc.), which has been dedicated to artificial intelligence for many years, which provides developers with strong tools and support.</p>
<p>For example, the analyst Sag told the BBC that "many leading positions of Huida in this field are the result of the company's investment in software, especially the product CUDA developed (unified computing architecture, can integrate software and hardware), Make full use of the programming of GPU to provide high -performance and easy development GPUs. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-13T01-46-29.000Z/_130042041_318967236_647812617345705_77822953705204696_n.jpg" />Image source, Joe Biden Facebook</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Liu Deyin (second from right), the chairman of TSMC (second from right), was a wafer. The second left is Huida Huang Renxun.</p>
<p>Analysts McGregor explained that as the processing requirements increased, especially large language models (LLM), equipment, networks, and clouds' demand for more professional AI treatment are also increasing. He told the BBC that this processing requirements were integrated from the basic MCU (microcontroller unit) to SOC (system single chip), and now all the transactions such as the separation accelerator such as GPU produced by Huida. He said, "The reason why Huida became the leader of AI chips is not only because its chip dominates the cloud's AI training, but also mainly because the company continues to invest in development software tools and databases."</p>
<p>The Huang Chaozong of Tsinghua University observed that Huida began to work hard to maintain the developer platform more than 10 years ago, so that AI researchers can easily use their GPU for research. This is the deep reason why the company is currently difficult to replace. However, he also emphasized that if the chip has been recognized as the oil of the new era. Under this metaphor, the oil production company currently located in the throat is actually TSMC.</p>
<p>He believes that because Huida's TPU (tensor processor, which is a dedicated stagnant circuit developed by the company, for accelerated machine learning) is produced by TS -Power. "Therefore, in the future, AI chip chip in the future The development potential or bottleneck, TSMC plays an important role. "</p>

<p>Description: The Hong Kong government applied to the court a week to prohibit the spread of this song on the Internet. The judge asked the Hong Kong government to specifically explain the scope of its requirements and be scheduled to hold a hearing next month. This case may further challenge the operation of technology companies in China. Lam Yik Fei for the New York Times 2019, people gathered in a shopping mall. Among them, "Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" became the representative song of the Hong Kong protest movement.</p>

A judge delayed decision on Monday that the case may further challenge the operation of technology companies in this Chinese city.</p>
<p>After the judge asked the government to explain more specifically, it was scheduled to hold another hearing on July 21.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have been fighting any behavior they think they are threatened to pose national security, and arrest and prosecute for individuals.</p>
<p>On Monday, the court hearing club was involved in the song "<a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230608/hong-kong-google/">Wish to return to Hong Kong</a>》 It has always been a special detonation point of the government. The song with the song challenged China's suppression of the former British colony's political abnormalities.</p>

Last December, Hong Kong authorities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gl3LefdcyM">Criticism</a>Google showed the protest song in the search results of the Hong Kong national anthem.</p>
<p>On Monday, Chen Jiaxin, a judge of the Hong Kong High Court, asked government representatives to answer a number of questions, including clarifying the respondent who had applied to the petition.</p>
<p>Ren Jianfeng, a senior researcher at the Asian Law Center at George University of Melbourne, Australia, said: "The judge is ensuring that if the prohibition is issued today, then some basic conditions can be met."</p>
<p>The impact of this case on how technology companies operate in Hong Kong still have to be observed.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Google and Meta set up offices in Hong Kong. Now both companies have hundreds of employees in Hong Kong. Twitter opened the office in 2015, but closed two years later, and there are no staff in the city.</p>
<p>Chen Yan, managing director of the former public policy director of Meta Greater China, is now the managing director of Taiwan and Hong Kong, the director of Taiwan and Hong Kong, who is currently a Washington consulting company the AsiaGroup. These companies can use a general technology called geographical shielding.</p>

<p>Google's parent company Alphabet refused to comment. Meta did not respond to the comment request.</p>
<p>The tension between technology companies and Hong Kong authorities began to upgrade in 2020. At that time, Hong Kong passed a wide range of [National Security Law] <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20200701/hong-kong-security-law-explain/">National Security Law</a>It aims to eliminate opposition to the Communist Party of Governance. Monday's petition was not in accordance with the formal lawsuit of the National Security Law, but the government quoted the law last week as the reason why the court approved its request.</p>
<p>Since the law has passed, the authorities demanded that the request for deleting Internet content has increased. According to Google, Hong Kong officials requested that in the second half of 2022, the content deleted from YouTube and Google Search for the content reached <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/">183 items</a>It is the highest peak of ten years, and the general rise in requests related to national security is the main reason. The company rejected about half of the request.</p>

The children of migrant workers are children who fill the kindergarten for children of migrant workers. Because the economy is not good, people working in Chengdu are reduced. "</p>
<p>He Peirong said that in addition to kindergartens, this phenomenon also appeared in elementary school: "In the countryside in Sichuan, the so -called so -called so -called rural primary schools in the past few years have disappeared and merged. The main reason for the Central Primary School is the reduction rate of birth. "</p>
<p>Some research institutions predict that by 2035, the demand for rural elementary schools in China will be less than half of 2020, only 35,500.</p>
<p><strong> Last year, the kindergarten and elementary school students were reduced by more than less than less than 2 million </strong></p>
<p>According to data from the Ministry of Education of China, the number of young children in garden and elementary school students in the country declined. Preschool education was 46.2755 million in children in the garden and 107 million students in elementary schools, a decrease of approximately 1.77 million and 1 million compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>The Chinese population has entered negative growth since 2016, leading to a rapid decrease in the number of kindergartens in various places. After the Spring Festival this year, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other cities issued the primary and secondary schools in the fall of 2023 in the 2023 degree excess warning; the phenomenon of "urban crowding, weak townships, village empty" appeared in various places, that is, the rural population moved towards the town, the towns move towards the county, the county's population to the city, Provincial capital movement.</p>
<p>According to expert forecasts, by 2035, there may be more than one million elementary school teachers in China.</p>

The enthusiastic worshipers and stubborn critics regarded their great influence. Essence</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/world/europe/silvio-berlusconi-dead.html">Famous Year</a>The 86 -year -old Berluskini was born as a real estate and media tycoon, and then became the most powerful figure on the dramatic Italian political stage. He not only completely changed Italian politics, but also subverted Italian sports, daily life, national image and popular culture -all realized through his private TV channel -left a mark on almost everything he had contacted, Or scars.</p>
<p>"Goodbye Silvio," Georgia Meloni, the prime minister of the United Government, said in a statement about him, saying that he was "one of the most influential people in Italian history." His national funeral will be held on Wednesday at the Milan Cathedral.</p>
<p>Even if his death may disturb the stability of the political world and Meloni's ruling alliance, his party Italian force party is one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/world/europe/berlusconi-italy-right-wing.html?searchResultPosition=9">small and key factor</a>Essence</p>

<p>Berlusco is extraordinary, and he seems to believe that he can live forever as many Italians. He recently set his "physiological age" to his 50s and never designated heirs for his middle and right Italian party.</p>
<p>Therefore, political analysts believe that either one of his children will take the initiative to control the party and even the ruling alliance, or the United government will disintegrate without him, so that the Melonini government, who has just started a five -year term, His fate is doubtful.</p>
<p>As a result, Berluskini brought the last shock to the political system. Although his health status and political influence have declined in recent years, everything around him can be said to be the product he created, and it is shaped by supporting or opposing him as a "knight".</p>
<p>This includes those political allies who have snatched him, such as Meloni; the political traders trying to win him; even the anti -building opposition that tried to drive him -but never succeeded.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has been singing "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTVr0zkDfys">Thank you, there is Silvio</a>"Fans said that he was an irresistible force that made Italy's political modernization, mature democracy, and added capitalist vitality to the decaying economy of the government.</p>
<p>His critics believe that he is the incarnation of the country's political and cultural decline, a cunning businessman who entered the politics in order to protect his business interests, and a Italian swing with flowers. Contempt and strong leader.</p>

<p>He and many contradictory roles: a reformer who promised to liberalize the country, but then governed like populist. This Gu family's man has a long string of young partners, especially known as "jump plus and jump"(Bungabunga)At the reception, this was not only a scandal that made the whole country shake, but also made the clutch who also pursued the same pursuit of love him. He is a firm ally and lover in the United States, but defended Putin and his Ukraine. In the case of obvious conflict of interest, the candidate used his TV channel as a political stick.</p>
<p>Dean of the Roman Louis Government College, "Berluskini and Italy: Historical Interpretation"(Berlusconism and Italy: A HistoricalInterpretation)The author of the book, Jostani Olsea, said that it is a very, very complicated issue to make Italy better or worse. Berlusco has an impact on the Italian imagination for 30 years, and this debate may last for at least so long. To be sure, he changed Italy.</p>

<p>Italian News Media <a href="https://www.linkiesta.it/">Linkiesta</a>The editor Christian Roca said: "His impact through TV is far -reaching than the election cycle." Roca said that Berluskini changed the ancient Italian program. "Although those programs are colorful, they are the same as black and white. "He brought new Italian style variety shows with beautiful women, movies, and beauty as the main character.</p>
<p>Critics believe that the transformation of this row and tacky culture not only continues in TV broadcasting, but also penetrates throughout Italian society, changing people's appearance and the ambitions and dreams of a generation of Italians. , Ambitional and false -the wealth and self -confidence represented by.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-13T03-36-56-08-00/12berlusconi-assess-02-vhlk-master1050.jpg" />For many Italians, watching Berluskini has always been a pastime. He loves to perform dramatic performances and downward remarks. These remarks have funny many people and anger many people. Agence France-PRESSE-Getty Images</p>
<p>For half a century, the collapse of communism has been the main boundary of Italian politics. After that, Berluskini has "entered" the collapse of the political system under the bribe scandal -this is his own famous saying. Berluskini became the new boundary of Italy.</p>
<p>"This is his great innovation," Roca said. "Whether it is in favor or opposition, you can't be indifferent."</p>
<p>Berlusco's polarization style is not only retained in Italy, but also becoming a global trend. Trump is the most obvious in Trump in the United States. Trump is imitating Berluskini's exaggeration in many ways.advertise</p>
<p>Erko Rita, a left -wing opponent of former Italian Prime Minister and Berluskini, said Berluskini began to do so through "changing the daily life of Italians with commercial television", giving them more choices. In return, these audiences provide "huge votes reserves" for Berluskini.</p>
<p>He also changed the way of speaking by Italian politicians. He showed optimism, and used critics to make his own excessive demonization and create a perfect victim image. He described all the people who criticized him as a red communist, creating a good campaign style and an orthodox solution for the system. Later, this style was refined into his enemies and assistants in the past ten years. A large amount of toxic information is used.</p>
<p>However, while the people of Italian, while paying tribute to Berluskini on Monday, they also began to plan the next step.</p>
<p>In recent months, Berluskini's loyal supporters have been competing for power. Among them, the current head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Antonio Tajani, in fact, has become the senator of Berluskini's nurseries, Lisia Longzuli, and his girlfriend Malta Farcina, a 50 -year -old girlfriend in Berluskini, He had a wedding with her, but did not formally get married.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-13T03-36-56-08-00/12berlusconi-assess-jlbp-master1050.jpg" />Analysts said that the stability of the Italian government may depend on the decision of Berluskini's daughter of Berluskini. Daniel dal zennaro/epa, via shutterstock</p>
<p>"As the Italian force party, despite being injured, we have the responsibility to continue," Tagani said. He also said that Berluskini hoped that the party would be united and stayed in the government. "To commemorate him and continue his career, we must look forward to the future. The Italian Power Party will be there."</p>
<p>The former left -wing Prime Minister Martio Lunzi seemed to be regarded by Berlusco as a potential successor, but later he betrayed Renzi (after the betrayal of him). Renzi tried to position himself as the heir of the Morns of Italy, which was once controlled by Berluskini, to win the attention again.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Many people think this is an impossible task. But Lunzi is a sophisticated political trader. He can't wait to start to win Berluskini, and get sufficient support again to become a key figure in Italian politics. Whether it is to support or overthrow the government of Melonini.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Melonney said that when she was a young minister in a certain government in Berluskini, Berluskini's reputation made her very embarrassed. Berluskini explicitly supports Putin in the Ukrainian war, which makes her a headache politically. ("For me, Silvio is a dear person, a real friend," Putin said in a statement on Monday.)</p>
<p>But now, Meloni, who remembers him, needs to retain his supporters.</p>

<p>Analysts said that the stability of the Italian government may depend on the decision of Berluskini's daughter, Marina, and she is generally considered to be the most keen person in the Berluskini family, and the family itself also has inheritance disputes.</p>
<p>"The question is, will Marina Berluskini intervene?" Said Roberto Dalimmont, a political scientist at the University of Louisy Gado Carry. "Without Berluskini's brand, this party will dissolve."</p>
<p>"If she intervened," he said, or clearly stated that she was operating behind the scenes. "This party will have the opportunity to survive, and the Melony government will not be particularly affected," because the two are considered consistent Essence Marina Berluskini is an executive of his father's business empire and does not seem to like politics. If she decides to stay away from the party, "the impact will be greater."</p>

<p>Her father will affect no matter what she does.</p>
<p>Roca said that there is such a story that can summarize Berluskini.</p>
<p>He said that when he just started as a Milan real estate tycoon, he wanted to build a suburban residential area and sell it as a peaceful and tranquil oasis.</p>
<p>But the airport nearby airports are hard to accept. In order to change the aircraft's route, Berluskini built a hospital -because the plane could not fly over the hospital, there were many people along the way. Later, the hospital named San Lahael became an excellent medical center. On Monday morning, he died there.</p>
<p>"This is Berluskini -entrepreneur, illegal, politicians," Roca said. "But go around to the end, this is still a good thing."</p>

<p>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi died at Milan on June 12 at the age of 86.</p>
<p>This is the end of an era. It is difficult to imagine that it has no Silvio Berlusconi, although the country has been working hard to solve its identity during the post -Berluskinian era.</p>
<p>Over the past 50 years, his shadow has shrouded people on parliament, media, football and streets.</p>
<p>In the tribute film on Monday (June 12), Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni praised his "courage and determination", saying that he was one of the most influential people in the country's history.</p>
<p>"Through him, Italy knew that he could not allow himself to be restricted and never given up," she said.</p>
<p>During his heyday, Berluskini wore colorful headscarves on a yacht in the Geyin Sea, which may be mistaken for a pirate.</p>
<p>But he had a huge impact on Italian society and politics and became the object of highly complex civil and criminal investigations.</p>
<p>As a cruise singer, he enjoyed the pleasure brought by the audience who worshiped him for the first time, and the experience of becoming the center of the stage determines his adult life.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Berluskini has been a singer on a cruise ship.</p>
<p>As a media tycoon, he witnessed the dazzling American television network, and has since changed the Italian TV station. The exposed women defined many of his programs, just like they also dominated his private life.</p>
<p>This has caused the Italian culture to change, and they can suddenly watch a television show with political incorrect jokes and "Veline". "Veline" is a word in Italian, which means "Draft Girl".</p>
<p>For decades, the Italian television channel led by the public broadcasting company RAI has been rigorous and serious. Berluskini decided to put the audience's preferences first and create commercial television stations in Italy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-13T03-45-52.000Z/_107148258_gettyimages-526743830.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>

<p>Berluskini decided to put the audience's preferences first and create commercial television stations (1986 information photos) in Italy.</p>
<p>Even today, if you browse the Italian TV channel, you will inevitably encounter half -naked young women.</p>
<p>Berluskini is not enthusiastic about politics, but because of the desire to protect its growing business interests.</p>
<p>He was elected Prime Minister four times and attracted extensive voters. The former entertainment tycoon shaped a colorful image, which was in sharp contrast to the conservative intellectuals that had previously formulated the Italian route.</p>
<p>But the person, known as the "ILCAVALIERE", commented in the Italian people because his policy (including his controversially joining the invasion of Iraq leadership in the United States) and his entire lifestyle.</p>
<p>In 2018, when I interviewed him as a BBC reporter, I saw this with my own eyes. At the end of our conversation, the camera was still shooting, and we held our hands.This also reflects why many Italians hate him, because his obvious gender discrimination and disrespect to others, but others worship him as a "man's man".</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Berluskini has the Italian football club AC Milan.</p>
<p>Just as writer Curzio Malaparte, Berluskini's quality and disadvantages are "the quality and disadvantages of all Italians."</p>
<p>In fact, many Italian newspapers believe that he has invented populism in Italy. Several right -wing politicians in the 2010s were often used to compare with others, including Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Berluskini played a key role in allowing extreme right wings to enter mainstream politics. He is an alliance with the Northern Union (an independent party that calls on some parts of northern Italy) and the National Alliance, which pursues the new fascist.</p>
<p>Meloni himself became a well -known politician under Berluskini's wings, and served as junior minister in his last government.</p>
<p>Berluskini hopes to impress the world. He transformed his villa in Alcura into a palace with the Renaissance paintings. His villa on the island of Sardine looked like a theme park, including a fake volcano that erupted lava.</p>
<p>Investigators found that female artists and models often patronized these villas, where they received gifts and cash envelopes.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Sexio Berlisco and Karima El Mahroup, which involved sexual intercourse scandals, denied that they had had sexual relationships.</p>
<p>In the end, the sexual intercourse party of "Bunga Bunga" crushed him, but that it was unable to deal with the unsustainable level in Italy's debt in 2011.</p>
<p>His political collapse occurred during the financial crisis, when the Italians believed that he responded to the country's weak economic responsibility.</p>
<p>Numerous criminal investigations for his bribery and corruption, as well as Yu Bo of the infamous "Bunga-Bunga" sexual intercourse party, also continued to make him struggling.</p>
<p>What is Berluskini's political heritage? He has almost no political reform. He seems to be more concerned about creating his own image, not managing a country.</p>
<p>But his ups and downs hypnotized a country.</p>

<p>这篇文章吸引42万人点阅，近8500人点赞，但在微博已遭到删除。而转述这篇文章并且还能留在微博的帖子大都是批评发文者的心态“不可取”、“国家有难、人人有责”等政治正确的观点。</p>
<p>“在中国，很多类似声音发不出来。我们所关心的是真正不让这种声音发出来的体制和制度，无法衡量哪种声音在上升。”旅美时事评论人士江峰接受本台采访时就此表示，无论是反战或拥战言论，在中国都具有很大的不确定性，甚至是欺骗性。他认为，不能因看到反战文就认为中国民心开始觉醒，反对独裁政府；正如看到鼓励要对台湾发动所谓“留岛不留人”的恐怖言论，也不能认为真正的中国人人心都是如此。</p>
<p>台湾的中华亚太菁英交流协会秘书长王智盛则认为，反战文一定程度表达了中国一般基层民众的心声，对于战争、武力统一的排斥与抗拒：“更深层的是，习近平这几年各式各样的作为，导致中国老百姓全面躺平的心态反射在对台所谓武统、战争的作为。”</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T04-02-00-04-00/000004.png" />The original articles of the anti -war have been removed, and only the post -critic posts have been criticized.(截图自微博)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-06132023035850.html/008xm4j3gy1hd4zfoc31oj30wi1x8qe9.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T04-02-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> Chinese polls echo the opposition to the unified Taiwan </strong></p>
<p>Wang Zhisheng takes a polls jointly by Singapore's National University professor Liu Yao (Adam Y.LIU) and the associate professor of Li Xiaoyi, an associate professor of Shanghai University of New York as an example. However, only 1%of people support the most extreme options, that is, they do not try other options first and start the war, which shows that the Chinese people can accept the government's gentle position in Taiwan.</p>
<p>In addition to reflecting the anti -war emotions of the Chinese people, the above -mentioned polls, Wang Zhisheng said, "The Chinese people are not talking about their lives, the society collapses the poor, and has the brains of Wu Tong Taiwan all day. The psychological refraction of the people. "</p>
<p>Zhang Jing, a senior researcher at the Chinese Society of Strategic Society in Taiwan, said in an interview that the online supervision of mainland China was extremely tight, but due to the huge amount of information and frequent activities of netizens, some posts still caught the supervisory unit. Before deleting this post, it will still attract a large number of netizens to read, comment, like and forward. Because the real -name system of the network user is adopted, as long as the user comments, likes, and reposts can be tracked in their true identity. These data volumes are worthy of in -depth research and control of scholars in the Chinese network ecology.</p>
<p>Zhang Jing: "Because the true identity and location of the original post of the Internet, when the lack of the information of the land connection relationship, I cannot arbitrarily determine the war in the war. It is quite dissatisfied with the current treatment, and it is also believed that the system of military mobilization of mainland China is not fair. In this regard, it is indeed the value of in -depth investigation of the specific truth. "</p>
<p><strong> Former PLA officials released the European release and uniform air balloon </strong>Regarding whether Taiwan will become the next Ukraine, he pointed out, "As long as Beijing believes in peace and reunification, it is still possible that the war in the Taiwan Strait is not unavoidable. So far, Beijing has not lost patience so far."</p>
<p>The reason for Zhou Bo is that for decades, China's defense budget is still lower than 2%of its GDP. In addition, the PLA held a military exercise near Taiwan in April this year. Beijing thought deeply that it only conducted analog attack, which was different from Perosi to Taiwan in August last year.</p>
<p>In this regard, Wang Zhisheng believes that Zhou Bo's article is investing in the British journal, facing European countries, and Beijing is released an important message, that is, Wu Tong is not an option in Beijing now. Beijing is still trying to seek peace with Taiwan, and even move forward. Push one step, "is peace rather than unified."</p>
<p>Wang Zhisheng: "Since the 20th National Congress of last year, China has been shaping a peaceful image and an image willing to interact with Taiwan. Whether the article is a reserved attitude of Western doubts about China, whether this move can only be regarded as a wind balloon by China.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) On May 31st, a letter of help is "too late, but it should also be caught." It touched many oppressive Taiwanese women and sexual minority groups, and ignited the flames of Taiwan's METOO.</p>
<p>The author described himself as a Democratic Progressive Party worker, and was sexually harassed by the director of cooperation. Starting from this letter, Metoo is like star fire, and victims of sexual violence such as sexual shows and sexual assault have appeared on social networking sites, spreading from the political circle to social movement, media, academic, diplomacy and other fields.</p>
<p>According to the Taiwan Executive Yuan, according to the Formula of Gender Inequality (GII) formulas of the United Nations Development Program, Taiwan's gender equality in 2021 ranked first in Asia. However, although <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/再創亞洲第一-台灣通過同志無血緣共同收養/a-65632519">Taiwan's gender equality has improved in Asia</a>, This wave of Metoo outbreak is more than <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/首尔已故市长朴元淳葬礼启动-50万人联署抗议/a-54154867">South Korea</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国公益圈媒体圈metoo风潮忽然涌起/a-44836769"> China</a>It's about 5 years later.</p>
<h3>China Metoo Great Incident: Zhu Jun was charged with sexual harassment case opening</h3>
<p>Wu Weiting, director of the Institute of Gender, Taiwan Shixin University, said in an interview with DW that compared with <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/專訪中國公眾對性別暴力事件無解感到絕望/a-62120418">China</a>Waiting for <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国修订妇女权益保障法-聚焦性别歧视和性别暴力/a-63598217">Gender Legal System</a>In the lack of countries, Taiwan is "lucky". It has established the "Sexual Puttering Law" such as "Equal Equality Law", "Gender Education Law", and "Sexual Happiness" for sexual harassment on different occasions. The specifications are relatively complete.</p>
<p>However, there are not enough law. Women's groups have pointed out that the current mechanism of sexuality is still not enough to "catch" the victims of sexual violence, and more people choose to forbearance. Wu Weiting said that many people's transit has been exported for many years. From this point of view, it is better to experience "how deep the trauma is ... let these victims have been after several years, after more than ten years, or even more time, even more time, or even more time. In fact, the trauma has never left. "</p>
<h3>Taiwan Metoo incident successively</h3>
<p>In late May, the DPP announced that the former CEO of the Kuomintang Youth League Li Zhenghao, the DPP, asked him to run in the party's arduous constituency. The Democratic Progressive Party cooperates with this person, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣九合一選舉女性參政創新高的背後/a-63745442">criticism of young generations violated the value of progress</a>Essence After the incident, Li Zhenghao took the initiative to announce the withdrawal, but for the charges of sneak shots, he said that "the determination to defend his innocence will not change."</p>
<p>Some observations believe that the DPP cooperates with Li Zhenghao, plus <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/民主的可能樣貌理想與現實中的人選之人/a-65625170">Taiwanese drama "candidate" has caused attention to sexual harassment in the workplace</a>It stimulated the outbreak of Taiwan. Subsequently, people with social influence have told Metoo stories that they encounter sexual harassment or sexual assault on the Internet, driving more people to be willing to speak. The following is several cases that caused warm discussions on the Taiwan Internet:</p>
<p>"Candidate" screenwriter Jian Liying accused, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/贝岭当选独立中文笔会新会长/a-17197697">Chinese exile poet Beiling</a>During her college, she harassed her, and her "routine" was to translate the young women of literary and artistic women, and then approved the residence. When Beiling was interviewed by Taiwanese media, he described his letter with Jian Liying as the "love letter" that attracted each other's attraction of the opposite sex. In response, Jian Liying responded: "The release of goodwill and worship is not a sexual invitation. Too as emotion. "</p>
<p>Well -known reporter Fang Huizhen revealed that when she first entered the industry, she had been touched her chest with her elbows at the dinner; Zhao Sile, a Chinese text worker Zhao Sile, also confirmed that Wang Jianqiang had been harassed. In this regard, Wang Jianzhuang apologized to Zhao Sile, but said that Fang Huizhen was "not true."</p>
<p>The Kuomintang member Zhong Peijun publicly kissed the kiss of Zhu Xueheng, who was named Zhu Xueheng, and the other party also destroyed the promise of an apology. In this regard, Zhu Xueheng claimed that he had "drinking the film" at the time. On the 12th, he apologized to Zhong Peijun on Facebook, saying that he had already "reported" the case in the Taipei District Procuratorate, but Zhong Peijun approved his complaints to be cautious and avoided, "without repentance."</p>
<p>People with women -oriented in various fields stood up one after another. Regarding the sexual violence relay that had suffered in the past, Taiwan Metoo opened the prelude and continued to surge.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T04-03-00Z/65818322_401.jpg" />This wave of METOO movement participants in Taiwan are mainly women, but there are also men who come forward to allegations. For example, political worker Li Yuanjun (also known as Li reinforcement) held a press conference to accuse the six 4 leader Wang Dan sexual harassment on June 4, and described himself as " The person standing in front of the tank car. " Wang Dan denied the relevant allegations.</p>
<h3>Why do you say it?</h3>
<p>In the interview with DW, Peng Renyu, an associate researcher at the National Institute of Nationalities of the Central Academy of Central Academy, described this wave of Metoo in the small label "Creator" named "Candidate". Just like the staff is the pusher behind politicians, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/公开讨论性侵让metoo再浮水面/a-58821481">Each spoken sexual violence victims are also "making waves"</a>: When social energy reaches a certain degree and more people say, the less energy everyone pays.</p>
<p>Peng Renyu also wrote multiple trauma experiences on Facebook since the age of 5, violating or harassing her parents with her parents, as well as teachers, hydropower and strangers. She throws a question: "How many sexual assaults should be encountered in the process of growth, study, and career of a girl or boy to grow into a way to defend themselves enough?"</p>
<p>She told DW that although she had never intentionally hidden these experiences, she was looking forward to the disclosure on the Internet, which could affect the victims who were still "invisible" and even the victims, prompting the public to reflect on the public, "What kind of social situations, in what kind of social situations, Under what kind of social and cultural framework, this behavior will always be in some vague zone, and there is no way to be considered clearly. "After the first "Building Letter", another former DPP party worker wrote: "I know at this moment, the DPP cannot afford to have a second victim. Any victims will occur. If you don't say it, there will be the next girl who will be injured, and I will be able to forgive myself even more. "</p>
<p>Unwilling to see the idea of being killed again is the common point of many Metoo stories. Peng Renyu told DW: "Most of the victims did not want to harm the social death. More people said that they would not have the next victim."</p>
<p>She further stated that sometimes the victim did not "shout and kill", but instead filled with people's indignation, as if "the victim died." However, the public should not think that they can easily stand on the "justice" position, but do not reflect whether they have hurt others, or they are stunned. Excessive discussion on the outside world may make the victims more unable to speak, and even be counterattacked by conservative forces.</p>
<p>"I look forward to the direction of the promotion of this movement is to try to establish a system of responsibility that makes people who do wrong, and assume the responsibility that match his fault or severity," Peng Renyu wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T04-03-00Z/65887224_401.jpg" />Peng Renyu, an associate researcher at the National Institute of Research, said that she hopes that the wave of Metoo in Taiwan can promote social thinking and how to establish a responsibility system that meets the principles of proportions for the principle of proportions.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>"I always said no, hold my hand, please, please stop ... I also remember that he had a great arms and hugged his body. He was very powerful. I couldn't move it. I might have tried to shoot two times to let go, but after this I murmured to talk to myself a few times and stop. "</p>
<p>On June 10, a woman who had lived in Germany wrote more than 4,000 words of Metoo stories in facial writing. He accused Polish diplomats in Taiwan, Bartoszryś, offending her and led to her suffering from stress. She said that he spent 20 minutes "persuaded". He should not do this: "There is a girl who raised a girl like this society. In the end, I even said that not to be polite.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she asked Li Bo to apologize and decided to take a judicial approach. However, she informed her friends that her "nothing" of the text became a court evidence, determining that she "afterwards was very different from the response from the general sexual assault", and the lawsuit was rejected.</p>
<p>Li Bo advocated that the court in Taiwan has determined that "the allegations will not be established" and said that the accusation of the woman had asked him 2.5 million Taiwan dollars, implying that she had accused her for money. In this regard, the woman denied "". The two parties accused that DW failed to confirm.</p>
<p>In court, the evidence of the sexual assault charges is high, and the evidence of the two often turns into each word, so it is quite difficult to convict. According to data from the Taiwan Ministry of Justice in 2020, the percentage of the final conviction of sexual assault cases was only about 15%. The report issued by the Taiwan Science and Technology and Law Society in 2017 pointed out that the biggest main cause of sexual assault is "whether the victim and witness's certificate is inconsistent or contradictory."</p>
<p>According to the report, in the judicial procedure, "the victims were forced to repeat the victims from the police, the prosecutor's investigator, and the trial of the court along the way." Damage is also more likely to be contradictory.</p>
<p>In addition, whether to actively resist when the incident and whether to continue with the defendant afterwards are the main factor that the court determines the defendant's innocence. However, experts point out that the victims of violence are suffering from trauma. The reaction after trauma may not be the same as the behavior pattern of general rational logic, and it may not be in line with external imagination.</p>
<p>Liao Shuwen, Secretary -General of the "Taiwan Riot Alliance" engaged in violence prevention and control, said in an interview with DW phone that if you do not understand this, "all the reactions of his (victim) will be as expected with you, what you think you think, what you think should be, what you think should be, what you think should be, what you think should be, what you think should be, what you think should be, what you think you think, what you think should be, what you think you think, what you think should be, what you think should be, and what you think should be, what you think should be, what you think should be, and what you think should be. He did not meet ", and even misunderstood the contradiction of the victim was" lying. "</p>
<p>Peng Renyu, a scholar of the Institute of National Institute of China, believes that justice is the responsibility of replacing the victims on replacement of the society, but sometimes the judge or prosecutor will "do not know his role" and interrogate the victims as the victim. "Incorrect preparation" is an important principle of protecting the defendant's human rights and avoiding the case of injustice. It has its own necessary and must be extremely cautious. The victim's guilty presumption. "</p>
<p>Peng Renyu said that when both sides are fair, it is like trials on both sides: while trialing the defendant whether the defendant has sexually assaulted others, he is also paying attention to the plaintiff whether there is a perjury. However, "maintaining the impartiality of investigations" and "avoiding victims' second time" should not be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Compared with sexual assault and slightly more sexual harassment cases, responsibility is not easy. According to a survey from the Ministry of Labor from 2017 to 2021, about 70 % of the sexual harassment of the workplace did not appeal because they were worried that they were pointed out and they were afraid of work without guarantee, and became "silent black numbers." In addition, because the interaction may not be able to record, recording immediately, and harassment cases, it is difficult to search for evidence. Many people tend to "do not find trouble" without appealing, which also makes many harassment incidents fail to be responsible.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T04-03-00Z/60563977_401.jpg" />After speaking of their own experience, for the victims of sexual violence, the responsibility of appealing and judicial channels still face difficulties. (Experience diagram)</p>
<h3>Social healing possibility: After Metoo, what's the next?</h3>
<p>Women's groups pointed out that Taiwan's sexual complaint mechanism often flows in form, and related laws also have loopholes, so they call for the law to amend the law as soon as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国职场咸猪手并非罕见/a-50989333">Workplace sexual harassment</a>For example, the Women's Team criticized the labor institution of the Labor Property to focus on whether the employer has set up prevention and control measures in accordance with the law, but does not have any effect on the appeal mechanism, and whether it can really punish the harm. The major loopholes in the "Equality Law of Gender" also include the situation that "employers are the victims" often become "investigating themselves"; women's group claims that a better approach is to establish a "external independent investigation mechanism" by the labor authority.</p>
<p>For victims, maybe judicial channels cannot obtain justice, but "[<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/米兔中国一个女研究生的性侵故事/a-45333552">right to recapture the interpretation of victims</a>"Still important. Peng Renyu, a scholar of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "When speaking, someone is willing to believe in me, what happened to me is true." After speaking, each victim expected the results of differently, and even some people may not know " What is the justice that you want? "At this time, you need to sort out experience and heal your psychological space.Liao Shuwen said that many times the victims need to apologize by the victims, but not to avoid the superficial skills of criminal responsibility, but to truly admit and realize how much harm to the victims; however, this is in Taiwan society is more difficult to achieve than expected, because the current social atmosphere and education have not yet made gender violence awareness that they are doing something "very harmful to others."</p>
<p>Observing the wave of METOO in Taiwan, the accusables often emphasize that they have no motivation to harass, and blame the problem on the gap between "intent" and "subjective feelings".</p>
<p>"When the victim says that I don't have that intention, he is ignorance of the law, or is responsible." Wu Weiting, a gender scholar of Shixin University, said: "When people interact with people, we can't feel the other party. I feel uncomfortable, or the other party is hiding with you, or the other party is afraid ... After seeing the other party's response, I have to go to Push, and I have to keep sexual harassment or words. That is obviously a criminal. "</p>
<p>How to strengthen gender education on body line and relationship interaction requires deeper reviews, and maybe it is possible to change the social environment from the young generation. Wu Weiting pointed out that the education site is still due to the pressure of conservative groups, so that many teachers still "do not dare to teach" flat education, and young people cannot learn true respect. "This is the price of conservative forces that give us Taiwan society."</p>

<p>Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>[Author's words] _ I am Wu Shihong. [A few months ago, I introduced the humble work "Crossing the Hills] on FT Chinese website"(http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001098031)". This time, I would like to introduce "Anti -Wind Flying" (adding version). This book was born in 1999. It was regenerated in 2023. After 24 years and the Chinese calendar two cyclists, the origin of various twists and turns, and finally re -life. In this version of the additional part, I have added an experience of falling into the abyss of the sinking sand, which is exactly the opposite direction of "flying"!For the first time, the injury of entrepreneurship was opened just to explain a sincerity. I used a life of Jiazi to make this new brewing plus wine. I borrowed FT inch square treasures and presented to Zhujun. _ _ _ 吧 _</p>
<p>I do n’t have much confusion myself. I focus on being a good manager. It is as wise as men, and it does not prevent naturally maintaining femininity -it is the unique pride of being a woman.</p>
<p>After 30 years from a girl to a woman, someone gradually started to call me a "strong woman", and later it became my nickname. I have a three -paragraph reaction to this nickname, reflecting my journey.</p>
<p>I was startled for the first time. It turned out that I was "strong" in the eyes of others. In fact, I didn't do anything at that time, but I did it in foreign companies for a few years, and the sales of locals were even less common for women. Later, I became a manager. I took a half step ahead of the excellent people around me, and I thought I was strong. At this time, others called me a strong woman. I started to have a rebellious psychology, and I often said seriously, "Please don't call me like this!" Sometimes I couldn't even hide my face. I like "strong", but I am only willing to be acknowledged that it is true, not because of gender "giving points"!I don't like "female strong women", and because of the poor psychological image of this word, people have mentioned strong women. "I often think of powerful and lustfulness, walking and walking with the wind, and the corners of the clothes will hurt people. ", I hope my ability will be recognized, but I don't want my woman's charm to be ignored.</p>
<p>Analysis of this psychology is still not confident enough. I care too much about how others think of me. I only use the eyes of others to reflect their own image with other people's eyes. Whether it is a woman or a professional, I have no confidence in confidence. Essence</p>
<p>I thought about a lot of things before leaving Guangzhou. The most important of these is the first analysis of myself. I asked the meaning of my life. I chose the meaning of life -pursuing wonderful success and realizing wonderful in the process of pursuing career ideals. This is destined to pursue the difficulties. Since you choose to pursue it yourself, you must prepare to pay, and you cannot expect to get everything you want from life. I already have the success of my career. This has given me a unique comprehensive charm. I have been appreciated by most men and women. I should also know how to appreciate the charm I created. The success or failure of a woman is only one standard for marriage and family. When I choose to be social and professional, I should measure myself fairly with comprehensive standards. I am not a failed woman.</p>
<p>I have since calmly the title of "Women Strong", although I still prefer my real name -Wu Shihong, very masculine name, there were often people who thought it was a sir; Juliet, the name of the unprepared woman, her beauty was all in the whole The world is circulating. The two add up to me well: women+professional.</p>
<p>I especially like the professional positioning of "professional manager". It understands the connotation of crowd and practice clearly. This is my choice.</p>
<p>When I first started being a manager, I only demonstrated myself, and I felt that no one was more assured of myself. My behavior naturally enabled the habit of asking people to form a thing. demonstration. At that time, I only had four people, and I was tired of being tired. After I arrived in Guangzhou, the order of the management crowd has changed, from more than 40 people to more than 240 people; if the manager is full of business, it is far more than that of the sales that you know. I have to learn to listen to others, learn to ask meaningful questions, learn systematically and abstractly, learn to trust people, and learn to encourage and confidence to the team to help them think about problems. The identity of the personnel is transformed into the team's organizer and coordinator; participating in market competition has also become the role of commander. From accepting simple sales indicators to full market planning, this transformation is difficult, but I have completed this key in a timely manner The transition has crossed the watershed from the manager to the professional manager.</p>
<p>The manager should have a distinctive style, and should be able to actively, firm and effective infection and affect the team. If you are ambiguous, hello, I am good, everyone is good, it will make the team unsatisfactory and indifferent, and it may also cause discipline to lose their due deterrence. When I first entered Microsoft, I had intended to obscure my distinctive style. As a result, I delayed the precious timing of the overall prevention of the overall prevention of the overall prevention, or to return to myself, to win the victory, and I can truly win the team.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-13T04-17-25-00-00/000184084_piclink.png" />After doing the high -level level, directly facing the manager, it will be very different from the generals, and we must focus on the "reason" ("understanding"), and "tube" and "belt" should flow into nature and intangible. To fully trust the elite generals, and feel that it is truly responsible, it will inspire a sense of responsibility (such as the female boss's entrustment, and may even arouse the heroic sense of mission and righteousness). At the same time, it must be a spurker. If you dare to decentralize, I am a practical person. When it comes to it, it is easy to be difficult. After I finally learned the "decentralization", I discovered that it was infinite. There are many wonderful results beyond me. However, the manager who really understands and controls the overall situation is qualified to "decentralize", otherwise it is neglecting the duty and even "suicide". I will keep in mind the lesson of "blood".</p>
<p>In the last few months of Microsoft, I have comprehensively practiced the role of professional managers in a high density: warfare commanders, team leaders, coordination, inspiration, spurring, decentralization, and -inspiring and comprehensive team wisdom. The last point is one of the most proud and successful experiences of my manager.</p>
<p>I often ask: What is the special impression of a woman as a manager? This is the same as the "female strong woman". The root cause of the Chinese culture -the manager is the man's nature. In fact, the "manager" and "women" are not contradictory. Being a manager is not because it is a woman, but because of the ability (most female managers must agree). Most women who are managers will be more dedicated. Luxembourg said, "When there is only the last revolutionary on the street, this revolutionary must be women." Some female managers and entrepreneurs will overcome themselves into the image of a "standard female strong woman". They will not hesitate to kill the natural charm of women, just to confirm that women can fully look like men.</p>
<p>I do n’t have much confusion myself. I focus on being a good manager. It is as wise as men, and it does not prevent naturally maintaining femininity -it is the unique pride of being a woman.I choose to be a professional and choose the social field of men. I believe that my own fate of my fate is that when I have my home, I will use my life to operate, there is no barriers, and a beautiful green.</p>
<p>Today I already have the balance of life. It comes from the freedom of grasping the meaning of life, choosing pursuit of myself, and mastering fate. Balanced power gives me a generosity and peace, making me more cute and becoming a better person. I will also grow up, and I will find a lot of "yesterday and now", but I will never lose the balance of life.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past, I found that I have got too much: my parents give me life, raise me to love me; I have to regenerate after a few times, I have a few more lives than others; my friends give me selfless friendship, regardless of glory and disgrace, no matter glory and disgrace The rise and fall will care for me and support me; my lover has given me love, died and lived, and left endless beauty, let me understand the fullness of women's life; I have encountered so many good people, and help me when I need it most when I need it most. Help me, give me a chance, they are the "nobles" in my life; there are so many nobles who will never meet, use their books or write in books, teach me to think, train my emotional intelligence, Pointing for me to make a role model ... I have gone through inferiority, self -esteem, self -confidence, and self -realization until I can have ideal pursuit until I can understand the meaning of life. The self -discipline learning of the day after tomorrow training to the extreme of talent and life.</p>
<p>The culture and philosophy of Americans are very simple. I like a few of them:</p>
<p>——Ling is your own decision, and happiness is your own decision every day.</p>
<p>——Love like never ben hurt, dance like nobody'swatching.</p>
<p>I choose a happy, free and full successful life.</p>
<p>I love myself, love people. I don't have any complaints. I feel good as a woman and a professional!How can I not thank life? Do not want to live more passionately!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65896716/65855056"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T04-58-00Z/65855056_303.jpg" /></a>Argentine football "Ball King" Messi played in France at the end of May</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The relevant news of "Globe's entry into China" is not only "crazy" on both sides of the strait, but many foreign media also follow -up reports. If this news is true, the value of the report is not the same as small, but it is a pity that it is a pity that it is a pity that it is a pity No one can prove that Messi once said that "Taiwan is not in China?"</p>
<p>There is an adjective called "Perfect News" in Western news media called "Perfect News"(perfect news)That is, a news is not enough to report at first glance, but usually this kind of "perfect news" is not right. Take Messi's news as an example. According to the initial news version, it is said that Messi brought a Spanish passport, not a "visa -free" Argentine passport, so it was stopped to enter China The entry regulations will find that whether it is a Spanish passport or Argentine passport, there is no [visa -free treatment] in China.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/哪国护照最畅行无阻中国护照变强/a-43930444)Essence</p>
<p>Later, a version of Messi appeared "Messi's Spanish passport, which can only be exempted from Taiwan. Messi is innocent: Isn't Taiwan in China? (Do you say that Taiwan is an indispensable part of China?", But there is no Who he heard Messi said this. The Spanish passport really enjoys the treatment of visa -free entry in Taiwan, but it is really difficult to believe that Messi or his teammates did not check the Chinese entry regulations before departure, not to mention participating in the competition hosted by the Chinese Football Association, although the Chinese Football Association may follow the convention according to the convention Special arrangements for the team to receive visas at the airport to avoid the laborers move to the embassy to apply for a visa, but the entry regulations in Taiwan are one thing, and China's entry regulations are another. Even if Messi does not understand, the Argentine team’s team does Relevant personnel will not understand these regulations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T04-58-00Z/65157846_401.jpg" />When Messi went to China to participate in a football game, it was not possible to enter the country because of visa issues (diagram)</p>
<p>A netizen did not follow the posts, which set off thousands of snow. It was impossible to happen in the era without the Internet, but now as long as it is the right appetite, an ordinary person can also make a bunch of media and Internet celebrities. Hold your nose and walk as a "giant" who can't be done before. Maybe they see the results of such "madness" will be complacent. Anyway, everyone takes what they need, and even if the Chinese Football Association explains and rumors, it is the believers. The responsibility and possible consequences are another thing.</p>
<p>Some people say that young people now believe that online news is more believed in the media too much, so young people often transfer to leave news, but the old -fashioned leave news is probably not less than young people, but it is just transferred to use. The community media are different. When old people, they often transfer to the posts of some experts and authoritative people, telling you what to eat to prolong life and keep good health. If they remind them, they will be stricken. "But isn't it easy for counterfeit experts to write posts? And the facts of the facts of the investigation have been identified as fake information, so in communication, sometimes young people are more logical, and they are older than they are "determined" and "positive".</p>
<p>The influence of the Internet is really far away. For example, the recent sexual harassment incident in Taiwan or <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣metoo延燒-下一步是什麼/a-65896549">Taiwan version #Metoo,</a>The victims can reveal the harm through the fastest way in the Internet, so that the society and relevant units can be remedied, but the same, the Internet will also become a tool for providing false information to cause others to be harmed and bullying, but it is just a person as a person. After receiving a "interesting" post or message, how many people will think about whether there is a problem with this post or message before <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/事实核查如何识别人工智能生成的图片/a-65293514">"transfers"</a>Intersection Because once you press the "transfer", you will also become the victims who have been deceived by fake information and the victim who assisted in the spread of fake information.</p>
<h3>False news? Intersection AI!</h3>
<p>_ Janwick: The medical deserter born in Taiwan once lived in the United States and then went to the UK to work in the United Kingdom. He also studied the history of East Asia. He left Taiwan in the 1980s and returned to Taiwan to settle around the world. _ _ _ 吧 _</p>

<p>Description: Over the past two decades, Hydeburg University, the oldest university in Germany, has been working with the University of Science and Technology of China to jointly study quantum physics. As for how this top Chinese university has a close connection with the military, it has just attracted the attention of Germany until recently.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65895830/65874107"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65874107_303.jpg" /></a>The team led by Chinese quantum physicist Pan Jianwei released 76 photon quantum computing prototypes "Nine Chapter" on December 4, 2020</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) Behind a forum with pink plastic fake flowers, a man is introducing a laser radar system that can be used to detect invisible aircraft. <a href="https://www.xast.org.cn/info/1479/49273.htm">This 20 -minute video circulating on the Internet</a>The date is marked as December 2020. At the time of the epidemic control, the event organized by the Xinjiang Science and Technology Association to introduce the results of the research on Chinese quantum technology is held online.</p>
<p>A young man asked during the event: What is the significance of quantum technology research on Xinjiang? The speaker replied that Xinjiang is "the main battlefield of counter -terrorism and stability." Need to mention the identity of the speaker: the technical executive of Guodun Quantum Technology Co., Ltd.. This article will be ink again later in this Chinese technology company.</p>
<p>The speaker mentioned in the answer that "our national defense security is very stressful", especially in the field of information security, "some hostile forces in the West have tapped and stole our internal information, and put forward higher information security on our information security. Require".</p>
<p>In recent years, large -scale data leakage incidents such as "Xinjiang Police Documents" and "China Decryption" have allowed the outside world to recognize that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新疆独家报导1再教育营强冠我们假罪名/a-53722596">the comprehensiveness of the Chinese authorities' monitoring and suppression of the Muslim minority of Xinjiang Muslims</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65874245_401.jpg" />The Chinese government refers to the "re -education camp" in Xinjiang in the picture as the "Vocational Training Center"</p>
<p>The speaker of the Guildren Quantum believes that the key to solving this problem lies in quantum communication technology, which helps "better support the overall goal of our society's stability and long -term stability."</p>
<p>However, what does this online speech on the research results of Chinese quantum science and technology have something to do with the University of Heidelberg, Germany? The German Voice Investigation Team cooperated with the German news survey agency Correctiv for several months, revealing the 20 -year German -China scientific research cooperation that had been rejoicing and recently caused by both sides. In addition to the University of Heidelberg, we will also focus on Pan Jianwei, a Chinese quantum physicist, and he is also one of the co -founders of the national shield quantum.</p>
<h3>Talent Cradle Heidelberg</h3>
<p>Pan Jianwei studied for a master's degree in physics at the University of Science and Technology of China in his early years. He went to Vienna, Austria in the mid -1990s.(AntonZeilinger)Doctorate. In the summer of 2003, he moved to the University of Heidelberg.</p>
<p>Heidelberg, founded in 1386, is the oldest university in Germany. The picturesque small town on the side of the Neka River has a population of only 160,000, but it can attract scientific researchers from all over the world. Over the years, the University of Heidelberg's Physics and Astronomical College has been considered to be the top institution of the basic research of quantum physics.</p>
<p>Austrian quantum physicist Schmidel, a Austrian quantum physicist who worked with Pan Jianwei(JörgSchmiedmayer)Recalling: "Pan Jianwei is always very interested in basic issues, trying to explore whether you can develop some new technologies from basic issues." Schmidmel said that the topic that Pan Jianwei was concerned was: quantum confidential communication transmission distance distance How much can it be? How to achieve it?</p>
<p>Some analysts even believe that quantum technology will have a deeper change in the world than the Internet. When Pan Jianwei himself responded in writing and Correctiv in writing, he firmly believed that these emerging technologies would eventually make humans "comprehensively benefit". However, quantum technology also has broad potential in the military field, especially in spy reports, reconnaissance, and monitoring.</p>
<p>Pan Jianwei's scientific research results were great, and the fame of gradually accumulated in the field of quantum communications allowed him to receive a lot of important awards, and he also received a lot of scientific research funding support.</p>
<p>Herman, physicist at the school(Norbert Herrmann)In an interview with the Voice of Germany and Correctiv, Pan Jianwei was already a "absolute star" at first; the reason why quantum technology research at the University of Heidelberg could stabilize the heel, "especially due to Pan Jianwei", all of which "of course, it is also there is also there is also there is also in it. The status of our college has been enhanced at the international level. "</p>
<p>At that time, China, as the most important trading partner, became more and more popular in Germany. Both the politics and the economy are very happy to see German -China science and technology cooperation.</p>
<h3>藕</h3>
<p>Pan Jianwei came to Heidelberg in 2003. He spent more than 5 years in the environment that he was almost disturbed. During this period, he often flew back to China. Pan Jianwei is very good at building a network network. He recruited a total of nine young Chinese quantum scientists and asked them to study at Heidelberg University. These young Chinese people also received funding from Europe.</p>
<p>Schmidmel recalled that in Heidelberg, "for five or six years, we jointly studied some cool basic scientific issues. The cooperation has achieved a considerable influence."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65874263_401.jpg" />In 2018, Pan Jianwei was elected as the world's top 100 most influential figures selected by Time Magazine</p>
<p>In 2008, Pan Jianwei returned to China. He never concealed his love for the motherland. He not only took his apprentices, but also took away his laboratory and research projects. Many devices followed Pan Jianwei to be transported to the Campus of the University of Science and Technology in Hefei. It is worth mentioning that at that time, the European Union had just allocated a 1.4 million euros of R &amp; D funds for Pan Jianwei's research team at Heidelberg University for 5 years.</p>
<p>With Pan Jianwei's return to China, China has continuously released the latest research results of quantum communication technology, which is also the fastest development of the field of quantum technology.</p>
<p>In 2016, Pan Jianwei's research team will <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国成功发射世界首颗量子科学试验卫星/a-19477120">"Mozi" quantum communication satellite</a>Send it to space. In the fall of 2017, a video connection between Beijing and Vienna used the confidential communication channel set up by this quantum communication satellite for the first time.</p>
<h3>Suspicious military contact</h3>
<p>The archives at the University of Heidelberg show that even if Pan Jianwei returns to China, the cooperation between the university and the University of Science and Technology will be suspended. In 2009, Pan Jianwei appointed Pan Jianwei as a lecturer in 2009. Pan Jianwei was still sending young scholars to Heidelberg to study. In 2011, the two universities also signed a teacher -student exchange agreement.</p>
<p>By 2016, the two universities planned to cooperate in China to establish a joint quantum research center in China, while the person in charge was Pan Jianwei and Weidemuler. In the preface to the cooperation agreement signed the following year, the National University of Defense Science and Technology of the People's Liberation Army was also mentioned. This is a university directly affiliated to the Central Military Commission, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission is Xi Jinping himself.However, this ambitious cooperation plan has not become a reality so far, and maybe it will not be in the future. China, a beloved partner China, has now become a "institutional competitor" in Germany. China is showing a more confident attitude. Just in November last year, a draft of the disclosure of the disclosure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote: "China's military -civilian integration policy is facing our cooperation, especially these cooperation will strengthen China's ability to send military power and internal oppression internally. ","</p>
<p>Pan Jianwei still retains the identity of the chair professor of the School of Physics and Astronomy of Heidelberg.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65791774_401.jpg" />The University of Heidelberg is the oldest university in Germany and one of the top ten elite universities in Germany.</p>
<h3>German physicist who is curious about China</h3>
<p>President Wei De Mueller of Physics and Astronomical College(Matthias Weidemüller)A face -to -face interview with the Voice of Germany and Correctiv was accepted on the campus of Heidelberg. Weidermu came to the University of Heidelberg in 2008, the year when Pan Jianwei returned to China. However, Wei Dimuler is still considered the most important partner of Pan Jianwei in this oldest university in Germany.</p>
<p>He led the reporter to visit the college's laboratory and pointed out: "Basic science researchers must conduct research, but need to be clear rules. This includes transparency and public."</p>
<p>In 2013, Wei Dimuler received an invitation from China. Later, he went to China University of Science and Technology under the framework of the "Thousand Talents Program" framework. Wei Dimueller accepted the top Chinese top scientific research invitation. According to himself, it is mainly because of "curiosity about this country and its people."</p>
<p>Many Western scholars have rejected the invitation of the "Thousand Talents Plan", and some of them refuse from ideological concerns.</p>
<p>Wei Dimueller became a member of the "Thousand Talents Plan", hosted by Pan Jianwei.</p>
<p>Pan Jianwei himself said to the Voice of Germany and Correctiv, "Promoting academic exchanges and talent training of cross -cultural and cross -borders has a decisive significance for the healthy development of science, because this has a profound impact on the well -being of all humanity." This year was convinced of this time in Europe.</p>
<p>The National Research Center of Hefei Micro -scale Material Sciences set up a laboratory for Wendermuel in the Shanghai Research Institute of China University of Science and Technology. Before 2018, Wei Demuller stayed there for two months every year. Since then, he is still a lecturer at the University of Science and Technology. Weidueller's last time to go back to China to go back to the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in 2019.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65888149_401.jpg" />In 2016, Wei Dimuler won the "Friendship Award" awarded by the Hefei Municipal Government</p>
<p>During the interview, Wei Demolle emphasized that he set up a very clear boundary for himself, "No one tried to persuade what I studied." He said that academic freedom is very important to him, "We are to nature As raised questions, we urgently want to understand the mechanism of nature. "</p>
<p>Wenderuller bet all the enthusiasm for basic scientific research. As for whether the research results will be transformed into military, he is indifferent. He explained, "As a basic science researcher, of course, we will not pay attention to this."</p>
<p>Since 2019, Wei Demuller has also served as the vice president of the innovation results of the University of Heidelberg. Therefore, he certainly knows that the research results of quantum technology have the potential to transform military use. However, he still emphasized: "Researchers can decide how close or far from the application is from different research methods."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65791760_401.jpg" />There are currently two doctoral students of Pan Jianwei studying at the Institute of Physics, the University of Heidelber</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Branch</h3>
<p>In addition to Pan Jianwei, there are now 11 scholars who have been studying in Heidelberg at the University of Science and Technology. Among them, some people are leading the national key research projects, and some people have participated in the establishment of startups in the field of quantum technology. These companies have been confirmed to be related to the military.</p>
<p>After returning to China, Pan Jianwei also quickly participated in the establishment of Guodun Quantum Technology Co., Ltd. The company's largest shareholder is the University of Science and Technology, and the second largest shareholder is Pan Jianwei. The company often uses an advertising word: "Protect each bit with quantum technology." In 2022, the company disclosed in a report submitted to the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it was participating in "multiple military projects." In addition to the headquarters of Hefei, the Guogeon quantum also has 6 points, including the Xinjiang branch established in 2017.</p>
<p>In the early years, Cheng Yangyang, a Chinese particle physicist who studied the development of Chinese science and technology in China at the University of Science and Technology of China and the current Yale University studying Chinese science and technology development and Sino -US relations. There is a place to refer to. " "This young company set up a branch in Xinjiang. This fact shows that the company is likely to have a very close connection with the Chinese authorities' security agencies."</p>
<p>Pan Jianwei told the Voice of Germany and Correctiv that he did not know why the national shield quantum had a branch in Xinjiang. He claimed that after 2011, "except as shareholders, he never participated in the company's leadership work." The national shield quantum did not reply to the reporter's inquiry.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65874050_401.jpg" />The relationship between Pan Jianwei and Chinese military suppliers has caused concerns about Heidelberg University</p>
<h3>US sanctions</h3>
<p>American intelligence security company "Entering Technology"(StriderTechnologies)Reports have been released at the end of 2019 that Pan Jianwei and the University of Science and Technology of China have connected with China's military industry. The report also believes that the University of Heidelberg "may be the most important foreign partner in the field of quantum technology, which is developed rapidly, and the military and civilian use."</p>
<p>Pan Jianwei herself stated in the voice of Germany and Correctiv that after he returned to China from Europe in 2008, "no project was supported by the military." However, Pan Jianwei also acknowledged that "the development of any technology may be used for military purposes"; "even if a certain technology can be used for military, it is not something scientist can control or predict." When Pan Jianwei replied, he deliberately used a full -write letter to highlight the word "any"(ANY)Essence</p>
<p>The U.S. government introduced in 2021 <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/阻北京军事发展美又双叒叕拉黑中企/a-59926021">Sanctions for Guild Shield Quantum</a>Essence The reasons for sanctions are: Guogeng quantum is a Chinese technology company that "supports the Chinese People's Liberation Army's military modernization". In addition, the United States also accused the national shield quantum "obtaining or trying to obtain US supplies to support (China) military application."</p>
<p>The Voice of Germany and Correctiv have repeatedly sanned the US authorities to make an inquiry letter, but the United States did not provide further information. China and the United States have been fighting for the leading position of quantum technology for many years.NATO Alliance Transformation Supreme Command(SACT)In February 2022, we also began to pay attention to the application research around the University of Science and Technology. The highest transformation command is responsible for promoting NATO countries to prepare for future war forms.</p>
<p>It is reported that at a online meeting, the Command spent an hour discussed the rapid progress in the field of quantum technology in China, which also mentioned the connection between the University of Science and Technology and Heidelberg University, and the connection between the national shield quantum and large military enterprises.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T05-08-00Z/65873977_401.jpg" />On April 26, 2016, Xi Jinping, the highest leader of China, inspected at the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>
<h3>Academic freedom and moral responsibility</h3>
<p>Regarding military -civilian cooperation in the field of scientific research in China, electronic science and engineering group(C ETC)It provides a good case. The main business of this state -owned enterprise is concentrated in the field of communications technology and data processing, and it is clearly stated that they also face the needs of the military and national security departments. A mobile app for Xinjiang Police to comprehensively monitor Uyghur people is also from the hands of China Electronic Science and Technology Group.</p>
<p>In 2018, the University of Science and Technology of China and Electronic Science and Technology Group signed a scientific cooperation agreement, including the field of quantum scientific research. It was Pan Jianwei signed on behalf of the University of Science and Technology. At that time, he had also served as Vice President.</p>
<p>Pan Jianwei stated in a written reply that quantum scientific research needs extensive international cooperation. "The important thing is that I am committed to improving knowledge and creativity to better serve human beings and society."</p>
<p>However, China is no longer regarded as a "normal" partner in Germany and Europe. The European Commission stated to the Voice of Germany and Correctiv that in the "high development and closer to the market's field of scientific and technological innovation", cooperation with Chinese institutions is no longer "in line with EU interests."</p>
<h3>What is quantum physics?</h3>
<p>In the face of stress, the University of Heidelberg established an export control office in 2022 to carefully review whether the potential for military applications for transnational research projects. The oldest university in Germany is facing a principle problem: if a partner "is" difficult to avoid from military institutions due to institutional factors ", how should cooperation be carried out?</p>
<p>Zeng Ci, the vice president and sinologist in charge of teaching in Heidelberg University(Anjasenz)I am also thinking about this problem. She believes that the cooperative relationship with the University of Science and Technology of China is "a very typical case." Zeng Ci was unwilling to set the red line with a knife, but he hoped to "criticize the influence of technology critical."</p>
<p>When asked about Pan Jianwei, Zeng Ci said that he had to "critical companionship" on a person's development process, and asked himself at a certain time: "What role does this person play under this system?"</p>

<p>Wei Dimueller avoided the issue of Pan Jianwei. He is also a vice -principal. Even if "someone is at a certain moment to make a common basic scientific research results in a certain way, the danger of being applied to the purpose that is not used" should not be cut off. He also said that he could imagine to go to China again when the frame condition is appropriate. "Do we want to stop communication on the major topic of natural science?"</p>
<p>In the face of such questions, there is no simple answer. What we know is that China is planning to build the most modern army by 2049, and through technological transfer achieved with Western scientific research, it is an important means to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>In the "Thirteenth Five -Year Plan", China mentioned the military -civilian integration policy in the field of science and technology, which emphasized that quantum technology research plays an important role and strives to transform the results of civilian basic scientific research into military.</p>

<p>He will be like "Good guy"(Goodfellas)Those gangsters in it, so that their own cells should be available. He will enjoy a variety of privileges, putting the songs of "Elvis" and Pavarotti; he can get a steady stream of Viagra, cheese burgers and spouses to visit (not Melania). Maybe he can still bring people in his dedicated orange hair dye.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that someone has tried to enter the White House from the cell. In 1920, Eugene Debers was sentenced to incitement for condemning the United States to participate in the First World War (he believes that the First World War was a capitalist war). ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/01/us/politicians-indicted-trump-rick-perry.html)Become the nomination of the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>"I can be a candidate who lives at home," he joked when he was asked how he would run. "This is not so troublesome, and my manager and opponents can always find me." He was allowed to send a briefing to the United News Agency every week. As for Trump, it will be sent to Newsmax.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>However, Trump will not be imprisoned because he adheres to his own principles. If he goes to prison, it is because he has no principle. We are witnessing him gradually revealing. It was a large, dangerous scammer and criminal. As Logan Roy said, he was not a serious person.</p>
<p>The dramatic trial of the Donald J. Trump case in the United States of America was a proper turning trial. Earlier, Donald J. Trump has sued the United States of America. He tried to plan a coup to overthrow the government he led. I gamble Jack Smith later to make these allegations.</p>
<p>The special prosecutor clearly stated that this was not only what Trump called the "box scam". You can't steal confidential documents; leave them in the golden shiny bathrooms, cleansing rooms, bedrooms and ballrooms in the Macaolu Manor; then take them out to show off, remind others how important you are. Trump's arrogance is his biggest weakness. He couldn't help but brag. Hey, I have so many confidential documents.</p>
<p>The indictment accused Trump that violated the Anti -Spy Law and other laws, which provided shocking photos, showing that the secrets of the United States were like "Poly Coopea"(Hoarders)It is piled up as well as under drying clothes, guitar boxes and other items.</p>
<p>"The confidential files placed in the box include the defense and weapons capabilities of the United States and foreign countries, the nuclear planning of the United States, the potential vulnerability of the United States and its allies in the face of military attacks, and possible retaliation plans to deal with foreign attacks." The book says. "Unexpected disclosure of these confidential documents may endure the continuous feasibility of the United States' national security, diplomatic relations, the security of the US military and human resources, and the method of sensitive information collection."</p>
<p>Well, it's bad.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>This prosecution is based on the information provided by Trump's own lawyers, staff, telephone records and monitoring cameras. This is not a insider or hate Trump wants to deal with him. It clearly stated that Trump deliberately reserved and hidden these documents. God knows what he intends to use these documents to do, and God knows who he wants to show it.</p>
<p>The former president instructed his servant Walting Naita (he was regarded as Trump's co -conspiracy) to move about 64 boxes from a storage room to Trump's official residence, and moved about 30 boxes back to the storage Room -Lawyer Trump who did not notify these materials.</p>
<p>Even the lawyer said that Trump later encouraged him to read the documents he reviewed carefully and eliminated anything particularly bad. Trump even made the movement of the west.</p>
<p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump always boasted that he was committed to protecting confidential information to ridicule Hillary. The prosecutor carefully quoted some of his past remarks, such as: "In my government, I will implement all laws related to confidential information. No one will override the law."</p>
<p>These statements are obviously as important as his remarks in 2016. He vowed to be very busy as the president, so he would never play golf again. It is a thorough liar.</p>
<p>The Republicans who jumped out to face the indictment for Trump should be ashamed. Unfortunately, the shame of the Republican Party has long been gone, and only Mitt Romney's office still has a little residue.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>So far, Trump has claimed that he is a victim, and successfully avoided countless ugly incidents such as the personal improper behavior from bankruptcy to despicable.</p>
<p>After watching the performance of James Komi and Robert Muller, I was worried. But Jack Smith seemed to show rewarding skills and temperament when he sued Trump. Perhaps he developed in the years when he explained the war prisoners in Hague.</p>

<p>Smith emphasized in the short -standing appearance of the Ministry of Justice on Friday afternoon that the improper processing of sensitive information brings risks to those who voluntarily protect us.</p>
<p>He praised the FBI -Trump and Republicans that have been trying to demolish and withdraw capital -say that the agents there "work tirelessly every day to maintain the rule of law of our country."</p>
<p>Republicans used to support the rule of law. Many people now describe the riots on January 6 as martyrs and say they should not sue Trump. Kevin McCarthy claimed that the prosecution was "a day of the dark country in the United States."</p>
<p>But Smith deliberately reminds Americans that the rule of law is the basic credo of our country.</p>

<p>On Friday, Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110515733898227087">Angry</a>Smith is "a mad neuropathy." He naturally attacked Smith's wife and award -winning documentary director Katie Sherina. She produced a documentary about Michelle Obama and donated a campaign for Joe Biden. Trump called her "" Hate the bone. "</p>
<p>But Smith is unlikely to be scared. This guy is very stubborn. A few years ago <a href="http://swimnac.com/masterstri-qa-jack-smith/">Interview</a>In Smith, Smith talked about his enthusiasm for the three items of the Iron Man. He talked about once he was hit by a truck to a pelvic fracture when he was riding a bicycle. After 10 weeks, he returned to participate in a three -ranging race.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T05-35-00-04-00/000000.png" />The People's Bank of China reduces interest rates. All banks also reduce deposit interest rates. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st-06132023053346.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T05-35-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Reuters information.</p>
<p>According to a report by Zhongxin Jingwei on June 13, the China Central Bank website reported on the 13th. In order to maintain the banking system, the People's Bank of China conducted an inverse repurchase operation of 2 billion yuan by interest rate bidding, and the interest rate of the winning bid was 1.90%, a decrease of 10 decreased by 10 Base point.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that this is the first time that the central bank has reduced short -term loan interest rates since August last year. The People's Bank of China also stated that the following new interest rates injected RMB 2 billion from the bank system, equivalent to about 280 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Caixin.com reported that after the six major national banks lowered some deposit interest rates on June 8, 11 shares such as China Merchants Bank also announced that they would adjust the interest rate of the current deposit of current deposits and medium and long -term deposits from June 12, and State -owned banks are consistent. Only Xingye Bank has not yet issued an announcement, but the industry is expected to remain consistent with other shares.</p>
<p>The Financial Association also reported that following the six major banks of state -owned shares, the national shares followed their officials to reduce the RMB deposit interest rate. On June 12, national joint -stock business banks including China Merchants Bank, Pudong Development Bank, CITIC Bank, Everbright Bank, Ping An Bank, Minsheng Bank, etc. have updated the RMB deposit interest rate sheet, which is similar to the state -owned bank. In order to reduce, the regulatory deposits in the medium and long -term period have a larger decrease. According to the official website of China Merchants Bank, the RMB interest rate adjustment will be implemented from June 12, 2023, and the interest rate of RMB current deposits will be reduced from 0.25%to 0.2%; It dropped to 2.05%, 2.45%, and 2.50%, and previously 2.15%, 2.60%, and 2.65%, respectively, lowered 10bp, 15bp and 15bp, respectively.</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal analysis, the central bank's interest rate cuts have shown that decision makers are becoming more and more uneasy about recovery, which may indicate that there will be more measures to be introduced to promote the return of the Chinese economy back. However, economists said that reducing the cost of borrowing may not help much to change the weakness of China's economic recovery, because the debt level is already at a high level and the growth prospects are sluggish. So far, households and enterprises have little interest in borrowing.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported on the 12th report that reducing deposit interest rates is a leverage that policy makers can use to stimulate expenditure. It hopes that lower interest rates can inspire consumers to consume or invest, instead of saving savings into banks. This shows that consumers spending as the main driving force for economic growth are still sluggish. China has predicted that its economy will recover from one of the slowest years in the decades last year, and by 2023, the GDP will increase by about 5%. But economic weakness still exists.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) Tokyo Electric Power Corporation (Todhine for short) began the nuclear waste water discharge system of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Plant on Monday (June 12) to discharge the nuclear waste water that will be processed and diluted in the future. prepare for.</p>
<p>According to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the trial phase is about 2 weeks. Dan water testing is used. During the period, it will check whether the pump operates normally, and if a major accident occurs, whether it can urgently block water discharge. Dongdian hopes to complete the trial within this month and is tested by the Japanese atomic energy control committee.</p>
<p>On the 12th, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, reiterated that he opposed Japan's discharge of nuclear pollution water, criticized Japan to pollute the ocean and harm the common interests of human beings, and "extremely selfish and irresponsible." On the 27th of last month, the Chinese representative also criticized Japan at the World Health Conference (WHA), saying that this move will spread to the global waters through ocean currents. Therefore, Japan should not discharge nuclear waste water before reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>For Dongdian's nuclear waste water discharge plan, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本核废水排海在即-原子能机构再赴福岛审查/a-65763766">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will visit Fukushima again at the end of May to the beginning of June</a>The comprehensive security assessment report will be released as soon as this month.</p>

<h3>Is it safe to discharge nuclear waste water?</h3>
<p>In March 2011, a strong earthquake was accompanied by the tsunami, causing severe damage to the Fukushima first nuclear power plant. The melting reactor should continue to cool with cold water. Most radioactive substances have been removed after the cooling water is treated, but <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/含氚核废水真的不会危害健康/a-57184856">containing tritium</a>Essence These wastewater have accumulated more than 1 million tons, and the storage tank is difficult to afford, and the storage costs are getting higher and higher. In April 2021, the Japanese government decided to discharge the processed nuclear pollution wastewater into the sea.</p>
<p>Georgsteinhauser, a professor of radiology at the University of Hanover, Germany, visited Fukushima to collect samples. In 2021, he accepted a DW interview and believed that due to the frequent earthquake in Japan, compared with the water storage tank, the cooling water was excreted into the sea in the sea. It is "the best and the safest way."</p>
<p>Dongdian said that nuclear wastewater is expected to start into the sea this summer, provided that after dilution, the cricket content is reduced to one -seventh of the drinking water standards stipulated by the World Health Organization. Although the Japanese government says that water contains a small amount of crickets will not pose a threat to human health, this plan still causes local environmentalists and fishermen, as well as <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛核废水倾倒海洋-渔民说不-中韩反对-美国支持/a-57244397">criticism of South Korea, China, and Pacific Island countries</a> 。</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly rose. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Place of cooling water</h3>
<p>The damaged Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station scene at the scene of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is the focus of controversy. According to the authorities, these water storage tanks must be removed before rebuilding. These water is mainly used for cooling reactors after the disaster.</p>

<h3>cooling water is safe?</h3>
<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<h3>In control?</h3>
<p>The radiation test standards cited by the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation and the Tokyo government are stricter than other countries that are also discharged. This release has also been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "We have equipment to make water safe." Tomohikomayuzum, a spokesman for Tokyo Power Company, told Reuters.</p>

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can."

He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p>After the "anti -repair" movement in Hong Kong in 2019, a large number of young people were arrested and imprisoned for related protests. BBC interviewed the "anti -repair" motion demonstrators from prison, as well as supporting networks for helping people into prison for social movement cases.</p>
<h3>Witches: Attackers have appeared in the rally</h3>
<p>The attack clips were quickly spread in the community of the people in the Hong Kong -Hong Kong people. Some people uploaded a college student ID suspected to wear a man in white, referring to the man as a Southampton college student; however, the BBC Chinese reporter failed to confirm the identity of the person.</p>
<p>Ella (Ella), who is responsible for holding a local commemorative "Anti -Repairing" demonstration on June 12, pointed out that the white man in white appeared on the rally, shooting demonstrators, and once had a residence on Hong Kong's sovereignty issues and participating rallys. The British and Hong Kong people had a heated discussion, but did not cause conflicts.</p>
<p>Ella pointed out that more than 50 people attended the rally on the same day and the atmosphere was peaceful. Even though she applied for the approval of the British government, she also informed the police, but no police officer was present on the day.</p>
<p>In 2019, the "anti -repair" demonstration broke out in Hong Kong and opposed the amendment to the "Fugitive Regulations".

<p>Because the theme of the assembly opposed the Beijing regime's suppression of Hong Kong, some people holding the "Hong Kong independence" claim conflicted with some Chinese nationalists who supported the Beijing regime.</p>
<h3>Public letter from worrying about safety</h3>
<p>In recent years, when the people in the British and Hong Kong people participated in the demonstration rally in the UK, there were often incidents of conflict or someone attacked. In October last year, Hong Kong demonstrators were accused of being beaten when protest when protest outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester. Residents and Hong Kong people expressed their security issues during political opinions.</p>
<p>The people who were attacked or involved in the incident this time pointed out that they would not expect that they would also become a "premeditated attack" object because of political statements. They believed that the attack was premeditated and the goal was because when the man in white appeared in the rally, he had no friendly mentioning "calling friends to the scene"; and suspected that the diners were delayed by the four people, waiting for the attacker to arrive. When the two men got off the car, the two men got off the car and got off the car. Obviously, there is a goal and a national flag rushing directly to them.</p>
<p>Tiffany said that she moved to the UK after the implementation of the "National Security Law" in Hong Kong. , But the incident is undoubtedly scared and prohibitive when it comes to voicing.</p>
<p>Helen said that she would be careful in the future. "The place where I live is very close to the place of the incident. I am worried that it will be tracked or suffered again in the future."</p>
<p>Southampton Hong Kong people group organized a collective letter to the British media, the Cabinet Minister and Parliament MPs on Monday, urging them to condemn the incident. In the letter, "we just advocate basic rights, but have become the goal of violent attacks; and seeing that Hong Kong people are threatened by the security of Hong Kong people in the UK, it is particularly disappointing."</p>
<h3>Member of the parliament: "One person feels unsafe and is too much"There was no real -time handling case in the reporting center and the participants said that no police officers were at the rally at the time, and West said that it was "unexpected." She pointed out that there have been many similar incidents in the past few years, and in the British community, "one person thinks it is too safe." She believes that the authorities should take corresponding measures, including ensuring law enforcement departments in various places, noticing the security risks faced by Hong Kong and other communities, and ensuring that they can exercise citizenship safely.</h3>
<p>Roystonsmith, a member of the British Conservative Party, said "I am as worried as the Hong Kong community as much as the incident that happened yesterday and was pleased with the police's investigation attack."</p>
<p>He also said: "Although the incident has not been confirmed, I feel uneasy to see the violence against peace protesters. We are worried about the sinister nature of China and the opposition to freedom of speech in the university."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the University of Southampton responded, "We know the films circulating in social media, and are investigating", "the university condemn the violence of what form is, and respects each person's right to speech."</p>

This is at least four months of visits. It should have occurred in February this year, but the CCP's spy balloon disrupted everything. The United States has disclosed the CCP spy ball flight route and announced that it will postpone Bronken's visit to China (although the Chinese side privately persuades the United States not to postpone it), and then shot it down to a sensation in the world.</p>
<p>After the dust was settled, the United States remembered the visit to Bollingken, but the Chinese side picked up the "shelf" and repeatedly refused. Angered by the spy balloon being shot down, and Biden formed the formed international alliance to tighten the encirclement of the CCP. Layers of alliances, including international geopolitical alliances, regional military alliances, and global chip, technology and supply chain alliances.</p>
<p>China has fallen into the Xi Jinping era. How to take care of the US -China relations? The United States and China have their own expectations and abacus. The fantasy of China is that the US -China relations have returned to the past. They have both high -level interoperability and comprehensive integration, which facilitates the CCP's hands and continuous large -scale penetration of the United States. The expectation of the United States is that despite being hostile, the United States and China should maintain communication to avoid war, including avoiding the start of the Taiwan Strait or the third world war. Maintaining world peace is the United States responsibility as the world leader.</p>
<p>In this way, it is necessary to briefly review the contemporary history of US -China relations. Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, US -China relations have roughly experienced four stages:</p>
<p>In the first stage, in the early 1950s, the two sides were hostile to fight on the Korean Peninsula. At this stage, the cause and dominance of the Communist Party of China are mainly caused by the CCP.</p>
<p>In the second stage, from the 1970s to the end of the 1980s, the United States Anti -Soviet Anti -Soviet, the relationship between the two countries eased. In the anti -Soviet, US -China relations are even like quasi -ally. At this stage, the cause and dominance of the United States are mainly caused by the United States.</p>
<p>In the third stage, after the CCP ’s Massacre Massacre in 1989, in the 2016 U.S. Obama era, the United States no longer regarded the CCP as an allies, but continued to contact and integrate policies, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party would go to democratization through reform and opening up. Peaceful evolution? In fact, it can be defined as an appeasement policy. At this stage, both the United States and China have the cause and their own lead.</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, Xi Jinping in China came to power (2012), and Trump came to power in the United States a few years later (2017), and the sharp struggle began. Awakening the United States began to counterattack and counter the CCP. After taking over (2021), Biden continued to pursue counterattack and counter -CCP policies, unite and integrate international allies, and formed a thorough surround for the Communist China. The United States and China returned to a state of comprehensive hostility. At this stage, both the United States and China have the cause and their own lead.</p>
<p>China hopes that US -China relations will return to the third stage. Under the different values systems of democracy and autocracy, the United States has held comprehensive contact and integration of comprehensive contact and integration. The United States hopes to avoid war. In other words, the United States maintains the fourth stage and faces reality.</p>
<p>There is also an important factor in the United States to deal with US -China relations and hopes to maintain high -level communication: the war that Russia invasion in Ukraine is still a formula. The United States, NATO, and the world of civilization have firmly supported Ukraine, and are determined to make Putin completely fail. At this time, Chinese factor is the key. If China and Russia are bundled, the delay of the war and the consequences will be unpredictable; if Beijing listens to greeting and is not completely bundled with Russia, Ukraine will win.</p>
<p>How to define US -China relations? The U.S. tone is a three -point method: confrontation, competition, and cooperation. According to the Bayndon government: "Competition, cooperation, cooperation, and confrontation when necessary." China does not want to be led by his nose. Essence However, after several fighting methods, the United States' context strategy obviously occupied the upper hand. After Beijing was not allowed, he was forced to restart the high -level dialogue. This is the origin of Blingken's visit to China.</p>
<p>The United States notice that the US -China relations may ease or temporarily ease, but it is impossible to return to the past. The ideology of democracy and autocracy is fundamentally opposed to, and struggle or competition is always the main axis of US -China relations. "Dream of Red Mansions" has a motto: "Either the east wind overwhelms the west wind or the west wind overwhelming the east wind." The set of dictatorships to realize the "community of human destiny". Xi Jinping, who lives in the old era, has to "indicate directions" for human development in the new era. The United States and the civilized world are indispensable.</p>

<h1>Can artificial intelligence really destroy humans?</h1>

<p>Description: Industry experts recently warned the future of artificial intelligence, arguing that AI's strong autonomy will pose a threat to human survival. But these warnings lack details, and there are no signs that AI can do this. Why are experts so worried? Saratta chungsatiansup</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-13T09-58-45-08-00/00ai-existential-master1050.png" />Last month, hundreds of well -known people in the artificial intelligence industry <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230531/ai-threat-warning/">signed a public letter</a>, Warn AI that one day may destroy humans.</p>
<p>Public letter <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk">only one sentence</a>: "Restore artificial intelligence and extinction human risks, and it should be a global priority with risks of other social scale such as major epidemics and nuclear war."</p>
<p>This is the latest one of the open letters of ominous warnings of artificial intelligence. The warnings are particularly prominent in lack of details. Today's AI system cannot destroy humanity. Some of these systems can only barely do some addition and subtraction. So why are these people who know the most about AI so worried?</p>
<p><strong> A scary prediction. </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The disaster prophets in the technology industry said that one day, researchers from companies, governments or independent work can effectively use strong artificial intelligence systems to deal with everything from commercial to war. These systems can do what we don't want to let them do. If humans try to intervene or turn them off, they will resist and even copy themselves so that they can continue to run.</p>
<p>"Today's system is still far from the threat of survival," said Joshua Benji, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Montreal's research on artificial intelligence. "But what will happen after one, two, and five years? There are too many uncertainty. This is the problem. We cannot determine whether the AI will become catastrophic at a certain moment."</p>
<p>Personal people often use a simple metaphor. They said that if you ask for a machine to make a clottering needle as much as possible, the machine may forget it, and make everything -including humans -into a factory that manufactures a pins.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the real world (or the future world that is not in a long time)? The company can give the AI system more and more autonomy and connect them to important infrastructure (including power grids, stock markets, and military weapons). They may cause problems from there.</p>
<p>For many experts, this possibility did not seem to be so credible until last year. Last year, companies and other companies showed major progress in AI technology, indicating that if AI continues to develop at such a fast speed, this possibility is existing.</p>
<p>"AI will gradually be authorized and becomes more autonomous. It may usurp the decisions and thinking of the current institutions of human and human management," said Anthony Ajile, a cosmologist at the University of California, San Cruz. Two organizations related to open letter -the founder of the Institute of Life Future.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"At some point, people will find that large machines running in society and economy are not under the control of human beings, nor can they turn them off, just as they cannot turn off the S &amp; P 500 index," he said.</p>
<p>Or according to the theory. Other artificial intelligence experts believe that this is a ridiculous assumption.</p>
<p>"Regarding my view of" Survival Threat ", it is said that it is very polite," the research laboratory in Seattle, the founder of the Ellen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Ollen Elenei explain.</p>
<p><strong> Is there any sign that AI can do this? </strong></p>
<p>not yet. But researchers are putting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html">chat robot like ChatGPT</a>The transformation is a system that can act according to the text that can generate. The project named AutoGPT is the best example.</p>
<p>The idea of this project is to give the AI system goals, such as "creating a company" or "making money". The system will then continue to find methods to achieve goals, especially if it connects with other Internet servers.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Systems like AutoGPT can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/technology/codex-artificial-intelligence-coding.html">generate computer program</a>Essence If researchers connect them to a computer server, it can actually run these programs. Theoretically, AutoGPT can use this method to perform almost any operation on the Internet -asking for information, using applications, writing new applications, and even improving itself.</p>
<p>Systems such as AutoGPT can not work well. They often fall into an endless cycle. Researchers have provided a system with all the resources required for their self -copying. <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf">It failed to copy itself</a>Essence</p>
<p>With enough time, these limitations may be resolved.</p>
<p>"People are actively trying to build a system that can be improved," said Conner Lehis, the founder of Conjecture, and his company hopes to keep AI technology consistent with human values. "I haven't done this yet. But one day it will be done. We don't know when that day is coming."</p>
<p>Loch believes that as researchers, companies, and criminals set the goals such as "making money" for these systems, they may end with bad results, such as invading the banking system, and instigating the revolution in the country where they hold oil futures, or Copy themselves when someone tries to turn them off.</p>
<p><strong> Where does the AI system learn bad? </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>AI systems such as ChatGPT are mathematical system based on neural networks to learn skills by analyzing data.</p>
<p>Around 2018, companies such as Google and Openai began to build neural networks to train it with a large number of digital text collected from the Internet. By looking for modes in all these data, the neural network system has learned to generate text itself, including news articles, poetry, computer programs, and even human conversations. The result is a chat robot like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The large amount of data used to train these systems makes it impossible for system creators to understand all data, so these systems will show unexpected behaviors of creators. Researchers recently reported that a system can <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf">hire people online to defeat the verification code inspection</a>Essence When the human asking the system is a "robot", the system lies and say that it is a person with vision disorder.</p>
<p>Some experts are worried that as researchers make these systems stronger and train them with more and more data, they may learn more bad habits.</p>
<p><strong> Who are these warnings? </strong>advertise</p>
<p>The things he wrote and he wrote in OPENAI and the creation of the DeepMind laboratory acquired by Google in 2014. Many people from EA groups work in these laboratories. They believe that because they know the danger of artificial intelligence, they are the most suitable for building the AI system.</p>
<p>The two organizations that have recently issued public letter warning artificial intelligence risks -the artificial intelligence security center and the future research institute — are closely related to the movement.</p>
<p>Recent warnings also come from research pioneer and industry leaders, such as Elon Musk, who has been warning AI's risks for a long time. Recently, this letter is also the CEO of OPENAI Sam Ultraman, and the Demis Kazakhstan, who helped create DeepMind, is now responsible for a new artificial intelligence laboratory. This new laboratory combines the combination Top researchers from DeepMind and Google.</p>
<p>Other respected people signed on one of the recent or two warning letters include Benjio, and Jeffrey Hente, who recently resigned from Google executives and researchers. In 2018, they won the Turing Award of the Nobel Prize in the "Calculation Field" for their neural networks.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Denver, 12th) The US professional basket NBA Denver gold block defeated the Miami hot fire king in the fifth game of the championship today. After the coach Michael Malone led the golden block to win the first championship of the team, he sent a proud language to create a golden block dynasty.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-13T10-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />The Golden Bag team stopped the mayor of Denver for 47 years today. 94-189 defeated the Heat in the 7th game and 4 wins and 4 wins.</p>
<p>When the celebrated colorful broken paper was still flying, Malone couldn't wait to declare that he hoped that the first championship of the team history of the gold block was only the starting point, and then won more championships.</p>
<p>Ma Long said, "I want to tell you here that we will not be satisfied with one seat, we want more seats!"</p>
<p>Ma Long said that he was inspired by the former Heat of the championship and Pat Riley, a former Heat who won the championship with five championships.</p>
<p>"What Lyri said many years ago, I have been remembering to coach the tactical board. It is about how to make a team from becoming a rising star from an unknown star, then from the rise of the star to the Changsheng Army, and the Changsheng Army, from the Changsheng Army, Become the powers, and then from the powers to the champion. After becoming the champion, the last step is to create a dynasty. "</p>
<p>Ma Long said that he believes that the elements of the creation of the Golden Bag dynasty are now in place, and the core of the team led by Nikola Jokic is relatively young. It is expected that in the future, it will be the backbone of the team.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Hu Yongkong, Director of the China Research Center of Mokato China(Mikkohuotari)Calling the federal government to strengthen the coordination of Chinese policies within the European Union. In an interview with Reuters TV, he said: "We'd better be consistent with the European Commission."</p>
<p>The German government will propose on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国国安战略千呼万唤不出来/a-65872459">National Security Strategy</a>Essence Hu Yongkong is expected to have a "more critical speech for China's challenges internationally internationally", and emphasizes that China is an institutional competitor and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Hu Yankong warned not to take excessive means or reduce connection with China. He welcomed the German -Chinese government consultation that was about to be held in Berlin. He said that holding a meeting is the correct practice, and it is important to maintain a dialogue with difficult partners and put forward their own views. In November last year, Germany's agreement strengthened cooperation on the issue of hygiene and sustainable development. He believes that the talks will be a test of whether both parties will really take action. So far, cooperation in the above -mentioned field has not yet seen much progress. From a China perspective, consultation with an important Western country will be used as a successful selling point. "It can be said that the meeting itself is information."</p>
<h3>"Different Opinions of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party"</h3>
<p>Hu Yankong believes that in the analysis of China's development, the differences in the governing alliances composed of the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party are less than that of the governing alliance. But he also said that "the party is indeed a correct way to deal with this issue." In particular, the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party have a "very different point of view."</p>
<p>At the same time, Hu Yongkong accused the federal government of lack of coordination within the European Union. "The federal government is not credible enough to European policy Europeanization."</p>

<p>But he also pointed out that when European countries are facing China, unity is very important. In response to the debate of the 5G mobile network and whether to use the Chinese parts manufacturer, Hu Yongkong said: "China's side will obviously try to draw Germany on these issues to ensure that the European Commission will not take a too tough position."</p>
<p>Germany is reviewing the use of 5G networks in China. In addition, the European Commission will propose a proposal about how to define economic security next week, which also involves technical control.</p>
<p>Hu Yankong warned: "Beijing will lobby Berlin to ensure that these measures will not be too severe." However, given the situation of geopolitical tensions, "it is necessary to think more widely than in the past."</p>
<p>In the interview, Hu Yankong also for some <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国企业为北京武统未雨绸缪/a-65871883">large -scale investment in German companies in China</a>Defense. He pointed out that people need "tolerance" macroeconomics and enterprises to have different views on new challenges. Some companies claim that new investment in China is due to the urgent demand or desire to realize localized production.</p>
<p>Hu Yongkong said: "It is correct to continue to obtain the maximum benefits from the Chinese market and should continue to do it." Different. In view of the conflict between the Taiwan Strait that may occur in the future, "the risk is significantly higher and it is difficult to predict." But he believes that the method of response cannot be evacuated from China.</p>
<p>He advocates that the investment review in the discussion focuses on limiting artificial intelligence or quantum technology, because China may obtain military interests from these fields.</p>
<p>Hu Yongkong also proposed a warning not to interrupt the scientific research exchanges with China. What currently needs is transparency, and what institutions and personnel are working in Germany. "But I think it is a very questionable view that treating every Chinese student or doctoral student as a threat." Hu Yimong emphasized that "must not be pursued to" reduce contact with China to solve all our problems "."</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Switzerland, Switzerland, 13th) cryptocurrencies have been resisting supervision for a long time, but there may not be many days of freedom, because the European Union has recently led the United States through comprehensive regulations on cryptocurrency assets, and the United States is still arguing about the cryptocurrency industry Which organ should be supervised.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-13T11-02-07-00-00/000000.png" />In April of the European Parliament, with the support of most European members, the final approval of the EUROPEAN Commission was obtained by the "Markets in CryptoasSets (MICA).</p>
<p>As the first comprehensive regulatory regulatory regulations in the cryptocurrency industry, the "Crypto Assets Fair" is used to reduce illegal behavior including money laundering and protect investors and consumers.</p>
<p>Jerome Bailly, vice president of Crypto Valley, the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain center, said: "Crypto assets have a clear understanding of the assets."</p>
<p>He told AFP in an event that supported a startup company: "We are no longer the era of the Western Wilderness. Everyone in this industry wants the rules of the game."</p>
<p>Belry said that although everyone was hostile to "encrypted assets" at first, "in the end it has become a selling point of Europe," because it establishes a clear structure for the company and can organize their business operations accordingly.</p>
<p>He believes that a "European Group" will appear, and Britain and Switzerland will follow up the European Union to establish a regulatory area.</p>
<p>Belry warned, but on the other hand, "signals from the United States are obviously negative."</p>
<p>The United States Corporation has been weakened due to the closure of SIGNATURE Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Silicon Valleybank. These banks are key institutions for financing in large science and technology industries and startups.</p>
<p>In addition, since the closure of the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX and Genesis, the US authorities have begun to rectify the industry and accuse the world's largest cryptocurrency trading platform Binance and its opponent Coinbase violated the securities law.</p>
<p>Belry said the uncertainty of the US supervision is a difficult place for the company. The United States is fiercely arguing whether cryptocurrencies should be regarded as financial assets and are supervised by the US Securities Management Commission (SEC); or it should be regarded as a commodity, and it is supervised by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>"We see that many companies are escaping from the United States and Europe," said THOMASNAEGELI, a lawyer in Liechtenestein This industry. "If there is no correct answer, they will worry about being sued in the court by the regulatory agency on one day."</p>

Some Hong Kong media analysis believes that Xi Jinping's response to the "extreme situation" is the worst plan for China to be designed by the global industrial chain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/ec2-06072023111114.html"><strong> China's import and export data performance is poor by depreciation stimulation to stimulate exports to exchange foreign currencies and fails </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm1-12152022062055.html">China ’s multiple economic data decline and“ expand domestic demand ”</a></strong></p>
<p>Chinese official "People's Daily" published on June 10th that Xi Jinping went to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia last Wednesday, and said after visiting the Central Industrial Park, "The construction of a large domestic cycle is to ensure that the national economy can run normally under extreme circumstances." In the interpretation of Hong Kong's "Ming Pao", Xi Jinping's "extreme situation" means that China is facing the "global industrial chain to completely remove" and must make the worst plans and preparations.</p>
<p><strong> Xi Jinping: Others can survive without opening the door </strong></p>
<p>The "documentary" of the "People's Daily" disclosed that Xi Jinping said: "To build a new development pattern, we must first do a good domestic cycle. This is a strategy to cure. When the door is opened, we can live and live better. We open the door, who will cooperate with us. Welcome. Economic globalization is the avenue.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping also said that among all kinds of foreseeable and unpredictable wind and storms, the most important thing is to do its own thing, and China must rely on high -tech self -reliance.</p>
<p>Nobu Jianyu, an associate researcher at the National Safety Research Institute of Taiwan, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that Xi Jinping's visit to the Central Science and Technology Park in Inner Mongolia was one of the officially promoted high -tech parks. It mainly produced solar products and 8 -inch chips.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T11-06-00-04-00/000002.png" />Nobel, an associate researcher at the National Institute of National Security in Taiwan, mentioned that the so -called "dual -cycle" -based lectures have begun to appear early this year, but it is still difficult to determine whether this move involves whether it can succeed in the high -tech process of competition with the United States. It may not be known after several years. (Provided by Shi Jianyu) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hx1-06132023103746.html/hx13.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T11-06-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Scholars: Xi called "outer cycle" refers to the "Belt and Road" country </strong></p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said: "China's official extension of internal circulation is mainly based on the internal cycle, supplemented by the external circulation, which means that the industrial chain should be pulled back to China, shorten the industrial chain, and do not cross the country. It is a related country on the "Belt and Road"; it is not an external cycle with each country, there are specific areas, and especially can provide raw material countries, including the Arab world, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia countries. "</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu mentioned that the so -called "dual -cycle" cycle -based lectures have begun to appear earlier this year, but it is still difficult to determine whether this move involved in the development of high -tech development with the United States. Then I know. The United States and China relations are tight, and the United States will take off with China in the high -tech field. Yan Xuetong, the dean of Beijing Tsinghua University, has previously qualitatively competed in the United States and China, and the pole pattern is becoming more and more clear. The era of free trade in US -China cooperation has passed, and the future profit model must be redesigned.</p>
<p><strong> Expert: People do not consume </strong> <strong> "</strong> <strong> Inner cycle" weak </strong></p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong, Secretary -General of the Society of Taiwan Tao Lue Strategy, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia, and also said: "How can China go out of the neck of the foreign card in the world? In the new materials and new industries, China's manufacturing industry has the potential part. He hopes that the new industry can drive the internal economy of China. "</p>
<p>Xi Jinping has previously reiterated that it is necessary to accelerate the construction of a new development pattern of "using domestic large -cycle as the main body and the promotion of domestic and international dual cycles", which not only enhances the endogenous power and reliability of the "domestic large cycle", but also improves the quality and level of international cycle.

<p>Xi Haiming, chairman of the "South Mongolia Hulgaria", accepted an interview and analysis of Radio Free Asia. Xi Jinping went to Inner Mongolia to talk about "big cycle", reflecting the pressure of the authorities facing international resistance.</p>
<p>Xi Haiming said: "He said that this big thing was very panicked. Foreigners did not buy us, and we were in a large country in China. The goods are always sold and we must not be piled in the warehouse. This shows that there is a lot of pressure on China's economy. ","</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) According to Reuters, the Minister of Pakistan Pakistan announced that the country had paid the first batch of imported discount Russian crude oil for RMB. The move marked the change of the country's foreign trade payment policy.</p>
<p>Purchasing Russian crude oil at a discount price, providing a chance to breathe for Pakistan facing serious international income and expenditure issues and even the risk of foreign debt defaults. The foreign exchange reserves held by the Central Bank of the country only barely pay for one month of management and control.</p>
<p>It is reported that these batch of Russian crude oils purchased to the port of Karachi on Sunday are currently unloading. The procurement transaction was the first intergovernmental transaction reached between Islamabad and Moscow.</p>
<p>Pakistan Petroleum Minister Musadikmalik did not disclose details about the transaction in an interview with Reuters, such as procurement prices and discounts. But he said that the transaction was settled with RMB.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为何美元在中东的主导地位出现衰退/a-65706009">Background Reading: Why did the US dollar lead in decline in the Middle East? </a>Pakistan purchased 100,000 tons of Russian crude oil in April. At present, the first batch of delivery is about 45,000 tons. The rest is still on the way.</p>
<p>Malik also said that this time it was a light Ural crude oil.</p>
<p>Although Russian oil is currently unable to enter the Western market because of sanctions, Pakistan's procurement has increased Moscow in addition to India and China, which has increased sales.</p>
<h3>"Go to the US dollar" process further?</h3>
<p>Earlier this month, the Islamabad government also proposed a plan to openly trade with Russia, Afghanistan and Iran. Analysts pointed out that this is the sought in the South Asian economy seeking to buy and sell transactions in commodities <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印俄石油交易正在削弱美元的主导地位/a-64921007">"Go to the US dollar"</a>Another signs can also be said to be a policy orientation to the East from the West.</p>
<p>Minister of Petroleum Malik said Pakistan's refining company PRL was refined. He had previously said that this purchase was a feasibility test for the procurement of Russian crude oil. On Monday, he said that all the tests and tests have been completed, and it concludes that the purchase of Russian oil to refine and sell it in the country is business.</p>

<p>He also said that in the future, Pakistan hopes that Russian crude oil will account for one -third of the country's imported oil.</p>
<p>Energy imports account for a large proportion in Pakistan's foreign payment transactions. According to the data provided by the analysis company KPler, in 2022, the country's average imported 154,000 barrels of oil per day was basically the same as the previous year.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Pakistani Electric Power Minister Kurham pointed out in an interview in May that Pakistan hopes to use RMB to settle Russian crude oil and hopes that "this can become a long -term arrangement."</p>
<p>Bloomberg believes that Pakistan's move is not only in line with Russia's desire to get rid of the US dollar and euro exports, but also helps to promote the internationalization of the RMB to weaken the dominant position of the US dollar in the international community.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Dorisfischer, a professor of economics at the University of Verzburg, pointed out in an interview with Voice of Germany that in an interview with the Voice of Germany, it is necessary to truly challenge the US dollar status, or the RMB wants to develop in the direction of becoming leading currency.

Recently, the Dutch government plans to prohibit Chinese students from taking courses such as semiconductor and national defense. Some comments believe that China ’s righteousness to absorb advanced Western technology, and the Netherlands and other Western countries are fundamentally defending.</p>

<p>The United States and allies are facing upgrading to Chinese scientific and technological wars. Following the restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands to reach an agreement in China, the Bloomberg Society quoted sources as saying that the Netherlands is studying legislation and prohibiting Chinese students from taking courses such as semiconductor and national defense.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Education of the Netherlands acknowledged that international students planned to study in the technology field were reviewed to prevent possible security risks. The review is considered to be formulated to restrict Chinese students and enterprises in contact with Dutch technology. However, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education emphasized that reviewing all students from other countries from the European Union are not only for Chinese students.</p>
<p>The British "Financial Times" mentioned that the Dutch government plans to review international students, especially the Chinese students who are loyal to the CCP and regularly report to the Chinese Embassy because these people may pose a threat to the national security of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Lai Rongwei, an assistant professor at the General Education Center of the Longhua University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, believes that it is gratified that the West has a wishes to the development of China's semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>Lai Rongwei: "It (Beijing) uses technology to suppress human rights, monitor dissidents, and requires society to obedient. It not only wants to catch up in military and economically, but also wants to change world civilization through hard power. The Netherlands is worried that their key technology will be in China Take it with very improper means, and even threaten Western industrial countries further. "</p>

<h1>NATO Future Air Power: Drone VS. Fighter</h1>

<p>(Voice of Germany) in some areas of some areas, if they hear sound explosion in the next few days, they do not need to be surprised. Because NATO is holding the "Air Guard 23" exercise. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北约开启最大空军演习/a-65889684">"Airdefender"</a>It is a military exercise activity that Germany shows air forces in 2018. It aims to enhance the coordination capabilities in the European-Atlantic region and be a deterrent measure for possible invaders such as Russia.</p>
<p>This exercise that invested dense resources at a high altitude gathered a series of expensive and complex military assets, which aims to successfully implement complex air actions, which is in sharp contrast to the actual war from not far away.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, people assembled grenades on a small cheap drone, throwing the enemy forces below. This is reminiscent of the early air strike. During World War I, the pilot would throw the explosives from the slowly moved winged aircraft.</p>
<p>Other drones perform suicide tasks one way, and it is difficult to fight back from the ground or in the air.</p>
<p>The German Foreign Relations Committee (DGAP) Security and Defense Researcher Torbenschütz told Germany: "The reason why this war shows such a situation is that both sides cannot establish an air advantage."</p>
<h3>Ukraine: Case research and warning</h3>
<p>Ukraine's Air Force is small and old, and the country's air defense depends on the weapons provided by its partners. The Russian Air Force is theoretically deterrent, but failed to make full use of its technical and quantitative advantages. Russia can launch high -speed missiles remotely, but both sides have adopted ready -made solutions, which looks more like temporary but not strategic solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/无人机袭击俄罗斯的背后究竟是怎么回事/a-65803958">Yanshen Reading: What is going on behind the drone to attack Russia? </a>The Ukrainian war has made Western war planners start thinking, how it reflects the future conflict situation, and also thinks about how to avoid the following situations: that is, the advantages of training and technology are dizzy by groups of low -altitude. Electronic interference.</p>
<p>The overwhelming air power is essential for the strategy of the United States and allies, and it can ensure almost the air advantage. The opponent lacks advanced air defense systems and trained pilots, and cannot compete with them.</p>
<p>But in the future conflict, this advantage may not be available. Schitz, who claims to be the "drone suspect", said that a "opponent who drives together" may be able to compare with NATO's equipment and action forces. He added that this is even more reasonable to "practice cooperative operations and practice military assets that NATO stationed in Germany to ensure that the procedure is correct." Otherwise, the United States and its allies may find that they have no effect on high -tech air power worth billions of dollars.</p>
<h3>Coordination tools, strategies and policies</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the German Air Force told Germany that it can resist threats such as drones from close to long -range "various levels of defense". It is the duty of the ground forces first.</p>

<p>Although the progress of the battle is not as expected, the theory of war in Russia has made people start to pay attention, and there is an asymmetric problem between threats and resources that can be used to deal with threats. Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany promised to improve its native and European air defense capabilities, which will require a large number of military equipment.</p>
<p>Benhodges, former commander of the NATO grounding forces in European ground troops, told Germany: "We have not enough, comprehensive air and missile defense to deal with any threats." He said that his concerns are based on too few NATO inventory. The facts, such as the Patriot missile combat group.</p>
<p>"When I saw Russia's random use of millions of dollars of weapons to deal with the apartment building, I realized that we were really not prepared for the violent air and missile attacks."</p>
<p>Hodis said that the United States cannot fight with the support of allies such as Germany. Therefore, joint training is not only to make the allies prepare for war, but also to understand each other's laws and action restrictions.</p>
<h3>Take you in -depth: NATO "Air Guard 23"</h3>
<h3>Human -machine collaborative power</h3>
<p>He said: "In terms of artificial intelligence and armed drones, not every country in Europe is keen or possessed to formulate technologies."</p>
<p>Germany has been hesitant to incorporate drones, especially armed drones into its army. Germany operates an old fighter in the field of military aviation. Among the additional national defense expenditures of 100 billion euros, Germany has allocated more than 8 billion euros to purchase up to 35 F-35 fighters-this is an US-made stealth fighter with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Supporters of traditional aerial power believe that drone technology is still unable to compare with human flight; airplanes are stronger compared with, can carry larger loads, and for cyber attacks and electronic interference that may fail to invalidate drones, and electronic interference. Strong resistance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T11-34-00Z/65836195_401.jpg" />Traditional fighters are stronger than drone loads and are not easily attacked by digital attacks (pictured F35 fighter)</p>
<p>The next generation of air combat operations may combine pilot driving and unmanned planes. European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the "Futurecombat Air System" dominated by Airbus, is to realize this goal.</p>
<p>Torbenarnold, an expert in the Berlin Think Tank Science and Political Foundation (SWP), pointed out that considering the speed of science and technology development and the differences in combat reserve, the conflict between the past and currently, such as Ukraine, Syria, and Armen, and Azerbaijan, " The army (NATO) concludes the conclusion of draft. "</p>
<p>For the German officer who served as a visiting scholar in SWP, the experience he learned "cannot be copied one -on -one."</p>
<p>He added that even if there is an artificial intelligence, drones will not cause the fighter to be outdated, at least not yet.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T11-36-53-04-00/000000.png" />The photos released on the Iranian Army website show the country's self -made drone. The Iranian Ministry of Defense stated that it has been delivered to the army with more than 200 long -distance strategic drones. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-06132023113623.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-13T11-36-53-04-00/000001.png" /></a>According to the Wall Street Journal report on the 13th, the investigators said that Chinese parts helped Iran provide Russia to quickly provide drones. Western researchers said when checking an Iranian drone that was shot down in Ukraine this spring that a Chinese -made component on this drone was produced this year. This discovery shows that although the United States has made increasing pressure to cut off the global supply chain, China continues to send the parts required for its drone projects to Iran. In the Russian and Ukraine War, Iran was able to help Russia quickly, and it would be possible to make and provide Russia with weapons of intimidating Ukraine civilians in three months. Investigators said that an Iranian drone shot down in April contains a voltage converter made in mid -January in mid -January. This is a conflict weapon research organization(Conflict Armament Research)For the first time, researchers found components made in 2023 in related drones. A conflict weapon research organization headquarters in the UK tracks the global weapon supply chain. The above discovery shows that Iran can quickly create drones and send drones to Russia. The Chinese parts were manufactured in January, and were sent to Iran. After the installation, it was sent to Russia and was used to deal with Ukraine in April. According to the Ukrainian military, Russia has launched more than 700 drones to target power plants, cities and military goals. Last month, Byden(Joe Biden)政府称，俄罗斯已经用光了伊朗提供的无人机，已要求德黑兰方面输送更多供应。上周，白宫表示，伊朗最近通过穿梭于里海的船只向俄罗斯输送了数以百计的无人机。美国及其盟友试图阻止零部件从世界各地流向伊朗的无人机工厂，而上述2023年产中国部件的发现突显了这方面的挑战。 (责编：梒青)</p>

<p>According to social media such as WeChat circle of friends and Twitter, students at Hubei Academy of Fine Arts on Monday (12th) showed device arts at the door of a supermarket that classmates often patronized, and were removed by the school security staff. Li, a college graduate of the university, told the station on Tuesday that the school publicly showed unspeakable works to the students, which was highly sensitive. Even if it did not involve political topics, it would obstruct it. She said: "These works are gentle and not criticized. He seems to be discussing dogmaticism, which is equivalent to discussing a definition, such as a definition of your career before, without any sensitive things. The position of the position is not allowed to make a public display in China now, and you must apply for it first. The cultural level of security should not be able to judge what the nature of this art is. "</p>
<p>Comprehensive information on the Internet, this Monday, a installation art work at Hubei Academy of Fine Arts was withdrawn by the security team, and the interactive device had only survived for less than 5 hours.</p>
<p>Some exhibitors said that although he was very nervous for the first time he made an installation art, he was very happy to see that everyone was taking pictures or sticking to a small ball. However, when the author returned to the door of the supermarket in the afternoon, "girls smoking would not damn" and "girls are not just passed on to generation, what do you read so many books" were removed. The result of the question was that the security team said: "Your work content is not approved, and it is not allowed to be displayed in such a large event."</p>
<p>This incident has aroused widespread attention and discussion. Some people think that the teacher should contact the students and inform the relevant regulations; others suspect whether it is a discussion of the school's prohibition of stereotypes; others think it may be just a security guard.</p>

<p>Li classmate believes that it should not be a security behavior, but an official behavior. She said: "Afraid of the accident, including the school's personnel to see this device first, because it has not been reported by the school. I think it has nothing to do with the content. It is a public display behavior. Negative issues.</p>
<p>This station called the Office of the Dean of Hubei Academy of Fine Arts on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang, a senior current affairs commentator, said in an interview with this station that stereotypes are a topic worth exploring, but in China, they cannot discuss some deep -rooted cultural traditions. In their life experience, they may be relatively late. The so -called stereotypes he conveyed have a model of shaping men in men. Women have a model of shaping. Some men seem to be feminine, or some women are very neutral. It seems that there are only two specimens in your life. Men must have men, girls have girls. "</p>
<p><strong> Art students suggest disagreement with the concept of stereotype </strong></p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang said that students in Chinese art colleges are more likely to accept the concepts of developed western countries, so through the expression of works: "In fact, human nature is common, and the art world is more likely to accept these things. Not only is it stereotypes, but also there are also impressions, but also there are also. The stereotypes are as good as the male lead, the female lead, the art student is a poor culture, and the girl smoking is damn. From the concept of these art students, the exhibition does not agree with these things. I want to make a prompt. I don't think there is any Strong political rebellion. "</p>
<p>The shower commented, no matter what the purpose, the movement of the security guard has enriched the meaning of the work itself. We look forward to more similar art forms to be displayed so that people can think and discuss more deeply.</p>

<p>This small house -like architectural structure has marble walls, tile roofs decorated with dragon, and a band -shaped LED indicator device (common additional substances to protect the internal wood relief). Safe electronic candle wall. Then there is the owner wearing a golden and red robe.</p>
<p>However, local media in Taiwan said that the Taoist outlook was associated with the mainland United Front Work Department, and the ministry led a widely influential movement, which aims to "make friends and influence the public."</p>
<p>Liang Zuwei, the Honorary Chairman of Guanghe Fude Palace, pointed out in a brief visit to lead a reporter of the Peninsula TV station that the media's view is not correct. He insisted that although he was a member of the united front and the party of the pro -mainland, Taoism was definitely a neutral place.</p>
<p>Liang Ziwei said that he hopes to see the peace and unity of the mainland and Taiwan one day, and he is mainly engaged in small -scale political activities. "We have organized many demonstrations and protests for the DPP government." "If we think that its policy is wrong, then we will mobilize thousands of people to participate in the demonstration and protest. Don't go. "</p>
<p>According to Liang Zuli, the united front and its party sounded like any other political groups active in democratic society. Essence</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-13T12-28-26/Portrait2-1686557784-1686658693.jpeg" />Liang Zuwei, the honorary chairman of the Guanghe Fude Palace, emphasized that the Taoist outlook is the neutral place(Peninsula TV Station)However, many people, including politicians, will look at the activities of these groups in another way: they regard it as the second line of the mainland's realization of "unification cross -strait" and "liberating Taiwan", including in 2049 At the time of -the deadline set to achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation -to liberate 23 million people in the region in a peace or force.</p>
<h4>"Carrot increase stick"</h4>
<p>Since the founding of New China in 1949, previous governments in mainland China have promised to liberate Taiwan Island.</p>
<p>Compared with the military's "big sticks" -sanctions, diplomatic isolation and public threats -relatively speaking, the united front provides many "carrots" for this process. The reason why this dual strategy exists is because although the mainland has strong military power, the process of martial arts still needs to pay a huge price and may cause conflicts with the United States.</p>
<p>And if it cannot be fully won, it may mean a worse situation. Therefore, persuading Taiwan to voluntarily achieve peaceful unity to avoid a devastating war, which will be the result of "win -win".</p>
<p>Kuan-Chenlee, an assistant researcher at the Institute of National Defense and Security in Taiwan, said, "For the mainland, realizing Taiwan's peaceful unity will be the best solution. They know that if the PLA's military operations have been withdrawn from Taiwan It cannot be achieved. This is why the CCP never expressed the right to give up the use of force. "</p>
<p>He pointed out in an email that the overall strategy is concentrated in "changing the views of the people of Taiwan". "This strategy is trying to deepen the understanding of some issues in Taiwan: first, the unity brings benefits, the second is one of the deadline for Taiwan independence, the third is foreign countries, and the third is foreign countries. People are not reliable. In other words, the primary task of pursuing unification in the mainland is to broadcast peace and unity seeds in the hearts of the people in Taiwan, rather than taking military operations. "</p>
<p>John Dosen, deputy director and expert of the Global Taiwan Affairs Research Institute, said that united front activities have many forms, and some of them are guided by the Office of the United Front Work Department of Beijing, but sometimes they are carried out through less formal channels.</p>
<p>The united front is publicly carried out by the "peaceful unity" group located in Taiwan and overseas, and many of the groups can be traced back to the China Peaceful Unity Promotion Association. Groups and unified parties like this often go to the mainland to carry out "cultural exchanges" through group access.</p>
<p>Many temples in Taiwan also have well -known connections with the mainland, especially those temples that worship Mazu.</p>
<p>Grey Grurt, a senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide, Australia, believes that not all these tasks are positive pan -cultural movements.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that "Although the united front work is often considered a action to win friends, the other side of this coin is to lose the legitimacy of the enemy, to be isolated, and then destroy them." This means to strive for the support of the people of Taiwan for unified, and completely lose the legitimacy of Taiwan independence. This is not only applied to the examples of Taiwan, but also the entire international community. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-13T12-28-26/image-3-1686658799.jpg" />The two sides of the Taiwan Strait want to achieve peace and reunification(news agency)Puma Shen, an expert in the information movement and the head of the democratic laboratory, said that the past united front movement also paid attention to the "three middle" groups in Taiwan, namely the middle and lower class, the people of the central and southern parts, and small and medium -sized enterprises.</p>
<p>He pointed out that recently, the movement has shifted to "grass -roots groups", such as local elites, leaders, and young groups under 30 years old. He also described the work of the movement as the "spider web" of construction influence.</p>
<p>It is hoped that entering the larger market celebrities and business people in the mainland may eventually support the vision of the Communist Party of China and its unification on both sides of the strait, and sometimes even provide very direct support. Taiwan's high -quality party -oriented media pattern is another main goal.</p>
<p>In 2019, a survey conducted by the British "Financial Times" stated that Taiwan's "Want Want Holdings" Group has some media that are closely related to the mainland, and the Taiwan Affairs Office of Beijing is also receiving subsidies in the mainland.</p>
<p>Wangwang Group denied these allegations, but the following year, a media he had -CITV -was revoked after being accused of spreading false information.</p>
<h4>The atmosphere of nostalgia</h4>
<p>According to some analysts, one of the most famous goals of the united front is the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang once led the government of the Republic of China, and since the founding of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai in 1921, the two parties have been fighting each other at different time points. Essence</p>
<p>Grurt said that the Kuomintang's nostalgia for his hometown is its weakness.</p>
<p>"The Kuomintang's attachment to the homeland is so strong that they think that the concept of Greater China is more important than themselves, although from a historical point of view, they are the victims of the successful work of the united front." He told the Peninsula TV reporter. Once, they are willing to stay consistent with the goals of the Communist Party, because in their opinion, this is the only way to achieve a unity. "The same is true of many elites in Taiwanese society. For decades, this class has been dominated by those families who fled the mainland with the Kuomintang, and they still have a strong sense of belonging to the mainland.</p>
<p>But now, this association has declined.</p>
<p>According to a long -term public opinion survey conducted by the Political University of Taiwan, in the past 20 years, the Greater China complex in the hearts of young Taiwan's young groups is declining, which will greatly change political narrative.</p>
<p>However, the Kuomintang leaders continued to meet regularly with the Communist Party officials, including a milestone interview with Ma Ying -jeou in this year, and became the first in Taiwan to visit the mainland since the 1940s. Supreme Leader.</p>
<p>For the Kuomintang, the visit to the mainland is essential for maintaining communication channels for maintaining communication channels on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Since the Democratic Progressive Party Cai Yingwen was elected regional leaders in 2016, she claimed that only Taiwanese could determine her future, and she has been regarded as "Taiwan independence elements" by the mainland.</p>
<p>Officials such as the Kuomintang's mainland affairs TSO Chen-Dong have denied concerns about their vulnerable to the CCP.</p>
<p>He pointed out that "said the Kuomintang's influence on the Communist Party is open to the Communist Party, it is not to look up this problem." "In fact, the Kuomintang still wants to affect the future policy of the Communist Party through dialogue and social interaction, thereby maintaining the status quo and stabilizing the two sides of the strait Relationship ... I believe that the DPP is also trying to do this, but the difference is how much success the two have achieved. "</p>
<p>Even so, the united front is enough to attract the attention of major political parties in Taiwan. In 2019, the Taiwan authorities passed the reverse osmosis bill to deal with the intensification of the so -called "division and penetration of Taiwan's united front movement", and believed that this was a movement that threatened its "security, social order, and democratic politics". The law will characterize the qualitative criminal criminals such as political donations, votes, lobbying, and disruptions provided on behalf of the mainland, which has aroused protests and opposition from many members.</p>
<p>The Taiwan authorities have a powerful opponent in the united front.</p>
<p>Although the organization did not actively participate in military exercises held in the Taiwan Strait, its activities were very wide and more cautious than publicly displaying military strength.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-13T12-28-26/Temple-front-1686557807-1686658926.jpeg" />The manager of Taipei Guanghe Fude Temple is friendly to the mainland(Peninsula TV Station)According to Grurt, some of the organization's work coordinated by the United Front Department of Beijing, but most of them are also decentralized.</p>
<p>Each Communist Party committee has a second -level united front committee, and so is the army and other major organizations, all of which are working hard for a common cause. Grurt estimates that although the official figures and budgets have not been made public, there are "a lot" personnel at home and abroad in the mainland and abroad.</p>
<p>The US conservative think tank "American Traditional Foundation", known for its tough positions in China, estimates that the number of people working in the united front in 2020 is as many as 40,000. The person in charge of the democratic laboratory Pumashen estimates that this number may be as many as 600,000 -in view of the mobilization of all CPPCC members in the country, provinces and cities, and local CPPCC to carry out united front work.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has expanded the organization's work and increased the salary and prestige of department employees since he came to power in 2012.</p>
<p>Expert John Dussen said that the united front is "the efforts of the whole party", which is similar to a practice to guide public opinion or secretly promoting some lobbying activities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the united front can also work through foreign exchange groups, embassies, overseas Chinese organizations, and even foreign legislators to carry out work abroad to promote the agenda of the mainland.</p>
<p>Dosen said that since 2019, the propaganda of the mainland has become more loud, and claims that "unity" is the inevitable realization of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and continue to pay "quite a lot of efforts to dominate the local political influence."</p>
<p>Whether this will succeed is another question.</p>
<p>Some public opinion surveys show that although people like Guanghe Fude Temple exist, the number is not large, and from the perspective of many young people, its mainland complex is not serious.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-13T12-28-26/2022-10-23T112213Z_1978833956_RC2U6X9333DX_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-CONGRESS-TAKEAWAYS-1686559514-1686658969.jpg" />President Xi Jinping led the new Politburo Standing Committee Member to meet with the media(Reuters)Moreover, the "one country, two systems" that the mainland has always adhered to -the system that has been tried after the return of Hong Kong in 1997 has also changed.</p>
<p>Dogosen pointed out that some signs show that the facts may be changing. At the "Taiwan Working Conference" held last month, Wang Huning, an official responsible for the united front policy policy, seemed to dilute the "one country, two systems", and instead supporting another "new era party to solve the overall strategy of Taiwan" plan.</p>
<p>Analysts said that this may indicate that the party's "ideological framework" on Taiwan's issue has changed, and a updated "unified" model may occur, but it is not currently unable to provide more specific content by prediction.</p>
<p>At the same time, the "carrot increase" policy will continue. The Taiwan authorities are neither unable to stop the PLA from sending Air Force to cross the Taiwan Strait every day, nor can it prevent their people from visiting the mainland website or making remarks online. At the end of this year, they will be able to choose the next leader -then they will also reflect their own position.</p>
<p>Researcher Kuan-Chenlee believes that "this is a very difficult problem, because the democratic nature of the Taiwanese authorities makes the government unable to prohibit the people's right to flow. We are worried that the access and exchange will be the focus of the CCP's united front work." Under the circumstances of political purposes, the cross -strait exchanges are normalized. At the same time, I also hope that those who visit and exchanges will be cautious on related issues. "</p>

Taiwan's foreign minister Wu Zhaoyi met with Milosvystrcil, Speaker of the Czech Senate on Tuesday, which was part of the trip to Europe. This is the second visit to NATO and EU member states for Wu Zhaozheng after visiting NATO and EU member states in 2021. China claims that autonomy is its own territory, and has never given up the use of force to put Taiwan under its control. Taiwan strongly opposes China's sovereignty and stated that only the people of Taiwan can determine their future. Except for the Vatican, Taiwan has no formal diplomatic relations with any European country. But Central and Eastern European countries have always been keen to express their support for Taiwan -especially after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia -ignore Beijing's anger in contact with such contact and reduce Taiwan's international diplomatic isolation. According to a Central News Agency report, Wu Zhaozheng's visit to the Czech Republic on the 14th is expected to appear on the same stage at the "European Value Safety Policy Center" meeting on the 14th; because European leaders have always avoided the same stage with senior officials in Taiwan, this move. It looks extraordinary. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged Europe to not have any official exchanges with Taiwan or support "independence forces." Reuters news said that the Chinese Embassy in Prague did not immediately respond to the request for comment. (Responsible editor: (：)</p>

<h4>What are we looking forward to the first hearing or message?</h4>
<p>The first hearing explained by the judge was called a message.</p>
<p>Fingerprints and avatars are usually collected before the defendant appeared in court.</p>
<p>It is expected that Trump will deny these allegations, and he has previously believed that these allegations are "ridiculous."</p>
<p>After arriving in Miami, Trump told a local Broadcasting station that a conservative Spanish -American radio station said, "There has never been such a thing, and there has never been a political persecution like this."</p>
<p>Although Trump will appear in front of the Federal Federal Judge, the case has been assigned to the regional court judge Erin Kannon(Aileen Cannon)The latter ruled last year to appoint a secret document seized by a special supervisor. The federal appellation team eventually overturned her ruling. Kannon was appointed as a bench during the Trump's administration in May 2020.</p>
<p>It is unclear. With the advancement of the case, Trump may quote what reasons.</p>
<p>His two major lawyers announced their resignation the next morning after the prosecution, but did not explain the reason behind this decision in detail. Another Trump lawyer Evan Cokolon(Evan Corcoran)Note and memories were repeatedly cited throughout the prosecution, indicating that the prosecutor may be regarded as a key witness.</p>
<p>Trump said that although he did not issue any announcements on Monday, he was seeking to increase his legal team. According to the regulations in the region, the defendant must have local lawyers to make a message.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officers are preparing for potential riots. Previously, Trump encouraged supporters to participate in protests planned in the court. Prepare violence.</p>
<p>Some Republican legislators have been criticized for speeches that may cause violence, including Clais Higgins in Louisiana, who told supporters "tie a good seat belt", as well as Andy Biggs in Arizona. He Published a tweet saying, "We have now reached the war stage to return tooth with teeth."</p>
<p>After the hearing, Trump is expected to fly to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, reiterating his innocence in a speech in front of supporters.</p>
<h4>Trump will eventually be imprisoned?</h4>
<p>These charges may lead to decades of imprisonment, including the "Spy Law" that violates the defense information that has not been authorized as a criminal crime, and the conspiracy hinders judicial justice, which can be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The former Minister of Justice William Balt, appointed by Trump, severely evaluated the predicament of the former president.</p>
<p>When talking about Fox's news allegations, "Even if half of it is true, he is finished," he added, "I mean, this is very beautiful -this is a very detailed prosecution, this is a very detailed prosecution, And very, very abominable, here is the idea of painting Trump as a victim -the victims of political persecution are ridiculous. "</p>
<p>Special Prosecutor Jack Smith -he is also investigating Trump's efforts to reverse to Biden in 2020 -the prosecution depends on Trump himself to a large extent.</p>
<h4>Trump can still run for president in 2024?</h4>
<p>Legal experts said the indictment did not stop him from running for president -or even if he was convicted, he could not stop him from taking office.</p>
<p>It may not be able to conduct any federal trial in Florida until November 2024.</p>
<p>Candidates with criminal convictions have been running for president in the past. The two previous candidates, Eugene Victor "Kimney" Dobes in 1920, and Linden Larus in 1992, both from prison escaped.</p>
<p>The leader who stood out from the Republican primaries in 2024 made an oath saying that he would continue to run for the case result.</p>
<p>Trump will also be tried in another case in the New York State Court in March 2024. The cause of the case was to pay a sealing fee to a porn star. He tried the case in the New York court in April.</p>
<p>Despite a legal lawsuit against him, a new public opinion survey by Reuters/Yipso found that most Trump's Republican colleagues believed that these lawsuits were due to political motivation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65904710/65673962"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T14-32-00Z/65673962_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The Frankfurt Report commented that Xi Jinping's expectations for the highest leader of the party and the country to the younger generation can help the outside world understand the Chinese leadership's research on the current economic situation: Xi Jinping also called on youth ten years ago. People must have ambitions and promote the prosperity and prosperity of the country with the spirit of innovation. Ten years later, Xi Jinping was asking the younger generation to "learn to endure hardships" like him. This article entitled "Why do Chinese people to learn" hardships "" and wrote,</p>
<p>"After the three -year epidemic prevention period, China should have become the biggest surprise this year with the image of full blood. Now, the People's Bank of China has to ask all parties to be patient The demand for Chinese products is constantly decreasing, and the export data of May has fallen again.</p>
<p>But the problems facing China are not weak in the international market, but the downturn of domestic demand. This is not only manifested on the declining producer price index. As Morgan Chase president Jamiedimon issued a warning in Shanghai, the government issued an uncertain signal, and the Chinese would not invest. Whether the next round of retail data will improve, no one is sure. As the number of Chinese people buying cars is far lower than expected, the government has launched a new subsidy plan. Chinese people's mobile phones receive promotional information providing loans every few minutes. Just click the button to get the five -year loan of China Merchants Bank's 259,000 yuan.</p>
<p>However, statistics show that a large amount of cash has been put in savings accounts and has not entered the field of economic circulation. This is not surprising, after all, the fear of social media for unemployment has become an overwhelming topic. Alibaba's current approach has also exacerbated this kind of concern: This nominal Internet private company announced that it would lay off a large scale, and news from the economic circle said that Alibaba's layoffs were the government's wishes. The crowds leave the economic center of the eastern coastal cities and return to the mainland cities. Although their salary will be reduced, it will help promote the development of the local economy. The big company can recruit college graduates to join in, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/躺平还是润中国年轻人面对严酷就业现实/a-65879593">to curb the problem of unemployment of adolescents that can threaten the stability of the regime</a> 。"</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T14-32-00Z/64828158_401.jpg" />"The unemployment rate of adolescents has reached the level of threatening regime stability"</p>
<p>The comment pointed out that the Chinese government has tried to restore the management of the economic field in order to reduce infrastructure projects and increase the loan threshold of real estate development companies. This will inevitably lead to a slowdown in economic growth. Shock.</p>
<p>"In the past fifteen years, the government has been encouraging the people to consume, but the results have been very small, and promoting consumption has now become the only way out of the government's predicament. So far, the Chinese will still use one -third of the income for savings. The proportion of savings is three times that of Americans. Americans' consumption accounts for 80%of the entire national economic product, and the economy has maintained a stable growth, while China's consumption proportion is less than 50%. If you don't want to distribute shopping If the way to stimulate consumption, then, the Chinese government must boost the economy in order to increase the income and confidence of the people.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping urged the public to prepare for hardships and make people have reason to doubt his willingness to boost his economy. The necessary reforms are implemented in order to make Chinese consumers' money bags bulging and become more distant. On the contrary, once China attacked Taiwan not far, then Chinese party and state leaders do bring China into a new, long bitter era. "</p>
<p>On Monday, the global nuclear report released by the Swedish World Peace Research Institute showed that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球可用核彈頭增-瑞典智庫中國增最多/a-65886579">the number of nuclear warheads in China has increased by 20%in the past ten years</a>Essence "Daily" commented on this:</p>
<p>"Critics may say that the number of nuclear military in the United States and Russia is still ten times that of China. But this view is not only difficult to convince the crowd, but its shelf life is also very limited: because as of 2030, China may become the world's number one nuclear military country. The more important thing is the motivation for China's expansion of military reserve. Obviously, the tension between China's expansion of military reserve and geopolitics is inseparable: Zhongnanhai is convinced that the West will strongly curb the rise of China, and the Taiwan Strait dispute will even make the United States at the expense of the United States.</p>
<p>But all this is not enough to explain the problem. After all, China already has enough effective deterrence: the nuclear weapons owned by China are enough to survive the country's first wave of nuclear strikes and implement revenge.</p>
<p>One possible reason for China to continue to expand nuclear weapons is that once conflicts occur in the future, China will use nuclear weapons as a means of pressure. The neighboring countries have fully learned about this risk: decades later, South Korea has re -started discussions on whether to develop its own nuclear weapons. Other countries are likely to follow up. "</p>

Associated Press picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-06132023123248.html/@@stream">Audio-Langk: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-06132023248.html/@stream</a>The competition in the United States and China has led to the upgrading of tensions. Whether the two countries can restart normal communication have become increasingly hot. As of Tuesday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not confirmed the news of US Secretary of State Brosky. At the same time, Xi Jinping, the leader of the Communist Party of China, should be prepared for the preparation of "extreme situations" to quickly attract external attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hx1-06132023103746.html"><strong> Xi Jinping's response to the "extreme situation" Hong Kong media alert: China may be broken by the global broken chain </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/yazhou-henxiangliao/yz-06092023122909.html">In the face of the "stormy wave" Xi Jinping is going to build a "new security pattern", what is he afraid of? </a></strong></p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on June 13 that when the United States and Chinese senior officials were cautiously in contact, Xi Jinping was taking action to take action to plan for potential conflicts. Since the end of last month, Xi Jinping has twice emphasized that it is necessary to prepare for the "extreme" situation, and the use of the word "extreme" repeatedly also implies the possibility of intensified tensions.</p>
<p>In response to the continuous upgrading of the tension between the United States and China, the UNITED States Institute ofpeace of the Washington Think Tank held an online seminar on Tuesday. Scholars of the participants expressed their opinions on the risk management mechanism of the US -China prevention conflict.</p>
<p>Michael D.swaine, director of the East Asian Research Plan of Washington Think Tank, analyzes that the Chinese elite class and the public position the image of China as a very ambitious, but not aggressive and bullying country. These images will undermine China's foreign trust relationship and may cause China to excessively react with the United States' communication operations. He believes that the risk of crisis in the middle of the United States is mainly due to China's positioning of Taiwan.</p>
<p>"The Chinese also tend to look at a crisis from a moral perspective. In this case, the issue of Taiwan is very important. The moral principle here is: 'Taiwan is the sovereign territory of China and part of China. Take away Taiwan is an unfair behavior; we need to correct this behavior through unwavering efforts to achieve the unity of Taiwan and the mainland. "He pointed out that" this cognition makes it difficult to make it more flexible to be more flexible to be more flexible. Concession and compromise ... China is looking at the Taiwan issue in a more zero -sum way. "</p>
<p>Shi Wen believes that the essence of the US -China crisis negotiation is to express their concerns about the crisis, and does not expose their weaknesses to prevent the crisis from upgrading to conflict. This is currently the United States's active efforts.</p>

The Wall Street Journal pointed out that Xi Jinping's "extreme" slogan began to cover the local level. According to the official release of China, from Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai to the inland Hunan Province, it is currently actively preparing for the "extreme" situation.</p>
<p>So, Xi Jinping, who has an absolute authority in the Communist Party of China, does it mean the real meaning of the so -called "extreme situation"? The Chinese political scholar, known as the "National Master", bluntly stated that the "extreme" situation of Xi Jinping's repeated warning of Xi Jinping means "the danger of war."</p>
<p>On May 30, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in the first meeting of the 20th Central National Security Council that he should deeply understand the complicated and severe situation facing national security and ensure the new development pattern with a new security pattern. He emphasized: "We must adhere to the bottom line of thinking and extreme thinking, and prepare for the major test of high waves and even stormy waves." At the same time, Xi Jinping also expanded this warning to the Chinese economy. A few days ago, Xi Jinping once again emphasized when inspecting an industrial park in Inner Mongolia that the purpose of building a large domestic cycle in China is to ensure that the national economy can run normally under the "extreme situation".</p>
<p>Chadsbragia, a researcher at the Institute for DEFENSESESES, pointed out at the seminar that based on the differences in the political system of the United States and China, in crisis negotiations, the inherent model of the United States treats other countries is not applicable to China, especially In terms of military dialogue mechanism.</p>
<p>"The core of crisis communication is that (the United States) Department of Defense believes that the parties in the dialogue usually have huge responsibilities and power and can be freely exerted." He said: "The Chinese side will not respond to this because they come to them because they come to them because they come to them. It can be said that the content can be said to be strictly limited. (China) is the political army rather than the national army. The United States must understand this and compete with it. "</p>
<p>Shi Gese also pointed out that China ’s avoidance of crisis dialogue is because Beijing is concerned that once it is communicated, the United States will infer more Chinese activities and prevent it through security fences. This is not the result of China.Xi Jinping's above -mentioned "extreme" warning also coincides with the time when US Secretary of State Brillings plans to visit China. Reuters recently quoted a U.S. officials revealed that Brins will visit China on June 18. However, the details of related visits have not yet been confirmed by China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin once again stated at a regular press conference on Tuesday that the questioning of Brinken's visit to China "has responded, and there is no other information to be supplemented." Earlier, China also rejected the United States 'suggestions on the Secondary National Defense Ministers' talks on the security dialogue between Shangri -La.</p>
<p>The participating scholars agreed at the above discussion that in the face of the US -China competition, the efforts of the establishment of a crisis communication mechanism in the United States are essential to avoid conflicts with China, and the two sides must find a way to start dialogue between each other.</p>

<p>UN UMNO Chairman of Malaysia <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/ahmad-zahid-hamidi">Ahmad Zahi</a>A few days ago, he announced that he went to the prison to visit the former Prime Minister Najib and had a breakfast with Najib for an hour. The lawyer believes that if Ahmad Zahi said that it is true, in fact, the prison regulations have been contradictory, otherwise the prison bureau has double standards.</p>
<p>UMNO Chairman Ahmadzich revealed at the UMNO Conference last week that he recently went to Kahara Prison to visit Najib and brought all Najib's favorite food. The two also had breakfast for one hour. Ahmad Zahi also said that he was at the time with the deputy minister of the Ministry of the Interior, Samsuu Ania, to explore the prison.</p>
<p>Mohamad Lafite, a lawyer of Malaysia, told the New Strait Times that if Ahmad Zahi said that they are all true, such exploration and supervisors have double standards. "The lawyer or family's exploration and supervision procedures are quite strict. Including a maximum of 45 minutes at a time. And you cannot face face to face with prisoners. You must have glass separated between you, so you must talk to the prisoner by phone,"</p>
<p>Rafik said: "Therefore, Ahmad Zahi's statement seems to have violated the regulations on the detection and supervision. There is another question, how do Ahmad Zaji obtain the right to visit? And what is he to explore the prison?" Regulations, only the director of the prison department or the Minister of the Interior. He pointed out that Ahmad Zahi claimed that there was Samsuanuya accompanied at the time, so Samsuu Anuya must explain.</p>
<p>Lafite also said, "Do the cabinet know this time the prison? If Ahmad Zahi explores the progress of the pardon of Najib, will it be notified by Najib's lawyer? Or the Najib family notify him. Why is it a witch? The chairman of the United States go to visit the prison? "</p>
