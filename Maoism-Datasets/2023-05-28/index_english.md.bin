在上述呼吁出台之际，苏丹军方与快速支援部队在该国首都喀土穆的大部分战线保持着谨慎平静。此前一天，双方在为时7天的休战期间爆发了最为激烈的冲突。需要指出的是，这项休战是苏丹冲突双方于5月20日在与沙特和美国的调解下达成的。

然而，当地消息人士告诉半岛电视台记者，北喀土穆以北的哈法亚郊区响起了炮击和防空火力的声音。

另一方面，苏丹西部的北科尔多凡州、南达尔富尔州、西达尔富尔州的局势趋于平静。

在靠近战区的街区内，街道上空无一人，而其他地区的人们则争先恐后地趁着停火时间购买他们的生活必需品，部分商人还试图将他们的货物转移到更为安全的地方。

####  约旦大使官邸遭到袭击

另一方面，约旦外交部宣布，其驻喀土穆大使的官邸遭到袭击和破坏，该部对袭击其外交总部的事件提出谴责。

约旦外交部在一份声明中指出，其大使和使馆工作人员没有受到任何伤害，因为他们目前位于苏丹东部的苏丹港市。

该部表示，“约旦王国谴责一切形式的暴力和破坏行为，尤其是那些侵犯外交建筑神圣性的行为。”

自苏丹战火爆发以来，已有多处外交总部遭到袭击。约旦曾在5月中旬宣布，其驻喀土穆大使馆遭到了袭击。

需要指出的是，自今年4月15日以来，苏丹军队与快速支援部队在苏丹持续发生冲突，目前已造成数百人死亡，超过100万人在国内流离失所，还有超过30万人逃往邻近国家。.

根据“武装冲突及其事实”网站公布的数据，自这场冲突爆发以来，死亡人数已达1800人，其中大部分人死于喀土穆，以及西达尔富尔州首府朱奈纳。

### Mount Everest 70th Anniversary: The first successful experience of the father and the current climbing boom

1953年5月29日，丹增·诺盖(39 years old)And Edmond Hillary(33 years old)登顶珠穆朗玛峰后不久拍摄的照片。

**“我认为他们是真正的开拓者和探险家，给未知领域铺平了道路。正是因为他们两人和他们的团队，我们今天才能做很多事情。” 詹姆林·丹增·诺盖(JamlingTenzing Norgay)说。**

他指的是70年前的5月29日，那一天他的父亲成为全球首次登顶世界最高峰的人。

丹增·诺盖 (Tenzing Norgay)在新西兰养蜂人埃德蒙·希拉里(Edmund Hillary)的陪同下登上了尼泊尔与中国边境的珠穆朗玛峰。

两位登山者的儿子，詹姆林·丹增·诺盖(Jamling Tenzing Norgay)和彼得·希拉里(PeterHillary)，从小就听着父亲的英雄故事长大。两人都追随父亲的脚步征服了珠穆朗玛峰。

在这次历史性攀登的周年纪念日，他们自豪地向BBC讲述了父亲的辉煌成就。

In the mid -1970s, Jamel was with his father and brother.

"When they went up, they were just ordinary people, and they became world heroes when they came back. This did not change them. They are equally simple and humble people. They all give back to the people of Himalayas with their own lives," Jamel said proudly Essence

"Whenever someone has done something that has never been done before, it will send a signal you can also do to others. On the 70th anniversary of (human first reaching the Everest), let us celebrate this achievement."

In 1953, the summit undoubtedly created a precedent, and many people would follow the imitation: in the first ten days of the climbing season this year, more than 500 people reached the 8849 -meter -high Mount Everest.

The advancement of technology, logistics and communications made it possible, but Dan Zeng Noga and Edmond Hillary achieved this strong role without GPS or satellite telephones.

The news of their success was passed to London three days later.

In the 30 years before the summit, the two of them failed to successfully adventure.

Among them, Da Zeng Nuo Gai participated in the six top trials of 20 years, including the failure in 1952.

"When my father was a boy who raised yaks, he was often curious why no bird could fly over the mountain," Jamelin recalled.

"The prediction of Lama (senior Buddhist monk) inspired him, he said that Buddhists would first reach the peak."

### 15 minutes of the world -famous world

Edmond Hillary(middle)Peter(right)Herbaba mountaineers such as Mimima Aima have maintained long -term exchanges.

Peter said that when his father was invited to participate in the Ninth Britain's Well -Type Mount Everest, he knew it was a good opportunity to create history.

"He always knew he wanted to walk ahead. He was an ambitious person," said Peter in an interview with the BBC "Witness History" program.

"One of the most clear things I remember is, he described how he crossed the ice and snow to the South Peak."

"He said that he was in front of the steps, and the large snow and ice collapsed from the steep hillside and fell to Tibet."

They continued to move forward regardless of bad weather. Peter said that if it was other peaks, his father might give up and come again. He believed a voice in his heart and told his father to continue.

They were hypoxic when they reached the top of the mountain. After about 15 minutes on the top of the world, they came down.

丹增在珠穆朗玛峰上的照片，由埃德蒙·希拉里拍摄。

丹增在雪里埋了一些糖果和饼干，作为佛教的祭品。

埃德蒙·希拉里拍摄了几张照片，照片中丹增挥舞着代表英国、尼泊尔、联合国和印度的旗帜。

但是没有希拉里在顶峰的照片。

“爸爸开玩笑说，据他所知，丹增从未用过相机——他不认为这是开始的地方，”彼得回忆道。

几十年后，当彼得和詹姆林登上珠穆朗玛峰时，他们都更清楚自己的父亲曾穿越过的未知领域。

“我第一次攀登是在1990年。我只是一直在想我爸爸。当我走到希拉里台阶时，我目睹了我父亲看到过的景象。我也有同样的经历。这让人非常激动，”彼得告诉BBC。

詹姆林1996年因宗教和个人原因“登顶”。

他和父亲都是夏尔巴人，这是来自西藏的民族，以登山技能而闻名，他们与喜马拉雅山有着深厚的精神联系。

“对我来说，这更像是一次朝圣。我想重新与我的宗教和习俗联系起来，了解我父亲所经历的一切。”

###  过度拥挤

In 2001, climbers lined up when climbing Mount Everest.

As many people reaches Mount Everest every year, Peter and Jamel are not sought after by the public like their father.But he said that he would not retire soon because his competitors, Pasang Dawa, followed closely, and it has been on the top of 26 times, and it is still increasing.

Lakpa Sherpa kept a record of female climbers, and she settled at the 10th time last year. They are not household names.

"Compared with my father's time, it is easier to climb climbing now. The technology is very helpful. After the summit, some people take a helicopter from camp 2 to Kedman. Both of them are carried by the Shilba. "Jamel continued.

"No adventure stimulus. It has become a photography event. It is not because they like to climb."

Peter agreed with this view. "We have a lot of ropes from the big camp to the top of the mountain, there are ladders across cracks, and the Charba team with hot tea in the camp. You can be rescued by helicopters safely at a helicopter from 6300 meters to 6,500 meters."

"But the mountain is still old. This is a challenging mountain."

This statement is more conservative. In the past 100 years, more than 300 climbers have died. In this season alone, the number of deaths reached 11.

"This mountain taught you to respect nature," Kamlin said. "We are just passengers on this planet."

The Citizen Party, one of the most famous democratic groups in Hong Kong, voted on Saturday and decided to dissolve. After the Hong Kong authorities suppressed the party and threatened the arrest of members of the party, the party could not select a leader.

According to Agence France -Presse reports on the 27th, the Hong Kong Citizen Party is known as the "Lawyer Party" because many founders of the party work in the legal community. The party was founded in 2006 to promote the democratization process in Hong Kong.

According to Liang Jiajie, the current chairman of the Citizen Party, "The Citizen Party will disappear from the earth after all procedures are completed." Liang Jiajie is one of the party's founders and a famous figure in the United Kingdom to return Hong Kong to China since 1997.

In 2007, Liang Jiajie was the first and the only candidate for the Hong Kong Chief Executive's position without being supported by Beijing. Unsurprisingly, he was defeated in the election. But his political party has been committed to becoming a "governance" power since then, not just the opposition.

When it was most popular, the Citizen Party ranked second among the oppositions in Hong Kong and won six seats in the 2012 Legislative Council election.

In recent years, the opposition in Hong Kong has been hit by the National Security Law and the reform of the election system implemented by China. These reforms have greatly excluded democracy outside local politics.

China implemented the National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2020. Many members of the Citizens Party were arrested, including former Legislative Councilor Yang Yueqiao and Tan Wenhao. Yang and Tan were detained for more than two years in the national security cases and were rejected by bail, while another senior member Wu Yiyi was convicted of illegal assembly. Others fled abroad.

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) German Chancellor Savz will only stay in South Korea for a few hours on May 21. However, this visit and talks with South Korean President Yin Xiyue have contributed to a series of agreements. The agreement is about [Germany sharing military intelligence and simplifying the national defense industry supply chain of the two countries](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与韩国将签署军事机密协议/a-65690800)Essence

Before the bilateral summit, Shulzgang participated in the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Both summits are particularly concerned about the tensions of Ukraine's security crisis and the tight situation in Northeast Asia. China has once again become the most important topic.

Analysts pointed out that the defense cooperation between Shortz and Yin Xiyue is only the latest example of similar cooperation between countries. All these cooperations can be regarded as a counterattack on China's influence.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T-2-14-00Z/65691203_401.jpg)German Chancellor Savz visited South Korea on May 21 and met with South Korean President Yin Xiyue

What he does in Beijing-from occupying the controversial islands in the South China Sea unilaterally and militaryization, to confrontation with Japan on the East China Sea Island, and conflict with India on border. A reason for the league and agreement.

In recent years, Germany has been strengthening the role of Indo -Pacific. In 2021, a German warship crossed the area and conducted a series of exercises with the navy of other countries. Recently, Germany also sent fighters to participate in joint exercises.

### The relationship between Korea and NATO will be further strengthened

Before meeting with Yin Xiyue, Shawrtz visited the Non -Military Region (Banmen Store) of the South Korean border. On the boundary of many defense, Shulz said that Pyongyang continued to develop nuclear weapons and long -range missiles, showing that the situation in the Korean Peninsula was still dangerous, and North Korea was still "threat to peace and security in the region."

In the subsequent talks, the two leaders reached an agreement on sharing and protecting military secrets, and established a mechanism to make the military supply chain greater elastic.

Dan Pinkston, a professor of international relations at the Seoul Campus of the University of Troy, pointed out that the "Beijing's expansion policy" is one of the reasons for those countries that do not alliance in China to strengthen cooperation with each other.

"I predict that there will be more such cooperation," Pingkston told Germany. He said, "the South Korean army can foresee that a military exercise will be held with NATO and other countries with common concern. These exercises are important to ensure that the supply chain is guaranteed to ensure that the supply chain is guaranteed."

### Ukrainian war deeply shocked South Korea

In addition to the German and Air Force and the South Korean army, Seoul is also exporting advanced weapon systems to Europe. Last year, South Korea and NATO member states Poland signed a large -scale national defense agreement with an estimated value of up to 15 billion euros ($ 16.2 billion), including the sale of nearly 1,000 K2 main battle tanks, 648 self -propelled howitzers and 48 FA050 fighters.

South Korea hopes that the establishment of closer alliances with European countries like Germany can enhance its deterrence to potential opponents in the Indo -Pacific region.

Former South Korean diplomats and senior intelligence officials Rah Jong-YIL said: "Obviously, South Korea is seeking closer and more contact with Western countries, and this is obviously attributed to the outbreak of the Ukraine War. South Korea is a big blow. "He said." In the area, China is of course the biggest concern, but we must also closely pay attention to North Korea and Russia. "

### China is also looking for allies

While Seoul was looking for close allies in the West, China seemed to be on its own diplomatic offensive.

"In recent months, Beijing has been in contact with some countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, hoping to establish their own alliances. Therefore, both sides are establishing partnership and committed to improving their own interests," Luo Zhongyi said.

At the same time as the Hiroshima G7 Summit was held, Beijing held the summit with five Central Asian countries-Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tagikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in Xi'an. China has recently served as a peaceful mediation person in the Middle East and has been praised for promoting the hostility of Saudi Arabia and Iran for many years.

Of course, it will not ignore that China is trying to raise its very strong influence in Asia.

In view of the security threat of North Korea's ability to develop nuclear weapons to South Korea, in 2016, the South Korean government decided to deploy the US Sad anti -missile system (Thaad). Because its radar has the potential ability of China, it is considered by China to affect its land security.

Author: None (Language: zh)

Publisher: None

Time: 2023-05-28T-6:12:00Z

Description: The Social Democratic Party leads the German federal government, and the Social Democratic Party Schilde is the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is not ideal. Police investigations show that the support rate of the Social Democratic Party has declined, and its joint governance with the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party is not smooth.

(Voice of Germany) at the Social Democratic Party headquarters in Berlin, it is rare to celebrate. As a result, every Jiebao will be valued. "Today is a wonderful night for us. We are very proud of the Social Democratic Party, which Bhili Mei and Bai Mei Port," said the Social Democratic Party ’s General Secretary Kevinkühnert, and said after the Social Democratic Party won the Meizhou Parliament on May 14.

Andreas Bovenschulte, Mayor of the Social Democratic Party, even sang "Stand Byme" (standing beside me) at the end of the campaign, and Lars Klingbeil, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, who came from Berlin, used it. The guitar accompanied by the side, and called for voters to "stand beside the Social Democratic Party" by music. In the end, the Social Democratic Party received 29.8%of the votes in Bulangmei, which was the second secondary election results in more than 70 years.

### ** The ruling party in the fall **

The Social Democratic Party, located in Berlin Headquarters, wants to learn some experience from the success of Blackme. The General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, Konat, said that they will carefully study the gains of the victory. However, the successful cases of Bremei are the result of the Federal Democratic Party's dream.

The support rate of the CDU/Cocoons in polls exceeds 30%, while the Social Democratic Party's support rate hovers between 17%and 19%, and competes with the Green Party and the Green Party and the Right -wing Party Options Party (AFD). In the history of the federal government, there is no support for the party's party.

[The reason why Scharsez and its party and the Social Democratic Party wins in the federal election in September 2021](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/奥拉夫肖尔茨被低估嘲笑的社民党救星/a-59327642)It is just because the Candidate candidate of the CDU made too many mistakes and weak strength in the election?

### ** Short high rise **

Looking at the year of election and subsequent polls, you will find that the Social Democratic Party has made great progress before the Federal House election. From 16%in July 2021 to nearly 26%in September. This rise has continued until the spring of 2022, and then began to fall. A bitter fact: Politicians believe that a political party must get at least 20%of the votes in order to be called "Volkspartei".

At the same time, Federal President Steinmier was delivered. After the photo was exposed, Lasha's polls support rate dropped straight up

Has the "return of social democracy" celebrated by the Social Democratic Party has become history? The number of members of the Social Democratic Party has continued to decline earlier before the federal parliament election, and even the large cities that had a lot of support were defeated. Berlin is the latest example -the CIMC has taken over the city again 22 years after the Social Democratic Party was in power.

The Social Democratic Party's situation in eastern Germany looks really bad. In Saxony and Saxon-Anhart, the support rate of the Social Democratic Party in public opinion surveys is only a single digit.

### ** When will you return to social issues? **

In this sluggish atmosphere, the Social Democratic Party ushered in its 160th birthday. As the oldest political parties in Germany, the Social Democratic Party has celebrated its birthday for three consecutive days through speeches, forums, exhibitions, and awards ceremonies. This is a rare opportunity that can breathe and replenish energy, and it is also an opportunity to reveal the figure in the ruling league again.

Celebrate the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party in Berlin's headquarters and Willie Brand Building(Willy Brandt House)The theme is based on the theme of "progress needs to be imposed".

Social issues are the core competitiveness of the Social Democratic Party. But the facts are blurred and diluted by the Ukrainian war and its influence. The Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Party is mainly busy with foreign policy. The Minister of the Social Democratic Party is busy with immigration.

In view of the tightness of the inflation and the construction market, the main commitment of the Social Democratic Party during the campaign -built 400,000 houses every year -no mention of it.

### ** The Opinions of the Transportation Lighting Alliance are different **

[In the governing alliance composed of the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/执政一年红绿灯政府交出怎样的成绩单/a-64029789)In, the Social Democratic Party appears [relatively low -existence and lack of distinctive features](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/评论若交通灯发的是黑绿光/a-61813910)Essence The controversy of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Green Party usually occupy the headlines of the news. Directed by the Green Party, the elimination of oil and natural gas heating has been panicked since 2024, and many people have pushed many voters to the arms of the opposition party.

Due to inflation, the cost of living has risen significantly. For people without financial reserves, it is becoming more difficult to maintain their livelihood. At present, the Society's Democratic Party hopes to step on the brakes for the "Energy Law of Architecture". They said that although climate protection is important, it cannot be too heavy. Minister of Labor Hubertusheil said that the bill must be improved, and the solution must be "feasible at the technical level and acceptable to the social level."

In 2019, the left -wing faction prevented the politics of Scharsez, who prevented politics that is even more inclined to the right of right -wing society to become a leader. But since Salz has served as the Prime Minister, the left -wing faction has been silent and obeyed the party discipline.

### ** Personal charm becomes more and more important **

Shawrtz has never been particularly popular in the Social Democratic Party, but as the Prime Minister, he has received the respect and attention he deserves. However, this is a kind and goodwill linking with achievement. Only when he can give the party's interests, the party will always support him. In this case, carefully studying the success of the Social Democratic Party may help. There, a social Democratic party won the trust of voters with a down -to -earth, approachable and popular image.

### Shawrtz's first year as German Prime Minister: What did he change?

In the election, personal charm is becoming more and more important, and the elections in other state parliaments have also confirmed this in the past few years. However, Shelz is relatively lacking in this regard. He often gives people a kind of indifference, no emotion and difficulty. Therefore, from this point, it may be difficult to get successful experience from Bon Mei Mei.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T0-14-00Z/61735360_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65733764/61735360)Xi Jinping visited the Fuzhou New World Group in November 2014

(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to the natural index data released on May 19, from January 2022 to December, Chinese authors published a "share" of 19,373 papers in 82 high -quality journals, which exceeded the United States for the first time. Number one. The United States is 17610.

The natural index is compiled and published by the subordinate agency of the publishing agency "Spelinge-Nature Publishing Group", tracking scientific research papers published in 82 high-quality journals, and analyzing data such as the author's belonging. A country's share is based on the proportion of authors of the country in each paper published in the natural index journal. If an article is fully published by Chinese researchers, China's share is 1.

According to the natural index of 2022, in terms of physics, chemistry, earth, and environmental sciences, authors who belong to Chinese institutions are more than those in the United States. The only thing that is still in the United States is life science.

A report from the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy in Japan last year said that from 2018 to 2020, Chinese research accounted for the proportion of the first 1%papers with the largest number of references than US research. The report also found that China published an average of 407,181 scientific papers each year, leading 293,434 ahead of the United States.

The increase in references for Chinese research should be attributed to a large number of references to the COVID-19 genome sequencing. However, although China's scientific research share ranks more than the United States, the cooperation between Sino -US authors is the most in international cooperation. Many of the most cited papers in China have also been completed with international researchers.

At the same time, the natural index also shows that according to the total statistics of all articles from a certain country/region, the total number of American scientific papers in 2022 was nearly 25,200 in 2022, and China was more than 2,3500.

### Sino -US scientist cooperation becomes difficult

The Guardian pointed out that with the deterioration of US -China relations, scientists in the two countries have become more difficult. From 2018 to 2022, the ["China Action Plan", which was launched by the US Department of Justice to eradicate Chinese spies and theft of intellectual property and business secrets(China Initiative)As a result, more than 100 scientists lose their job](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/斯坦福大学177名学者联名要求美司法部停止执行中国行动计划/a-59168487)Essence Chinese universities also strictly review their cooperation with foreigners.

### Chinese researchers' big papers for fake attention attract attention

Chinese President Xi Jinping called on raising scientific research funds and investment. The academic community was pushed to the forefront of science and technology competition. However, Chinese researchers say they are under pressure to give priority to the quantity rather than quality. In order to increase the output, the dissertation was also faked and low -quality research occurred. In 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China banned universities and research institutions to make financial rewards to increase the number of published papers.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T0-14-00Z/59525544_401.jpg)The dissertation fakes plagued the Chinese academic community

Elisabethbik, a microbiologist who has worked at Stanford University in the United States, has repeatedly revealed that Chinese scientific researchers have exposed Chinese scientific researchers suspected of "academic incompetence and fraud." She found that about 650 papers used pictures of the same source, which seemed to be produced by the same "factory".

According to a report on January 25, 2022, the Bicker team has discovered 16 "thesis factories" and more than 2,000 papers since 2020, most of which contain Chinese authors. The members of the Bike team's pseudonym told the Journal of Chinese Sciences that "100%of the domestic thesis factories are Chinese customers, and some foreign thesis factories are also Chinese customers. From the perspective of the world, the largest buyer is undoubtedly from China. "

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-05-28T03-56-39/222-1685262231.jpg)A missile aims at Kiev, Ukrainian capital(Reuters)In the early morning of May 28, a series of explosive sounds of Kenhe, the capital of Ukraine, and the Russian army eased its attack on Bachmut to re -assemble their teams.

Peninsula TV reporters in Ukraine said that at dawn, a strong explosion shook the capital Kiev. Reuters reports that these explosions have killed many people and were injured in three.

The reporter added that the air defense system responded to the attack, multiple drones were shot down, and some residents went to the subway station because they were afraid of being bombed.

As Mayor Kiev said, the suicide drone attack on the capital caused two buildings in the two regions of Kiev. At the same time, the director of the Ukrainian President's Office announced that the capital was being attacked by drones.

In the emergency news of this Sunday morning, the Kiev Military and Political Department announced that more than 40 drones launched by Russia were shot down overnight overnight.

On the other hand, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said on Sunday on Sunday that the Ukrainian army successfully repelled Russia's 21 attacks in the past 24 hours, and added that the Russian army continued to focus on seizing Luguskhehe Donetsk area.

At the same time, the authorities announced that the Ukrainian Air Force has launched four attacks on enemy personnel and areas with concentrated equipment in the past 24 hours. "

On the other hand, the governor of Russia Peskov announced that two drones attacked an oil refinery in the state and pointed out that the target of the attack was a refinery located in Russia, Belarus and Latvia.

Governor of Belgo Rhode, Russia, also said that a civilian was killed in the shelter of the Saido city bordering Ukraine in Ukraine.

####  Bachmut

At the same time, a senior official of Kiev said on Saturday on Saturday that the Russian army temporarily reduced the offensive pace of the Bachimut besieged in eastern Ukraine, in order to re -assemble the team and enhance their strength.

Ukraine's deputy minister of Defense Anna Maryl said in a statement issued by Telegram that the Russian army continued to attack, but the overall action was reduced.

She continued, "No battle happened yesterday and today, whether in the city or in the suburbs," said that the Russian army bombed the suburbs and roads leading to Bachomut.

Ukrainian senior officials stated in a separate statement that their troops are preparing to launch a long -awaited counterattack to regain territory occupied by Russia since the beginning of the war.

Vagna, a Russian private military group, began to transfer its position to the Russian regular army last week. Earlier, after the longest and bloody battle in the war, it announced that it was fully controlled to control Bachmut.

#### "Taurus" missile

According to the German Ministry of Defense, in the background, Ukraine officially required the German government to deliver a range of at least 500 kilometers of "Taurus" air -to -ground cruise missiles.

A German official said, "We have received a request for Ukraine in the past few days", but it has not provided any details of the number of missiles.

In recent months, the Berlin government has significantly increased its military supply to Kiev, but it still provides them with cruise missiles or support Ukraine Air Force and help the delivery of the F-16 fighter aircraft to remain silent.

"Taurus" is a air-to-ground cruise missile equipped on a fighter aircraft, developed by a Deedi Taurus Company. Its range can strike the goal away from the current front line of East Ukraine.

On the occasion of these situations, Kiev has been preparing to fight back for several months to drive the Russian army out of its land occupied in Ukraine.

Both sides accused each other of shooting first.

Although Tehran and Kabul have diplomatic relations, Iran does not recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Recently, the two countries have been tense due to water rights disputes.

Iran asked Afghanistan to respect its "water rights" last week and accused the upstream dam intercepting, which caused the water volume to flow into Hamun Lake. This lake was located on the common border between the two countries.

Afghanistan has reduced the amount of river water on climate factor.

The Helmand River originated from the mountainous area of Haymande Province, central Afghanistan, and flows into Hamon Lake on the border between the two countries more than 1,000 kilometers.

Iran insists that Iran's water quota is a legitimate agreement reached by the two parties in 1973 and asked Taliban leaders to abide by the agreement. Last week, Iran said that the Tehran authorities "reserved" took action to solve the right to dispute.

When Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inspected the drought of Sistan-Baluchistan in the southeast on the 18th of this month, he said, "I warn Afghanistan that he should immediately give Hittano Balurachi Provincial people's water rights. "(Translator: Ji Jinling)

(Voice of Germany Chinese) Neuralink ("Brain Machine Interface") of Elonmusk's neural technology startup said on May 25 that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has opened a green light for its first human clinical test This is a milestone incident. Before that, the application was difficult to get approval.

Neuralink said in a tweet that FDA's first "represents an important first step, and one day our technology will help many people."

The company did not explain the goals of this research in detail, but just said that it had not started recruiting, and soon there would be more details.

[Musk envision to treat a series of diseases through brain implant](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马斯克的大脑植入设备真能读取你的思想吗/a-65262642)Including obesity, autism, depression, and schizophrenia, we also hope to achieve web browsing and mental minds. At the end of last year, he said that he was very confident in the safety of these equipment and was willing to implant them into his children and became a hot spot for public opinion.

According to Reuters's predecessor and current employee quoted Neurink, since 2019, Musk has predicted that Neuralink will begin human test at least four occasions. But in fact, the company only began to seek FDA approval in early 2022. FDA originally rejected its application.

According to the employee of Neuralink, the FDA pointed out to the company at the time that several problems that needed to be solved before the human body test were required. In the case, the challenge faces the equipment safely.

### The mystery of the human brain!

Founded in 2016, Neuralink has faced federal investigations many times. In May of this year, the US Congress urged regulators to investigate and supervise whether the company's animal test teams had poor and hasty experiments. At the same time, the Federal Ministry of Jiaotong investigated separately whether Neuralink illegally transported the risk -based diseases on the chip taken from the monkey's brain without taking appropriate control measures. Neuralink is also investigating by the Office of the US Department of Agriculture's Supervisor's Office because it may have a behavior that violates the well -being of the animal.

At present, Neuralink has not responded to Reuters' comment requests on these surveys.

In addition to Neuralink, some companies are also studying the topic of brain interface. In July last year, Synchron, founder of Microsoft's founder Gates and Amazon founder Bezos, announced that it became the first company to implant chip into the American patient brain.

All these are pursuing a unified aesthetic: black skin is lighter, white skin becomes rosy, and big nose becomes delicate. Katjagany, a lecturer at the University of Frankfurt Golita, criticized that although these technologies are brand new, "there must be problems with aesthetic taste, and many old Chen concepts are condensed in filters."

### depression and self -perception deviation

And this will cause serious consequences of user psychology. According to a study at the British Christian Youth Conference, two -thirds of young people feel the pressure of appearance standards on social networks. A survey by British Youth Organization GirlGuiding shows that about one -third of the 11 to 21 -year -old girls will not post their unrefined photos. German Youtube anchor Silvicarlsson believes that "this is a game with the devil" and publicly shows the position against beauty filters. "When we appear in public with the filter, we will receive love and like. We feel that we are accepted and dopamine burst. However, once we walk to the crowd, there is no filter, with acne and stains on our faces. What would happen with dark circles? "She said," Social media has trained us to show a perfect self to the outside world, which will destroy us. "

The disease caused even a special name: selfie deformity phobia or face value phobia. The more the selfies under the filter become the norm, the more the self -esteem of many people is affected. According to the Jama Facialplastic Surgery of Scientific Magazine, it can no longer achieve depression that can no longer achieve the ideal face value.

### Discussion on national supervision

In order to control this phenomenon, some countries are trying to resist through the law. In Norway and Israel, the photos processed by the filter must be marked if they are used for social network advertisements. A draft law in France has made similar regulations on photos and videos. If Internet celebrities are illegal, it will face a fine of 300,000 euros or a six -month imprisonment. Britain is also discussing such regulations.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T07-13-00Z/64828423_401.jpg)Internet celebrity marketing is full of Chinese network platforms

Germany has no such legal provisions so far. Last year, Servi Karson launched a petition activity to change this situation. The German Minister of Gender Equality and Women's Issues also appealed last year that advertising and social networks should be marked with filter pictures and videos. However, there is still no bill on the federal level.

### How much does the net red make money?

Gangcker, a lecturer at the University of Frankfurt, agreed with such supervision, but also pointed out that this should only be applied to the business field and cannot be used for selfies in the private sector because it will be a review. She believes that they need to educate children and young people early to strengthen their skills to deal with media. "We live in a capitalist society, and it effectively makes people feel that we must optimize ourselves and must consume certain products or services, such as [Medical Beauty](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/疫情宅在家不如做医美/a-56226365),Plastic surgery. All operations depend on a sense of dissatisfaction to stimulate consumption. "Golder believes that people need to think about how to grasp the scale when dealing with these images as users.

Description: Beijing prohibits key information infrastructure to use Meicuang products to counter the United States' further tightening of Chinese chip exports. Analysis believes that this may be a new means used in future geopolitical disputes. But China must also realize the impact of such countermeasures on the country's economy.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T07-14-00Z/65224835_303.jpeg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65735679/65224835)(Voice of Germany) [China Network Information Office recently announced that operators of key domestic information infrastructure should stop purchasing Micron's products](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國封殺美光-美反對無事實根據的限制/a-65693360)Essence According to the online information office, "[Meiguang Company Products](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國突擊美企上海辦公室-掀外商憂慮/a-65447816)There are hidden dangers of serious network security issues, causing major security risks to the supply chain of key information infrastructure in my country and affecting my country's national security. "

Washington expressed serious concerns. The announcement of Beijing's announcement was on the occasion of the G7 summit to urge Beijing to end the "economic coercion".

Garyng, a senior economist of French Foreign Trade Bank (Natixis) specializing in global chip trade, told AFN that this response from China is of iconic significance. He said that since the United States has tightened the export restrictions on China in 2021, China has conducted network security censorship on a foreign company for the first time, and the scope of review is rare [expanded to national security concerns](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制美國北京以國安為由審查美晶片商/a-65224796)Essence He said that when he encountered other geopolitical affairs in the future, "if the regulatory authorities use this as a means of revenge, I will not be surprised."

Georgetown University's scholar Emilyweinstein, a scholar who studies US -China technology confrontation, said that the definition of "key information infrastructure" is very extensive, from online government services to national defense and medical and water conservancy. "Technically, it can refer to any areas that meet this condition," she said. "China has always established protectionist barriers for national security", including the mandatory technology transfer agreement, requiring the company to store all data locally, and to require foreign entities to establish a joint venture with local partners in some fields.

### "Political Speaking"

In March last year, China began investigating Micron. In the past five months, the United States announced that it took great restrictions to block Beijing's software for high -end chips, chip production equipment, and design semiconductor software.

Paultriolo, a Chinese technical expert from Olbati-Shiqiao Consulting, said: "This is obviously Beijing thinks Washington supports Micron and the United States semiconductor industry, and Teru said that Micron became a target of targeting The object is to make a political statement. He said that China ’s cyber security censorship of domestic enterprises such as taxis was concentrated in data, rather than expanding into the category of national security.

Washington has previously included Chinese chip manufacturers including Micron's competitors in Yangtze River.

The G7 summit statement states that it will "risk risks instead of decoupling." At the same time, Washington put pressure on the allies to unanimously restrict the export of chip equipment for China.

Gary NG, a senior economist, said: "The strong statement of the G7 may also add a fire."

### Without Taiwan's semiconductor production, what should I do in the world?

### "Beijing intends to turn to Korean supplier"

However, when Beijing implements such countermeasures, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact on the economy of the country.

Analysis believes that Micron, one of the largest storage chip manufacturers in the United States, can easily become targets, because its semiconductor can be replaced by South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung.

However, it is much more rare to restrict other American companies such as Intel or Qualcomm, because these technologies are used for consumer products such as smartphones and shipped overseas after manufacturing in China.

Zhuang Jiaying, the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg: "U.S. companies such as Micron are limited, this position may be a signal, that is, in confrontation with the United States, Beijing is willing to bear some pain. The cost. "

The Toby ZHU of Censtan Consulting told Agence France -Presse that the ban will particularly impact the companies that provide cloud services or data centers, because the hardware they use requires high -end storage chips. He said [Micron's consumer products can "be replaced by South Korea or domestic storage chips. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美半導體大戰封殺美光韓企得利/a-65705950)Expert Teru also said that the abacus played by Beijing is to turn to South Korean suppliers.

However, last month, [White House required Korean chip manufacturers not to increase exports to China to fill the vacancy caused by the United States](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北京恐禁美光芯片-媒體美籲韓勿填補缺口/a-65414199)Essence

At the request of Washington, the Netherlands and Japan have announced restrictions on chip exports.

The chief economist Gary Ng said: "China has always been very cautious and does not make excessive revenge ... Because Beijing cannot quickly expand its domestic capacity to make up for any lack."

According to the latest news released by Ukrainian officials, the Russian army has temporarily slowed down its crackdown on Bakhmut, Wudongzhong Town, so as to reorganize and enhance combat effectiveness to the troops, saying that counterattack operations or began in "one week".

Reuters reported that the Vice Minister of Wuda's Ministry of Defense, Hannamalia, issued a post on Saturday (May 27) on the instant communication platform Telegram that the Russian army continued to attack, but the overall offensive operation has decreased.

Maria believes that the Russian army's slowdown is to "replace and re -gather troops" to strengthen combat effectiveness.

Russia last Saturday (20th) [announced that it has completely captured Bach Murut](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230521-1396677)，乌克兰则坚称巴赫穆特并未失守，乌军仍在侧翼推进，依然控制着部分地区。

伊拉克以目前速度生产原油，它庞大的石油储备还可再用1个世纪，但随着世界努力摆脱对碳氢化合物的依赖，伊拉克调适的速度一直很慢。

多年来，能源业一直面临减少温室气体排放的呼声，目标是将全球升温幅度控制在摄氏1.5度以内。

七大工业国集团(G7)━英国、加拿大、法国、德国、义大利、日本和美国，今年4月承诺「加速」从化石燃料中「退出」，目标是「最迟」到2050年实现碳中和。

但随着伊拉克从多年严重冲突和政治动荡中恢复，石油销售占伊拉克预算总收入的90%，形成严重的过度依赖问题。

政治学家艾查维(Ammar al-Azzawi)表示，「目前整个伊拉克经济都依赖石油与石油价格」，「如果油价暴跌，我们的经济将走进加护病房。」

艾查维建议的补救措施是在世界转向替代能源之前，发展伊拉克工业、农业和旅游业。

欧盟今年3月已表示2035年将完全禁止销售内燃机引擎新车，届时新车将不允许排放任何二氧化碳。

总部位于纽约的洛克斐勒基金会(Rockefeller Foundation)气候中心主任沙法(Ali al-Saffar)说，全球正努力投入能源转型，但并未达到专家期望的速度和规模。

伊拉克4200万人民长期为干旱还有频繁的沙尘暴所苦，民众已见证这些温室气体排放的结果。

联合国认为伊拉克这个大部分干旱的国家，可说是世界上受气候变迁影响最严重的5个国家之一。

The U.S. Treasury has previously warned that without reaching an agreement, the United States will not be able to pay bills on June 5. If this happens, it will subvert the US economy and severely damage the global market.

With a $ 24 trillion US debt market, it is the world's largest debt market and the main source of financing for the US government. From mortgage interest rates to the world's most powerful US dollar currency, U.S. debt is indispensable for financial entries.

### Preliminary agreement reached

The background of this negotiation is that the United States must borrow money to fund the government at the moment because expenditure exceeds taxes. However, Republicans have been seeking expenditures in the fields of education and other social welfare plans to exchange for the upper limit of national debt of US $ 31.4 trillion (about 25 trillion pounds), which limits how much debt can accumulate the US government.

Republican senior officials said that unless the government reduces expenses in the next few years, they will not increase the upper limit of government bonds, and the Democratic Party has proposed to raise some taxes to respond.

The specific details of the new agreement have not been officially announced. However, according to the BBC understanding, non -national defense expenses will basically remain unchanged within two years. For example, the medical insurance plan "Medicaid" will not have a major budget increase or decrease. However, government plans to provide low -income or non -income citizen food purchase assistance are unclear.

Behind this crisis is a fundamental ideological difference between the two major political parties in the United States.

On Saturday (May 27th) local time on Saturday (May 27th), McCarthy said he and Biden had a phone call twice that day. He said: "After several weeks of negotiations, we reached an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do, but I believe this is a principle agreement that is valuable to the American people."

The problem of debt limit highlighted a fundamental difference between the two major major parties in the United States. The Republican Party is suspicious of government expenditure, because for them, increasing government bonds are a proof of government out of control.

McCarthy also said that it is planned to draft the bill on Sunday (28th) on Sunday (28th), and then vote on parliament on Wednesday. He said he would talk to Biden again later that day. Biden said in a statement: "This agreement represents a compromise, which means that not everyone can get what they want. This is the responsibility of government governance." He also said: "This agreement is right for this agreement. The American people are good news because it prevents the occurrence of catastrophic defaults, avoiding economic recession, severe damage to retirement accounts, and loss of millions of jobs. "

### What is the debt crisis?

Facing the crisis, Biden and McCarthy held a budget negotiation last week. If the U.S. Congress cannot reach an agreement on raising the so -called debt upper limit, the United States may breach contracts on debt issues, causing global financial confusion.

So how does the United States fall into this situation?

The upper limit of debt, also known as debtlimit, is a law that limits the total amount of the US government's borrowing to pay for its expenses. This includes the cost of paying federal employees, military, social security and medical insurance (Medicare), as well as interest and tax refund of taxes and taxes.

The U.S. Congress will vote or suspend debt upper limit every time, so as to further borrow.

The current upper limit is about $ 31.4 trillion. The limit was broken in January this year, but the U.S. Treasury Department adopted a "very means" to provide more cash to the government when determining countermeasures. Under normal circumstances, Congress is just a routine procedure according to financial needs. However, this time the two major parties of Congress seemed to be unable to agree.

US Finance Minister Ye Lun warned that if more money can be borrowed, the United States will not be able to meet all financial obligations before June 1.

### What are the consequences of default debt?

There has never been a debt default in American history, so we cannot fully predict what consequences will be. But it is certain that this will cause major damage to the economy. Because the U.S. government will no longer pay the salary of federal and military personnel, and millions of social security checks that US retirees rely on will stop issuing. Companies and charity relying on government funds will also face danger.

In addition, if the US government stops paying debt interest, this will also cause the country to be in default.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-28T08-37-47.000Z/_129613770_whatsubject.jpg)Image source, getty images

Image adding text,

Some people urged Biden to quote the 14th amendment of the Constitution and bypass Congress.

Moody'sanalytics predicts that if the breach of contract occurs, in the case of long -term stalemate, the US stock price will fall by nearly 5 minutes, and the economy will shrink by more than 4%, resulting in loss of more than 7 million jobs. Essence

In the long run, if investors start to think that US debt has risks, they will ask the United States to pay higher borrowing interest. Due to the influence of government loan activities at the general level of interest rates, this impact will spread to the national economy, which will increase the cost of lending in houses or cars when buying houses or cars.

Indeed, there are still differences between Americans who can pay priority to paying interest to avoid debt defaults. However, in the case of retirees and others failed to get payment, if the government prioritizes the commitment to the US debt holder (including financial institutions, retirement funds, and foreign investors), this is considered to be difficult to politically. Sales for the options that Americans accept.

### President's use of the 14th amendment to the Constitution?

In the absence of an agreement, someone had urged Biden to quote the 14th amendment to the Constitution before, bypassing Congress. The amendment stipulates: "The validity of the public debt of the United States of America ... cannot be questioned."

This clause was passed after the American civil war, which aims to ensure that at that time, the southern slave state in the United States paid the war debt accumulated in the northern state, and ensured that the government did not need to pay compensation to the slave holders and others in the south.

Biden previously said that this clause was considering using this clause. However, many comments say that the use of this clause to challenge the upper limit of debt can almost cause a legal dispute. Moreover, this method is limited in the current crisis.

Ye Lun's previous speech faded down the possibility, and she said that any move trying to quote the clause will trigger a constitutional crisis.

### negotiation plan

In April this year, the Republican Party proposed an agreement to suspend debt limit with a amount of $ 1.5 trillion. As exchanges, they will maintain the expenditure level of key American institutions in the next fiscal year as in 2022, and will be limited to 1 % per year in the next 10 years, which will save $ 4.8 trillion.

However, the Republican Party's proposal will abolish the key priority expenditures in the governance of the Biden government, such as student loans and electric vehicle tax incentives. The White House said that the Republican agreement forced "the burden of tax reduction of the most borne by the middle class and the labor -class family." They believe that the Republican agreement has no chance to be able to legislate.

### How to reach the agreement?

Many analysts predict that "short -term extension" allows Congress to have more time to negotiate to reach an agreement. In 2011, the last time the United States was considered to face the risk of serious breach of contract, the negotiations had been dragged until the last moment, and it was not until a few hours before the deadline that the compromise agreement was reached. The agreement at the time included cutting 900 billion US dollars in expenditure in the next 10 years.

However, even delay can produce negative consequences. In 2011, a similar ride caused US credit rating to reduce, and the stock market plummeted. It is estimated that the public will pay at least $ 1.3 billion in higher loan costs that year alone.

### The ideological differences behind the crisis

In fact, behind this crisis highlighted a fundamental differences between the two major American parties.

The Republican Party is skeptical of the Democratic government's expenditure. For them, increasing government bonds are evidence of government out of control.

Although for the Republican Party, it is relatively new to use the strategy of restricting the upper limit of debt, but many Republicans believe that this is necessary. Because they believe that the current debt handling methods of the United States will eventually lead to the destruction of the US economy and society.

The Democratic Party believes that the government's policy of raising debts is a positive means, which is a policy that improves Americans' lives and corrects historical errors. They believe that it is necessary to increase the debt limit when necessary to maintain government operations.

From the perspective of Democrats, Treasury bonds only provide funds for the legislative plans that have been discussed and approved.

During the presidential period of Trump, the debate on the upper limit of debt has decreased. The US Congress raised the debt limit three times and did not conduct major debate. But after Biden took office, this problem has attracted attention.

U.S. President Biden and the Speaker of the House of Representatives McCarthy have reached a debt limit agreement to end the long -term negotiation deadlock.

Comprehensive US media reported on Sunday (May 28) that the negotiating representatives of the White House and Republicans of the House of Representatives have reached an agreement in principle to avoid debt defaults. It is expected that the relevant agreement text will soon submit the relevant agreement to the National Association to vote.

Before the agreement was reached, Biden and McCarthy held a 90 -minute call meeting on Saturday (27th). Afterwards, McCarthy tweeted: "I just had a phone call with the president not long ago. After a few months of waste of time and refusing to negotiate, we reached an agreement worthy of the trust of the American people in principle."

McCarthy said. "We still have a lot of work tonight." It is expected to formulate legislative texts on Sunday. Congress members will get relevant agreement text on the same day, and the House of Representatives will vote on May 31.

Biden issued a statement saying that this was an important step forward, representing the compromise between the two sides. The negotiation team of the two parties will complete the legislative text discussion on Sunday and submit it to the two houses of the United States Congress.

According to sources, after several weeks of difficult negotiations, the two parties have agreed to suspend the debt limit for two years, and reached a two -year funding agreement that will keep non -defense expenditure at the current level.

The U.S. Treasury has previously warned that if Congress does not increase or suspend the upper limit of debt, the federal government's cash will be exhausted early in early June and trigger debt defaults.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-28T09-32-08-00-00/000000.png)This election has a big relationship with Pedro Sanchez. His "SocialistParty" and the "Podemos" in the "Podemos" are in power to govern Spain's fourth largest economy.

Voters will vote to select the heads of 8,131 towns across the country. At the same time, they will also select leaders and parliaments in 12 regions in 17 regions in Spain, of which 10 are currently in charge of the Social Labor Party.

The voting starts at 9 am and ends at 8 pm. About 35.5 million voters are qualified to vote in local elections, and 18.3 million voters are qualified to vote in regional elections.

Spain will not release export polls, and the preliminary voting results will be announced around 10 pm.

Global Political Risk Consultation Organization Eurasia Group Analyst Federicosanti said this week that if the left votes are "beyond expectations and try to maintain control of most regional governments. This will indicate the competition of the national elections in the country. It will be very fierce and indicate that the left school will have the opportunity to continue governing. "

Santy said that if the polls that will be turned to the right during the prediction election are correct, then the regional level victory will be the leader of the opposition party of the Right Popular Party, Albertonunez Feijoo, to win the need for the end of the election at the end of the year.

It can be seen from today's elections that Sanjes, the main government since 2018, has been in several disadvantages.

He faces voters tired of his left government and has soared in inflation -although the inflation rate in Spain is lower than other EU countries -and the decline in purchasing power caused by it.

The repeated crisis shakes his left -handed alliance, and he has always been difficult to curb the impact of these crises. (Translator: Lin Yifeng/Calculating Draft: Lin Zhiping)

In 2021, the Hong Kong authorities banned the June 4th Memorial Party again. After the Hong Kong National Security Law came into effect a year ago, the space and free space for Hong Kong society were further squeezed. At the same time, Macau's folk June 4th commemorative activities have been banned for the second consecutive year.
###  Real comedy will make the authoritarian restless

The online media headquartered in Washington, USA, published a article "CHINACHANGE" published an article "Beyond Joke", sorting out the rise and development of Chinese comedy group "Smile Culture". Author Cao Yaxue said that there is no greasy, false, and charming state of the young Chinese talk show actor. They are sincere and natural, exuding a fresh temperament that the previous two generations of Chinese people are unable to see. "Although they said a very unwilling talk show, I concluded that they were free people."

The author said that while watching their comedy, they have begun to worry about them: "If these young comedians and their audience are normal in my eyes, then in the eyes of the examiner, they must be foreign bodies. Everyone knows Real comedy will disturb the authoritarian. "

The author believes that even if [talk show industry](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/管住嘴或邁開腿言論審查下的中國脫口秀/a-65739237)Be careful to avoid all "sensitive" topics, and the CCP will not allow talk shows to grow up in China, because the CCP knows that in the cultural market, including ideas and entertainment, party culture has no competitiveness and cannot obtain young people's hearts. ; And a show that is away from the party's control and does not conquer virtues for the purpose of singing. Even if it is only popular entertainment, it is a threat and offending the party in itself.

### Can the Chinese Chinese move to move to the country of "good years"?

Singapore's "Duan Media" published an article "China intervene in Canadian election controversy, and what is the more important problem behind it? ", The author pointed out that WeChat reviews the content on the platform under the requirements of the Internet Information Office and other Chinese government departments. The pressure on the review will also compress the local Chinese media and creators in Canada. The Canadian political party's intention to obtain voters of Chinese voters in the short term may lead to [the incident of intervention elections has continued to deteriorate](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/加拿大中國試圖干涉選舉但不需公開再查/a-65714765)Essence Regardless of the cyber violence of Chinese students at the University of Toronto in the early years, or a Chinese student at the University of McMatt's Chinese students monitoring and harassing the Viva's speeches for Chinese diplomats at the University of McMaster, none of them received the attention of first -level politicians or officials from the federal. In the near future, Canada has also reported that the overseas police station in China has also appeared. Compared with the direct arrest of related affiliates in the United States, Canada has a lot of low -key processing. To arrest or prosecute.

The article said that for more new and old immigrants, office workers, and small business owners, maybe their living goals in Canada and even North America are not politically related, and they do not mean that they must be sympathized with the Chinese Communist Party. ", Also does not mean that their ultimate goal of life is to overthrow the rule of the Communist Party. For most people who abandon the connections and resources owned by the native country and come to the new environment to start again, those grand goals are too far away from their lives. But on the other hand, for ordinary people, the cost of maintaining silence is increasing. Regardless of whether people are interested in Canada's political politics, their lives will have to be involved in future political issues.

Agence France -Presse reported that Spanish voters will be selected as mayor among 8131 cities across the country at 9 am (Singapore time at 3 pm), and will also select 12 regional leaders and members of the 17 regions in Spain. 10 of them are currently governed by the Spanish Workers Socialist Party led by Sanchez. The Socialist Party and the extremely left -wing party "we can" jointly governs.

The voting will end at 8 pm on the same day. It is expected that 35.5 million qualified voters will participate in local elections, and 18.3 million voters will vote in the area.

The analysis believes that the left camp represented by Santis may not be able to retain most of the control in regional elections.

Eurasia Group analyst Federicosanti said that if the left can "exceed expectations and try to retain control of most regional governments ... indicate that the next national election will have a fierce battle, the left camp or It is expected to continue governing. "

However, based on the analysis of the results of the polls earlier, Santy said that if the polls to the right to the right are correct, then the party leader Albertonunez Feijoo will win the year -end election. "Power".

The analysis believes that Sanchez, 51, is facing several unfavorable factors, including comprehensive crisis such as voters' fatigue and soaring inflation to the left -wing government. Although Spain's inflation rate is lower than other EU countries, the purchasing power of the people has declined significantly.

Sanchez recently emphasized the political achievements of the ruling party in supporting the economy, fighting drought and management of water resources. He said: "Social democratic policy is more suitable for Spain than new liberal policies, because we are much better for economic management."

Sanchez has been the Spanish Prime Minister in June 2018 and successfully re -elected in January 2020.

American researchers have designed new nano robots that can efficiently kill common fungal disease primary in 10 minutes to help human treatment of fungal infection.

Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday (May 28) that the University of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania recently issued a newsletter that researchers designed a nano robot made from iron oxide nanozymes that can achieve fast and precisely kill Candidaalbicans. Effect.

It is understood that some nanomaterials have antifungal effects, but the efficiency and accuracy of related technologies are insufficient. Therefore, the effect of controlling the infection is not satisfactory, and it can easily lead to a drug resistance.

However, this new study published in the German "Advanced Materials" magazine has successfully overcome the shortcomings. Researchers found after testing with cell balls and animal tissue samples that nano -robots can remove white Candida at the infected area within ten minutes. This nano robot can accurately reach the specified position under the control of magnetic field control.

Nanozymes are nano particles that have catalytic effects like biological enzymes. The properties of specific iron oxide nanozymes are similar to that of common peroxidases in the organism. Active oxygen that can kill fungi.

Studies have found that the shape and motion mode of nano robots accurately control the programmatic algorithm can control the level of active oxygen. This iron oxide nanocyrase is particularly strong to fungal cells, which can be firmly combined with fungal and concentratedly killed without affecting parts without infection.

The problem of fungal infection is becoming more and more common globally, and only some drugs on the market are facing a threat of drug resistance.

According to a report issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022, Candida is one of the four primordies that threaten human health.

Hadi Awang, chairman of the Malaysian opposition party, claimed that someone had demanded to meet him many times and suggested that the Iraqi Party joined the united government led by Prime Minister Anwar. Hadi Awang shows that the Iraqi Party is the largest party of Congress. Once joined the unity government, the new government must be led by the Iraqi Party.

On May 14th, after the Democratic Action Party's veteran suggested that the government invited the Iraqi Party to join, Malaysia politics reported many times that the unity government exposed the Iraqi Party. However, the Iraqi Party has always been reluctant to confirm the matter. This time is Hadi Awang's first discussion on this.

According to the Malaysia Media Sunday (May 28), Hadi Awang attended a press conference after the promotion ceremony of the "Prophet Muhammad Foot Track" at the Gelang Lumpur World Trade Center (WTC) on Saturday (27th). Unity of the government's position.

Hadi Awang said: "Someone contacted me many times, invited me to meet, and suggested that the Iraqi party join the unity government." He said that the unity government invited the Iraqi Party to join because the Pakatan Harapan, especially the Justice Party, knew that his status was unstable. After all, the Malay constituency won by the Justice Party is not as many as the Iraqi Party.

He believes that once the Iraqi Party joins the unity government, the Iraqi Party must lead the government. "Because the number of members of the Iraqi Party is the largest, there are 43 people, all of which are Malaysians." He said that among the 31 members of the Justice Party, there are 19 Malay people and 40 members of the Democratic Action Party. There are only three Malay people. "The current government is dominated by non -Malay people."

"The Iraqi Party was invited to join, but only asked the Iraqi Party to sit in the back seat of (the parliament hall of the House of Representatives) instead of the front seat. When organizing the government, it should be led by the largest (party)."

Hadi Awang did not disclose the identity and time of inviting him to the meeting. He said that the Iraqi Party is currently open to all the recommendations of joining, but these suggestions cannot leave the principles, goals and directions of the Iraqi Party.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) For North Koreans, the country's twists and turns northern borders are a rare channel for obtaining external information, and it is also the best choice for seeking escape.

However, at the same time that the new crown epidemic in 2020 swept the world, the North Korean regime led by Kim Jong -un has a large -scale project to block the large -scale border between the country and China and Russia, cutting off the smugglers and the [North North].(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/韩国梦破灭新年越境脱北者在韩离群索居/a-60326482)The channel.

According to a survey report released by Reuters, commercial satellite images show that the Pyongyang government has built or renovated the boundary fences, fences and posts with a total length of hundreds of kilometers in the epidemic for several years, so that it can strengthen the information and materials flowing into North Korea for information and supplies. Control to prevent the people from the country from running out.

Reuters and Middlebury Institute of International Studies Atmonterey (Middlebury Institute of International Studies Atmos) obtained the above conclusions by the oral analysis of satellite image analysis, as well as seven northern people, activists, and other insiders.

According to official statistics from South Korea, only 67 people from North North in 2022 successfully entered South Korea, which was significantly reduced compared with the 1047 people in 2019. As China has strengthened border control, this number has actually declined before the outbreak. For those who are from the North, taking Tao China is their preferred path.

For the construction of a reinforcement border, the North Korean government and official media have rarely mentioned it, and the North Korean Embassy in London did not answer the inquiry call from Reuters reporters. However, in the speech of "defeating the new crown virus" last year, Kim Jong -un has instructed officials to "ensure the improvement of the comprehensive multiple blocking walls of the border, front lines and coastal areas and sea airspace.

### Cutting off the "Life Line"

The School of Research, Reuters and Monterem University of Monte University, analyzed the northern North Korean border satellite image taken from different stages of Google EarthPro from 2019 to early 2023.

Due to restrictions on images, geographical characteristics, and weather conditions, analysts cannot comprehensively review the 1,400 kilometers boundary between North Korea and China and the 18 -kilometer boundary between Russia, including the border status of about 353 kilometers.

DaveSchmerler, assistant researcher at the Montere International Research Institute of Monterem University, said that it can be seen on the border line of at least 489 kilometers. Concrete walls and additional guards. Some other areas can also see some changes, but due to the limitations of images cannot make a conclusion judgment.

The researchers pointed out that most of these additional border protection facilities are located in the residential area that lacks natural barriers (such as high mountains). In addition, the border fences are also added near the flat farmland along the River River.

Sources who are from the North, human rights activities, and sources involved in cargo smuggling or personnel in China said that these new security facilities cut off the economic lifeline of those vulnerable groups, closed their channels to escape from this autocracy, and further further It is limited to the way North Koreans get external information.

A northern person who worked at the border between China and North Korea told Reuters that North Korea installed a camera every other distance on the border line, adding a multi -layer fence, including the stabbing wire mesh and electronic fence. His description and the photos and videos he shot from the side of China are in line with the features identified by analysts from the satellite images.

The northern person said that sometimes some smuggers can leave North Korea, but they can hardly go back, causing many people to stay in China. He also added that the North Korean side has deployed additional special border guards to strengthen its alert.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not understand the relevant situation in a statement in Reuters, but emphasized that "China and North Korea have always maintained communication and strive to maintain border security and stability together."

According to a warning notice issued by the Chinese government in 2020 to the border residents, North Korea ordered the border guards to shoot at trying to cross the border personnel. South Korean pastors and human rights organizations interviewed by Reuters both said that the order is still valid.

### Huawei dispute

In the US -China trade conflict, China Telecom giant Huawei has become one of the focus of controversy. In August 2018, Trump signed a bill to ban any US government departments from using products from Huawei and ZTE, including network equipment. Under the urging of the United States, many countries around the world have decided to exclude Huawei outside the construction of 5G networks. In May 2019, the US Department of Commerce included Huawei and 70 affiliated companies in the "entity list" to prohibit American companies from selling components from Huawei. Subsequently, Google began to restrict the use of Android systems and related applications in Huawei mobile phones. The Meng Wanzhou incident, which has continued to the end of 2018, is also considered a microcosm of the United States punishment to suppress Huawei.

According to data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), as many as 828 million people (10%of the world's population) go to bed hungry every night, 46 million more than the previous year.

Among those who are hungry, two -thirds are women, and 80%of people live in areas that are affected by climate change.

In order to raise people's awareness of global hunger, non -profit organization The HUNGER Project will designate May 28 as the World Hunger Day.

Among those who are hungry, two -thirds are women, and 80%of people live in areas that are affected by climate change.(Peninsula TV Station)Hunger is a weak state. This happens when the body lacks food for a long time.

Long -term hunger can lead to health problems, and may cause lifelong body and cognitive damage, especially for children.

Nutrition, that is, does not reach calorie intake, indicating the lack of energy and protein, as well as important vitamins and minerals.

After ten years of continued decrease, the global hunger population has risen in recent years. From 2019 to 2021, the number of malnutrition increased by more than 150 million, mainly caused by conflict, climate change, economic impact, and new crown epidemic.

The cost of food has also increased. From 2019 to 2022, the Food Price Index (FPI) of the Food and Agriculture Organization, which measures the global price change of food, including sugar, meat, grains, dairy products and vegetable oils, rose from 95.1 to 143.7.

Monica Totova, an economist at the Food Organization Trade and Marketing Division, pointed out that "even if the price of global food goods has risen, due to different policies in various countries, the growth of the national level is different."

"For example, many countries implement consumer subsidies for selected products, fixed prices for consumers and protected them from the influence of global market fluctuations, that is, at the expense of national budget."

The latest UN World Grain Safety and Nutrition (SOFI) report found that most of the world's malnutrition people live in Asia. In 2021, about 425 million people were hungry. However, hunger has the highest incidence in Africa, and 278 million people were affected that year.

According to the 2023 version of the "Global Food Crisis Report", in 2022, the number of people who experienced serious food shortage increased for the fourth consecutive year. Among the danger of urgency, a total of 258 million people were facing serious hunger.

Totova said, "In several major food crises, the economic impact has exceeded the conflict, which has become the main driving factor of severe unsafe food and malnutrition."

"Cumulative global economic shocks, including soaring food prices and severe damage to the market, weaken the recovery and ability of countries to respond to food prices."

In 2022, war between Russia and Ukraine, the world's two largest major grains, oil seeds and fertilizers, caused a serious interruption of international supply chain and pushed the prices of grain, fertilizer and energy. This has led to the global food price index (FPI) reached its highest level in 2022.

The prediction of global hunger future prospects show that hunger will continue to exist, and extreme weather incidents will have a more destructive impact.

Reuters reported that in order to settle the tide of nurses, the British authorities have proposed the next fiscal year to increase the salary of the nurse by the fiscal year and issue a one -time bonus equivalent to a 2%salary for everyone. However, the nurse of RCN, the largest nurses in the United Kingdom, rejected the salary increase plan and announced immediately to upgrade the strike.

In terms of RCN, the government must "fairly" pay the salary of the staff of the National Medical Service (NHS) staff (NHS); if the union nurse cannot reach an agreement with the government with the government, it will plan to strike to Christmas.

When asked if he would restore negotiations with the trade union, Minister of Health Barkley told British Sky News that "will not be negotiated with the union for salary."
