Ke Wenzhe (left)

** More than half a year before the Taiwan 2024 presidential election, a poll released by Taiwan TV TVBS last week showed that it had represented the presidential candidate of Taiwan's third largest party and former Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe's support accident. Leading, and on behalf of the Kuomintang, the mayor of New Taipei, Hou Youyi, fell third, causing heated discussions in Taiwan. **

Although the polls of other institutions later said that Lai Qingde, who represented the DPP, returned to the first place, Ke Wenzhe's rising momentum has triggered the anxiety of the Kuomintang supporters and the DPP's tension.

In addition, Ke Wenzhe recently threw the issue of the service trade agreement that caused Taiwan's "Sunflower Movement" nine years ago, and once again caused a debate. When Ke Wenzhe was in the political circle of the political circle, he was surrounded by the generation of outsiders in the political circle. Now he said that if he was elected president, he would negotiate a trade agreement with Beijing.

The "Sun Flower Study Games" broke out in Taiwan in 2014. At that time, Ke Wenzhe was surrounded by the rise of the political circle of outsiders and was surrounded by the Sunflower Movement for generations.

LEVNACHMAN, assistant professor of the Asia -Pacific Research University of Taiwan Politburo, analyzed the BBC Chinese analysis. Although the outside world believes that most of the supporters of Ke Wenzhe are young people, Ke Wenzhe is also eating the Kuomintang ticket, and the latter supporters are mainly middle -aged and older. How many Kuomintang votes can be taken away by Ke Wenzhe are the focus of observation now.

Zhang Junhao, a professor at the Department of Political Department of Donghai University, analyzed that the support of each candidate at this stage is mainly "negative voting". With less support, the popularity is rising. However, he emphasized to the BBC in Chinese that Ke Wenzhe's amazing political style may lead to the anti -spokes of his speech during the election, that is, Taiwan, commonly known as "back darts". He said that, for example, Ke Wenzhe's position on the service trade agreement has changed, as well as previous speeches and criticizing "there are too many (some schools) sciences and some students taught without that value", they may create a political crisis for themselves.

###

According to the highlight of the TVBS poll center on June 16, Ke Wenzhe's support was 33%, from the original third place to the leader. After Lai Qingde settled at 30%support, Hou Youyi's support was only 23%. On June 20, the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation announced the June poll in June. Lai Qingde's support was 36.5%, followed by Ke Wenzhe 29.1%, Hou Youyi ranked 3rd in 20.4%. Compared with the polls published in May, Ke Wenzhe rose 4%overtaking Hou Youyi The latter fell 7.2%.

Ke Wenzhe's young people in the current polls are the leading support.

It is worth noting that at present, it seems that Ke Wenzhe's support in the young ethnic group has won Lai Qingde and Hou Youyi. The above-mentioned polls of TVBS show that Ke Wenzhe's support at the age of 20-29, 30-39 has 58%and 55%, while Lai Qingde is 17%and 18%, and Hou Youyi is 12%. At the end of June, the polls of the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that Ke Wenzhe's support at the age of 20-24 was as high as 67%, and 40%of the ages of 25-34 were supported.

The latest polls of another public opinion agency "Beautiful Island Electronics News" also supported 40 % of the support in 20-29 and 30-39 years old. This shows the absolute advantage of Ke Wenzhe on young people's votes.

Nine years later, he seemed to be supported by the young Taiwanese voters in the next generation.

For example, after the well -known player in Taiwan's e -sports, "Asian Tongshen" stated that he wanted to support Ke Wenzhe, the local well -known game active game "Dingte" also broadcast publicly to support Ke Wenzhe a few days ago. He criticized, "How many times the blue and green have been changed, which time is not a political party tied the consortium?" He also said that "let the people who really have the ideal ideal, do not have to be limited by the consortium, dirty things."

The publication of Shan Houzhi, a senior political commentator in Taiwan, believes that in the era of fragmented social media, Ke Wenzhe's style is particularly easy to please middle voters and young ethnic groups. He said that Ke Wenzhe had long understood that young voters were his main support group. In just eight years in politics, Ke Wenzhe not only actively participated in lectures on colleges and universities, but also often had dialogue with high school students. During this time, he trained good skills to talk to young people.

For example, Ke Wenzhe served as the mayor of Taipei. In order to launch a new machine to test a body temperature in order to implement the epidemic prevention, it spent more than 10 million yuan for NT $. Shan Houzhi said, "He not only does not want to admit that there is a lack of governance, but also tries to provoke the opposition between generations and highlight that he will offend the elderly at the expense to maintain fairness."

Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tatk University in the United States, analyzed that the young people's understanding or interest in politics was basically weak. However, he said that this is not only in Taiwan, but also a common phenomenon around the world. Therefore, the evaluation method of politicians is often based on "feeling". This is why Ke Wenzhe attracts Taiwanese young people and scientific and technological talents.Ye Yaoyuan [Represents](https://www.facebook.com/profyehinternationalaffairs/posts/pfbid02tgfWKLSoxhaBZ35vDXWu7ndtYynZk6k2t9JvfYA7uC3GFQJCX9UKzWhZN47xbCpUl)Young people believe that Ke Wenzhe broke the traditional political framework, but the essence of politics is "compromise and distribution."

In addition, Brianhiou, a guest researcher at the Taiwan University of Nottingham, explained to BBC that populism is Ke Wenzhe's political style. Police polical satisfaction is at the bottom of the year, but it still enjoys high popularity.

Image adding text,

The third forces led by Ke Wenzhe, the People's Party, uses the slogan "Breaking the Blue and Green Monopoly" and "Breaking the ideology" as the slogan, hoping to attract the support of middle voters and young voters (the picture shows Ke Wenzhe's information).

For example, in the past few days, Ke Wenzhe criticized the Democratic Progressive Party with "letting a dog bite". He also used "dogs" to blame the party workers. When he visited Japan in May this year, he responded to the critical criticism of Bonnieglasser, a key think tank scholar across the United States across the sea across the sea. ? "

After returning to Taipei from Tokyo, he shouted to the US -Taiwan Association (AIT) chairman Laurarosenberger, "She wants to see me, ask her to move to Kaohsiung." "It states," Emphasis of male and young women is the instinct of creature. When a profession is rising, it means that the industry is not falling. "

Analysis of Ke Wenzhe's phenomenon, Nanle told BBC that in addition to young ethnic groups as the main supporters of Ke Wenzhe, there is actually a "anti -anti -voting" that is dissatisfied with the Blue and Green Party (which means voting that is unhappy or hateful). But Nanle believes, "But the variables of the election are still very large now. Each candidate began to fall down or climb up. It depends on how the election strategy is wrong." Love brings challenges.

### Return to the service trade agreement to recruit the "Sun Flower Generation" rebound

Ke Wenzhe said last week that if he was elected, he would consider restarting the service trade agreement that caused a political storm in Taiwan's society nine years ago, and his move accidentally encountered a political crisis. Some comments believe that young people in Taiwan in their 30s, that is, the young generation of the Sun Flower Movement, began to rebound on Ke Wenzhe's re -service trade proposition.

The so -called "service trade agreement" refers to the follow -up agreement of the "Cross -Strait Economic Cooperation Architecture Agreement" signed by Taipei and Beijing in June 2010 (ECFA). At that time, many young people in Taiwan protested that the Kuomintang tried to forcibly pass the service trade agreement and believed that the service trade would bring a major negative impact on Taiwan society. Therefore, the Taiwan Legislative Yuan was occupied and shocked Taiwan society. "Huang Guochang and other emerging politicians entered politics.

The rise of the Sunflower Movement also promoted Ke Wenzhe. Emerging politicians such as "Sun Flower War" and Huang Guochang entered politics.

Ke Wenzhe, who is now rushing to the presidential position, acknowledged in an interview with the Taiwan media on June 26 that if he was elected, he would first launch the "Regulations on the Supervision of the Cross -Strait Agreement", then conduct a "trade negotiation", and then handle the "service trade negotiation". Essence He said that if he was elected, he would definitely move in this direction. Huang Guochang, a former legislator of the Taiwan "Time Power" party, which interacts frequently with Ke Wenzhe, did not refute the "anti -black box, not anti -trade" for Ke Wenzhe. clear."

Ke Wenzhe pointed out that if mainland China is an important economic object to Taiwan, it is necessary to deal with this issue with a pragmatic attitude. He also said that the Blue and Green camps criticized him, which showed that he did something right in some aspects.

Image adding text,

When he was elected Mayor of Taipei in 2014, Ke Wenzhe was supported by the young ethnic group of the Sun Flower Movement. His recent remarks on restarting service trade negotiations may affect his support in this group.

Du Zhenhua, a retired professor at the National Fa Institute of Taiwan University, told the media that if the signing trade between the two sides of the strait is much better for Taiwan. Many controlling service industries can open each other, "you can earn high salary and high profit." He believes that the level of service industry in Taiwan is higher than the mainland, and there is no need to be afraid of opening up.

However, critics believe that in the moment when the US -China trade war has begun, Taiwan semiconductor industry is rising, Taiwanese businessmen return, and the disagreement between cross -strait relations, whether Taiwan society is preparing to accept the mainland service industry and telecommunications industry and publishing industry, including talents to enter Taiwan. Still a question mark.

There are also critics' commitments to "goods out, people coming in, and Taiwan's big fortune" proposed by service trade supporters. They have no confidence. Instead, "if the monthly salary of 9,000 (Taiwan dollars) comes to Taiwan, you really think you can be able to be you. Do you do a high salary? "

### Kuomintang's blood loss

Regardless of the position, many data show that Ke Wenzhe's polls overtaking Hou Youyi are a trend. But for half a year before the election vote, various issues will affect the support rate of candidates.

Image adding text,

Ke Wenzhe's people's party is considered a "light blue" party, but he also seems to have attracted the traditionally not the Kuomintang's voters.

Analyzing the latest two -month polls of major institutions and media in Taiwan, and a scholar Kagawa Hoshi, a scholar of the Japanese University of Foreign Languages, who had accurately predicted the results of the chief elections last year, pointed out that Taiwan's politics and media will be affected by the polls. It is inevitable, but the support intention of voters has not really stabilized, and it is normal for poll data to fluctuate.

Professor Ogasawara, who studied Taiwan for decades, said that the current characteristics of three parties candidates are: Lai Qingde is stable, Ke Wenzhe rises, and Hou Youyi fights hard. However, he analyzed that in the early June polls, the interviewees targeting who selected, and the proportion of "no opinion / decision" began to decrease, that is, the climbing of voters' "expressive rates" is particularly worthy of attention.Qiu Qixin told the BBC Chinese that the Taiwan presidential election shows a pattern of different local elections. For example, Hou Youyi has performed well in local politics and is very popular, but his performance on the stage of the presidential election is not good. In contrast, although Ke Wenzhe may be regarded as a poor grade to govern Taipei, "but Ke's political image may attract voters in the presidential election, because they want to choose a candidate with a strong and distinctive personality- Hou has no such personality, but Ke has it. "

Qiu Qixin explained that Hou Youyi did not have a strong political style as Ke Wenzhe's civilian style, so it was more difficult to attract hesitant middle voters. In addition, even if Ke Wenzhe's people's party is considered a "light blue" party, he seems to have attracted not traditionally a voter who is not a Kuomintang supporter. This also explains why Hou Youyi lost blood from the other side.

Peninsula TV reported on Tuesday (June 27) that when Fu Cong, the head of the Chinese envoy of the Chinese EU, was asked by reporters whether to support the Kiev authorities, including recovering the area occupied by Russia, Fu Cong said, "I don't think What's wrong? "

** It is reported that the Chinese ambassador to the European Union Fu Cong said that Beijing "does not oppose" Ukraine's goal of recovering all territories determined in 1991. After the Crimea Peninsula, which was annestyed in 2014, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Beijing hopes that the Crimean problem can be solved through "political channels". **

Peninsula TV reported on Tuesday (June 27) that when Fu Cong, the head of the Chinese envoy of the Chinese EU, was asked by reporters whether to support the Kiev authorities, including recovering the area occupied by Russia, Fu Cong said, "I don't think What's wrong? "

Fu Cong said: "We respect the territorial integrity of all countries. Therefore, when China and the former Soviet Union built diplomatic relations, we also advocated it."

"But as I said, these are historical issues that must be resolved by Russia and Ukraine through negotiations, which is our position." He added.

This statement has attracted attention, and senior Chinese officials generally do not make clear comments on Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday (June 28): "I don't understand the specific statement of Ambassador Fu Cong."

However, she said that in the Ukrainian crisis, "the Chinese position is consistent and very clear, and we hope that the Crimean problem can be solved through political channels."

In 1991, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and Ukraine held an independent referendum and announced its independence. The territorial scope of Ukraine at the time included the Crimean Peninsula, but Russia was annexed in 2014. Moscow also supported Donetsk and Lugusk in eastern Ukraine to establish the "Republic".

Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war, China has not condemned Russia's invasion.

In October last year, the United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution of the number of votes in favor of the 143 countries, the opposition of the five countries, and the abstain from the 35 countries, condemning Russia to hold its so -called referendum within the international recognized Ukraine border, trying to illegally annex some Ukrainian territory, and China voted for abstaining votes.

According to reports, Fu Cong delivered the above remarks after the 2023 EU China Chamber of Commerce Summit in the 2023 EU China Chamber of Commerce on June 16.

On Weibo, Fu Cong's statement caused discussion among netizens. Some netizens commented: "Is the wind direction going?"

Some Weibo netizens said: "For a year, Putin has no progress on the battlefield, and it should have been cut long ago."

Zhuang Jiaying, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science of the National University of Singapore, told BBC that this may be different views expressed by different Chinese officials, but in view of the uncertainty of the situation in Russia, this may also be a "test balloon".

"This remark from a ambassador -level person means that it will get attention, but it is still a low -level position for Beijing, and it can seem to be reasonably pushed." He said.

This is not the first time that Fu Cong has made a statement on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fu Cong said in an exclusive interview with the New York Times in April this year that China did not recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory, including the annexation of Crimea and Donbas.

He said that China did not stand on Russia in the war. The reason why did not condemn Russia's invasion because China could understand Russia's claim on defense of NATO invasion.

Fu Cong also diluted Russia and China announced the "unlimited" diplomatic relations, saying that "'unlimited limit' is just a rhetoric."

The Chinese ambassador to France, Lu Shayan, often made controversial remarks. Earlier, it was said that Meng Wanzhou was arrested because of "white superiority" and abusing the famous French scholars as "little hooligan". "wait.

This is compared with the remarks of his peer and Chinese ambassador to France, Lu Shaye. In April of this year, Lusha was asked in a TV show whether Crimea belonged to Ukraine. Lushae claimed that this depends on how to look at the question and mentioned that Crimea belonged to Russia at the beginning, and later Nikitakhrushchev, the first secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, gave Ukraine.

The host reminded that according to international law, Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Lu Shaye said, "From the perspective of international law, it can even be said that those former Soviet countries have no effective international law status because there is no international agreement to determine their status as a sovereign state."

The Chinese Embassy in France later issued a statement saying that Lushaye's remarks were "not a policy declaration, but an expression of personal views in TV debate", "should not be over -interpreted", and the full text of the interview issued earlier issued by the shelves. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China also "extinguished the fire": China's position is "unchanged."

Zhuang Jiaying said that even if different Chinese diplomats have some "deviating routes", Beijing usually emphasizes that their positions are "not changed" in their official speeches.

"(This) can leave their positions to be controlled and coherent, or the impression of the incident is expected, even if the incident or behavior is different from the past model," he said.

Experts are concerned that the situation of foreign corporate situations may be more difficult. The picture shows Beijing Tiananmen Square. (Data photo)

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Congress passed the "Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China" on Wednesday (June 28), stipulating that foreign countries have harm to Chinese sovereignty, security, development benefits, and violations of international law. Agreement to counterfeit](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国智库新研究中国正学习使用制裁工具/a-65861451)And restricted measures.

The Foreign Relations Law will be implemented from July 1. The Chinese official media "Global Times" quoted Huang Huikang, a member of the United Nations International Law Commissioner and a Chinese legal scholar, stated that this law stipulates the purpose, conditions, and policy orientation of Chinese law in foreign relations. The principle of adopting countermeasures and restrictions is a milestone in China's foreign relations legislation.

"Nanhua Morning Post" reported that the "Foreign Relations Law" of Bao Shanbaohai pays special attention to national security and fights the so -called "American long -arm jurisdiction". Stimulating behavior.

George Magnus, a researcher at the University of Oxford, told the South China Morning Post that the outside world may regard this method as part of China's aggressive diplomacy, thereby expanding [Trust deficit between Beijing and Western countries](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/西方制裁失效中国监控技术版图持续扩张/a-65245519); Henrygao, a law professor at Singapore Management University, also said that the Communist Party has further concentrated power in the name of national security and this law, which further increases "the uncertainty of the Chinese business environment, because the Chinese Communist Party may take action based , Rather than consider it in accordance with the law. "

### Foreign -related policy strengthened and implemented "Xi Thought"

Wang Yi, director of the CPC Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said on the 29th signature article in the People's Daily that the formulation of the "Foreign Relations Law" is a key measure to improve China's foreign rule -related system, and provides "strong legal guarantees for diplomacy with large Chinese characteristics." Wang Yi emphasized that during the current period of strategic opportunities and risk challenges in China, it is necessary to "continuously enrich and improve the legal" toolbox "of struggle.

The Global Times also pointed out that the law can "prevent, warn and deterrent the Western hegemony," and quoted experts saying that this law provides a rule of law weapon against unilateral dominance and abuse of "long -arm jurisdiction".

Gao Shuchao told the South China Morning Post that compared(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国出台反制裁法-在华外企考虑双循环/a-57980466)The "Foreign Relations Law" is more extensive and comprehensive; the "Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law" only pays attention to the legal retaliation measures for foreign sanctions such as refusing visas and frozen personal assets. One of the tools of foreign interference and long -arms jurisdiction.

Wang Jiangyu, a professor at the School of Law of the City University of Hong Kong, said that the "Foreign Relations Law" will act as the "protective umbrella law", from various aspects of standardization, summarizing China's foreign policy and behavior, and providing legal tools for "responding to external challenges".

Bloomberg pointed out that in fact, China has already had a record of retaliatory sanctions, such as [US companies selling weapons selling weapons in Taiwan](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国制裁参与对台军售的美国两大军火商/a-64724514)Essence The establishment of the new law provides additional legal support for such measures and reflects Xi Jinping's personal control of Chinese foreign policy.

Suisheng Zhao, a professor at the School of International Research, Denver University, believes that the new law does not seem to provide new anti -sanctions tools for Beijing, which only repeatedly repeated the Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law.

Zhao Suisheng analyzed that the "Global Security Initiative" and "Global Civilization Initiative" such as the "Foreign Relations Law" and other iconic policies made this document "more like Xi Jinping's foreign policy declaration and illegal laws." He commented: "This is through legal procedures to personalize Chinese foreign policy."

"Hands are used to hold the hands of others and embrace others, but when you encounter a challenge, you must quickly hold your hand into a fist." "China has a free legal hand" and said that this law "will definitely increase the price of the United States and allies infringe on China."

Many Weibo netizens agreed with Hu Xijin's view that "this is also a weapon for China to deal with the future struggle situation." And introduced this method "to make people have the law to rely on, and compare with the US emperor."

However, some netizens have expressed different views. Some messages said that the more fierce anti -the United States, the more fierce the United States, "explains that domestic contradictions are getting deeper and deeper", and "the country should face up to domestic contradictions and solve it down -to -earth." Another message stated that no matter what law was promulgated, "in the end, it still depends on the old method of reform."

What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Today, talk about the latest progress of the situation in the Taiwan Strait. As the world's attention was concentrated at the dramatic results of the Wagner Group mutiny, the restless situation of the Taiwan Strait began to rise. ** approaching the adjacent area ** On June 24th, the PLA-10 fighter aircraft crossed the middle line of the Strait and arrived at the 24th neighboring area of Taiwan (known as the Diandian District). In addition, five warships cooperated with the joint combination of the combination of the combination of the combined police patrol. Many media reports in Taiwan stated that two of the secondary fighters were near the Penghu Islands 24 neighboring area. In an interview, Zhang Yanting, deputy commander of Taiwan ’s Air Force, pointed out that the Penghu Islands are strategic domains (defense or military strategic bases that must control and ensure the area and water areas where tactical points are located). The "Tianju Army" is deployed here. The Chinese military plane comes here to find a break in the airspace around Taiwan. The neighboring area of the 24th 线 west of Taiwan's Linghai Line is Taiwan's training airspace. Chinese fighters approaching this, showing that Taiwan's training airspace is being compressed. Zhang Yanting believes that in the future, China's battle opportunities will gradually approach Taiwan's 12th airspace. At present, there are human -machine testing first, and then various types of drone invasion and interactive use will be dispatched. Now it is tentative, and it will be normal in the future, and then become comprehensive; except for Penghu, the Huadong area of Taipei and the east coast of Taiwan will face the threat of this gray area. Taiwan Defense Minister Qiu Guozheng pointed out in the Legislative Yuan in March this year that in August last year, Nancy President NancyPelosi visited Taiwan. The Chinese warship was approaching Taiwan's Linghai Kili Line and a 24 neighbor area. He judged that he would get closer this year, and even broke into the territorial waters that were approached to 12 浬. It seems that the situation is developing in this direction. At present, the way of Taiwan's corresponding offices is to use military aircraft and warships that use interception missions, as well as the shore -setting missile system to implement monitoring. Keep high restraint and do not initiate the "first blow" to avoid rising things. What should I do if the opposite shore must be in? The bottom line of Taiwan is to defend the 12 浬 台湾 台湾 and its airspace. After the warning is invalid, Taiwan will exercise any aircraft and HNA entity invaded in China "self -defense counterattack". However, this is already a decision. In August last year, the PLA comprehensively broke the central line of the Strait. Today, Taiwan's training airspace line is also facing huge challenges. If you cannot keep the neighboring area, Taiwan ’s coastal defense and air defense will be reduced to the 12 -collar sea line. The Taiwan Strait will lose the meaning of the sky. The military confrontation between the two sides of the strait is no different from the confrontation between Ukraine before the war. This is the most severe issue in Taiwan's current defense.

Chen Langsheng: "It is not easy to find the criminal composition of the" fake news ", it is also difficult to define what" fake news "is. The government's current clarification of 'fake news' is effective. News' criminal needs. The so -called 'fake news' in Hong Kong is not aimed at the election, nor is it a platform for information release, but an individual. No free and democratic country will legislate like this. "

Authorities will study the definition and regulation of "fake news".

** Analysis: Government officials may also fall into the "Fake News" French Open **

Du Yaoming, former assistant professor at the Department of Journalism, Hong Kong Baptist University, said that since the implementation of the Hong Kong version of the National Security Law, the Hong Kong Government must restrain remarks and do not worry about no tools. In addition, the 23 "Basic Law" is about to legislate. Week chapter. Moreover, the Hong Kong Government also realized that once legislation, non -opponents may also fall into the French Open.

Du Yaoming: "When a pro -government or government officials talk about any false news, it is likely to resist the so -called 'fake news law', and most of the existing media are pro -Beijing. Small online media also step by step. 'Fake news The French 'is mainly for netizens' reposting information, but these also have the "incitement regulations' to regulate.

Du Yaoming believes that the current "fake news" legislation is relatively closed and backward countries, and countries and regions that are in line with Europe and the United States will believe that the problem of freedom of speech should be solved with freedom of speech. "News" is not helpful for revitalizing the Hong Kong economy.

Du Yaoming: "Unless (so -called 'fake news') directly damages the privacy, reputation of others, or the actual interests of the country are damaged, otherwise, it will generally solve the problem by public discussion. It is unfamiliar with foreign investors. Of course, Hong Kong's investment promotion will treat civilization and democratic countries priority. "

Although the Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao stated in an exclusive interview that it would not be a "fake news" legislation, it emphasized that the faster and better the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. However, if you only consider completing the task as soon as possible and ignore certain potential risks, you will "be unable to hold the constitutional responsibility and can't hold Hong Kong and the country."

Among them, it is clearly ordered to establish and develop foreign relations with various countries on the basis of a China principle. Acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits have the right to adopt countermeasures and restrictions. According to analysis, the law shall also restrain all the political statements of all foreigners and approach the category of the National Security Law of Hong Kong. China will be more closed.

[** Xi Jinping announced "to launch an international struggle with the rule of law" **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hx1-02162022083557.html)The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China voted on the 28th and approved the Law of the Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China. Article 34 of the law clearly orders, based on a Chinese principle, establish and develop diplomatic relations with countries around the world in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence; China has the right to take or terminate the necessary diplomatic actions such as changes or termination of diplomacy and consular relationships.

Article 33 of the Law also stipulates that it has the right to take corresponding countermeasures and restrictions on acts that endanger the sovereignty, security, and development benefits of the People's Republic of China. Article 8 stipulates that any organization and individuals who violate the law and engage in harmful national interest activities in foreign exchanges will be investigated for legal responsibility in accordance with the law.

** Scholars: Foreign capital restraint in politics approaching the Hong Kong National Security Law **

Ye Yaoyuan, a professor of international research lectures at the University of St. Tomas University, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia on the 29th and pointed out: "As long as most countries establish diplomatic relations with China comply with the principles of China, although there is a private relationship with Taiwan, they will not publicly recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. Not only the national level issues, but even private enterprises invest in China, and even travel to China, they must follow the principles of the first China and follow the leadership of the Communist Party. In this way To some extent, all foreigners have not yet reached the level of the Hong Kong National Security Law, but they have approached the category of the National Security Law of Hong Kong. "

In response to the background of this method, Ye Yaoyuan analyzed that US -China relations have fallen into stagnation, and have not improved in the Blingken visit. The Russian and Ukraine War has derived the Wagner's soldiers. Although the authorities have harassed foreigners through the inspection and investigation system in the past, the implementation of the "Foreign Relations Law" has a greater harm to China. In the future, it may be more locked. Foreign investors will slow down and exchange.

The official media Xinhua News Agency issued the content of the "Foreign Relations Law of the People's Republic of China", including the general rules, power, goals, systems, and guarantees, including 45 articles, including 45 items, and will be implemented from July 1. Article 27 of the Law stipulates that foreign aid adheres to the sovereignty of other countries, does not interfere with other domestic politics, and does not attach any political conditions.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-29T11-50-00-04-00/000002.png)(webpage Screenshot)  [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-29T11-50-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hx-06292023082330.html/capture.jpg)** Wang Yi: Implement Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought in legal form **

The law also mentioned Mao Zedong's thoughts, "Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era", and "adhering to the centralized and unified leadership of the Communist Party of China in foreign countries."

Ye Yaoyuan pointed out that this is the "human law" based on the party's meaning, instead of law: "It writes Xi Jinping's thoughts inside and turns into how Xi explained, Xi Jinping's thoughts or Xi Jinping uses to define these concepts. It is entirely the party's intention. To put it bluntly, there will even be some lower -level people who will speculate and over -enforcement. "

"People's Daily" published a comment by Wang Yi, the director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the CPC Central Committee on the 29th, saying that the law "provides strong protection for the law of the law of the big country" is "the major achievement of implementing the diplomatic thoughts of Jinping in a legal form", Facing severe challenges, opposing hegemonicism and power politics, and improving legal tools for foreign struggles.

Shen Mingshu, director of the National Security Research Institute of Taiwan's National Defense Security Research Institute, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia that for China, legal warfare from international issues, claiming to quote the law in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international rules, etc. Disputes can be treated in accordance with this law. For example, citizens have been persecuted internationally, and they have been withdrawn from Sudan to protect their own interests.

Shen Mingshi believes that the key is that Article 9 explicitly sets up the "central foreign affairs leadership agency is responsible for decision -making and coordination of foreign work, studying and formulating, guiding the implementation of national foreign strategies and related major policies and policies." The group is responsible for China's foreign policy.

Shen Mingshi said: "Xi Jinping, the head of the foreign affairs work group, the deputy team leader Wang Yi, and Wang Yi can best represent the CCP's foreign policy. For example, Qin Gang saw that Brinken had a good attitude, and Wang Yi was dressed as a black face. Speak ruthlessly. "

** Scholars worry that the law of the law will give China a source of chips from foreign negotiations **

Shen Mingshi mentioned that Article 38 of the Law made clearly order that "the state has the right to allow or refuse foreigners to enter the country and stay, and manage the activities of foreign organizations in accordance with the law." Social public interests and destroy social public order. "

Example of Shen Mingshi: "If foreign people and foreign organizations engage in illegal activities in China, they can directly drive, arrest or protest against the country. These companies are probably clear. What should be done should not be done. But for example, when the relationship between the two countries is harsh, will China take strong or persecution actions against some enterprises or organizations to force which country to negotiate with it. This is more troublesome. "

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) A large -scale questionnaire survey conducted by the University of Leipzig at Germany showed that the romant -right speech was specially recognized in eastern Germany. The survey with the extreme right -wing concept of the eastern people in Germany found that people were "particularly alienated by democracy" and less than half of them were satisfied with the daily life under the democratic system.

Researchers questioned 3,500 people from 5 Federal State in eastern Germany. The population of these five states accounts for nearly one -fifth of the total German population. The results showed that nearly half of the respondents demanded that Muslims immigrated to Germany; nearly 70%of them agreed that foreigners came to Germany to enjoy the German social welfare. In addition, anti -Semitism thought is quite common, and nearly one -third of the people said that the Jewish impact is too great.

Such political concepts are also reflected in people's election preferences. "Relevant results show that the Right -wing parties advocate many fit points among the general public with their ideology." Research authors said that among the supporters of the German options party, people with extremely right -wing concepts are the most concentrated.

Extreme right options are particularly successful in eastern Germany. Not long ago, in a county in Turinen, the option party candidate was elected as the county chief. This is [Optional Party won the first time in German local elections](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国极右翼选项党首次赢得区议会选举/a-66033353)Essence At the state level, the party may win in the three Eastern State Council elections next year. Optional Party has won a lot of support for the racist content of anti -immigrants and anti -Muslims for many years.

### Racial discrimination in German society

### Hope there is a strong leader

Why can the concept of extreme right wing be popular in eastern Germany? The research report believes that the reason is not the history of the communist autocracy of East Germany, but more about the popularity of "trust conspiracy theory" and the longing for "authoritarian countries". Most respondents hope to have a "strong leader" or "strong political party." 33%of them agree with the following sayings: "We should have a leader (Führer, in the historical context, referring to Hitler as the" head of state "-The translator's note), governing Germany with a strong wrist and pursuing benefits for everyone." Nearly A quarter of respondents said that the socialism of the Nazi nationalism also has a good side.

Researchers have also investigated whether people's views have changed in the past few decades. Because Whenever Germany occurs [racism](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/种族主义在德国势头渐长/a-53756672)After the bleeding incident, there will always be fierce social discussions, and it is no exception in eastern Germany. All localities have spontaneous assistance to refugees and advocate social diversification. However, the results of the questionnaire survey showed that the political concepts of the people in eastern Germany have not changed much in the past 30 years. That is to say, the concept of extreme right -wing has not increased, but maintains a higher level. This may explain why the party can obtain excellent election results in the east.

Research authors at the University of Leipzig believe that right -wing thoughts are very vigilant in the German East Minister. Because, if the statistics of criminal criminal criminals such as the arson of the refugee receiving center have shown that anti -democratic emotions in daily life may be transformed into violent operations.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-11-08-00-00/000185984_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

In the early summer of 2023, the German Federation of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) conducted an economic census on about 21,000 companies in various industries nationwide.

In the subsequent release of the Economic Survey Report in early 2023, DIHK lists a series of operating risks faced by German companies in the chapter of "Business Risk of the next 12 months." Professional talents, labor costs, domestic demand, foreign demand, economic framework conditions, etc. This article intends to evaluate the three main risks and consequences of energy and raw material prices, shortage of professional talents and domestic demand.

** 1. Energy price fluctuation **

German companies still regard energy and raw material prices as the greatest operating risks. Of course, compared with DIHK's survey earlier this year, there is a decline: At present, less than two -thirds (65%) companies think this is a threat to its business. At the beginning of this year It was 72%.

On June 13, data released by the German Federal Bureau of Statistics showed that the inflation rate in Germany in May was 6.1%. It is said that this is the lowest level since March 2022. Although food prices are still rising sharply, a year -on -year increase of 14.9%, energy prices have fallen sharply, which has increased by only 2.6%year -on -year (the increase in February this year has reached 19.1%).

It is worth noting that the current natural gas and power prices in the futures market have significantly lower than the level at the end of 2022. In the current market, in some cases, they have even descended to the level before the crisis. However, the future energy supply cannot be determined.

A German TV website reported on June 2 that German natural gas storage facilities were once again full of 75%, three months earlier than the law. This means that the level of filling is much higher than the same period last year. It is said that this is also due to the relatively mild winter from 2022 to 2023.

Nevertheless, DIHK still bluntly pointed out: "The supply is still uncertain, especially considering the next winter."

It can be seen that despite the sharp fall of energy prices at the moment, German companies still regard it as the largest operating risk, and strive to plan ahead, prepare, and grasp the initiative.

In the industrial field, overall, the proportion of energy and raw materials as the number one risk -risk enterprise is declining, which is now 75%, and it has reached 85%before.

However, more than four -fifths of energy -intensive intermediate product manufacturers, as always, listed it as the greatest risk, for example, the metal product industry (83%, 89%before), the chemical industry (82%, 91%), glass glass, glass , Ceramic and stone industry (88%, 92%before).

The continuous high level of producer prices also allows the food and animal feed industry to continue to pay close attention to the price trend of energy and raw materials (89%, 93%before).

The price of producers of building materials such as steel, cement or asphalt has brought difficulties to the construction industry. Although the price has fallen in recent months, it is still higher than the level before the crisis. Therefore, although the proportion of construction companies that regard it as the largest operating risk decline, it is still as high as 72%(previously 79%).

In short, the price of energy and raw materials is quite tricky. However, from the results of DIHK's early summer survey, compared with the beginning of the year, the proportion of the number of companies in the number one operating risk company has declined.

** 2. Professional talent shortage **

In the survey, the shortage of professional talents was also highlighted. More than three -fifths (62%) companies use the shortage of professional talents as operating risks. This is a peak that only reached in the fall of 2018.

According to DIHK, the shortage of professional talents has become the second largest business risk of all enterprises. According to data released by the Federal Statistics Bureau on June 7, from 1950 to 2021, the proportion of population in Germany at the age of 65 and over has increased from 10%to 22%. This proportion is amazing!In view of the aging population, lack of qualified employees will also become one of the main structural challenges of future companies.

In the service industry, the shortage of professional talents exceeds energy and commodity prices, becoming the most commonly mentioned risk.

For industrial and construction companies, qualified workers' shortage is the second most urgent issue. In the industrial field, it is regarded as a new high of 63%after 61%of business risk companies. Despite the weak construction industry, 70%of companies also complain about lack of technical workers.

The German Institute of Economic Research (IW) in Cologne (IW) guaranteed the Professional Talent Capability Center (KOFA) issued a research report on April 16 this year that the vacancy of more than 630,000 professional talents in 2022 cannot be filled because there is no corresponding ones nationwide without corresponding ones. Qualified unemployed. The report pointed out that since its observation in 2010, this is the biggest gap in skilled talents; especially in social and technical majors, lack of qualified talents.

According to this study, in the fields of health, social services, apprenticeships and education, as well as construction, architectural design, measurement and architectural technology fields, these shorts are the most obvious, and 6 shorts of vacancies cannot be filled. In the fields of natural science, geography, and information technology, the shortage of professional talents is also higher than the average level.

It is worth noting that, especially the lack of information technology professionals with college degree. This study shows that the current general law of the labor market is that the higher the professional skills requirements, the more difficult it is to fill the vacancy position. Professional talents with college degree are particularly sought -after in computer science, electrical engineering, construction planning and supervision departments.

A "Today News" website of German TV reported on June 2 on the title of "One -Six Vocational Professional Talents" as the title. An analysis of the Federal Employment Bureau showed that one -sixth of occupations exist in existence The problem of shortage of professional talents. According to the analysis, 200 of the 1,200 occupations evaluated last year, there were 200 types of talents in occupations. The agency declared in Nuremberg that it had 52 occupations more than a year ago. This number means that the number of talents in talent has reached a new high.

According to the Federal Employment Bureau's analysis, the shortage of professional talents affects the major of nursing specialty, professional drivers, medical assistants, construction and craftsmen, children's conservation, motor vehicle technology and information technology. Compared with the previous year, hotels or catering services, fitters and bus drivers increased in 2022. According to the survey, half of the vacant positions last year concentrated in the shortage of the above -mentioned professionals.

Not long ago, by the commissioned by the German commercial bank, the polls Forsa had conducted a survey of the status of medium -sized enterprises and came to a similar conclusion to DIHK. Among the 1,500 enterprises that were surveyed, nearly three -quarters (74%) companies called labor and professional talents as the biggest challenge currently facing. The seriousness of talent shortage is evident.

** 3. Weak domestic demand **According to data released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics on May 25, the German GDP fell 0.3%month -on -month in the first quarter of this year. Because GDP in the fourth quarter of last year was already a negative growth, according to the usual definition, Germany, the largest European economy in Europe, has entered a technological recession.

According to analysis, weak private consumption is the main reason for this decline. According to data released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, private consumption in the first quarter of this year fell by 1.2%. "Compared with the previous quarter, private families' expenditures on food and beverages, clothing and shoes and furniture have decreased."

In addition, new passenger cars purchased by private families have also decreased. It is said that this is mainly due to the cancellation of subsidies for purchasing plug -in hybrid vehicles at the end of 2022, and starting to reduce subsidies for electric vehicles from early 2023.

However, there is another deeper reason for consumption reduction: inflation is high. Andreasscheuerle, Andreasscheuerle, Dekabank, pointed out: "Under the tremendous pressure of inflation, German consumers have kneeling and dragging the entire national economy."

In most departments in Germany, although the trade union can increase wages by negotiations, because wages have not kept up high inflation, the purchasing power has decreased.

According to data released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics on April 27, compared with 2021, German employees' actual salary in 2022 fell 4.0%. This decline greatly exceeded 3.1%of the preliminary prediction before.

For 2023, many experts expect the actual salary will continue to fall, because the inflation rate is still high. This may once again devour the wages of many employees.

It is worth noting that all walks of life in Germany today have generally reached an agreement to increase wages, and the increase is not small. However, such agreements have increased the risk of wages-price spiral increase, which may continue to enhance inflation pressure. Economists call this phenomenon "the second round effect".

It is also reported that at the beginning of this year, the purchasing of the German government has also decreased significantly: government expenditures have been reduced by nearly 5%compared with the previous quarter. Its impact should not be underestimated.

In order to fight inflation, the European Central Bank raised interest rates repeatedly. On May 24th, at the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the European Central Bank, the president of the bank, Christina Lagard, said she would continue to implement this policy. Lagarde pointed out that this is because the European Central Bank's primary task is to achieve a 2%inflation target in a timely manner, thereby maintaining price stability. The president also said: "And we will complete this task."

On June 15, 2023, the European Central Bank raised interest rates again. This is the eighth interest rate hike since July 21, 2022. The key interest rate has now increased to 4.00%.

However, the European Central Bank continued to raise interest rates. Although inflation was suppressed, it also suppressed economic growth.

The German "Commercial Daily" website reported on May 22 that "on the one hand, this makes the re -financing of existing loans more expensive. On the other hand, the business resources and investment costs of new credit funding will be higher." Point out: "What is worrying is that some investment projects will become unprofitable, which cannot invest at all."

Therefore, some analysts said that the danger of continuous interest rate hikes completely stifled economic growth completely and said that this is the current situation in Germany, and the situation in other countries in the euro zone is better.

Iljanothnagel, a member of the DIHK, is in charge of the economic situation analysis of the economic situation, stated that when Iljanothnagel released the Economic Survey Report in early 2023, despite the continued rising energy prices, rising interest rates, and the Ukrainian war, companies still Show "extraordinary toughness". "However, the overall prospects of the next 12 months are still dim, especially in terms of demand, the orders received are significantly declined. Dihk continues to expect zero growth this year." It is consistent.

Recently, many German Institutes of Economic Research have even expected that the German economy will shrink in 2023. For example, the Kil World Institute of Economics (IFW) published a forecast on June 15 that compared with the previous year, the German economy will shrink by 0.3%this year. From the current point of view, German economic prospects are worrying.

There are no eternal friends, no eternal enemies, only eternal interests. This is the rule of people that many people believe in, and the relationship between the country.

This was originally originated from British Prime Minister Palmaton in the nineteenth century. The original words were "A Country Does Not Have PerManent Friends, onlyperManentinterests". The literal translation is: the country does not have forever friends, only eternal interests. Later, it is said that British Prime Minister Churchill said: "There is no forever between the country and the country, only eternal interests." Now, this sentence has become the basic principle of getting along with the country in the minds of many people.

In fact, the use of interests to explain the relationship between the country and the country is not long in China. Before the reform and opening up, people generally used Taoism to explain the exchanges between the country. For example, those who liberate two -thirds of the remaining suffering in the world, such as assisting the Asian -Africa -Rathered brothers to fight against Su Xiumei. This is a kind of moralism to explain the relationship between the country.

After the reform and opening up, the commodity economy and the market economy changed the concept of the Chinese. People turn 180 degrees, no longer believe in morality, but use benefits to explain all relationships, relationships between people, and countries and countries.

But this is wrong.

First of all, the first economics is subjective. A glass of water and a diamond, which is more valuable, depends on the views of people in a specific environment, that is, perspective and concept.

As a result, the national economic policies, GDP, interest, fiscal policy, and monetary policy we see are based on the concept of "marginal effect" and derived step by step. The foundation of marginal utility is subjective value theory.

In the age of humans or animals, interests are simple and have nothing to do with ideas. For animals, beneficial things are reproduction. Everything is for the purpose of spreading genes.

But with the development of human civilization, the value of human beings is increasingly unrelated. An ordinary Chinese can have three children, and a rich American may only have one child. The word interest -breeding and retreat, the concept is king. Many people think that many times, just because he thinks so.

It can be said that from the moment the person is separated from obscurity, the concept is the behavior of the leader, letting people give up their benefits and obey their concepts. The tribal struggle, religious, and national conflicts, and the war between the country are driven by ideas.

This is the same from the timeline, to see people or society from any moment in human society. The concept is king.

For individuals, get the money that you can always see and touch, and the concept does not seem to work.

But this is not the case. Money does not need to be paper. The money is to spend it. It is not used by depositing banks. It is also meaningful because money can be used and will be used in the future.

Once you use it, it is the dominance of ideas. LV's bags are better than snake skin plastic pockets. This is the concept. The tram accelerates for 3 seconds, the V8 engine is 6 liters, and the acceleration is also 3 seconds. The latter is good. This is also the concept.

Are you willing to eat with a person you hate, because he pays it; or is he willing to pay for yourself, please drink a person with similar smells? The adult world has never been only interests, but full of righteousness, morality, and emotions.

Enterprises are economic organizations pursuing profit. But when it comes to profits, it involves customers. The customer's choice is subjective. Choosing to dig diamonds or find water depends on his customer's view.

Moreover, concepts will drive companies and give up their benefits. After all, companies are composed of people. If the enterprise is a pure organization, then the wine bureau becomes unnecessary.

When an importer stands at the International Trade Association, when choosing a product of the two countries, the concept can control his choice. Let him earn less 1%, and also obey his preference for factors such as the place of origin, the country, and even the religious.

Enterprises composed of people even specifically and internalize their concepts into business decisions. They obey ideas, carry out public welfare, and refuse to serve the objects.

Or some people think that these seemingly obedient examples actually have greater benefits behind it.

However, when we talk about greater interests, we are even more conceptual. At this level, the role of ideas is even more powerful, and it is almost determined what interests are determined by ideas.

"More benefits" is a collective concept. So what is "collective" what is "us"?

If "our interests", then "who is us"?

In a community. Is it "us" on the 6th floor and the first floor? No, install the elevator, laugh on the 6th floor, and cry on the first floor. Is it "we" who rely on the garbage station and the garden? Is the property and residents "us"? Is the industry committee and residents "us"?

This is just a community.

The happiness of residents in the community is interest, and the first place in the dragon boat team in the community is also interests. The former, pay less property fees, and engage in more greening; the latter donate more money and buy a better dragon boat. The key to the difference between the two is what residents in the community believe and what they choose. This is the concept that determines the interests.

When the concept determines the interests, the control of the concept controls the interests. The concept will also derive your own interest structure to form a kind of mechanism that you can benefit from this concept. The most typical is religion.

However, even on the surface, people show their belief in their concepts for interests, but in the final analysis, people who play a role in people believe in this concept, not for benefits. Because it is not believed that the concept cannot form a specific structure. One person to participate in the dragon boat in the community may be for money, but behind this is that many people are sincere pursuing the dragon boat championship. Of course, the sincerity and enthusiasm of this concept never need to endorse rationality and reasonable.

Therefore, when people talk about interests, they actually have a large extent. At least, concepts and interests are a complementary relationship, and interests have never been higher than concepts.

With the development of human society, the conceptual factor in interests will become heavier.

4000 years ago, a tribe who worshiped men and a tribe who worshiped women could not be related. Before 2000, they would fight together. Now, they are in Earth Village.

The survival struggle and evolution of animals are based on the flesh, naked, direct. Intelligent creatures, intelligence directly participate in evolution. The concept itself is the crystallization of evolution. Better concepts, guide higher -level technology, production, and energy use, and in line with the direction of self -organizing evolution. Intelligent creatures are connected by concepts and evolution of concepts to eliminate conflicts. If they cannot handle their concepts, smart creatures will increase their energy levels with greater risks brought about by conflict. In this sense, the globalization of ideas is a new stage.

So, ordinary people can independently analyze these complex logic, get out of the fog of concepts, and find their true interests?

The answer is very pessimistic: no.

However, it can still be approached, that is, to listen to more, see more, and achieve reasonable ideas through the accumulation of data.

How to distinguish between Chinese teachers? I have studied Chinese history, philosophy, literature and other fields for many years, and worked in the Chinese Academy of Humanities, Language and Literature, and other Chinese universities. Think for a long time. In my opinion, writing should be the "testing gold stone" for testing the level of Chinese teachers.

For the mother tongue as Chinese, listening and speaking are generally not a problem (a few people may be seriously affected by the accent). Reading is not a problem for those who have received higher education. However, writing is different: A considerable part of the mother tongue is not high in writing. This can be roughly seen from the level of graduation thesis written by many undergraduates written by universities in China -the articles they have repeatedly modified have some grammar problems. In addition, at least some Chinese teachers' writing level is difficult to overestimate.

Zhu Gang, director of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Fudan University, wrote the mullet "Seeking Benefits and Reliever, Yongzhen's Interest" on June 18, 2021. It was less than 180 words, but netizens found multiple mistakes. Zhu Gang's research field is ancient Chinese literature, and he actually wrote such a mourning. If he studies physical education or chemistry engineering, he barely speaks; he has a doctorate in literature, and is a professor and blog director. Students or college students barely say. Fudan University Chinese Language and Literature Discipline ranks in the top three in the circle. As the "head of the Chinese department", it is inevitable that such things are inevitably "laughing and generous."

Some Chinese education in Chinese universities looks like "Golden Yuqi" -the many bloggers and professors, published a large number of papers every year, get many topics, and receive a lot of rewards, but the real level is "difficult to say." Such Chinese education, the Chinese teachers cultivated, will not be 100 % percentage, especially in terms of writing.

Writing can accurately reflect the true level of Chinese teachers, and can be used to determine whether Chinese teachers are really qualified. If the teacher writing level is poor, there is obviously shortcomings in Chinese teaching. It will be more or less affected by writing lesson plans, test questions, writing teaching summary, and engaging in teaching research. It should also be pointed out that what a few Chinese teachers need to solve are no longer the problem of "writing badly", but the problem of "unwillingness to write" or even "can't write".

How to judge the writing level of Chinese teachers? Read his articles on newspapers, magazines, and important websites. Generally speaking, the more public publishing articles (the draft of the relationship), the higher the writing level. If the teacher does not publish an article publicly, he can browse the original articles he posted on the media, which may also help judge his writing level. However, because the media has no "threshold", this method is limited.

For Chinese education, high writing levels may not be famous teachers, but famous teachers should be based on high writing level.

** Knowledge and experience accumulation **

Literary history and philosophy must have long -term knowledge accumulation. As far as ancient Chinese is concerned, ten years of studying and studying for thirty years, the level must be different. Reading "Book of Songs", "Zhuangzi", "Historical Records", "Selected Essays" ("Selected by Zhaoming"), all need ancient textual skills, and this is by no means that it can be available overnight. Similarly, it is necessary to teach Chinese, and it is by no means that it can be available overnight.

Ancient literature and history, philosophy, and philosophy, contemporary also emphasized that Chinese teaching should expand to teaching in Chinese traditional culture. In this case, the accumulation of knowledge of Chinese teachers is even more important: this involves not only involves the field of Chinese language and literature, but also includes history, philosophy in China (especially ancient), and even religion, law, customs. Mr. Wang Li wrote the article "The Calendar of Ancient Chinese" (sent to "Literature", No. 1, 1980, and later included in "Ancient Chinese Common Sense"), which includes: "We study ancient Chinese, and at the same time study the ancient calendar; and study the study; study the study; and study the study; and study the study; and study the ancient calendar; and study the study; study the study; study At the same time, we need to study astronomy at the same time. "As an excellent Chinese teacher, knowledge must be profound, covering a wide range of (and even the ancient calendar, etc.).

The main carrier of culture is language, and the main carrier of traditional Chinese culture is Chinese language. In language teaching, consciously combine culture (especially traditional culture) teaching. Chinese traditional culture is vast and profound. If the teachers lack the accumulation of knowledge, in some places, they will have a half -knowledge. In the teaching, there may be the phenomenon of "Mencius" ("Mencius • Under the Heart").

In addition to the accumulation of knowledge, the accumulation of teaching experience is also important for Chinese teachers. Therefore, understanding the previous teaching experience of teachers also helps to judge its level. For example, those who have taught for ten years must have more experience than those who are teaching for two years. Teachers who have taught students at different ages and levels have rich teaching experience. They have strong ability to deal with various teaching issues (even teaching accidents), and their teaching level will be higher.

Finally, it should be mentioned that engaging in academic research and teaching research helps to promote teaching. If there is a lack of research experience, the teaching level is limited. The teachers who have experienced rich research experience (should exclude "relationship projects"), and the teaching level is generally not bad, especially in the humanities. There are long teaching and long teaching and research -those who are engaged in teaching and researchers at the same time can benefit both aspects. Studies talk about the accumulation, and the same is true of teaching.

When I heard that the art college in Shanghai was once with more than 100 students with more than 100 students, I had already drank too much. Friends who graduated from the Shanghai Academy of Drama at a table talked about their spare -life in school, and Lao Deng probably had more than ten bottles of red wine.

It was a dusk of Huang Meitian. The pressure was very low, and some felt breathless. Teacher Qu Luo ate together, but the invitation was sent by Teacher Gu. Happiness Road has always been the streets where Shanghai Literature and Arts like to gather. There have been many niche bars and nearly -approachable restaurants on this not long road. After opening the happiness next door, more young people like this like this. There are so many dining stores that like there. One of my friends living nearby in the name of walking dogs for a long time, chatting with all kinds of beautiful women here, let him have added the WeChat of the girls who raised dogs nearby. In middle -aged, he started fitness running since he raised dogs, and then he tattooed his eyebrows, which made us feel his infinite longing for love. We all said that he was walking on the road of happiness in happiness. These kind -hearted jokes fully diluted the anxiety of him who has been writing a movie script, because the script is always modified, but the startup is still far away.

The restaurant of Lao Deng was SPICYMOMENT. Compared to the ancient meaning Xiangwei and Diushuidong I often went, this Hunan cuisine on Wuyuan Road was mainly for foreign friends living nearby because the portion was too small. The atmosphere is extremely beautiful. Some people describe Lao Deng's restaurant with a literary hippie style. I think they must be attracted by the private bars in the restaurant. Compared with most Hunan cuisine in Shanghai, I think his Hunan cuisine is more like Spain from Spain’s. tapas. It is really not easy to make Hunan cuisine into Fingerfood.

However, it is said that he sold his other branch in Jing'an to another more famous Hunan cuisine chain shop in Shanghai, and then continued to keep the shop of Wuyuan Road, living the kind of life that everyone was jealous. It didn't take long for a three -year outbreak. Many interactions between friends. In the past three years, the experience of these three years entered this year with the fast -moving key. Usually, everyone sees each other's whereabouts and the scenes of the party on WeChat. In general, many changes in the catering industry have happened in these three years, or they have been closed or switched. When he closed Hunan cuisine on Wuyuan Road and re -opened on the famous road of happiness, I realized that he changed the name of the restaurant to "happiness and pot", but the English name was still Spicymoment. In fact, I have been to No. 110 Xingfu Road before. A quiet western restaurant downstairs seems to have been in line. There is almost no decoration style. It has always been where many young people like to take pictures. However, Lao Deng took both the second and third floors. The second floor was a restaurant. It is said that the third floor is said to work hard in the direction of the art space.

There are eight people one after another, Dr. Yangmei, who is a teacher in the show, is a writer who has been writing script when he graduated from the show, and has been promoted to the new film. Book or teach in the play. Of course, Teacher Qu Fengguo, who is also a teacher, is also a teacher of the play. One week later, when his 30th anniversary work review exhibition was grandly opened at the Dragon Art Museum in Xuhui Binjiang, the artist in Shanghai did not appear except to the Basel exhibition in Basel, Switzerland. All are present. The guests sat down around a long table, and the two happy pots boiled tomatoes with steaming. Some of the sour soup fish of Guizhou, but the domineering of lemongrass made us feel the style of Thai meals. In short, the eels were cooked in the pot. Later, it was said that there were bullfrogs. In short, there was no common sour soup fish. I think this is the wisdom of Lao Deng. After all, Hunan and Guizhou still maintain the taste distance. Subsequent spicy beef tendons, golden eggs, dried lipsticks, and even fried cord can be used for wine. Lao Deng is constantly opening wine, and everyone is toasting. The liberal and young gathering party does not care about the matching of wine and Hunan cuisine. They care more about the wine of the wine.

In fact, such a pot of happy tomato soup has almost become the protagonist of all night, and all kinds of cut beef and mutton are put inside. The most suitable party is the most suitable tomato happy pot that has been boiling, because the people at the party are really wonderful.

When people always think about the party, they are important or important. Most of the time they still have the upper hand in social needs, because people who do not speculate to eat together, they will be boring to manage Michelin or black pearls. The most interesting thing is that this restaurant also has a secret room hidden behind, pushing away the heavy dark door, and a small bar quietly emerged. The grasp of the old Deng, who is studying dance in the play in the show, is really nothing to say in color. The bright red wall becomes the main color of the secret room. Then the DJ main console is full of various huge coffeetableBooks, and then the hills are the same as the hills. On the pile of books, there are different shapes of table lamps. The book rolls rushed. In the flying electronic music, the knowledge is still very powerful in addition to the weight. The secret room is connected to a huge terrace. It seems that the space here is more open than the old restaurant on Wuyuan Road. You can smoke and chat on the terrace, and there are office buildings around. Repeated existence.

Don't forget the two pots that have been boiling tomato soup. Everyone does not seem to stay in the secret room. After a while, they returned to the restaurant for a while. In fact, the reason for everyone to sit back on the dining table is the music in my mobile phone, because the tomato happy pot soon, the waiters began to get off work one after another. At this time, Lao Deng had switched from the restaurant owner to the bar owner, and because I had too many songs in the mobile phone, I unexpectedly became the music jockey who had a long party. When the wine is hot, if you need to find a kind of power that can make the hair stand up, it is a song that has not heard for decades, but the door of the door will yell when the door sounds. Fortunately, I am a peers with a very different age, so I started to push slowly. From the early Liu Wenzheng to Luo Dayou behind, from "OneNight in BEIJING" to "Stone", from Sister Qiang to Su Xiaoming, from the Tang Dynasty to the little bird. I remember when I started playing "Unforgettable Tonight", everyone laughed and said that today is the Spring Festival Gala today?

Regarding young growth and middle -aged sustainability, I think this is the most topic of friends who have graduated from a table. In fact, time is the main reason for social change and historical changes, and the new generation will definitely bring new thinking and new behaviors to the world, and then eliminate those outdated faith and practices. Fresh blood has gradually stood up to the wind and becomes the mainstream, so that the society will be full of vitality. The so -called generation of generations of people will become the pulse of history. But sometimes we feel that we have changed, and we have created the differences between each generation. The changes they have experienced are mapped into the lives of different intergenerational groups through a rhythm, which allows each intergenerational group to feel the impact and brand of significant major historical events, especially playing these can be called When the popular music of the times.I seem to have jumped from a restaurant gathering to the inventory of the memories of the music that brings us growth. In fact, we like to use the standard of intergenerational differences after 60, post -70, post -80s, or post -90s, and zero, mainly because we like to use convenient terms, and because we have ten fingers. Essence It can only be said that generations are a new method of segmentation of time and space. Are you really different from the small trees that are planted after 1990 and the big tree that are planted in zero -year. The so -called intergenerational difference is not that the spirit of the times makes them look like this, but that the economic cycle has made them look like this. Just as there are two teachers with a student of a student today? Such a school is definitely gone, but today there are two tomatoes with a restaurant with eight guests with eight guests.

This is the founding of modern automobile groups and cultural centers. It excavates and supports the curator's art project. The awards include two categories: The Hyundaiblue Prize Design Award for design curators, as well as Hyundai Blue Prize ART+Tech Award for Chinese Young Casters in Beijing.

This exhibition is exactly the award -winning work.

** Simulate the future field of "decentralization" **

With the "decentralization" becoming a state and concept, the curator Li Yan and Chen Jianghong boldly simulated a world of "going to human beings". Imagine the fields of symbiosis, including humans, will be What kind of scene?

The curator solicited 11 works among global artists. There are "farm laboratories" units that have brought future species and innovative thinking about genetic engineering, as well as "farm cooperatives" units that have imagined decentralized cooperation and operation methods. Essence

The theme of this exhibition comes with early warning and criticality, which is easy to remind people of George Owaer's literary work "Animal Farm" and the British science fiction short series "Black Mirror".

The curator Li Yan said: "We want to argue with a neutral perspective of equality and coexistence of all things. In the future, all things are built together in the Garden of Eden. 100 million chickens were killed and became a human food. This is particularly worthwhile to wake up. "

Although the theme pioneer is profound, the two young curators want to use immersive entertainment to guide the guides to allow the audience to visit as the candidate. This pioneer theme exhibition is also more experimental in visiting methods, looking for cross -border entertainment projects such as immersive script killing. "In the future, we will also do puppet dramas and drama workshops." Li Yan said.

** Art creation really express the development of science and technology? **

Cutting -edge technology has always been an important source of inspiration for artists to create. Today is the era of explosive development of science and technology. Decentralization, ChatGPT, artificial intelligence ... These hot words not only appeared frequently in the scientific and technological scenes, but also became high -frequency vocabulary in the artist's mouth.

The creative medium of contemporary art can be almost any element in daily life. When seeing artistic installations such as "genetic engineering" and "artificial intelligence" in front of you, will visitors engaged in the genetic engineering and artificial intelligence industry will "laugh"?

Li Yan said: "Many artists now have the knowledge background of interdisciplinary knowledge. For example, in this exhibition, two artists have undergraduate majors in machinery and engineering, and they have learned design at the master's degree. Some works come from the creative team. , Both the scientific background and art background are fused, and they are fused and learned from each other. "

In fact, the birth of many innovative styles in the history of art is related to the development of science and technology, such as the Eiffel Tower, which commemorates the 19th century science and technology civilization, the style founded by Einstein and the atomic structure of Einstein and the atomic structure. However, artists use artistic perspectives to create works related to technology, which takes time to precipitate. Li Yan said, "I need to try and error the artist."

** The curator's survival dilemma ** **

Hyundai Blue Prizeart+Tech Annual Art Awards and Modern Automobile Culture Center (Beijing) were also founded in 2017. It aims to support the art curator of pioneer experiments through the "technology and art" vision of "technology and art".

The point is, this is a rare art award for curators.

In the field of "technology and art", Li Yan said: "The curator is almost all oblique young people, and they all have another job to maintain their livelihood." The same is true of Li Yan, with art -related full -time jobs. Not long ago, Yao Qingmei, a video artist who lived in France, complained that when he participated in the exhibition in the public account, he rarely received the production fee of art works. The curator also has the same difficulties. Li Yan said: "At least in the exhibition of technology and art, it is difficult for curators to get curatorial fees." It seems that no one realizes that there should be this expense expenditure.

In the field of art, some works are difficult to sell, and the more pure art works, sometimes farther away from the market. On the one hand, art works are criticized for the market, on the one hand, works that do not meet the market at all cannot get financial support. This is really a paradox.

In addition, although the Chinese Private Art Museum has developed in recent years, it is far from European and American countries. There are 150 museums and art museums in Paris alone. The opportunities and space for curatorials will naturally be much more.

Although the development of the contemporary art field of Chinese contemporary arts has attracted the attention of the world, there are still many places that need to be improved. Professional cognition of all aspects of the art industry needs to be further improved. Although the road of contemporary art has improved the rapid progress, it has just started.

Have you heard of the "National Museum of Asian Art"? This is the Flier Art Museum in Washington, USA(Freer Gallery Of Art)And Arthur-Sacklergallery (Arthur M. Sacklerlery) at the end of 2019, a new brand to reshape the brand at the end of 2019. Although the "new brand" has only been worldwide, in May this year, the museum has gone through a 100 -year history.

For a century, the museum has added a new exhibition hall, allowing guests to visit the museum to quickly understand the geography, ethnic, society, and culture of Asia. The museum also renovates the website to "welcome curiosity"(CuriosityWelcomed)For the big title, we encourage websites to explore "peace"(Calming), "Happy"(Joyful),"Surprisingly"(Unexpected),"cute"(Cute),"exciting "(Inspiring)And "funny"(Funny)Collection.

I was curious to open the "funny" link, and a webpage immediately appeared a Chinese business -oriented bronze bird and beast. The bronze birds and beasts left more than 3,000 years ago were funny and cute, making people laugh. I think the museum's goal of "welcome curiosity" has been initially achieved.

Not only the new exhibition hall and new website, the museum has also planned a two -week event for the century -old celebration. From the lunch provided by the local Asian catering industry, to the popular Korean singer Nan Yundao; Bollywood Indian dance class is available. Of course, in addition to eating, drinking and playing, the museum also provides many guides that lead the experts by experts from various departments.

** Museum Development History **

The original name of the National Asian Museum was officially opened on May 9, 1923. At that time, 9,500 works were collected, almost all of them came from entrepreneur Flier(Charles LangFreer,1854-1919)Donation. Flier has started to collect enthusiasm after knowing American painter Whistler. In addition to collecting a large number of Whistler paintings, the artist also created the famous interior decoration "Peacock House" for him. However, Flier's collection far surpasses the United States, especially China and Japan. For the collection, Flier visited Asia many times and brought back countless cultural relics and treasures. He was unmarried throughout his life and had no descendants. As early as the early 20th century, he began to plan to let his collection spread immortal.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-47-51-00-00/000185808_piclink.jpg)Although he settled in Detroit, Flier locked his target in Washington from the beginning. He put forward the idea of donating treasures to The Smithsonianinstification, agreed to fund the Society and let the Society establish a national museum in Washington. Because the US President Roosevelt attached great importance to Asia at the time, Flier's donation and the planned museum planned to pass quickly. The Flier Art Museum not only became the first museum in Washington, but also the first National Asian Museum in the United States. However, Flier and Roosevelt died in 1919 and had no chance to participate in the opening ceremony.

Since the opening, the collection has increased from 9500 pieces to nearly 47,000 collections today. Among them, Buddha statues, bronze, jade and painting are the most exciting in Chinese collections. The Chinese collection of the museum has been considered one of the most exciting collections in the United States for a long time. Nathan Atkins Museum of Art is on the name. There are many Buddha statues from Xiangtangshan Grottoes, as well as Gu Kaizhi's "Luo Shen Fu" and Wen Zhengming's "Chibi Winning Tour" and other masterpieces. Some of the collections are bought, but more from donations from collectors.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-47-51-00-00/000185809_piclink.jpg)** The new challenge of the Centennial Museum **

In addition to Friel, another group of important collections were from Sacler in 1982(Arthur M.Sackler)Donation. Sakler is a doctor, medical publisher, pharmaceutical marketers and Asian art collectors. He donated 4 million US dollars and more than 1,000 collections to Smithson. In order to recognize this gift, the Smithson Society agreed to build another Arthur-M-Sacler Arts next to the Flier Art Museum. Hall.

According to "Who is collecting China: The United States Hunting Asian Art Treasure Centennial" author Xielin Bridk(Shareen Blair Brysac)And Carl Meyer(Karl E. Meyer)The two people described in the book: "As the first batch of art museums funded by the Federal government, since the opening of the museum in 1923, the Flier Art Museum has been unsolved because the conditions of the donor of the museum are too harsh: it cannot be too harsh: it cannot cannot If you borrow collections, you cannot borrow from the collections from the museum to display. In fact, the Flier Art Museum itself has been frozen by time in the old house of Miss Hao Weixin in Dickens' "Big Future". "

The donation of Sacle made the museum more flexible with reality, but what Smithson learned that it was never expected that after more than 30 years, the lightness caused by the opium analgesic agent produced by the Purdue Pharmaceuticals of the Sacle family to belong to It is addicted to the medical disaster that died in severe death. Sacler's name is like a bloody dirty label, which makes the museum very headache. I asked Chasef. Robinson, although the museum had been renamed, why did the exhibition hall still retain Sacler's name?

"We are deeply distressed by this crisis." The museum chief told me that many of his family came from New Hampshire. The state was the second in the country because of the death example of taking opioids, and the damage was very deep. However, in the 1982 donation agreement, Sacler requested that the Smithson Society must permanently retain the name of Arthur-M-Sacler. However, the museum guarantees that it will be transparent to this history, recognize its complexity and encourage the public to discuss responsible naming practices.

Sacler's controversy will not disappear in a short time. As the sources of museum collections are becoming more and more stringent around the world, the Asian Art Museum has also begun to investigate the source of collections. "During my chief of the museum, I have not encountered a request for claims or repatriations", but Robinson acknowledged that "in the face of nearly 47,000 collections, it is impossible to have no suspicion for morality or legal reasons."

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-47-51-00-00/000185810_piclink.jpg)Not just in Smithy, because some of the confiscated part of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Museum of New York(ShelbyWhite)In private collections, the Metropolitan Museum has recently seized two pieces of stone carving tombs worth about $ 3.5 million worth of $ 3.5 million. Due to this lesson, the metropolis will decide to hire a source research team to review the source of the collection.

I mentioned to Robinson that Flier bought many collections from the antique merchant Lu Qinzhai. Lu Qinzhai was famous for its jade and bronze wares and bronzes that originated from grave robbers, and the museum was famous for the murals of the temple. "We are very alert to Lu Qinzhai." Robinson replied that the museum recently acquired another literature of Dai Runzhai, a Nagong merchant. "In this field, our method is to do research. Scholars share our research. If there is a proof of items that need to be taken, we will not hesitate. "

The State Asian Art Museum's research on the origin of cultural relics and the source process, as well as the temporary custody of the cultural relics of Yemen, reflects its commitment to moral management and tolerance. With the change of the times, the museum can no longer show the suspicious cultural relics as much as in the past.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-47-51-00-00/000185811_piclink.jpg)Robinson also acknowledged that few museums could confidently say that there were no suspicious collections because of moral or legal reasons. First of all, the museum acknowledges the complex history of the cultural relics that is collected. Through a complete source of research, the museum ensures the transparency and accountability system of its collections. Through the temporary custody plan, the museum establishes cooperation and knowledge exchanges to promote a deep understanding of the rich cultural heritage of Yemen. On the occasion of its century -old celebration, the National Asian Museum of Art hopes to become a lighthouse for cultural protection and cultural dialogue. Today, when the misunderstandings and disputes continue to promote the awareness of the diverse art culture and traditions of Asia and other regions, it must be better than ever than before. More important.

Designed in Shanghai for ten years, from the initial explosion to today's peaceful and routine. In the past ten years, it is also a cycle of home design in the Chinese market. I thought it could bloom and bear fruit, but I couldn't wait for the spring, design, and finally wandered in the niche circle.

Ten years ago, Shanghai Airborne Shanghai Beach was designed. This design exhibition with the largest British design as the signboard has successfully made a circle and became the explosion of that spring. Prior to this, the design exhibition only fermented in the circle, and designed Shanghai for the first time caused the public's social effect. The queues at the entrance of the weekend exhibition center, the organizer temporarily raised the fare, and once ushered in reports from major media such as television stations. A passenger flow of more than 60,000 during the exhibition period, the organizer laughed and paved the way for the later investment promotion.

In the next three years, whether it was designed to design Shanghai, it has become a major indicator of the brand's sufficient funding. After all, it is the most expensive exhibition in the industry. The audience was judged to be squeezed into the circle with a ticket to design Shanghai. The booth is expensive and the tickets are expensive. As soon as the exhibition season, even those in the industry must be busy raising tickets everywhere, otherwise they will not be able to pay a difference with friends and relatives. I used to carry out on the first day to help the media contact the staff to see if the friends who missed registered reporters went to watch the exhibition. It's hard to make up for the time. At that time, the only thing that could ask for help was probably the ox at the door.

The original British exhibition team, the foreign design brand of the Manchuria Hall, in the first exhibition propaganda said that 90%of the brand came to China for the first time. Coupled with the big coffee designers, they are sought after like celebrities. Michalyoung hugged the baby in the forum, socially socialized, and became an Internet celebrity. Photography enthusiasts, seeing the cute curly hair dolls slammed, and the Magis classic plastic PUPPY KIDSCHAIR on the circle of friends. In the second year, designer Marcelwanders not only brought limited works designed for Christofle and Baccarat, but also settled in the booth early to adjust the exhibits to the most ideal state. Just like the director, the light and shadow and angle on the stage are particular, so the effect is good.

Such a grand occasion lasted for six years, and in 2020, it changed. The organizer Media 10 was collected when he saw it. The main position was sold together with the design Beijing to sell to Clarion Events. This is a British company established in 1947. In 2017, it was acquired by the U.S. Private Equity Fund Blackstone Group for £ 600 million. It has many exhibitions in the field of design and fashion.

The new team took over, and the exhibition moved from the Shanghai Exhibition Center in the city center to move to the Expo Exhibition Hall in Pudong. At the beginning of the year, he encountered a new crown epidemic. There are two consecutive variables that have repeatedly reduced the expectations of it. The exhibition time moved from spring to autumn. When I feel that it is victory as long as it is opened, the others can talk about the epidemic.

I did not expect that the epidemic was three years, let alone the design exhibition stopped, and even the normal life stopped. When everyone recognizes the lifestyle, there is also new ideas for the design needs and positioning of design. Design and art have many interlinked places, the old saying is the cultural relics of the prosperous world, and the gold of the troubled times. These icing things are more used to meet spiritual needs. Although the design products have the most basic use function, they have too many replacements, cheap prices, and moderate appearance, and can also bear the general needs of life. At this time, the design items are facing challenges. How should it be accepted and paid for the concept of life aesthetics.

In fact, this problem exists ten years ago. The home design industry has been in a difficult country in China. On the one hand, local design power cannot keep up. Many products can only rely on foreign brands. The market, but the real audience is limited. The brand side and professional buyer, coupled with the media concentration of firepower to cultivate the market for ten years, have achieved some results. When designing Shanghai in 2014, everything looked prosperous. Everyone was full of confidence. In particular, I saw that the design exhibition could break the circle and feel that the spring spring should really come.

I did not expect that another ten years, everything was not what everyone imagined.

This year, the design of the Shanghai Exhibition no longer see the queuing long dragon, and the ox has given up on the star concert next door. Although the number of participants in the end is more than 70,000, 75%are still concentrated in the professionals. After all, the explosion of the circle returned to normal.

The iconic works at the entrance before each year have disappeared. From the work "Dragon" made by Peter Linnett in the first year, to the "time devourer" designed by British designer and inventor Dr. Johnc.Taylor in the second year, it is also a dragon, 24 carat -plated colors, and the blue -like color. The organs closed their mouths every five minutes. These have all become standard in the circle of friends, and also become the standard photos designed in Shanghai. Even in 2020, it was difficult to move a chandelier of the Dutch designer brand Mooi, and the audience patted it left and right.

All this has become a past. This year's exhibition hall comes in, looking at it at a glance, a horse Pingchuan. Each booth seems exquisite, but it is bland. The exhibition is not complicated, which means that the cost is not high, but it is not a span, and it is neat and clean.

Although the organizer promoted that there were more than 600 design brands from more than 40 countries and regions, the scale increased by 50%, and the internationalization of the exhibition was not affected. However, walking in the exhibition hall of lamps and furniture, it feels that China is a home that is not allowed to be. Familiar domestic brands, familiar products, and familiar exhibition methods are concentrated together.

The third floor is the newly added lifestyle and accessories hall this year. The home accessories category such as porcelain, incense, vase, and tapestry are concentrated. This is a relatively concentrated area for foreign brands. Fuli brocade Fuli exhibits the "Energy Garden" art weaving car blanket series of British "fashion godmother" Sandra Rods, which has become the most gorgeous area in small fresh colors. Germany's Meissen, Wedgwood in the United Kingdom, Christofle, French silverware brand, is exhibited in a well -existing family. Although it is not fancy, it can be explained that they are still there. Without moving out of China, they can feel a little gratifying. Just affected by the epidemic, the new products of each family are limited, and most of them are classic models. At the booth of Danish porcelain Royalcopenhagen, the salesperson is making live broadcast, and the lace series is introduced with emotions. The legend of ancient times, ancient craftsmanship, and ancient patterns, these still need to be said in today's market.

For a while, Chinese media peers always ask the organizer a question. For example, how many Chinese designers are involved? Whether it will be supported by China. The answers are always friendly and open, but in the end, it is mainly based on foreign design. But this year's design Shanghai, the follow -up report of the media, is very concentrated to a group of young Chinese designers.Yes, it is courage. In fact, whether it is a young designer or a mature business brand insisted on the exhibition, whether Zhang Lei has persisted in the "Rong Design" exhibition area for 8 years, and designer Yang Mingjie, he continued to use his unique 3D printing symbolic curatorial. Unit ", designed this industry, it may be indispensable to be courage. Especially when a reincarnation of ten years, can the market and confidence accounted for half of the market and confidence.

At the end of the exhibition, the staff of the organizer dragged a cart, which was filled with various trophy, and delivered them to their respective booths. Both the guests took a group photo, and the handshake wished each other. The original celebration was so simple.

On the other side is in the "TALENTS" exhibition area, a group of people in black sitting around the central round table. On the one hand, the round table shows the theme "banquet", and at the same time, the design model and semi -finished products are displayed above. People in black suddenly raised the red plastic bucket on their heads, sat here, and dispersed later, and everything returned to its original state. It was learned afterwards that this was a behavioral art made by an artist. The routine is broken, and the break is restored to normal. Perhaps this is also a design.

At the beginning of the summer, "Disappearing Exhibition | Act 4: Natural Determination" officially opened in the Museum of Museum of Art. In the convergence of nature and art, find the spirit of all things, the voice of life, and the deep connections that invisible to the natural world.

The "disappearing exhibition" inspired by Taoist philosophy is intended to echo the "disappearing building" of Fearoshi's concept. This is a small exhibition with a large number of works, a small number of works, but a large tension between the connotation of the work and the art museum building. The main purpose of the curatorial is to hope that the exhibition is centered on the architectural and design concepts of Yosanu. Each period invites different contemporary young artists -especially conceptual art, installation art and sound artists to participate in the exhibition. And look forward to letting more people understand these young artists through the platform of the art museum; at the same time, I also hope that the viewer will understand the architectural concept of Huyanura through artistic works, re -watch and experience the space of the art museum, and change from an angle to think about people. The relationship with architecture and nature.

** Regardless of human nature, or nature of nature, its original sound and vitality are extremely rich. Why is it a silent state now? Is it a person's participation and intervention? In a broad sense, people are actually a part of nature. ** "Disappearing Exhibition | Act Fourth Act" invited five artists of Jing Ao, Ma Laurentttré, Li Shun, and Xue Ruzhe from their different perspectives and experiences to discover and realize pure and original nature; Go to feel the hyperlink between humans and nature, the integration of human original power and the power of nature.

Will the forest think? Canadian anthropologist Eduardokohn's book "How Forests Think -Human Science" that humans can think like forests. Cohen proposes, "** We 'to survive in the Anthropocene -the uncertain era that is increasingly occupied by the world that belongs to us beyond human beings is increasingly occupied by" too human "things-- - We will have to take the initiative to cultivate these ways to think like the forest and think like a forest. ** "

** "Delo" Morning Dew **

The "Dulu" created in 2021 is a concise work of ethereal and artistic language. The weightlifting is light. It sounds like the sound of "repeated" impacts, each impact is like a reincarnation and a rise. For the artist, "no interpretation" is the original intention of this work -when the viewer sees the ball in and out of the circle orbit, the sound of spinning on the glass randomly hit the sound, the cleanest rhythm and sound will be filled in The conscious space of the viewer.

In this exhibition, the exhibitors deliberately presented the work of "Dulu" alone in the "tea room" space of Zhizhi Art Museum. The tea room itself has a special meditation architectural language. A rectangular glass structure with a steel frame looks like a minimalist work that can enter from the outside. The room is completely transparent, and people's activities inside are unobstructed. In this way, the viewer has both the user of the building and is also part of the building; it is not only a feeling of the work and part of the work. Because the "tea room" is surrounded by water, there is a calm psychological effect from the inside out.

Showing "Dulu" in such a space makes the sound of the work collide with the sound of the heart; let the sound and nature, meet with space, integrate with space, and feel the life of the work itself. "** I care about how individuals and works grow in the creation process. Starting in a random and primitive way, human original motivation and natural power links. **"

Jing Ao's personal creation mainly focuses on sound. In the process of exploring different sounds, a series of sculptures, behaviors, and images of different materials and new artistic styles are used as sound materials, which should be born from different environments. In the context of non -binary opposition, explore the relationship between "material" and "intangible material", and "unconsciousness" and "unconsciousness". Compared with the current artistic production model led by dialectical thinking, the creation of Scripture is more inclined to narrative literature. By telling a story, it is constantly raising questions and walking in doubt. In the process, the attitude and choice of life are honestly presented in the work.

Similar to the focus on the creation of Jing Ao art, Ma Lizheng "** has always been concerned about the complex spiritual connection between man and nature beyond the flesh and time and space." The artificial plant garden she portrayed from the artificial and plastic "Central Garden" from the city to the latest "MATRIX" plant series in 2022, which triggers people to real nature and between people and nature Thinking of hyperlinks. "Matrix" opened the new creative journey of Ma Liyu. The artist ** regards the world as a perceived substrate, focusing on discovering the hidden interaction between human subconscious and nature, and doing structured, figurative and abstract staggered. The visual presentation of raw is **. The artist believes that when a person returns to the body, and removes the identity mark given by all the acquired days, and the emotional links that transcend the differences and disputes can be widely established. This is the way the artist responds to the political and historical direction of the current turn to the confrontation.

The "Matrix-NO.6" exhibited in this "Disappearing Exhibition" appeared in the appearance of the river-this is also the "The Dead and the Dust" inspired by the Thames in London in London in 2015 After and the dust, the artist created the second time the theme of the river. In "Matrix-NO.6", the artist did not depict a specific river, but she recently visited a perceptual integration of various waters. Ma Lizhen has always used the habit of recording water flow, and often watch these recorded images repeatedly in the fast -paced working life, which makes her feel wrapped in a gentle power. Feel."So I focused on the texture and flashing of the water -like silk satin that flickered, and the branches are always accompanied by the waters. They often rush into the field of vision. Complex emotional connection. The grid in the picture is inspired by the comic narrative method. Each grid opens a different time and space door. Because in the face of the water, we always cannot observe every vortex at the same time, and when we are our View jump, the previous second has become a past. "

** The power of water is very special, gentle and powerful; water can change various forms, regardless of rain, ice, fog ... but the kernel has never changed **. From the new work of Ma Liyu, I felt the gradual maturity of the artist's creation and the pursuit of deeper spiritual exploration.

The work is presented on the corridor of the top of the art museum. On one side of the corridor is a white wall, and on the other side is the glass curtain wall. Daily and night, the sun and lights of the sun and lights are reflected on the tiles and glass outside the art museum, and the light and shadow are reflected on the work, so that the water pattern with a strong structure and layering in the picture moves. Nature's accidental joining seems to have once again created "Matrix-NO.6".

"As an artist, my mission is to convey a sense of universal sense to the audience, which aims to evoke the memory of sleeping, which is forgotten by the forgotten past 5000 years ago. It is an era that is closely connected to nature and is closely linked and has a sense of liquidity. *. "This time, Laurent Lettrée, a famous French sound artist, specially created an interactive sound installation work" Three Plancies "for the" Disappearing Exhibition ": Plant composition (in fact, you can trigger the biological response and activate the plant's sound).

I was fascinated by my voice since childhood. Since the age of five, he has often moved around with his headphones, carrying his mother with his mother to seize his favorite sound with her mother -whether it is going to the forest adventure or exploring in the city. He hopes that people can feel joy and laughter when facing the mysteries of nature, and wake up their curiosity about wonderful things. As the artist says: "Nature and plants are not just beautiful existence. Each plant has its own personality, characteristics, and sensitivity. We can speak some warm words to plants and make them grow more. There are more common points between plants and humans, exceeding our imagination ... "

"** Through my artistic expression, I humblely contribute to the transition to a new era. I hope that this era is characterized by improving awareness.

The series "Ge Zhizhi" began in 2009. At night, Li Shun drove through the streets of the city, while exposing various light sources with the camera in his hand for a long time, and then from tens of thousands of pictures, selected thousands of unconventional lines, and used it to imitate the dictionary as a dictionary. In the form of the head of Chinese, refer to the characters of the word to form the image of Chinese characters or Chinese characters. This is a difficult process and an interesting process.

The creation of "YYYY-MM-DD" began on January 20, 2022-the birthday of Xue Ruizhe's little daughter. This is a project related to life, and the artist will continue this project until the end of his life.

The creative process of painting is a bit like behavior, and one more time dimension. After laid the first layer of color, the artist sketch a flower daily. In this process, the flowers will change, bloom or fade. The artist truthfully draws their changes on the canvas, while the background layer retains the original, and does not cover it. "" Yyyy-MM-DD "is the anchor point for my daily life. I kept returning to the canvas and re-coloring. I set the size of the format to 50 × 40 cm in the suitcase to carry it to carry , Painting in constant migration. "

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-50-42-00-00/000185837_piclink.jpg)Each painting will use a piece of paper of the propylene color plate. When the picture is completed, Xue Ruizhe will sign the date of the day.

Xue Ruizhe's "YYYYY-MM-DD" series of works were displayed alone in the "cave space" on the negative layer of the art gallery in this exhibition. The concept of "cave" is one of the cores of thinking that Yan Reano has always runs through. Among his many architectural works, the concept of "cave" has been repeatedly reviewed by him. For Yanyanwu, "the cave is a medium connecting things on the left and right sides, so that there is a dialogue on the left and right spaces. It is not as closed as the cave, but the publicity is revealed while evoking publicity." The cave should be a place full of biological softness, and then it is implicated between people.

And Xue Ruizhe's "YYYY-MM-DD" presents different times, as well as life and death at the same time in the work-** Each work in this series presents flowers from life to death, open at different times, open at different times, open at different times, and open at different times. Status, this is also related to the artist's attention in painting.

Putting things at different times and placed in the same space; there is a time difference on the same picture, forming a common picture, showing the reincarnation of life- "from her birth to me to me "Death -from the birth of the daughter to the departure of his father. This is an art project that the artist will carry out a lifetime. It is passed down from generation to generation and endlessly.

Cohen's anthropological topic involves fundamental reflection on human beings and human centralism, hoping that we can learn to "ecological" our ethics. In Avila in Ecuador, Cohen deeply inspected the Luna's survival method through a national means, and tried to understand how they and the most "Being" (Being "in the world's most dense forests in the world (Being" ) Conditioning, such as the power of medicine, the power of the elves ... Cohen has always tried to say something that is related to "common", "this 'generally' makes us feel it It ’s 'there'. Opening our thinking in this way may make us realize that a greater us — a person can We are booming. This will be a gift we gift to the future, no matter how trivial. "

In "How to Think in Forest", Cohen believes that "** Everything is the same self as us. Everything is spiritual, the world is full of magical and spiritual **." Disappearing buildings, disappearing exhibitions, disappearing relationships. Those invisible are more important than visible. "Disappearing exhibition | Act 4", through the silence of nature, feel the voice of life.

It was the rainy winter when it arrived at Bilgen for the first time. Step out of the stations below the mountains, and then look back when you are in a small town, and feel the clearness between Tianhai.

At the edge of the Haikang, the Bryggen frame left by the Middle Ages "Hansa Alliance" is sharp and tough, and the fearing atmosphere exudes in the rain. Under the misty mountain, only two beams of lights can be seen, barely breaking the madness of the sea. The two yellow lights of Lengbuding became more and more light until they looked up, and looked up, and then I was surprised that a large boat like the top of the top directly entered the reality directly from the magic film. At that time, the Nordic legends were obviously obviously taken on the spot; myths were originally imitating realistic.

Later, I visited several times, and I went to Bergen in the early summer of this year. It was ten years since the first time. The "Northern Road" with a coastline of 100,000 kilometers (that is, the original meaning of the "Norwegian"). Essence I guess this is inseparable from the magic presented by Bolgen in the first impression.

I often watch music festivals across Europe. In the long run, it is becoming more and more sensitive to a holiday environment. Nature or humanistic buildings will have a profound impact on the viewing experience. In the early summer of Bergen, BergenInningal Festival is held 70 years ago. This art festival, which is the protector of the protector of the King of Norwegian Hallar V, is the highest in the four Nordic countries. On the show list, you can see the premiere of many local artists, and more than 70 places in the performance venue are all over 70 inside and outside the city of Bergen. Unfortunately, this year's temperature is a little lower than the same period of previous years, and it rains every day, and the open -air stage is a bit deserted.

In the same period, a jazz festival called "Nattjazz" (Night Jazz) was held. As the name suggests, it only opened every day at night. However, the concept of "evening" has nothing to do with the sky in early Xia Belgen: it takes 23 o'clock every night to go down the mountain, and the midnight sky is still dark after the midnight sky. The Jazz's big camp is in an old seaside plant that walks more than ten minutes away from the city center. This small red brick building is formerly the largest sardine canned factory in Norway. Today, more than 10,000 square meters are separated and rebuilt into a professional art place. , Can the Foundation of the Canadian Factory and some private sponsorship jointly take care of them. Over the past year, I encountered a sunny day during the Jazz Festival. The open -air coffee on the sea was full of people. Some people called the local apple juice to start reading newspapers. Jump directly into the sea to swim, and there is a giant cruise ship passing by from time to time.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-57-58-00-00/000185817_piclink.jpg)Photography: Zhang Lu Shi

There are several trails between the city center and the old factory building. The most pleasant street will pass the houses on the hillside. These houses have different colors and forms, but they can be reminiscent of the "Bryggen" of the houses listed in the World Heritage List. In 1070, Bilgen, which was built in the city, was the first capital city of Norway. It was monopolized with the northwestern coast of Norway. It was across the sea in the east of Oslo, the capital of the capital of the East, and shared the sweetness between the "friendly competitors". These distinctive houses in the port have been stored in the warehouse of fresh fish for hundreds of years. Bergen in the Middle Ages was a trading center between Norway and Germany, England and Baltic countries. Dried fish, cod liver oil, and catfish were the hottest export products from then on. The Bryggen is the site of the "Hansa League" that has been organized in the 13th century in Nordic and Germany in the 13th century. In addition to these bright cultural relics, the government stipulates that all national cultural relics must be applied with white paint, and the white building must not be damaged. Today, Bryggen's warehouse has become a colorful seafood restaurant and tourist shops. The unique wooden house structure has also become the most popular local attraction.

There is the oldest elementary school in Northern Europe near the wooden house area. The long queues waiting in the summer are often lined up on the street. Following the steep and narrow cliffs slowly rising to the top of the mountain, the fjord and urban scenery spread in front of the eyes. Every night at 23 o'clock, people who go up the mountain to watch the sunset are endless. The day is impermanent. I like to go to the top of the mountain for a while. The small town looks vast and mysterious. Then I take the opportunity to enter the northern European monster Troll's blocked forest for a while.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-57-58-00-00/000185815_piclink.jpg)Photography: Zhang Lu Shi

On the other side of the harbor, which is opposed to Bryggen, stands several modern buildings with glass, including the indoor fresh fish market built on the original site of the ancient fresh fish market ten years ago. In summer, there are stalls outdoors. Many years ago, the citizens of Bergen knew that a Hong Kong girl in the market was enthusiastic about explaining and choosing seafood for Chinese tourists to see her this time. As long as it is close to the fish market, the fresh fishy smell can't linger. Each stall in the fish market is equipped with a large fish tank. It can be seen that the "swimming water" live crabs and lobster, which are rare in most European countries, lying between the various large fish lying on the ice on the glass cabinet. There will be an uncommon dark meat.

When I first saw the "Whale" on the label, I thought I had read it wrong, but in fact, hunting marine mammals was a tradition of the Norwegian Stone Age. Essence This custom is controversial internationally, but in the Belgen Fish City, many stalls will also marked the English "whale" in front of the stalls, with small paintings to attract tourists to taste new. Vladimirepak, a chef from South Korea, is now rooted in Oslo and Bergen, mentioned that the whale also brought the hometown with the custom that the whale meat was a bit like "peace". However, he also opened a restaurant in Oslo. After all, Bergen relied on the sea. Compared with Oslo, salmon, scallops, and emperor crabs and lobster from Sotra west of Bergen were much more fresh.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-29T23-57-58-00-00/000185816_piclink.jpg)Photography: Zhang Lu ShiHowever, the 19th -century veteran stock exchange building in the center of Bergen was transformed into a more particular hotel five years ago. One year ago, the Frescohallen Hall on the first floor of this late classical building was changed to Dining room. The dome and decoration of the new Renaissance style, especially the paintings of the Norwegian 19th -century painter Axelrevold, which is covered with the four walls. A kind of smoke is filled and is very charming.

Norway, with crude oil and fisheries as its main productive forces, has always been rich. Ten years ago, it was enough to generously provides refugees for Afghanistan and Chechen's refugees. Bergen, a city with a population of only 270,000, is still a paradise for the industry. In other words, it is not difficult to get the desired life. This is also a city that uses universities as a land center, and the youth culture is very prominent. I heard that compared to many European countries, the Norwegian government has a high investment in education. Therefore, it is circulated here: Only those who do not want to read books, but those who do not read the book: refers to the government designed by the government for the "student designed by the student -age student. "Loan", a good school can be paid by the government first, and it is not too late to find a good job in the future. Of course, this is also an adventure. Some of them are people who have not returned the tuition of college in the year. House loans can also be replaced simultaneously: 80%of young people here have bought a house as soon as they graduate, and renting a house is rare.

The small windows on the top of the heavy rain fell, and the red and yellow houses were printed outside the window. Over the years, I remember that in the 18th -century house in one of the small streets in the city center, there was a "Bergen Manufacturing" design store leased by six independent artists. The experience of Eirik, one of the masters, can be regarded as a typical history of Bergen creators: he was born in visual design. He started designing T -shirts in Oslo in the early days. Original design works of artists and students: from T -shirts, postcards to crafts. Like many designers, Eirik has another ideal work that is also related to art. There is a vinyl record shop that has been opened for many years. There is no 15 square meter shop for many years. It is full of 15 square meters of small shops. Bergen's independent music is dense and rich. This is also the space for on -site concerts. The rain was still down, reminding me of a sentence, "The moss marks are green, and the grass color is green."

Russell said that the nearly half of Haiti's population is 5.2 million unprecedented people, which urgently requires humanitarian assistance, including nearly 3 million children.

Russell said in the briefing that violent armed gangsters controlled more than 60%of the capital and large rural areas in the capital.

She said, "Our team told me there that the situation has never been as bad as it is now."

Russell pointed out: "Unprecedented hunger and malnutrition, extreme poverty, economic paralysis, cholera resurrection, and severe unsafe situation that causes fatal violence."

She said that what exacerbates the crisis is that the flood and earthquake that ravaged the sea "continues to remind us how fragile the sea is in the face of climate change and natural disasters." She then reported that the gang used rape as the "intimidation and control weapon". The witness of the victim is shocking.

Russell said that at the survivor asylum center of Prince Port, "1 11 -year -old girl told me with the weakest voice that 5 men caught her on the street."

"Three of them raped her. When we talked, she had been pregnant for 8 months and gave birth to a child a few days later."

Russell said that a woman told her, "The militants broke into her house and raped her. Her 20 -year -old sister resisted, they set fire to burn her, and then burned the house."

She said that in ruthless violence, schools and public areas should be a safe space, but this is not actually the case.

Russell accuses the international community of standing stand by.

She said, "The whole world has disappeared the people of Haiti. Unless we take action immediately, it is difficult to imagine that the people of Haiti will have a good future." She said that the Haiti government asked the international community to provide assistance and has not yet received a response.

Lai De said that the United States "take measures to alleviate" the emotional collection of balloons. "Of course, our efforts will help this", but he has not further explained.

From the end of January to early February this year, the giant balloon of this device flew from Alaska in northwestern United States to South Carolina in the east. It passed through the sensitive military facilities, which was worried that Beijing was seizing important information.

On February 4th, the US military shot down the balloon empty on the sea outside South Carolina, and then salvaged ashore in the Atlantic Ocean. Since then, it has been studied and analyzed.

This incident triggered a new wave of tensions between Beijing and Washington. US Secretary of State AntonyBlinken canceled the long -established China visits in February, and the purpose of this China trip was to improve bilateral relations.

China Yokou denied that the balloon was to collect emotion, and said it deviated from the route when entering the United States.

At the time, a US official said that the balloon had multiple antennas, including a group of configurations that could be used to collect communication and geographical positioning. The official said: "This balloon is equipped with a large enough solar panel, which can generate necessary power to run multiple sensors that actively collect information."

Earlier this month, before Brinton re -arranged for visiting Beijing, the White House deliberately diluted the impact of the entire reconnaissance balloon event.

President Biden said: "I think the leadership of the (China) does not know where it is, what is inside, and what happened ... I think it is more embarrassing than intentional." (Translator: Xu Ruicheng /Calculate: Zeng Yixuan)

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The Supreme Court of the United States overthrew a precedent for many years on Thursday (June 29), and ruled that universities and universities could no longer incorporate race or ethnic groups into consideration factors.

Six in the court [Conservative Judge](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/遭爆私下表決廢止墮胎權-美最高法院下令徹查/a-61680580)—— John Roberts, Clarent Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neilgorsuch, Brett Kavanaugy, and [Barrett](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国大选倒数一周-巴雷特宣誓就职大法官/a-55406033)(Amy Coneybarrett) and others, voting in favor of canceling the race -based enrollment considerations. Elena Kagan, Soniasotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, voted to support these considerations.

In the end, the Supreme Court was discriminated against with a 6-3 votes that identified equal rights action (Affirmative Action, also known as preferential differences), not used to ensure diversity, and improve African, Spanish and other minorities Tools for group education opportunities.

This ruling is for the oldest private universities and public universities in the United States: Harvard University and North Carolina University. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in most opinions: "You must treat him / her according to the student's personal experience, not based on the race."

### Who submits this case to the Supreme Court?

This case was mentioned by a group claiming to be a group of Students for Fairadmissions, and the founder was Edwardblum, an initiator against equal rights. Blum advocates that race as admission factor is unfair to white and Asian American students and discrimination.

The group claims that the practice of the University of North Carolina violates the 14th amendment of the US Constitution, which is the principle of equality protection; Harvard University's practice violates the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Civil Rightsact in 1964, that is, [ Forbidden discrimination based on race, skin color and nationality](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/小美人魚中國票房差-種族歧視作祟/a-65804107)Essence

In the case on Thursday, the group asked the court to overthrow the 2003 Grutter V. Bollinger, which allowed the school to use race as admission factor in a very narrow situation.

The Supreme Court of some states has overturned the equal rights action of some universities, but those who support equal rights operations believe that the diversity of the campus is hit; the decision on Thursday may also affect the recruitment of the workplace.

### response of American politics

Chuckschume, the leader of the Democratic Senate, said that the ruling was "judged by mistake." He said: "On the road to racial justice in our country, the Supreme Court's ruling set up huge roadblocks. The nation will immediately feel the consequences of this ruling, because in the enrollment procedure of next year Compared with their parents and sisters, there will be fewer opportunities for the same college or university. "

Former US Vice President Mikepence, who intends to compete for the Republican presidential candidate, said: "In the United States, there is no room for racial discrimination. I am very happy that the Supreme Court has ended this kind of serious violations of citizens and constitutions during the enrollment process. The practice of power will only continue racism. "

[Former President Donald Trump](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国华人-我选特朗普是出于无奈/a-36341953)The Barack Obama also expressed their support and opposition on the ruling.

There were three conservative judges appointed by the Supreme Court. Trump said that the ruling was "surprising" and said that on Thursday, it was a "beautiful day" for the United States on Thursday.

Obama said that although the actions of equal rights are "never a complete answer" for a more fair social process, it still brings opportunities for those who were excluded in the past and proved that these people "fully worthy of possession of a place is a place. "".

![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-06-30T02-33-00Z/66075656_401.png)The Supreme Court of the United States decided to overthrow the enrollment policy of equal rights, and US President Biden delivered a speech on the 29th to respond to the incident.

### What do you say?

A few hours after the Supreme Court announced a few hours after the decision, US President Joebiden made a brief and exciting speech in the White House. He strongly opposed the majority of the court's opinions, but supported the claim of the opposition, saying that the ruling "made decades of precedent for decades."

Biden said that over the past 45 years, colleges and universities have been able to independently decide how to enrich the student group, and racial diversification will make schools and even the entire country stronger.

Biden encouraged colleges and universities to consider the adversity that individual students overcome in order to win the qualifications for admission. Considering that some people live in poor communities, study in vulnerable schools, and grew up in low -income families. He said: "Disclosure still exists in the United States, and today's ruling has not changed this."

Biden also tried to resolve the criticism point of "racial factors to enroll enough students to be accepted", and further criticized the more favorable admission policy for those who had the same school in the same school in the same school. He said that this traditional policy "expanded privileges rather than opportunities" and sighed: "It has been too bad for workers for a long time."

"Remember, diversity is our power." Biden finally said, "We can't let this ruling be determined."

Article 23 has always been a political "hot potato" (information photo).

** The "Hong Kong National Security Law" has been implemented for three years, and this official claims to be "Dinghai God Needle" and "only a group of people" laws. As of now, the crime rate is 100 %, which has been accused of causing a cold effect in Hong Kong society. **

The Beijing and Hong Kong Government stated that Hong Kong has "from chaos, governing and promising", but still to beware of "soft confrontation" and national security risks. Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao's preview on the eve of July 1st has a timetable for Article 23 of the Basic Law involving national security.

The authorities have not yet announced the content of the draft, but the analysis believes that the 23 articles compared to the National Security Law as "symbolic significance than reality", and at the same time marked Beijing to further tighten the ideological work of Hong Kong.

In 2003, the number of Hong Kong citizens went to the streets to demonstrate, opposing 23 legislation and request, then Chief Executive Dong Jianhua's steps down (information photo).

Article 23 of the "Basic Law" in Hong Kong is the terms of national security. It stipulates that the SAR government shall prohibit the seven categories of acts that endanger the national security.

The "seven sins" of Article 23 include: rebellion, division of the country, inciting rebellion, subverting the Central People's Government, stealing national secrets, foreign political organizations or groups to carry out political activities in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's political organizations or groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups. Foreign political organizations or groups have been established.

In 2002, Dong Jianhua, the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong, launched local legislation, but the consultation period was insufficient, and the draft of the regulations was accused of blurring and harshness. The public worried about the freedom of speech and human rights. Later, the institutional liberal party, which represented the interests of the business community, made the government fail to obtain sufficient votes in the Legislative Council, and eventually withdrew the draft.

Since then, 23 have become political "hot potato", and the four special capitals have failed to complete the "constitutional responsibility."

However, Professor Chen Wenmin, Dean of the School of Law, the University of Hong Kong, publicly refuted the statement that has not fulfilled the "constitutional responsibility", saying that 23 articles did not explain what the way to use, but only said "self -legislation", and the country required by Article 23, and 23 countries required to require Security law has always existed in the current laws of Hong Kong, but it is scattered in different provisions.

He pointed out that on July 1, 1997, the Interim Legislative Council passed the "Hong Kong Return Regulations" and changed the "Emperor" and "United Kingdom" and other places to "the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China".

The current "Criminal Crime Regulations", "Official Confidential Regulations", and "Association Regulations" all have crimes such as incitement, rebellion, and spies, which have already covered 23 requirements.

### 23 What is the difference between the crimes of the National Security Law?

The Li Zhiying case is one of the iconic cases of the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the details of the use terms and procedure rules have always received much attention (information photos).

Chinese said.

In 2019, Hong Kong broke out for the "anti -sends" campaign due to the revision of the "Fugfeng Regulations". Beijing was regarded as "anti -China -China chaos" and "color revolution". In order to split the country, subvert the state power, organize terrorist activities, and intervention in foreign forces, the first two overlap with 23 parts.Song Xiaozhuang, director of the National Hong Kong and Macau Research Association, wrote in the "Bauhinia" magazine in the "Bauhinia" magazine that 23 legislation does not have to repeat the two crimes that the "National Security Law" has covered, and can be concentrated in the remaining five sins.

It is worth noting that the definition of 23 articles on the crime of "subversion" is different from the National Security Law.

### With the "National Security Law", is there still an urgency of 23?

The June Fourth Candlelight Gala, which has a history of more than 30 years, was also unable to hold it after the implementation of the National Security Law. The picture shows the Hong Kong police stationed in Victoria (data photo) on June 4, 2022.

Hong Kong's current laws have included 23 requirements to a certain extent, but some laws have been accused of outdated.

For example, the "Official Secret Regulations" covering the crime of spy are localized the laws entered into the United Kingdom in 1919, and the rebellion under the Criminal Crime Regulations still retain the words "Her Majesty of the Queen".

Guild member Tang Jiazheng said in an interview with BBC that the laws passed by these Hong Kong -British governments have been more than 30 years or even 50 years. " "Inconsistent, so now there is a very urgent need to modernize these laws into the needs of 23 articles."

Professor Chen Wenmin of the former School of Law of the University of Hong Kong has pointed out that the existing legislation needs to be reform and time to advance, and it can be discussed by the Legal Reform Commission. It is not necessary to force 23 legislation for political convenience.

He also said that the current law is not only insufficient, but is too harsh. For example, there are three people in the past cases that have been placed in bombs, which have been regarded as a war against the Emperor (Chinese government). Today's Basic Law and the guarantee of human rights.

Dr. Li Enzhen, a visiting researcher at the Law School of the University of London, also told BBC in Chinese that the annual outdated legislation has its necessity. "The problem is, now want to update to more stringent and infringement of human rights, or is it more in line with human rights protection? "

Li pointed out that the "National Security Law" is currently a legal weapon to control society. There is a long -term influence that has achieved great deterrent effects. He questioned the urgency of 23 legislation.

"Is it an objective and reality, or the urgency of political propaganda, and slogan? From a government perspective, constantly establishing new national security laws, further extending the power of the national security system in Hong Kong society, are more beneficial to the government's tough governance. ","

### 23 "Political Task" is imperative?

Analysis means that national security has become the core idea of Xi Jinping, so that 23 legislations in Hong Kong have more important political symbolic meaning

Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao recently stated that 23 legislations are priority work, emphasizing "faster the better" and "not a mess".

Current affairs commentator Lin He Li pointed out to the BBC in Chinese that the current "National Security Law" is enough to maintain the "stability" needed by Beijing. Two times. "

Chen Jingxiang, a senior media person, previously wrote in the Ming Pao and analyzed that the previous government in Hong Kong several times has "unmoved", but this time it is bound to complete the legislation during the first term of Li Jiachao, because Hong Kong is now by the Party Central Committee of the Party Central Committee. Leading directly, maintaining national security is the core idea of Xi Jinping's era.

He pointed out that after Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he established the National Security Council and proposed the "overall national security outlook" for the first time. The 20th National Congress also said that "national security is the foundation of national rejuvenation." In this context, the 23rd legislation in Hong Kong is no longer as simple as the "constitutional responsibility" that was said to be in the early stage of return, but the primary concern and major political tasks of Zhongnanhai.

He cited the precedent of Macau. Even if the local national security law version of the "mild" national security law was established in the early years, more than ten years later, they must catch up with Beijing's political situation and revise the provisions more. National ", there is no" two systems ", related laws must be aligned with mainland China.

Zhong Jianhua, a Hong Kong social policy and public administrative scholar who has moved to the United Kingdom, said that Hong Kong's sovereign transfer has been transferred for 26 years. Article 45 and Article 68 The political system reform, that is, the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council have a method based on universal selection.

"After the legislation in 2003 is unsuccessful, the general understanding is to wait for the third chief executive election method in 2007, and then promote a more reasonable election before 23 legislation is carried out. This (implementation of general elections) is actually constitutional responsibility. Now Beijing Speaking of part of it does not talk about part, no one can stop him from castrating the Basic Law and the breakdown. The SAR government seems to want to use this (23) to express loyalty to Beijing. "

### 23 Is there a conflict with the National Security Law?

The National Security Law has a driving position and is accused of infringing human rights and freedom (data photo) that guarantees the Basic Law.

Article 23 is local legislation. The National Security Law is a national law that implements in Hong Kong. The Security Director Deng Bingqiang described it earlier that the two were "complementary."

In 2020, the number of overwhelming votes of the National People's Congress of China with 2878 votes, 1 vote against, and 6 votes abstaining passed "the decision and enforcement mechanism (draft) of the establishment and improvement of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to maintain national security." Chang Wang Chen mentioned at the time that 23 people with ulterior motives were seriously stigmatized and demonized, and it was difficult to approve at the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Therefore, it was necessary to "establish a legal system from the national level.

Beijing directly includes the National Security Law into the Annex III of the "Basic Law" in Hong Kong and announced its implementation in Hong Kong. This is regarded by the outside world as an bypassing local legislative procedures in Hong Kong, which is equivalent to "illegal legislation" to destroy the Hong Kong and two systems, two systems and high autonomy.

According to the official explanation, although Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Government should "legislate" on national security, it does not rule out that the central government has legislative to maintain national security, but also refers to the national security surpassing the scope of autonomy of Hong Kong. Article 18 of the Basic Law "National Defense, Diplomacy, and Other Laws in accordance with the Basic Law that does not belong to the scope of the autonomy of the Special Administrative Region in Hong Kong."

Public administrative scholar Zhong Jianhua said that because the "Hong Kong National Security Law" has been criticized in the international community, many countries and international institutions require the cancellation of relevant laws. After the Hong Kong Government is expected to complete 23 legislation, it will reduce the use of the "National Security Law".

Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao said in an interview with the official News Agency that the National Security Law and the 23rds of Article 23 plus "even if it is not overlapping, it is 11". See the big witch. "

The guild member Tang Jiazheng also told BBC in Chinese that the most controversial crimes have been handled in the National Security Law, and the remaining five sins believe that the controversy is not great. "The remaining, such as the crime of betrayal, how can there be controversy in the crime of betrayal? There are crimes in the world in the world.

Legal scholar Li Enzhen pointed out whether there are 23 disputes in addition to seeing the legal provisions "how spicy it is", but also depending on the procedure regulations, such as "whether the Hong Kong court has the right to review whether 23 is unconstitutional."

Li said that if the criminal procedures of Article 23 are aligned with the National Security Law, for example, there are chief executives designated judges, no jury, and bail arrangements for the National Security Law, etc., will still be regarded as destroying the principles of general law and judicial independence "At that time, the international community will believe that now it is the credibility of the Hong Kong government to destroy the judicial system by hand."

Hong Kong is currently strengthening national security education (information photos).

The Hong Kong Government has not announced the draft regulations on 23 articles, but the chief executive Li Jiachao told the official China News Agency that preventing the risk of national security must "be vigilant of the influence of ideology", and 23 legislation must take into account the "new method of appearing on the Internet world."

Public policy scholar Zhong Jianhua estimates that 23 articles may be added to the control network, and the provisions may be more widely written than the National Security Law, and it can be explained at will.

Hong Kong current affairs commentator Liu Ruishao, who is familiar with Chinese affairs, also expects that 23 will strengthen norms in terms of speech, publishing, and popular culture.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China recently reviewed the "Draft Patriotic Education Law". For the first time, it was mentioned that it was necessary to strengthen the recognition of "Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan", and "consciously maintaining the unity of the motherland and national unity."

Liu Ruishao pointed out that although the National Security Law has been abnormal in the past three years in Hong Kong's implementation, Beijing still feels that the situation is not as ideal. "His ideal is that everyone is actively patriotic, not passively obey." He continued that the CCP had a long -term consciousness of struggle and the devil of foreign forces.

"Even if Hong Kong has set up 23 articles, it is difficult for the demon to be unlocked, because this is their natural psychology and response, and they are also their needs and strategies -only in this way can we continue to create political tension."

DUV is the second advanced instrument of ASML, and the most advanced "Euv" light carved machine has been restricted and never shipped to China before.

Sources said that the new regulations in the Netherlands are expected to take effect in September; the United States stipulates that it may be announced at the end of July that it is expected to apply to ASML because its products contain American parts. In July, the United States is also expected to make other updates on comprehensive rules announced in October last year.

The Dutch government and ASML rejected Reuters' comment requests, and the US Department of Commerce, responsible for supervising export control, also refused to comment.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning responded at a regular press conference on June 30: "China resolutely opposes the concept of the United States generalized national security, abuses export control, and uses various excuses to use various excuses Administrative means interfere with normal economic and trade exchanges between enterprises, seriously destroy market rules and international economic and trade order, and impact the stability of the global supply chain and do not meet the interests of any party.

He completely agreed that Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC (TSMC), speeches in March, arguing that "chip globalization is dead." He did not point out what countries he said from the "government".

He said that the relevant industry has entered a period of turmoil: "Our industry itself is periodic, and every practitioner has its own way of responding to cycles. But the high uncertainty we face is exactly the destruction of globalization. What caused. "

The Yangtze River Storage was one of the 10 Chinese artificial intelligent chip companies facing the US export control last year.

Some scholars believe that the market's pessimistic expectations for the Chinese economy have led investors to discourage.

*** [Renminbi degrades Chinese senior officials to shout and stabilize the people's hearts](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/tj-09282022112210.html)***[** The exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar after a lapse of two years broke through 7 **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/2-09152022103223.html)The exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar fell below the 7.24 mark on June 28, and the exchange rate of the offshore RMB against the US dollar fell below the 7.25 mark. According to Sources quoted by Reuters, Chinese state -owned banks sold the US dollar in the future foreign exchange market, trying to prevent the decline in the RMB.

Zhang Dinghuan, an associate professor of the Department of Finance and Finance of Taiwan Hiravity University of Science and Technology, said in an interview with this station that the Fed did not rule out continuous interest rate hikes, and the US dollar still has a trend of continuous appreciation. In addition, China is affected by geopolitical politics, and the United States has formed a lot of pressure on Chinese semiconductor sanctions. In addition, the Chinese housing market has obvious signs of foaming, and the attraction of foreign capital is also declining: "The economic prospects of mainland China are not very clear. It is now at a turning point in economic development, and its demand for RMB is not so strong. The following is the key to the depreciation of the renminbi. "

** The advantages and disadvantages of the RMB depreciation **

Zhang Dinghuan further analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the depreciation of the RMB that the current supply chain in China moved to the south to move south. Although the authorities shouted a dual cycle in response to the disadvantages of the external environment and moved by domestic large -cycle internal demand, China still manufactured by manufacturing The main production base, depreciation is conducive to its competition with other Southeast Asian countries. However, depreciation of depreciation and exacerbation of foreign capital escape and domestic assets have shrunk sharply.

"The most afraid of economics is 'expectations'. If everyone expects to go pessimistic today, many investments will stagnate. The People's Bank of China will continue to create a possible future policy, so that investment funds will not be discouraged."

China's "Daily Economic News" quoted the point of view of Wang Qing, the chief macro analyst of Dongfang Jincheng, and also echoed the saying "steady expectations". He believes that "it is not necessary to keep a certain point, but to control the speed of depreciation and avoid market sentiment aside and extreme."

"Shangguan News" is "the RMB exchange rate" is "falling"? The article pointed out that according to logic reasoning, the RMB exchange rate depreciates, and the US dollar can buy more Chinese products, which is conducive to export. However, Manager Xia, who has been engaged in the foreign trade industry for more than 10 years, believes that "because the current global economic and demand is still low, foreign customers are more cautious, and the orders have not risen due to changes in exchange rates." The person in charge of the head of a large -scale service trade enterprise in China revealed that "in the face of the downward trend of the RMB exchange rate, some strong foreign companies often require enterprises to make additional benefits from export products to offset this additional exchange rate income." The person in charge said, "The decline of the RMB against the US dollar is not necessarily conducive to export."

"First Finance" quotes the "China Macroeconomic Forum" of Renmin University of China(CMF)Recently released the "China Macroeconomic Analysis and Forecast Report" related to monetary policy content, which mentioned that the core is to increase interest rate cuts and restrictives. " At the critical moment, we must increase the courage and courage of action, so as to break the pessimistic expectations. "

In a pessimistic atmosphere, the Chinese official media "CCTV Finance" gave the "big news" about the renminbi on the 30th: on the 29th local time, the Central Bank of Argentina issued an announcement saying that the RMB was included in the Argentine banking system to access coins. The species approves the domestic banking institutions of Argentina to open RMB savings and current deposit account business.

Liu Yuanchun, president of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, wrote that China does face huge challenges in the future, but at the same time, it also faces many opportunities, so it still has to have full confidence in the rise of the nation. He said that the so -called big change is to break the pattern of "the United States". "Those who get emerging markets to win the world", "Win the Asia -Pacific to win the world", China should transfer the focus from developed countries to emerging countries, rather than simply anchor the US market.

"Although China engages in the 'Belt and Road Initiative', actively attracts those developing countries, and wants to push the Chinese economy, the RMB internationalization, etc., but the results are not good. Many countries regret that after these countries are close to China, the economy has not improved to improve. It also owed huge liabilities and even forced to debt with important ports, causing the next election to lose. "Lai Rongwei, assistant professor of the General Education Center of the Longhua University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, made the above interpretation.Reporter: Huang Chunmei Responsible: Chen Meihua Xu Shuting He Ping.com Edited: Ruizhe

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-30T05-49-27-00-00/000186102_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

Ten years ago, when I first sent the boss to elementary school, the day of picking up the child to the child was so far away. When I went to study in the UK in 2004, the part -time job of a Chinese doctoral student at that time was to help British families pick up and drop children to school. At that time, how could I think this was so important? Unexpectedly, I became a full -time mother, and this became my daily life in the past ten years.

The reasons worth recording in the past ten years are because my educational thoughts have gradually begun to change. The Chinese mothers who have never lost on the starting line. Mom -because I gradually got rid of the life of being held in responsibility, I entered a new life that enjoyed personal rights. Please note that this is not selfish. At the same time, British Primary School is more helpful for the writing of British society's fairness and justice in the past. Because the elementary school itself is a social institution full of love, especially care for disadvantaged groups, and equality.

When the boss entered the elementary school at the age of four, I was in the UK, but my head was Chinese -style. Those who are full of brains cannot be lost on the starting line, Wang Zilong, and the unsuccessful child is their biggest failure. Looking back now, such thinking is scary and torture parents and children. But at that time, my parenting behavior was completely dominated by such a strange discussion.

At that time, I thought that there were many associations in the British primary school as China. As a result, I did not see the drumming schoolbags, because the schoolbags were usually only aquarius, and the lunch was free for lunch in the second grade. When I found that the boss had no textbooks, I did n’t do homework when I went home. I think the school teacher is too lazy, and I do n’t even want to change my homework. Later, I found that there was no homework in the entire elementary school (from Reception to Sixth Grade), and at most, parents accompanied their children to read a few English children's stories. Now that I have received such an educational method -why do I need to force my child to enter the race early, it is not necessary in the UK!Ordinary life is the choice of most British people, because this is equal to fairness and justice, everyone has dignity, and everyone has medical protection. If a British can't eat, it will definitely be British news and government scandals. What British society is proud is not the rich who earns a lot of money, but a person who has contributed to the fairness of society; politicians are even more unlikely to be loved by the British. On the contrary, judging from the recent British elections I have participated in, England's town -level members are not what the British like to do. Officials at this level are usually volunteers, mostly retirees. In some small towns, you can be an official without a campaign. It can be seen that being an official in the UK is not a career to be looked up. When the official salary is low or even, the opportunity for corruption has been basically eliminated, and it is supervised and criticized all over the weather. Because the development trend of British society is to allow the people to have more and more rights and allow politicians to accept more supervision.

At that time, I thought British Primary School encouraged competition and only liked to study good students. It was found that the boss was always divided into a group with the stupid students. The boss always needs to help other students, but the school does not praise students with good academic students and does not praise. Instead, I always praise the poor students. In competition, public schools help middle -class children to help poor students, so that everyone is as stupid, rather than let middle -class children chase private school students?!"Of course I accepted the equal view of the UK because even private schools It is also impossible to escape this full -bleaching movement -private schools provide scholarships for outstanding students who cannot afford tuition fees. They need to share campus resources with public school students, but enjoy tax -free treatment at the same time (because private schools have won welfare in history to win benefits in history Institutional treatment, the Labor Party has always canceled its tax -free benefits, because the Labor Party generally opposes the existence of private schools). The spirit of the equal rights movement has also been accepted by Niu Jian. The admission rate of public school students has been increasing, and even the saying that "the background of private schools will become the resistance of Niu Jian." My children are not interested in politics, but if they will follow politics in the future, unless they enter the Conservative Party, the background of the private school will not add points to them.

Regarding the relationship between parents and students, I once naturally believe that parents must care about their children's homework, otherwise they are irresponsible. At that time, a parent complained that the school asked the parents to help their children's homework. The reason was that "the homework should be completed in the school. How can I take it home?" I thought she was really a lazy mother at that time, so she shirk responsibility. Later, I realized that the homework of students (actually where is the homework?), The school and parents have a consensus -this is the responsibility of the school, and parents can ignore it. When I attended the Conservative Annual Meeting in 2016, a person in charge of a trade union said in the Education Forum: "Many parents return home after get off work. If you still have to control your children's homework, it is unfair to rest." It is unfair. "

I have grown up in a society full of responsibilities: to sacrifice personal interests for the country, to raise children to become beams, and to support my parents and so on. In the UK, these responsibilities are all countries and governments; the government dare not ask British citizens to take on what responsibilities. On the contrary, the sense of responsibility comes from social traditions, especially religious social traditions. As for whether you love your family and patriotism, it is the free choice of citizens. If you love it, you do n’t love if you do n’t love. It is pure feelings. Unlike the social contracts of family members set by Confucianism like China. Gradually, I unloaded the parent responsibility I once thought of of course. At first I blamed myself and thought I was selfish. Looking back at the kind of tangled mentality, it is an inevitable psychological response from the responsible personality to enjoying the right of rights. Few people can embark on this transformation, and most people spend their lives in their lives. My parents' experience in the past completed the transformation on this road, and gradually increased the consciousness of enjoying my rights as a person. That is not selfish, but the basic right to live.

Although British parents are very comfortable, they do not lack a sense of responsibility, such as participating in various charitable activities of the school. Participating in social charity in the form of volunteers, in my opinion, is the super popular behavior of the British popularity circulating in Christian civilization. In fact, citizens are responsible for social responsibilities. I went to school several times to help sell cakes to raise funds (very common primary school charity activities). Recently, the volunteers I have done are to cooperate with teachers to take 90 students to visit middle schools, and pay for nearly seven hours before and after. After learning to enjoy the high degree of rights given me to society, I have learned to express my sense of responsibility for society in the way of Britain.

In the 18th century, the Edo period of Japan was more important sources of fertilizer. However, the improvement of the improvement of the sub -channel system and the sewage treatment plant and the rise of chemical fertilizers, "lower fertilizer" lacks people to ask.

Because the septic tank sludge treatment is not expensive and the process is likely to destroy the environment, about 10 years ago, the sewage factory in Japan wanted to evoke people to re -use the "lower fertilizer", but it could never bring the trend until Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February last year. As a result, the price of global fertilizers soared, and finally ushered in a turnaround.

The "lower fertilizer" made by the septic tank excrement is about 160 yen per kilogram (about NT $ 34), and the price is only 1/10 of the chemical fertilizer made of imported raw materials.

In Kyushu Saga in the south, local officials said that the sales of fertilizers were 2 to 3 times in the past, and dozens of inspection groups from all over Japan visited the future.

In Miura in the periphery of Tokyo, the water and fertilizer car continuously load the sewage tank sewage to the treatment plant. After removing the water in the processing tank, the solid is fermented. Finally, it is used as a soil -like powder to pour the farmland. The occurrence of methane is used for heating water and power generation in the plant.

Miura Biomass Center pointed out that they have 500 tons of fertilizer per year, and this fertilizer is particularly suitable for leafy dishes such as cabbage.

The Supreme Court of the United States has made a decisive ruling, and races are no longer considered considered to be considered by universities. This landmark ruling has subverted the policy of equal rights action implemented in the United States for decades, and has caused a major blow to increasing the efforts of African Americans and other ethnic ethnic ethnic groups.

Comprehensive BBC and Reuters reported that the US Supreme Court of the United States on Thursday (June 29) ruled that Harvard University and the University of North Carolina (UNC) were in favor of 6 votes and 3 votes opposed to voting results on Thursday (June 29). (AFFIRMATIVEACTION) The enrollment plan is unconstitutional. These two universities are the oldest private and public universities in the United States.

The ruling written by Chief Justice Roberts said: "For a long time, many universities have missed a conclusion that the testing of the golden stones that believe that personal identity is not overcome challenges, cultivated skills or experience lessons, but their skin tone. Our constitutional history capacity Don't have this choice. "

Actival operation was launched in the 1960s to actively improve a series of compensation measures for employment, education and other opportunities of discriminatory group members, and a measure to increase diversity.

US President Biden said he "strongly" opposed the decision of the Supreme Court, saying that the United States needs "a new way in line with the law."

He pointed out that the Supreme Court consisting of six conservatives and three liberal judges was not a "normal" court. "We cannot make this decision a final decision, and there is still discrimination in the United States."

However, Biden believes that adding judges in the Supreme Court will be a "error". In the interview with Microsoft-National Broadcasting Corporation (MSNBC) on the same day, Biden said that the Supreme Court overthrowing the university's enrollment equal rights "may cause great harm, but if we start trying to expand the size of the court, we may always make it politically. This is unhealthy. "

Harvard University issued a statement saying that it will abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States and abolish the enrollment plan with racial consciousness to maintain the values of its higher education diversity and opportunities.

### U.S. equal rights bill: High court overthrowing the university's enrollment considerations of the cause of racial factors

** The US Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution banned universities from considering the applicant's racial factors during the enrollment process. This ruling has a milestone significance and has subverted the "Affirmative Act" (AFFIRMATIVEACTION, also known as support). **

This is one of the most controversial issues in the American education community. The Pingquanity Act was first included in the policy in the 1960s and was considered a measure to improve diversification.

The ruling of the High Court is suitable for all public and private universities in the United States. However, the most affected may be the famous Ivy League schools such as Harvard University, and tens of thousands of applicants are competing for hundreds of admission places each year.

The Supreme Court did not directly say that this ruling has overturned the legal rules of 20 years -that is, universities can consider racial factors in the overall efforts of establishing a diversified student group. But the impact may be very significant.

"The impact of this decision is much greater than the court's ruling." Stevevladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas, said, "In terms of all intentions and purposes It is impossible to consider racial factors. "

Harvard's admission data in 2018 shows that 22.9%of the freshmen are Asian students, and the proportion has increased year by year.

The two cases targeted at the US High School involved the recruitment of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. These two universities considers the racial proportion when enrollment. There is fairness. But opponents believe that this is a reverse racial discrimination.

The lawsuit of Harvard University was filed by a group of Asian American students. They claimed that Harvard's enrollment policy discriminated against Asians and underestimated their academic achievements and high scores.

Among the Asian groups in the United States, the "Equation Act" is one of the most controversial topics for a long time. Especially among the Chinese Americans who value the next generation of education, they often become their debate.

Supporters believe that the "Equation Act" can ensure that schools and companies avoid discrimination against minorities during the admission process, and Asians are also the beneficiaries of them. However, the opponents said that when Asians and African -American, Latin America and other ethnic minorities entered the candidate list at the same time, the bill tended to support the admission of other ethnic minorities such as African descent. However, many young generations of Asians believe that even so, the bill is to ensure the diversification of the student group, because Asian families generally only pay attention to children's scores, not diversified development.

Zhao Yukong, chairman of the Asian American Education Alliance, told BBC that he welcomed the high court's ruling. His organization believes that the equality bill has a negative impact on the probability of Asian and American students entering the elite school. "This decision will retain elite politics, which is the cornerstone of the American dream."

Judy Chu, a member of the California House of Representatives and chairman of the Asia -Pacific core group of Congress, said the cancellation of the equality bill "not victory."

She said: "For a few communities such as Asians, the admission of racial consciousness is unlikely to change the net number of Asians and Americans admitted to elite colleges, but from low -income, refugee or indigenous Asian students It will encounter more admission obstacles. This is why most Asians in the United States expressed support for racial consciousness. "

According to the study released by the research institution Pew Researchcenter on June 8, most (53%) Asians and Americans recognize the concept of "equal rights". But at the same time, the vast majority (76%) Asian people oppose colleges and universities in the process of enrollment as a consideration factors. Another study released on the same day showed that 50%of Americans opposed universities to consider race when enrollment. But 47%of African -American support this policy, and only 29%of white people also expressed support.

### Why is the US High Court ruled that the "equal rights bill" involved in race discrimination?

The ruling of the US High Court follows the ideological route, and a few liberal judges have different opinions.

The Supreme Court once again appeared sharp differences in ideology. The six conservative judges announced that this decision has taken a step towards a societyless society, and the quality of students will be measured by their achievements rather than race. The three liberal judges believed that this ruling ignored the discrimination of the United States for a long time.

In most opinions, John Roberts, the chief judge, will be directly linked to the university admission opinion in 1954 with a milematic Brown V Board Office. The case of Brown Education ended the racial isolation in the field of education.

"Elimination of racial discrimination means eliminating discrimination with racial factors," the Chief Justice wrote.

He said that universities cannot formulate an indefinite timetable for solving the problem of discrimination in the past. He refuted the explanation of Harvard University and North Carolina University to defend its policy. related.

Chief Justice wrote that the admission decision of university must be based on the applicant's personal experience and qualifications. But for a long time, many universities have the opposite.

"They mistakenly believe that it is not to defeat challenges, master skills or learn lessons, but their skin tone. Our constitutional history does not allow this choice."

The ruling once again reflected that the Supreme Court was exerting its strength to major social and political issues dealing with previous courts. Last year, the Supreme Court overthrew the protection of abortion and environment for a long time. Now, conservative judges have targeted the goal of college enrollment.

### In Liberal Judge, what reason does it oppose?Image source, getty images

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson published a harsh word.

The three judges appointed by the Democratic President condemned these rulings in the opinion, with a total of nearly 100 pages.

Soniasotomayor, a judge, wrote that this ruling "has always been important and continued to have an important impact, consolidate the superficial racial discrimination rules as the principles of the Constitution." She warned that this "the rules and major progress have been overturned for decades."

In history, Ketanji Brownjackson, Ketanji Brownjackson, the first black female judge in history. Regardless of race, it does not mean that the same is true in life. "

She also said: "Because the court and the country's actual experience are disconnected in the past and current experience, the court is now seduced to interfere (North Carolina University) and other colleges and universities to solve the problem of the real world of the United States."

After the High Court announced its ruling, US President Biden said "strong" opposition. "We can't make this decision a final conclusion," he said, "discrimination still exists in the United States."

### What will happen to American education?

Image adding text,

Harvard University in the world is one of the most competitive schools in the United States. Of the more than 40,000 applicants each year, only about 2,000 lucky children are admitted.

Although the court's decision is applicable to universities across the United States, nine states have taken measures to prohibit racial factors from considering the enrollment process of public universities. This may indicate the upcoming changes.

For example, California prohibits race -based "preferential treatment" in all government projects including public education 25 years ago.

Throughout the University of California, the number of representatives of ethnic minorities has declined, but the efforts of increasing diversity in other ways are still effective. The proportion of African -American and Spanish students currently recruited by the University of California Los Angeles is higher than that of the equal rights bill.

The Supreme Court stated in his opinion that applicants can still quote their race and discuss how the race "affects his/her life, whether it is discrimination, incentives, or other ways." Universities can find ethnic alternatives -such as economic disadvantages or geographical origin -to build a diversified student group.

However, how universities do this may be different from the state, depending on the conservative laws that the local politics and Republican "Red State" are passing, these laws prohibit the diversified promotion and participation projects of universities.

The National Space Mission for Earth Observation, which costs 1.2 billion AUD 1.2 billion (about NT $ 25.2 billion), just started last year, known as the key architecture of the Australian space industry.

The goal of the plan is to design, build, and run 4 satellites. Those satellites are scheduled to be launched from 2028 to 2033 to collect earth observation data.

Those information helps the authorities to predict weather, responding to natural disasters and management environments.

However, the Australian government in the middle said that the plan would be canceled due to the "budget correction". This allows Australia to rely on foreign partners to provide data on the earth.

Australia's Minister of Industry and Science Ed Husic told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) today that at the time of hard work with inflation, priority consider "broader environmental factors", which means "make difficult decisions" Essence

He said, "If I don't cut 1 billion A $ 1 billion here, then I have to squeeze out 1 billion Australian dollars in other places."

Despite the slow growth and the steady national defense expenditure, the Australian government has promised to balance the Treasury's revenue and expenditure this year.

The Space Industry Association of Australia said the cancellation of the satellite plan is "short -sighted and close."

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-30T08-02-08-00-00/000000.png)The "Online News Law" aims to support the Canadian journalist in trouble. Hundreds of publishers have closed down in Canada in the past 10 years.

The New Law requires digital giants to negotiate reasonable business agreements with Canadian media and pay the news content of the media, otherwise it will face binding arbitration.

Google stated in the statement that the new law "obstructs difficulty to do", and the government has no reason to believe that "the structural problems of law" can be solved after the law can be solved after the law is on the road.

Google pointed out in the blog post that "Canadian people search for news on the Internet" and "reporters contact the audience" will be more difficult.

However, the Canadian people can still enter the Canadian website directly in the browser or browse the Canadian website through the app.

Before Google announced the news, the Canadian government tried to persuade Google to cooperate with relevant policies, but the last negotiations between the two parties still ended in failure.

The social media "Facebook" parent company Meta Platforms announced on the 22nd of this month that it would block Canadian news on Facebook and Instagram.

These two companies with online advertising are often charged with media content but do not pay, which is equivalent to squeezing cash from traditional news agencies.

Stoltenberg pointed out, "The rebellion we saw last weekend shows that there are cracks and differences within the Russian system. At the same time, it is also important to emphasize that these are Russia's internal affairs."

German Prime Minister Schultz said that "Russia's regime change" is not a goal.

However, Ukraine President Zelezki delivered a speech at the EU summit on the 29th through a video connection, and to those who claimed that Putin was weakened would make him more unpredictable and dangerous, and sent a blunt information.

"We see their weaknesses, this is what we need."

He also said, "the weaker Russia, the more afraid of its leaders and the uprising, the more they will be afraid to anger us. Russia's weaknesses will make it safe for others. Its failure will resolve this war. The problem."

EU leaders agreed that the Wagner incident had a blow to Putin's authority.

Lithuanian President Sata is one of the EU countries bordering Russia. He insisted that the chaos caused by the rebellion of Wagner provided more reasons for Putin's tough attitude.

Natasa pointed out, "Some people say that strong Putin is more dangerous than vulnerable Putin. I don't agree with this view. We must move forward and take decisive actions because it is the critical moment of history."

Estonian Prime Minister Karas said, "We have no room for hesitation." "We must continue to increase the price of Russian aggression."

Many EU countries are also members of NATO. These countries seek more security guarantee to Ukraine at the NATO Summit at the NATO summit from July 11th to 12th -if they do not provide it with qualifications for member states.

It is expected that at the end of this two -day NATO summit, this approach to more support will be fully recognized.

Since the rebellion of the Wagner Group, Putin has taken action to regain control, but the Kremlin has remained silent to Russia's absence of Russia's deputy commander of Ukraine's military operations and other Russian senior military figures.

####  missing Russian general

After the rebellion of the Wagner armed forces failed last weekend, Russian general Surovijin faded out of the public vision, and it was reported that he had a sympathetic position on the goal of the mercenary organization.

The Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov told Russia's International Telecommunications Agency on the 29th that although many media claimed that Surovin had been detained, the whereabouts of the general should consult the Ministry of Defense.

The "Institute of War", a think tank headquarters in Washington, DC, said on the 29th that Peskov was deeply meaningful to the answer to the disappearance of the general.

The Institute of War pointed out, "If there is no survey against Surovin, Peskov can completely deny these guess about him."

The statement pointed out that "Peskov's rejection answer shows that Russian officials may be investigating Surovijin because Russian officials usually refuse to make any comments on investigations."

The Institute of War also pointed out that Russian sources gave mutual contradictory statements to the possible situation of Surovitin, including his contact with the security department due to his contact with the Wagner Group, and was later released.

The think tank pointed out that "after the Wagner organized the armed rebellion, Russian officials questioned Surovin or any other military officials who contacted Pricig's arbitrarily. This is completely logical."

When asked if Putin would continue to trust Surovin, Peskov only said that the president is working with the Chief of Staff of the Army Gracimov with the Chief of Staff of the Army.

Surovin is considered to be the allies of Pryigo, but while the Wagner troops entered Moscow last Saturday, he stood on the side of Moscow.

Description: The court made a ruling with the results of six to three. The judgment means that elite universities that seek to increase students' diversity may reduce the number of blacks and Latin students. Conservative groups welcomed this and Biden criticized the ruling. Kenny Holston/The New York Times people demonstrate outside the Supreme Court.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-30T09-40-37-08-00/30ambriefing-asia-nl-scotus-master1050.jpg)The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Harvard University and North Carolina University have racially conscious enrollment programs. The latest ruling made by the Supreme Court, which is an absolute majority of conservatives, means that American elite universities that seek to increase student diversity [may reduce black and Latin people](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/us/politics/affirmative-action-college-students-black-latino.html?smid=url-share)The number of students.

The court made a ruling with the results of six to three. Chief Justice John G. G. Roberts wrote in most opinions that these two projects "inevitably use racial factors in a negative manner" and "involve racial prejudice" violated the Constitution.

Universities can consider how the race influences the student's life -for example, students may write this topic in applying for the paper -but he warns the school that this consideration should not be used as a hidden means based on race -based choices. "Universities cannot simply establish a system that we think today's illegal is established through application papers or other means," he wrote.

Unlike the court's opinion, Judge Sonia Sodomar summarized her objection -this is a rare move, indicating that the judge and the final ruling have serious differences. She said that the ruling "further exacerbated racial inequality in the field of education."

"How to emphasize this decision is not too much," she wrote.

The enrollment of Asian Americans has always been the core of this debate. For many years, the applicant has been [to dilute his identity,](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/29/us/affirmative-action-supreme-court?name=styln-affirmative-action-scotus®ion=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Interactive&variant=undefined#asian-american-college-applications)Make yourself "not so Asian." The plaintiff in this case has accused Harvard University accused of using subjective standards to measure personal characteristics for many years, and systematically discriminates against Asians and Americans.

Many Americans welcomes this decision of the Supreme Court, especially conservative groups and Republican leaders. Several recent public opinion surveys show that most Americans do not support race as a factor for admission.

Matt Schrap, chairman of the American Conservative Alliance, one of the largest conservative groups in the United States, said that the court's ruling and the decision to terminate the constitution of abortion right last year "is a trusteter horn that restores our dilated constitution."

President Biden criticized the ruling in a TV speech a few hours after his ruling, saying that the state cannot allow this ruling to become a "final decision" for the issue of equal rights action.

He said, "discrimination still exists in the United States." He repeated his words to emphasize. "Today's decision has not changed this."

" The Federation of Trade Unions specially hired a professional law firm. In 2022, 101 legal aid cases were accepted by the union, 100 lectures on law publicity lectures were carried out, and 25 enterprises also carried out free medical examination services for the rule of law to effectively safeguard employees' rights and interests.

In addition, according to Qianlong.com, in order to achieve "where the migrant workers are friends, where they have their warm home", Fengtai District has established 7 "[Home of Migrant Workers] who moved with the construction site of the construction site.(http://society.yunnan.cn/system/2022/08/26/032249445.shtml)"There are 173 such homes in Beijing.

Wang Zhenhua, chairman of the Fengtai District Federation of Trade Unions, said that "Beijing Fengtai Trade Union is fully improved to improve the sense of happiness in industrial workers." There are their warm home ", and the money of taxpayers has established so many homes." So, the union claims that these work and achievements they have done have nothing to do with industrial workers who have owed wages in the construction site of Fengtai District? In other words, these are the slogans that must be shouted, and have nothing to do with the rights and interests of the construction industry workers?

Please listen to the workers' salary representative Ye Xiangming's conversation with me.

Does the union go to the union to know this?

Please listen to these questions and talk to the Changzhen community staff.

Hipkins faced domestic criticism because of not spending more time to propose New Zealand's concerns about China's infringement of human rights in Xinjiang during the visit.

Malhota said in an interview with Reuters that the relationship between China is very complicated and "we are very careful." She said that Hipkins' attention to trade did not change the foreign policy of New Zealand, but showed that there was a series of interests in New Zealand and China.

The statement issued by Hipkins and Xi Jinping did not mention human rights issues or the Taiwan Strait crisis. For the notification issued by former New Zealand Prime Minister Adon and Xi Jinping after meeting in November 2022, these two points were mentioned.

"I do not doubt that the discussion involves trade and economic issues, human rights issues and the issue of Ukrainian war."

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand stated last week that in the past 50 years, "through joint efforts, on the basis of mutual respect and seeking common ground while depositing differences", relations between the two countries have made great development.

For a long time, New Zealand has been regarded as a mild or even absence of China in the Five -Eyes Intelligence Alliance. However, last year [China and Solomon Islands reached a security agreement](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/所羅門群島證實-王毅本週到訪簽多项双边协议/a-61910783)Later, New Zealand's attitudes in security issues and China's increasing influence in the South Pacific were tough.

"In some periods of difficult times, we have always maintained a diplomatic dialogue with China," said Malhota, but did not explain it in detail.

From a wider perspective, she has become more and more complicated by foreign policy and geopolitical challenges, including the impact of climate change on countries, the Ukrainian war, and a large number of refugees that need to be resettled.

In the summer solstice of June 21, the highest temperature reached 38 0 C; on the Dragon Boat Festival on June 22, the highest temperature was another floor, 39 0 C; on June 23, the highest temperature soared to 400 C. In the summer of the summer, the air conditioner was turned on, and a bit of rice dumplings could not be done.

Unexpectedly, the soldiers of the Wagner Group on June 24 suddenly stirred the world and hung my spirit. Since then, despite the scorching sun and high temperature, my little life has been moisturizing. What is the moisturizing method? In a word, I was so idle in Midsummer, and laughed at the goose and goose.

Both Putin and Pleigo are not good birds. The two fights, many people call it a dog bite dog; I find the word: goose and goose. The two geese are different, there are dramas to watch, there are secrets to peep, emotional can be expressed, there are questions to think ... So, is it pleasant?

On June 24, I was happy. It is not to be happy, but to be happy. "A Garden" author Lao Dao, the "Dongli Handmade Beer" commissioned by Mei Mei, came home on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. Since the 24th, I am happy every day and enjoy three cups. On June 27, under the sincerity of singers in the community, I went to the opening ceremony of an art festival. Zhang Hong brought Jiaxing meat dumplings and Lingnan litchi to visit Teacher Ding Zilin, an 87 -year -old. For many years, Teacher Ding has always lived deeply; in addition, her family has not opened WiFi, so she neither turns over the wall nor WeChat. When I was out of the door, I told Zhang Hong that I must tell the ups and downs of the ups and downs of the goose and goose in the past few days.

Needless to say, after joy, I also move my mind. These days, good articles about the two popular fighting have made me dizzy. And the live broadcast of Mr. Dakang, New Zealand on Youbutu (oil pipe), I also patronized according to time and did not fall for a day. In this essay, I want to talk about my two viewing experiences of "laughing and watching goose and goose".

The first experience is: the two -Paponal incident makes Putin's "tough guy" internal background exposure.

In the past few days, the world has witnessed the following scene: Even his home and dogs dare to call him publicly; he asked Lukashenko to get rid of his embarrassing situation; The hat of the "tradition of the country" was blowing the wind the next day ...

Putin has been lying on the pinnacle of power for more than 20 years, and it seems that he can control and control everything. To be honest, the "tough guy" image he carefully created has really bluffed many people. Now, the buns are exposed, and the background is exposed. Even a host of the Russian National Television had to admit that this incident "is a serious blow to the external image of the country and a serious blow to the authority of the president. What, but the results, if you have seen it, it is not, everything is not shaken. "

The second experience is: Pryojin vomited the truth, and torn out the painting of the "justice and reasonableness" of the Whard War.

On June 22, Porigoin, who had decided to petition, released a video speech. In the speech, Pricigo vomited the truth in his speech; I think that the most hit Putin's weakness and dead acupoints is the following words: "In the past eight years, Ukraine has not bombed Donetsk, but it is just a bombing of the Russian army position. Just; Ukrainian armed forces have no intention of attacking Russia with NATO soldiers. The Russian Ministry of Defense is deceiving the people and presidents. " Exchange Medvekkak. The real reason is that the Russian rule group who is not satisfied with Donbas hopes to appoint Modwauch as President Ukraine.

It can be imagined that the above -mentioned mantra of Pricigin will make Putin extremely annoyed and make goose powder uncomfortable. Putin's pro -soldiers, the anti -Ge's hit, made the Russian invasion of the Ukraine War's despicable intentions and exposed it completely; the hammer and tingling caused by Putin and goose powder, from some kind of In a sense, it even exceeded the relevant resolutions on the Russia and Ukraine War made by the UN General Assembly. According to my observation, since the outbreak of the Russia -Ukraine War on February 24, 2022, the fans of the goose fans are lost, depressed, and mood low, especially these days.

The two geese are each other, no matter how many goose feathers falling, the Ukrainian military and civilians and the world anti -aggression camps against the Russian defenders are a great benefit. On May 24, a whole month ago, Wagner's convergence, I said in the article "Humans will usher in a milestone civilization new victory": "In fifteen months, Russia's military strength has been proven, and the killing is decided to decide The timing is coming. "It should not be foreseeable: As Ukraine's anti -attack stabilized and stabilized, Ukraine will eventually recover all the territories including the Crimean Peninsula, thereby winning the glorious victory of the Patriotic War. At that time, people would see the tragedy situation of goose feathers and goose feathers in the defeated middle school.

After a goose feathers, is Russia reborn or fall apart? Obviously, it is difficult to conclude that it can only be seen. However, for me, one thing is to do what I want to do, that is: before you watch the situation and wait and see, you will get together with the friends of "A Garden". Not return.

June 29, 2023 at the home in Beijing

[Trump](https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/te-lang-pu)Get nominated by the Republican primaries in 2024.

Reuters reports that this lobbying group, which has a 20 -year history that is committed to promoting tax cuts and reducing government supervision, will take the first time in the preliminary selection of Republican presidential candidates.

The 87 -year -old Charles Koch ranks among the global super rich. His family company Kochindustries is headquartered in Kansas, with business over fossil fuels, commodity transactions and other fields.

The "American Prosperity" initiative of the Koch Super Political Action Commission has raised $ 70 million, and it is still unclear. How many of the funds will be directly used for Trump.

However, the US prosperity initiative has clearly stated that defeating Trump in the Republican primaries is their primary task because they believe that Trump will lose to Biden again in the presidential election in November 2024. In the 2020 US presidential election, Trump was defeated by Biden.

The person in charge of the US Prosperity Initiative said: "We have a strong sense of urgency, and we must choose a candidate who can be elected president. In fact, Trump (former) President's own large supporters can also be elected for him to be elected. I feel worried and hold an open attitude towards other alternative candidates. "

This conservative lobbying group was founded by Charles and his late younger brother David Koch. David Koch died in 2019 at the age of 79.

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-30T10-32-08-00-00/000000.png)In this sensational social trial, the jury ruled that the 60 -year -old former deputy vice sheriff Scott Peterson had no fault in the Parkland campus shooting.

On February 14, 2018, the 19 -year -old gunner Nikolas Cruz entered the campus with a semi -automatic rifle, shot 14 students and 3 faculty members with a gun, and injured 17 people.

Although Cruz is known to have psychological diseases, he can still buy powerful weapons.

Pittson, who was the school policeman at the time, was charged with failure to enter the teaching building to hunt on Cruz. Even if he had weapons at the time, he had received training in confrontation with the gunner.

Pitterson was considered a law enforcement officer to be charged because of the failure to take action in the American campus shooting. He was charged with a number of guilty of neglecting children's felony, defeat, and one perjury.

The jury today ruled that all allegations against him were not established. Pitterson was so excited when he heard the verdict.

After four years of litigation, he said outside the court, "My life is back again."

Mark Eiglarsh, the appointed lawyer of Pitsen, said that "this is not only the victory of Pitterson, but also the victory of all law enforcement officers."

Parkland campus shooting shocked American society, and once again set off a debate on gun control. Some deceased and the family members of the wounded turned their spearheads to Pitsen, thinking that he had to be responsible for it to some extent.

Prosecutor Stevenklinger said in the trial that Pitterson, who has served in the law enforcement industry for 32 years, has received relevant training for such attacks, but at the time of the incident 48 minutes until the shooting ended.

Klinger said, "There is a gunner outside the crime. You should go to the sound of gunfire. You have received training to find the gunner, because each gunshot may be the passing of life."

Pitson's lawyer claimed that his client was just a sinful lamb and denied that he was a "coward." He argued that Pitson could not judge where the gunshot came from where the vast campus came, and said that he "has done everything with limited information."

New Zealand Foreign Minister, Nanaiamahuta, said in an interview with Reuters on Friday (30th) that New Zealand is carefully managing the relationship with China and must avoid the situation of left and right in the United States and China in strategic competition.

At present, Chrishipkins, New Zealand, led a six -day trip to China to visit China. In this trip, he held a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, focusing on economic partnership and trade. However, he faced domestic criticism because he did not spend more time in the interview.

In the statement after Hipkins met with Xi Jinping, no concern for human rights or Taiwan Strait issues were not mentioned. For a long time, New Zealand has been regarded as a country that has a mild or even absence of China in the Five Eye Alliance.

Malhota told Reuters: "The relationship with China is a complex relationship that we are very cautiously managed." She said that Hipkins's attention did not change the foreign policy of New Zealand, but it shows that New Zealand and China have extensive interests Essence She has no doubt that the issue of human rights will be discussed.

In the interview, she also said: "In the Pacific region, we are facing the challenges of strategic competition between the two big powers. New Zealand hopes to ensure that we will not be controlled to manage important relationships in a way that can safeguard our own interests."

According to the Australian media recently reported, Malhota was reprimanded by the other party for an hour when he met with Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang in March. Malhota said on the 27th that the two sides did have a "very warm" discussion at the time. At the meeting, she mentioned "profound concern for the state of human rights in Xinjiang and the freedom of Hong Kong's rights."

The security guard standing at the entrance said that since the start of the pop -up shop for three days, he refuses about 20 bribes of about 20 people every day. He said that their offer is often $ 20, but some people bid up to $ 100.

On Sunday, the last day, the first batch of shoppers arrived around 6 am. Shein starts at noon. Throughout the morning, the team continued to expand, first began to fold, then passed through the food square, passed through the milk tea stall and the Mediterranean barbecue. Those who arrived after 12:30 noon were suggested to go home -they did not have the opportunity to enter the store to buy a daisy earrings at a price of one dollar, a four -dollar bucket hat, a $ 12 knitted navel top, a $ 13 artificial leather stick bag and the $ 13 $ 29 Neon PVC Mueller Slipper.

"We had to take the figures on the window," said the guardian Di Dixon pointed at a place where the white sticker was peeled off, where the closing time was at eight o'clock in the evening. The stock was insufficient that day, and the store closed at 4 pm.

The enthusiasm of this group of people is a remarkable scene. After all, many shopping malls have been [hard work] in the past ten years.(https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/briefing/shopping-pandemic-american-malls.html)Attract such a crowd: About 700 people waited outside of a shop that was painted into a white, where it was the store of the American Eagle Brand Clothing Company, which was sandwiched between Swarovski and Bath & Body Works. On Friday, the first day of the Shein pop -up store opened, a man proposed to his girlfriend in front of the entrance.

"I'm really nervous, I want to surprise her," said the 23-year-old Niimi Jamie-Vega. "She loves shein." His fiancee, 22 -year -old Michelle Alvarado nodded. "Too cheap," Saturday afternoon, she said after patronizing the flash shop for the second time. She was wearing a red lit tattoo knitted top, and she was priced at shein for $ seven dollars; she said she would buy two orders every month.

These pop -up shops are not the way most people interact with the brand. So far in 2022, SHEIN has only held five such activities in the most valuable market in the United States. However, these pop -up shops are not so mysterious to make this China Fast Fashion Company look so mysterious. According to Sensortower's analysis, shein (official pronounced "she-in", but people usually read "Sheen") -The recently surpassed Amazon, becoming the largest download application application in the United States. Herchi is a private company who refuses to disclose financial data, but according to CoreSightresearch, the company's revenue in 2020 reached US $ 10 billion.

However, with the growth of SHEIN, doubts about their practices have followed. Disputes caused by SHEIN are common in the newspaper, such as [Sale](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shein-nazi-symbol-swastika-necklace/)Nazi cross necklace with a price of 2.5 US dollars or [plagiarism](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/20/1018381462/why-indie-brands-are-at-war-with-shein-and-other-fast-fashion-companies)Designer's work. (The company said that it seriously treats the infringement claims and requires the supplier to prove that its products have not infringed on third -party intellectual property rights.)

SHEIN is also accused of cooperating with suppliers that violate labor laws, and did not disclose the factory conditions. In response, the brand pointed out that it has "regular internal audits" and "strict" that meets legal providers. It also signed a contract with companies such as OpenView and Intertek to audit its facilities; the company said: "Once illegal behaviors are found, we will take further action, which may include termination of the contract."

Last year, a Broadcasting Corporation's "Market" column [Survey](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-fast-fashion-chemicals-1.6193385)It is found that the lead content of some Shein products exceeds the standard, including children's jackets and mini wallets. Shein said that it will regularly detect products in accordance with the standards of international regulatory agencies and "immediately revise unscayed places."

All of this has made SHEIN a typical example of a specific style of ultra -cheap clothing companies: it is the same as Fashion Nova and Boohoo.(https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/style/fast-fashion-gen-z.html)The best person, but also criticized (including [Z Generation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shein-haul-backlash-11656504321)) Speak accusations of [excessive consumption and waste](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html)The atmosphere.

However, shein claims that its clothing production is "transformed": starting from small batch (100 to 200 pieces) clothing ordering, and collecting customers' reactions to various small batches before ordering large orders.

Nevertheless, there are many videos on SHEIN on social platforms -including those very popular "sun -order" videos, that is, it is a large number of products that people buy one by one to show the doubts of comment: How can we guarantee the durability of a four -dollar top, so as not to eventually fall into the landfill? How can workers who sew and transport this dress get fair compensation?

However, these problems do not stop the enthusiasm of Shein fans. Many of them believe that there are not enough reasons to convince them not to buy products of the brand.

25 -year -old An Taylor is a top fashion in Toronto [Internet celebrity](https://www.instagram.com/being.mary.jane/)She received the brand's gift card and also claimed that she saw similar comments in the video. She noticed that in most cases, these people would mention concerns about the company's violation of labor law.advertise

Taylor was not convinced. If it is reported that the company violates regulations such as child labor law, "I will definitely oppose it," she said. "But if the workers complain that the salary is too low, it is completely two -cooked with forced children to work."

32 -year -old Pittsburgh information technology professionals Steven Pruga uses they and them (they) as their own pronoun. They say that SHEIN's pricing and many large size options have allowed them to disclose their non -non -non -non -non -non -non -non -non -non -non -non -non -size options in 2020. After binary gender, you can try your personality style -in order to understand what kind of clothing is suitable for their body shape.

"You can create a pretty good wardrobe without spending a lot of money. This is really good, especially for many low -income people, those who cannot afford $ 100 a piece of skirts," Pruga said, saying, saying, saying, saying, saying, saying that They estimate that one -third of these people's wardrobes come from Shein.

Although Pruga has always been willing to resist the companies that have donated money for anti -LGBTQ organizations for anti -LGBTQ organizations for moral reasons, they still feel that "every company you consume has a lot of black history. To be honest, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you It's really powerless. "

But this will not stop SHEIN to try. George Jiao, president of Higin US, said that the company plans to promote it through social media since September, allowing people to "understand" its efforts in terms of labor, sustainable development and product security. The company also vigorously "promotes the concept of approachable -shein is a easy -to -buy brand."

"Although the online allegations, rumors, and attacks are mostly false, we have some responsibility for the dissemination or continuation of these false narrations," said George Jiao, who has been working in the company since 2015. "We ignore the need to truly communicate and interact with customers and communities."

However, George Jiao believes that the negative discussions on SHEIN on the Internet are largely the result of people's "pressure by peers". He said that the Internet's debate on SHEIN is similar to that of politics.

He knew that most customers would not shake, and still focused on low prices.

"I don't even go to H & M," said Jamie Vica in the Dallas couple engaged in the Shein store, because H & M's price is higher. Alvarado refers to his big handbags: a variety of shoes, clothes, accessories, and beauty products in it add up to $ 100.

This marketing method not only did not win people's hearts, but caused violent criticism on the Internet.

It has become a symbol of the identity symbol of the creators on Instagram and the Tiktok platform. Frima has been working for SHEIN for two and a half years.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/business/shein-fast-fashion.html)She regards this trip as an important opportunity.

However, although the brand often arranges such a trip to promote new products or speculate on the Internet, SHEIN's publicity points are unusual. It arranged Freman and several other US Internet celebrities to visit its factories and logistics centers and meet with workers. Shein is being reviewed by more and more regulatory censorship. The company is trying to solve the allegations of the use of forced labor manufacturing products. It is hoped that creators will release some more positive content during this trip.

Shein's wish was realized: Frima made 11 posts on Instagram, including videos praise Shein and her working environment. She had 3,1600 fans on Instagram. She and other creators who participated in the Shein paid travel showed the neatly placed clean SHEIN parcels, the robots of the goods, and the rows of happy workers in their contents.

"They don't even have a drop of sweat," a creator named Desteini Su Dusi on Instagram and TIKTOK [Post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtnPlOMpO_M/?hl=en)explain. (Su Dusi did not reply to the reporter's comment request.)

But shein and these creators not only did not win people's hearts, but were criticized by social media users in the past week. They were doubtful about these videos. Shein was forced to issue a statement saying that seeing the creator was "sad" and performed the "physical and mental health inspection" (what Frirman said), to determine that they had suffered a bitter online attack. The situation.

These creators have been deleting negative comments under their social media account and publishing videos to defend themselves. This trip has become a negative textbook for marketers: Shein uses net red to improve their reputation's efforts instead alienated consumers and attract people's more attention to bad business behaviors.

Although the number of net celebrities on TIKTOK and Instagram has increased more and more times, "I really don't know that there are any other situations like shein have obvious intentions." Internet celebrity marketing agents [OBVIOUSLY](https://www.obvious.ly/home)Founder Mei Kavoski said. "This requires people to put away suspicion to a large extent, because it seems obviously a propaganda."

Shein said in a statement that the trip "reflects a way we listen to feedback."

"The videos and reviews they posted on social media are real. We respect and support each Internet celebrity's views and voices on what we have experienced," the company added.

Shein is an online retailer established in China more than ten years ago. Because of its easy -to -use applications and low -cost fashion clothing and accessories, [quickly received by American consumers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/business/shein-fast-fashion.html)Especially among young people in their teens. Although most fast fashion companies have faced criticism of their production methods for a long time, SHEIN's allegations are also used in the supply chain to use forced labor, and [plagiarizing the design of other companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/business/economy/shein-temu-forced-labor-china.html); SHEIN was also reviewed because it sent cheap products directly to the business model of the American shopkeeper's house. Shein said that the company's business method was "legal".

Although the company's current headquarters in Singapore, production is still in China. As American legislators have made a wider blow to Chinese companies such as Tiktok, shein has also received more attention.

According to reports, SHEIN has been considering the first public offering, and the company has been working hard to win the favor after maintaining relatively silent for many years. The company has established a second -hand clothing department to avoid people's unsustainable criticism of their products. Hiring independent designers designed new products for them, and invited lobbying agencies to speak in the federal government.

Shein seems to hope that this influencer travel can help it offset the negative news of one after another, including a [British News](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/inside-the-shein-machine-untold/on-demand/73730-001)The Channel reported last year that the survey found that in order to produce a large number of fast fashion clothing, shein violated the law for some workers to work for 18 hours a day. An article from Bloomberg News [Report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-21/shein-s-cotton-clothes-tied-to-xinjiang-china-region-accused-of-forced-labor?sref=zVYYYI5e#xj4y7vzkg)It is said that according to the detection of its commissioned laboratory, some Shein clothing uses Xinjiang cotton. Out of concerns about the infringement of Uyghur human rights dominated by Muslims, the US government has banned imports from Xinjiang.

"This activity launched by Shein is essentially to change people's views on the working conditions of these factories," said Krichina Subramanan, the founder of the Internet celebrity marketing company Captiv8. "From the perspective of Internet celebrities to change people's views, it is more effective and credible than the brand themselves."

As far as this activity is concerned, the video made by the Internet celebrities has caused resentment, because the Guangzhou factory they depicts has a strange optimism, and the company tries to make these Internet celebrities famous for designing clothing and advocating self -confidence. The role of reporter. Although [there seems to be no negative report on the company](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/style/shein-clothing.html)Fans of this retailer, but public praise has attracted people's attention.advertise

According to statistics from social media analysis companies TrendPop,#Sheinbrandtrip,#Shein101,#Sheinfactory, etc. The topic labels related to this trip have obtained millions of views. On TIKTOK, the video that has been deleted by the creator has gained new vitality, because other users use the editing tool of the application to add comments that they expressed suspicion and panic.

Coriman and other creators were confused about the response of users. She said that she originally thought that she showed herin factory from her own perspective, which would let people share her positive view of the company and the trip, and she thought the trip provided her with useful information. She said that because of her cooperation with Shein, she had received hate emails before, but did not expect that the intensity of this response was so great. (In the past, the Internet celebrities who were sponsored to travel to Saudi Arabia, and net reds who have recently sponsored by makeup brands Tarte to Dubai for luxury travel have also been strongly criticized.)

Friman said she asked the workers and Shein representatives to ask their working conditions, and these people told her that they operated honesty and checked the working conditions. She said that in addition, she didn't know what else could do.

"Why can't I say that this is the real situation I saw, and my experience with this company?" Friman asked. "This is what I see with my two eyes, what I see, and what I experience."

She added, "My own eyes have not seen what others are talking about."

Danni Cabina is also one of the net celebrities who participated in this trip. She used the Danidmc net name on social media, and she called herself "confident activity persons." She was particularly criticized because she called herself as "investigating journalists" in a video that she posted on Instagram. That video has been deleted, and Kabonari did not reply to the reporter's comment request.

In fact, SHEIN's travel arranged for Internet celebrities and the opportunities to contact them provided by them are in sharp contrast to China's increasingly hostile attitude in recent years. According to this year [March Report] [March](https://fccchina.org/2023/03/01/media-freedoms-report-2022-zero-covid-many-controls-covering-china-in-2022/)The negotiations on issuing a new visa to the US news agency in China in China have fallen into a deadlock. At least one American journalist who holds a valid visa has not been able to enter again after leaving China for a daily trip.

"This is a very obvious example that uses creators who talk about specific things such as lifestyle, fashion, and self -confidence to promote the products, and then try to use them to promote a completely different agenda." Kavasky said.

Kabonari on Tuesday on Instagram [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct-TG-prC0-/?img_index=1)A video, saying that she should have done more research. She thanked everyone about her information about Shein and said that she had used this information to do her own education.

"I hope SHEIN can be more transparent and answer all your questions," she said. "Because I can be responsible for myself and my behavior, but I can't bear responsibility for Shein."

After the "National Security Law" took effect, many political parties and political groups in Hong Kong could not escape the fate of dissolution. Chen Baoying, the chairman of the "Social Ministry", told this station that as a political group, explaining their ideas to the public is the most important job. However, the implementation of the National Security Law cannot be implemented in the past three years, and it cannot affect their development like a parade. There are many difficulties to cross the risk of "National Security Law", and there are many difficulties to cross.

Chen Baoying: "The National Security Law certainly has a great restraint. When the government thinks is a sensitive day, the 'powerful department' will have a certain degree of obstruction and persuasion; At the time, we only have 4 people 'swing streets'. There may be more than 10 plainclothes policemen next to it, or they will use some laws that have not been used in the past, such as illegal fundraising. The "Inciting Crime" sued us, and it was possible for the comments that any authorities did not like on the Internet.

The "Social People's Lian" has persisted in the protests that have been returning to the day for many years, and the pressure was forced to cancel. On the June 4th anniversary of the past, Chen Baoying was holding flowers alone on the street and was taken away by the police. She acknowledged that it is difficult to continue to express their demands with action now, but no matter how difficult it is, he must do his best.

Chen Baoying: "Why should I stay in Hong Kong? Not to prove how brave we are, but when I see unreasonable things in Hong Kong, whether it is politics, economy or society, or there is ideas, we still want to express it. I hope that Hong Kong society has only one -sided sound. No matter how small the space is, the sound of the objection can be performed. Under such a big pressure, there are still people who are willing to speak. Let everyone see each other, it is a big encouragement. "

Chen Baoying said that after the "social and civilian" is mainly based on donations, the difficulty of fundraising and the termination of the bank account can only rely on members as volunteers to suspend the problem of insufficient funds.

Public opinion pointed out that the authorities had no choice but to create revenue. Reuters Information Picture [Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediaomiao/econ 06302023093102.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediansaomiao/econ-06302023093102.html/@@stream)Good audience and friends, welcome to listen to the financial and epochs of Liberty Asia, I am Rao Yiming.

China ’s local debt problems have been serious for a long time. In the case of finances, local governments have cleverly established their names and constantly issue various strange tickets for ordinary people to increase income. Recently, many restaurants in Shanghai have added cucumber shreds on Liangpi, which has been severely punished, causing heated discussion among all walks of life. Driven by this wave of fine economy, the people or stores have been repeatedly punished by the government for some small things. The living space of small and micro enterprises is more difficult. So what harm does the fine economy without control? Was the fine fines of some government departments or the acquiescation of the central government? Are cities that are not economically rampant concentrated in those areas? This program will discuss the above topics. The guests who participated in the discussion were Qin Weiping, an economist in the United States.

** Frequent fines in the catering industry **

Recently, the Shanghai Mi Fan Catering Golden Bridge Branch was severely fined 5,000 yuan for adding cucumber shreds on Liangpi. Many netizens scolded "absurd" and "abuse of regulations." In fact, this is not the first batch of restaurants that have been fined because of cucumber and cold dishes. According to reports, more than 1,000 restaurants have been punished for sale of cold cucumbers.

After experiencing the food safety crisis such as Sanlu Milk Powder, the Chinese government launched the most stringent "Food Safety Law" in 2015, but food safety issues are still endless.

For the catering industry, it is punished without a cold dish, but the threshold for applying for a certificate is high. According to the introduction of the internal reference of the owner of the WeChat public account catering company, taking the cucumber shreds that often step on the pit as an example, it belongs to a cold food food production and sale, and to obtain this license, it is necessary to have independence of not less than 5 square meters in the store. Space, with disinfection facilities, air disinfection equipment and independent air conditioners, which are difficult for the small catering industry.

In addition to the Cool Chan, more and more merchants have recently been punished because of "not prompting food waste". A consumer purchased 16 ice creams in a hot pot restaurant. Because the seal was not finished, the merchant was fined 2,000 yuan for the "anti -food waste supervision and guidance".

In March of this year, the Chinese market regulatory authorities deployed special operations to stop catering waste in the country, such as increasing inspections on key areas such as catering and takeaway, wedding banquets, buffets, and unit cafeterias. For platform themes, strengthen administrative guidance and prevent waste of order. For the main body of the merchant, advocate reasonable adjustment of the dishes.

China's "Anti -Food Consumption Law" stipulates that each catering service operator should take the initiative to prevent consumers from wasteing food waste, or order consumers to order an appropriate order by the waiter.

** Government governments have fined their fines for income **

Local government debt is exhausted, and the phenomenon of fines in order to create income is becoming more and more rampant. Last year, a vendor in Yulin City, Shaanxi was a heavy penalty of 66,000 yuan for selling celery that did not meet the food safety standards. Later, the media disclosed that the city's debt ratio in 2021 was as high as 123%.

In May of this year, the chaos of the over -limit transportation of Huangxian City, Anyang City, Henan Province became headlines. The reason for the ticket is overweight. Some truck drivers accused of complaints. Before departure, the truck was obviously not overweight and was fined. A driver received a ticket of 275,000 yuan in two years.

A driver in Hebei Province was also dropped by the Beidou positioning system. He was fined 2,000 yuan in Tangshan and was detained. He committed suicide. Less than a month later, another truck driver from Shandong, who could not afford a fine of 5,000 yuan, and committed suicide on the spot. Fortunately, he was rescued in time. These are the tragedies caused by the fine economy.

It is worth noting that the targets of random fines are usually individual households or small and micro enterprises, such as takeaway riders and the above drivers and restaurants.

According to the survey report of Beijing's "Finance" magazine, a total of 1.94 million companies in the 40 cities with the highest revenue in China in 2022 closed down, accounting for about 7%of the total. Among all the cancellation companies, micro -enterprises account for 57.4%. If small companies are calculated, the proportion is as high as 93%, reflecting that small and micro enterprises have weak anti -risk capabilities and are easily affected by the economic cycle.

Many small and micro enterprises in China have experienced operating difficulties under the impact of the epidemic, and they have closed a lot. In the case of China's economy, the local government has cleverly increased its fines, which will inevitably allow small and medium -sized enterprises to face a worse business environment. In this way, the employment and economic recovery of China will surely have a negative impact.

** Punishment is the most rampant in Northeast China, Southwest, and North China **

Punishment without income generally refers to the price of local governments during law enforcement, judicial agencies on illegal, illegal fines, and confiscated stolen money and stolen goods. It belongs to the non -tax income part.

Generally speaking, there are two main types of local governments: one is public fiscal revenue and the other is fund income. Public fiscal revenue mainly includes two parts: "tax income" and "non -tax income". From the direction of development, local government income should be based on "general public budget". The general public budget should focus on tax revenue. The proportion of non -tax income, including penalties without income, should be declining.

The ratio of no income and tax revenue in a city can reflect the quality of local fiscal revenue. Beijing Finance Magazine recently issued a survey and found that compared with cities above the 247 prefectures, it was found that the proportion of two-thirds of fines was concentrated at 3%-8%, and 29 exceeded 10%. The proportion of penalties for no income should not be too high or it should not grow too fast. High growth does not necessarily mean behaviors such as punishment and distribution, but it can provide a reference direction.

The investigation of Financial Magazine found that the proportion of fined income from 247 cities accounted for 5.8%, the highest value was 29.8%in Wuzhou, Guangxi, and the lowest was Suzhou 1.1%.

The 10 cities with the highest proportion of penalties are: Wuzhou, Hezhou, Shaoyang, Panjin, Ulanchabu, Jiamusi, Guangyuan, Xiangxi, Bazhong, Hechi. Most of them are located in the northeast, southwest, and North China.

The survey found that most first -tier and second -tier cities and cities in the provincial capital were relatively low in income, and the growth rate was relatively reasonable. The value of the third and fourth -tier non -provincial cities was relatively high.

The above is the current financial and economic listening, thank you for your listening. I am Rao Yiming. If you have any opinions and suggestions on this show, please write to fankui@rfa.org. Or my personal Twitter account is contacted by RFA_RYM.

# How the Supreme Court of the United States ruling will affect the future university enrollment

Creator: ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

Description: Because universities must abide by laws and admitted diverse students, the ruling of the Supreme Court may lead to more subjective processes in colleges and universities. Some predictions believe that the number of blacks and Western students in prestigious schools will decline immediately. Many universities in Kenny Holston/The New York Times have prepared for several months or even years for the ruling of the Supreme Court, and have begun to take measures to move towards the "racial neutral" enrollment method.

But on Thursday, the court on the two universities on Thursday [ruling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/us/politics/supreme-court-admissions-affirmative-action-harvard-unc.html)It may lead to the more subjective and mysterious enrollment system, because universities must abide by the law and admit diverse students.

Some schools predict that the attention of standardization indicators such as test results and class rankings will be reduced, and more emphasis is on the personal quality reflected by recommendation letters and application documents -this is the opposite of the hope of many equal rights bills.

"Will it become even more opaque? Yes, there is no way," said Daniel Renho Holy, who was about to take over as the dean of the Mun -Halio Oak College. "This is a complicated process. This opinion will make it more complicated."

In an interview, the founder and president of the plaintiff's "Student Fair Admission" organization, Edward Bloom, defended the "standard measurement method" of his so -called academic qualification. Curriculum homework helps to determine which students can win in a competitive school.

He promised to implement the decision and stated that "students' fair admission" and their lawyers "have been paying close attention to the possible changes in enrollment procedures."

He wrote in a statement on Thursday: "We are kept vigilant. If there is a university openly contempt for this clear ruling, we plan to file a lawsuit."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-30T12-30-26-08-00/00nat-affirmative-action-future-02-zpkq-master1050.jpg)For decades, the University of California Berkeley has been banned from the equality bill. Jim Wilson/The New York Times

However, it is almost impossible to eliminate any race in the process of enrollment -starting from the name of the applicant. In the judgment, Judge Roberts left room for the ethnic or ethnic background in considering the life experience of the applicant.

"Any content in this opinion should not be explained as a ban on the discussion of the university's discussion on the influence of race influence on their lives. Whether it is discrimination, incentive, or other ways," he wrote.

However, he also warned that personal statements could not play a hidden role in transmitting racial information. "In other words, they must be treated according to their experience as an individual, not based on race," he wrote. "For a long time, the practice of many universities is exactly the opposite."

Universities including Harvard University and North Carolina said on Thursday that they will abide by this ruling. But for the skeptician of the outside world, clarifying the intention of a university will be a challenge. How do they know whether an admission decision is based on an article about personal courage or the race of the applicant it revealed?

"I think a very reasonable result is that the school will cheat, and then said," Let's see who will be prosecuted, '"Richard Sander, a legal professor at the University of California, Los Angeles Holding criticism. "The chance of being prosecuted in individual schools is very low, and the cost of prosecution is really high."

Some educators have discussed how to use their personal statements when applying. Recently sponsored by the US Education Commission [Speech](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/SCOTUS-ACE2023-Transcript.aspx)Among them, Xiangnon Gandy, the undergraduate enrollment director of the University of Maryland, said that students' enrollment documents must be changed and describing how race affects their lives.

"Now, the students write football training and the death of my grandmother," she said. "They don't write the tests and suffering they have suffered. They don't write those challenges they have to experience."

Universities can also require applicants to submit other more targeted documents, such as statement of "diversity, fairness, and inclusiveness". Such a statement is very common in faculty recruitment.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-30T12-30-26-08-00/00nat-affirmative-action-future-zcpt-master1050.jpg)Xiangnon Gandy, the undergraduate enrollment director of the University of Maryland, said that in the university application documents, students "will not write the tests and suffering they have suffered." Shuran huang for the new Yorktimes

Holly, who is about to serve as the dean of the Martholo Oak College, envisioned such a problem: "Various diversity is one of the core values of the Mantholio Academy. Please tell us why you pay attention to diversity, and What do you think you can make on this issue to Mantholio's College. "

University officials predict that the number of blacks and Western students in prestigious universities will immediately decline, just as the result of the ban on public universities in California and Michigan from California and Michigan. Last fall, of the new students of the University of California, Berkeley, black students accounted for only 3.4%. At this time, it has been effective for 25 years.

However, in about 100 schools that take equal rights measures, many of them have been prepared for several months or even years for such a situation. These schools have begun to move towards the enrollment era of "racial neutrality", that is, while trying to comply with legal provisions, we try to retain the spirit of equal rights.

The rigorous academic rigor is still important, but the standardized test is not needed. In some cases, even reading is not even exams.

The school is increasingly inclined to admit students from low -income families, or the "first generation" applicant -the first college student in the family. They are investing a lot of funds to support students and provide more demand -based economic assistance.

Some prestigious schools are also likely to play a more direct role in cultivating potential applicants.

For example, the University of Virginia announced a plan this month to prepare for high school cooperation with 40 applicants in the eight regions of the state. The University of Duke just promised to provide a full school aid to students from North Carolina and South Carolina, which earn $ 150,000 or below.

"The hardest part is actually looking for and recruiting students," said the Academy of Calton College Dean Elison Belly, saying that the college would expand cooperation with community institutions.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-30T12-30-26-08-00/00nat-affirmative-action-future-wctf-master1050.jpg)President of Colorado College L. Song Richard said that high -quality students have always been there. Stephen Speranza for the New York Times

Some educators believe that the experience of California after the ban on the Agreement in 1996 shows that such projects can work. The entire system of the University of California achieved the highest history in terms of diversity in enrollment in 2021. However, the recruitment cost is high, consuming hundreds of millions of dollars, and the strongest Berkeley branch still failed to keep up with the trend.

For some public universities (such as the University of North Carolina or Virginia), they have conflicted with conservative politicians in the "diversity, fairness and tolerance" policy, and the risks they face are also different. When the problem involves any vague racial neutral policies, these universities are likely to act with caution.

"Whether in Hongzhou or Lanzhou, one of the truly set off by public universities is to be politicized as much as possible," said Gordon Ji, the president of the University of West Virginia. "This is a bit like a Budweiser storm," he said. The beer company was resisted because of hiring cross -gender people's endorsements, [heavy losses](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bud-light-boycott.html)Essence

Stress may also destroy the entire process and cancel the preferential treatment of alumni and donors. These people are often wealthy white groups.

So far, most schools are resisting these voices, saying that these preferences will help develop communities and increase fundraising. However, as the outside world questioned the anger of university enrollment, many people believed that the system had been managed by the rich and the relationship households, and the court's ruling could force the society to reflect on.

"This is a major settlement of racial justice, but it is also an opportunity," said Socialist Jerom Karabell, a sociologist who studied university enrollment in the University of California. "It's time to start from scratch, see what we can do. The idea of this matter is endless."

The next thing is that according to their college entrance examination scores and interests, which school is chosen in the future? Which major to learn?

Recently, a video of the China Internet Da V Zhang Xuefeng has been on a video of the candidate's application for news. When Zhang Xuefeng answered whether a student's parental consultation should allow his child to apply for a journalism, he expressed his strong opposition, and even exaggeratedly said, "Saying the child, not letting the child report the news."

As soon as Zhang Xuefeng's words came out, he immediately exploded on the Internet, and the sound of opposition and approval came one after another. The Chinese Education News of the Ministry of Education of China has criticized that those simple and rough online celebrities have strong confusion. The greater the spread of this speech, the greater the destructive power.

However, there are also many netizens who think that Zhang Xuefeng has made sense, because the current employment prospects of the journalism are indeed not good, and they will not encourage or support their children to apply for the journalism.

When applying for a major, should candidates be interested in? Or is the employment prospect and employment income? This issue may be benevolent, but I hear Zhang Xuefeng's response to the professional opposition to the journalism is that this is the sorrow of the Chinese press.

He said in an interview: "We do what we need to do to protect our interests. We said what we need to say, and we also clearly expressed the content that should be expressed clearly to ensure that this situation no longer occurs. Therefore As long as it no longer happens, this chapter should end. "

However, on the same day, the US President Biden's campaign in California called the Chinese President Xi Jinping as ["Dedicated"] at a campaign fundraising event.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登称习近平为独裁者-北京公开的政治挑衅/a-65987541)Essence In his speech, he said: "The reason why Xi Jinping was particularly angry was that when I shot down the balloon filled with two spy equipment, he didn't know where it was. This was particularly embarrassing for dictators. What happened, it should not be its destination, because the wind has deviated from the route. "

This expression of Biden aroused great dissatisfaction in Beijing.

### Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."

The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.

In March of this year, the picture reached by Beijing AIDS reached an agreement showed that in the three -party talks, all officials did not wear a mask, which was in sharp contrast to the picture of Beijing officials now meeting with Bollingken.

Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be on the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.

However, there are exceptions, such as when Plingken's former Pompeo visited China in October 2018, Xi Jinping did not see him. At that time, the Sino -US trade war had debuted, and US Vice President Pence had just delivered a tough speech on China. The relationship between the two sides was very tense. Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.

(Voice of Germany) Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen announced on Friday (June 30) that he may disable Facebook on Cambodia. Earlier, Facebook stated that he would delete a video of Hun Sen threatened to beat political opponents.

Cambodia will be held on July 23. After the authorities refused to register for the main competitors of the Cambodian People's Party led by the authorities, this was widely considered a false election.

Facebook announced on Thursday that it will delete a video of Hunson in accordance with the ruling of the META Supervision Committee of the social platform, and the committee also suggested to suspend his account. Some experts describe this as a "turning point".

The Meta Supervision Commission's ruling stated that Hun Sen's speech included a "clear violence statement" against opposition politicians.

### "We can block Facebook"

Hunson has been a high -yield user of Facebook for a long time. He announced on Thursday night that he had stopped using the platform and seemed to delete his account.

On Friday, Hun Sen warned in a speech at the Cambodian Bodhisattva Province that he could shield Facebook at any time in Cambodia to "short -term or permanent", [to prevent exile from exchanges with the citizens of the country. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/亲历者讲述如何从体制外撼动威权/a-46327244)"Don't be arrogant, you stay overseas, communicate with Facebook, we can block Facebook", he seems to be talking to the opposition to exile.

Subsequently, he urged Cambodians to download other social media platforms, including WhatsApp owned by Telegram, Tiktok, Line, Viber, and Meta. In fact, the content of these platforms is more difficult to regulate.

Hun Sen also accused Facebook that he claimed that the "insulting" remarks published by his competitors against his wife and the eldest son Hongmanet were blind. It is generally believed that Hongmanet is being cultivated as the future successor of the Cambodian regime.

### Facebook can monitor our mobile phone?

### confrontation between technology companies and dictators

On Thursday, Human Rights Observation Organization(HRW)It is said that this incident is "confrontation between large technology companies and dictators on human rights issues," which is "something that should have happened long ago."

Valren at the Royal University of Science and Technology of Melbourne University of Science and Technology(Matthew Warren)It is said that Meta is facing increasing pressure and requires politicians to be responsible for improper behavior of their networks. "I really think this is a turning point." He told AFP.

He said: "Facebook is doing this well, but this does not solve the problem ... Because now politicians can use a variety of platforms."

Hunson now use Telegram applications to pass information to supporters and use Tiktok to interact with young people.

Wallen added that Meta's decision was not as late as it was better.

"What they are doing is to show that Meta can regulate content." He said, but "that video was in January, that is, six months ago, so Meta spent a long time to deal with this situation. They are not so agile. "

After the international community strongly opposed it, the [Cambodia government put hold on the national Internet gateway plan last year. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/柬埔寨效仿中国网络防火墙的项目推迟/a-60929131)Wallen said that Hunson threatened to block Facebook in Cambodia, [This may restart the gateway plan](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/柬埔寨要引入中国式防火墙/a-56599703)The plan will transmit all network information through the state -controlled entrance. He said that this is another example of the "splitting network" -the Internet is divided into multiple regional groups.

### How to avoid network censorship?

### What do you say?

For many Cambodians, Facebook is considered the entire Internet.

Hunson threatened the platform's actions that caused different reactions in the local area. Some people pointed out that the ban will damage small companies sold using Facebook for sales.

"If Facebook is blocked, the relationship with the West will deteriorate. Bad officials will be happy," a Facebook user posted.

Some people also support this. "If Facebook is blocked, people will start reading again, and will not have a headache because of immorality. More than ten years ago, we did not live without Facebook. Turn off it!" A Facebook user said.

According to the Meta Supervision Committee on Thursday, Hunson's Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended for six months for the video released in January. In that video, Hun Sen told the opponent that if they accused his political party cheating in July elections, they would face legal lawsuits or sticks.

After making a decision for the Supervision Committee for a few hours, Meta stated that it would delete the video in accordance with the execution.

In a statement, the company stated: "In addition to this decision, we will also conduct review based on all the suggestions provided by the committee, and respond to the committee's suggestion on suspending Prime Minister Hongsen account as soon as possible after analyzing."

Hongsen has been in power in Cambodia for 38 years and is one of the longest in the world's longest leaders.

After the opposition Party Cambodia was dissolved, Hunson's leadership party won all seats in the 2018 national elections.

The German "Daily Mirror" published an analysis and review article pointed out, "So far, people have noticed that Xi Jinping, a dictator is using laws and rules to ensure the growing power of growing. It will also apply to foreign countries. "

The article reads: "The reason why the passage of the new law has such a great explosion because China put forward its role as a world country, and is [heavy vertical global order](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7会议德国外长批评中国推动自己的规则/a-65350115)Definition.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Marhota said that New Zealand is very cautious to deal with relations with China, and must avoid being forced to "choose to stand by" in strategic competition in China and the United States.

Malhota was interviewed on Friday (June 30), saying that the relationship between New Zealand and China was complicated.

When interviewed in Malhota, New Zealand Prime Minister Hipkins' trip in China was about to end. Hipkins led a trade delegation for six days to visit China. The itinerary included meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, focusing on discussing economic partnerships and trade issues of the two countries.

During his visit to China, Hipkins did not have too much concern in New Zealand's concerns about China's infringement of human rights in Xinjiang, and was criticized by domestic.

Malhota told Reuters that "the relationship with China is complicated, and we must deal with it very cautiously."

She said that Hipkins' trip to trade does not mean that New Zealand's foreign policy transformation, but a topic that New Zealand has a series of attention to China.

The statement issued by Hipkins after meeting with Xi Jinping did not mention human rights issues or Taiwan Strait issues. In November 2022, the New Zealand Prime Minister Adon mentioned these two points in a statement issued after meeting with Xi Jinping.

In this regard, Malhota said that when he met with Xi Jinping, Hipkins talked about economic and trade issues, human rights issues, and Ukrainian war. She believed that "this is beyond doubt."

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to the comment request. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand said last week that in the past 50 years, "through joint efforts, the relationship between China and New Zealand has made great development on the basis of mutual respect and common deposits.

(Voice of Germany) "I found that in the past year, Hong Kong students in Germany have been much more careful than before", and the Voice of Germany said to Germany. At the age of 26, she is currently a PhD in Burger. Since 2015, she has been active in the democratic movement of Hong Kong. In addition to initiating the draft amendments to the "23 Article 23", after the "Rebellion" in 2019, she accompanied Huang Zhifeng, a Hong Kong social movement from the current prison to Germany for related international lobbying.

"Maybe there is a recent news that there is a girl studying in Japan. When she was in Japan, she published some political remarks on Hong Kong on social media. Then when she went back, she was caught. So everyone was more careful in this regard. You also noticed that they did not talk so much in the school environment. Everyone doesn't want to discuss too much in the public environment too much. I think there is a fear there. Recently, there are also reports that there are overseas police offices, so I think everyone everyone thinks everyone It feels a little scared. It will worry about your personal safety, or you will worry about whether you will be recognized if you will be recognized and will continue to wear masks and hats. "

The case mentioned by Jun Songqing is that [March this year, a 23 -year -old college student studying in Japan was arrested when returning to Hong Kong](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港国安法域外适用首案留日学生返港被捕/a-65431047)Essence The Hong Kong Police Station later issued a news announcement saying that the woman was suspected of publishing information on Hong Kong's independence on the Internet and suspected of being a criminal of the Hong Kong Guoan Law "inciting the crime of splitting the country."

[Songqing](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论捍卫维园炬火-为中国也为香港/a-53673627)It is said that the situation in Hong Kong has become worse and worse in the past year. "Although the government wants to construct an image to the outside world, that is, everything in Hong Kong is as usual or has returned to normal, but it is not actually. This year, many different people have been caught by the police. . Then you also see that the entire Hong Kong that the entire Hong Kong knows the world is already two different cities. For example, later [District Council Elections](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港區議會選舉改制-直選削至19史上最低/a-65494542)It is no longer the kind of voting, and many of them are picked up by the government. [ Legislative Council](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体看只有爱国者参选的香港立法会选举/a-60194472)Also, 20%of the positions are selected, and candidates have to be selected by the government, and you can go to the election. So you can see that Hong Kong is very different from before. "

### Patriot Governing Hong Kong Hong Kong Election Voting Raid

### Hong Kong people return to political life

"Over the sea, I don't feel how depression or something I live in Hong Kong now. However, I have contact people or friends who have been in contact with travel, and they will say, they don't think I want to talk about (politics), I Live your own life first. Because it doesn't make sense to talk. Or the most important thing now is life rather than politics. They don't care about no longer care, they just feel that they may be tired. Life. "

For Ji Songqing, this change is obvious. "In 2019 or 2020, everyone talked about politics or exercise itself. But now everyone has returned to a de-political life-I will describe it like this. Rarely discuss politics in life enthusiastically . The news can still be seen, and I still feel that the government is really tumbling, but I don’t feel that what political actions do to do some opposition. "

"My feelings are very sad. It is to look at the place where you grew up completely. It is completely unrecognizable. That is, what I was very proud was taken away by the government or the central government. At the same time, I realized that this is necessary. Phase. From 2019, it can be better to be better to get better one day. Nevertheless, when you watch things happen, your friends and people you know are closed into it. The prison is quite uncomfortable. "

### family's harassment by the police in Hong Kong

Asked about her own life, Ji Songqing said, "I have lived well, but my family in Hong Kong has been harassed by the police. I was called to the police station to ask, saying what do you know about what she was doing? Does she have contact? Do you know where she is now? Then I also warned that I can't return to Hong Kong and I will be caught when I go back. It is some threats. "

In recent months, Zong Songqing has been circulated by the police at least twice in Hong Kong's family. [She expressed to Germany in November last year](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被警告返港即遭逮捕-鄺頌晴北京複製新疆模式打壓港人/a-63867655): "To be honest, I feel very angry about the Hong Kong police's approach, because my family in Hong Kong knows nothing about my work overseas, and the police know that the family members who call me will not have any impact on me, but They still insisted on doing so. This is crazy.

### Western countries did not think about "the worst situation"

[Songqing](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体键盘战线发言人呼吁对中国说不/a-50915914)Starting in Germany in 2018, he returned to Hong Kong to participate in sports and elections in the middle, and returned to Germany to continue reading in 2020. In the interview, she also specifically mentioned that the Hong Kong people's BNO passport could not be recognized in Germany. For civil rights, this may cause difficulties in applying for a visa.

On the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's sovereignty transfer on July 1st last year, [In the guest comment written by the Voice of Germany](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论追究中国在香港的所作所为/a-62337607)Criticizing that "the international community has only empty support, and has never tried to let China do what it does in Hong Kong and take responsibility for destroying rules -based order."
###  Landscaping under the wind: Hong Kong reporters after finding a new life after finding robbery

### The biggest change is the freedom to speak

Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law in July 2020, Hong Kong has changed greatly in terms of political, journalism and citizens: the Legislative Council no longer has a pan -civilian camp, [Apple Daily](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/黎智英之子英国需为黎智英案发声/a-66015090), [Stance News](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/立場新聞煽動案17篇涉案文章被指控什麼/a-63616772)The person in charge of the media was charged. For Shi Songqing, the main change in her personal feelings is:

"When I grew up in Hong Kong, I don't need to think about what is freedom of speech, I just have it. I think this is taken for granted. I don’t need to consider whether I will hurt the government's reputation or something I just want to say, I don't like this, I don't like that, I can say it all. But now you say a word, you have to be very careful. It ’s okay if you say that I do n’t oppose it. It’ s okay. If others think you don't have a deep meaning, you will still have trouble. I think this is something that is very unimaginable for me. You have to be very careful, you can't tell what you want to say, you can't post you Opinions. For me the biggest difference, what I feel most is this part. "

In 2018, a young American who named Lele Feli performed two talk shows that he described "nervous and bad" in China in China. At that time, the talk show was still a relatively new form of comedy in China, and young people like Pharma explored and tried in this industry.

However, five years later, many things changed. Pharisee, who has lived in China for a long time, returned to the United States and grew up in the comedy industry. His YouTube Channel often releases content related to China, with hundreds of thousands of people watching, most of them are fans in Taiwan and other overseas countries.

A talk show named HOUSE's talk show caused an uproar in a paragraph in May. His company's laughing fruit culture was issued a penalty of more than 10 million yuan, and many performances were canceled.

French, real name Alex, said that doing comedy in China is like "playing in the mines".

He said, "You don't know how many things are not allowed to say." (One he must know: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGRUVSiIc8)Let him be blocked by the entire network in China. .

When the world celebrates the International joke day (also the international chicken wings day), the talk show that frequently contributes to Chinese society has been pressed on the suspension key.

An American scholar who studied China said that House's lethality of this industry was huge. The scholar himself was a comic actor himself.

He said the talk show "still popular, but now everyone is waiting to see if this industry will experience some changes." Today's environment is so sensitive that the scholar living in China requires anonymous.

(Screenshot of Tencent Video) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-30T14-56-00-04-00/000005.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/diaocha-baodao/db-06302023131939.html/inv_chn_comedy-2.jpg)** Evolution of Chinese Comedy **

"Comedy with Chinese characteristics" has always been a strange match.

Historically, cross talk is a kind of city art that satisfies the interest of the bottom people. He does not ask for the height of the temple, but only asking a blogger to smile. However, since the CCP's power, the form of artistic creation, including comic dialogue, has been used as a tool for publicity ideology.

During the Cultural Revolution, the cross talk became "very unhappy". The scholar said, "I can't say anything."

In the era of Deng Xiaoping, after the reform and opening up, under the "socialism with Chinese characteristics", some shackles were solved, and the creative space obtained by comedians increased.

But it wasn't until the past ten years that the western -style and offending art of talk show began to emerge. According to the "2021 National Performance Market Report" released by the China Performance Industry Association, the business performance of the talk show market in 2021 reached 18,500, and the box office revenue was 391 million yuan, an increase of more than 50%over 2019.

Among them, Xiaoguo Culture stood out. With the variety show "Tucao Conference" and "Talk Show Conference", they cultivated well -known actors in the industry, and almost monopolized the stage of talk show.

** Wild dogs, squirrels and PLA **

The trouble started in May this year. A netizen released a blog post on Weibo, saying that the paragraph of a offline talk show caused his discomfort because the content insults the PLA.

According to the recording content exposed on the Internet later, House, the real name Li Haoshi, during the performance, the scene of the wild dog chasing the pine kings he adopted reminded him of "excellent style and victory." This phrase comes from the strong army's goal proposed by Xi Jinping in 2013: "Build a people's army that listened to the party, can win, and excellent style."

A few days later, the cultural competent department issued a penalty decision, fined more than 13 million yuan in the laughter culture, and accused House's performance. Du Yiyi criticized the incident strictly.

House is also accused of "wantonly tampering with the content of the performance."

Article 25 of Business Performance Management Regulations stipulates ten taboos, including negative impacts on the country, nation, social stability, tradition, and other people's rights, as well as content related to sex, cult, violence, and superstition.

The regulations stipulate that holding business performances must be declared, and the application materials include "program and its audiovisual information", such as the verbatim draft of the performance, and the video performed by the actors according to the manuscript.** Cultural regulator is watching you **

The improvisation is not allowed. In a domestic media [Report](https://static.zhoudaosh.com/files/cnews/2021/20210719/B28D39F8D66D9CC7B0AAAF5523CA4C571CC442D6DACDDE042CB1BDBA277ADC7C/14.html)Among them, when the supervisor inspected a performance organized by Xiao Guo culture, he found that about 10-20%of the content of a certain actor had not been submitted, so he interviewed Xiaoguo Culture.

Government officials introduced in the report that although the company must have been discussed, modified, deleted, etc. before the company submitted the section, "but we must change it here. The scale will be stricter than them. "

Huangpu District, Shanghai has the largest theater group in the country, and the review of the review is very large. To this end, the local cultural department organized a volunteer team to perform a performance inspection.

Query [Shanghai Volunteer Network](https://sh.zhiyuanyun.com/app/opp/view.php?id=uNGnh7Ki1RxVa)It can be confirmed that this team conducted two rounds of recruitment in 2021-2022. The recruitment conditions wrote: "Have a strong sense of confidentiality" and "party members priority".

Volunteers need to complete a inspection form on the night of the performance, including taking at least three live pictures, filling in the plot content, and evaluating the scene with the script. If the content of the performance scene is seriously deviated, you need to call government personnel directly as soon as possible.

In a [Report](https://www.sohu.com/a/485256626_120044982)Among them, a volunteer described the state of his inspection as "sneaky": "Mix the brightness of the phone to the lowest, and then use a hat or scarf to cover the light to avoid disturbing the surrounding audience."

** Are you questioning my car skills? **

Chinese comedians expressed humor in the gaps, can train to avoid political topics or have significant incidents of the Communist Party of China. The commonly used way is self -deprecation, or exaggerate the absurd anecdotes in life.

The American scholar talked about a typical Chinese paragraph: a man dating his object. He drove her to dinner. After meals, he drove her to the bar for some wine, then drove her to the park to take a walk, and finally drove her home.

When she went downstairs, she pretended to be unstable because of the car, and some motion sickness gave him a chance to send her upstairs. But he was furious: Are you questioning my car skills? So he left the throttle.

The scholar said: "They naturally formed a genre, avoiding pornography and politics, but the end of the direction is still funny."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-30T14-56-00-04-00/000008.png)The audience's response when watching a comedy performance in a bookstore in Beijing on May 24, 2015 (Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press) [![] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-30T14-56-00-04-00/000009.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/diaocha-baodao/db-06302023131939.html/inv_chn_comedy-4.jpg)** "Welcome to the group" **

The talk show actor occasionally breaks through the boundaries and pays the price.

In addition to the House incident, China has two public punishment cases for the content of the talk show. One of them involved the content of ridicule the Shanghai epidemic. The previous two fines were 50,000 yuan. The sky -high ticket reflects the government's determination to rectify the industry.

In February this year, the talk show actor pool, the real name Wang Yuechi, after the North American tour, it is rumored that the performance content involves the Chinese epidemic prevention policy and review system, and was blocked on many online platforms in mainland China. Clean up. Since then, he has never appeared in the public's vision again.

Meng Chuan, who participated in the "Talking Show Conference" program from 2019 to 2022, was banned after speaking on Weibo to support the white paper sports last fall, and offline performances were also canceled.

The Uyghur Cam from Xinjiang was called one of the most avant -garde talk show actors in China. Because of his abuse of others, he was arrested by the police in 2020 and was sentenced to 8 months in prison. After being released from prison, he was active on Weibo, but he was not allowed to perform offline and appeared on TV media.

After the House incident, Kam made a meaningful sentence on Weibo: Welcome to the house to enter the group. Delete then.

** People's supervision, the government's operating **

In addition to being caught by the regulators, there is another problem: the audience itself.

Jocelyn Chey, a professor at the University of Sydney and a Chinese cultural expert, said: "What the comedy club said will not stay in a comedy club."

The humorous incident may involve a series of "political factors or vortexes, which will quickly devour comedy actors." Markrolfe, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales, who has studied humor in different countries, said, "Many others will bring their own issues."

The supervision of the people has evolved into a "cancellation culture" in the United States. For example, Michaelrichards, a star in the scenario comedy "Song Fei Biography", used racial discrimination language in a talk show performance, which was widely resisted and his career collapsed.

In China's soil, it corresponds to "reporting culture": people's supervision, and the government operates. As in the House incident, some people think that the report of the Weibo user allows the government to rectify.

** "Funny contains strength" **

Experts who study rhetoric believe that the authoritarian government is particularly afraid of humor, such as China, because it is very effective as a communication tool.

Understanding a stalk means that it has the same knowledge foundation; people who laugh at each other often have a similar outlook on life. Beckkrefting, a professor at Skidmore College of New York, said comedians said that comedians can "explain serious things in humorous language and will not lose the information that you want to convey."

Krefting is also a part -time talk show actor. She said that in American history, the talk show actor has participated in promoting social change, such as those who are influential in black and white audiences at the same time. The role.

Not only that, Matthewmeier, an associate professor at the University of Dibao, Indiana, said comedy also has strong power in strengthening ideology. "Autocraticism wants to control what is funny and what is not funny, because the funny contains strength. To some extent, it is a power of laughing into a stalk."** Xi Humor ** **

This control is not limited to the field of comedy. Chey added: "The Chinese government wants to stop the chaos that may explode, so they try to cover up and restrict people's feelings."

She said that the House incident reminded her of China's recent foreign consulting companies that collect business information.(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/china-targets-foreign-consulting-companies-in-anti-spying-raids)Essence "People are careful in many fields, and they are very clearly aware that there are more and more restrictions on what can be said and can be repeated."

However, this does not mean that the Chinese government wants to tell everyone that the CCP or Xi Jinping himself has no sense of humor.

Outer propaganda channel CGTN edited a display of Xi Jinping's easy time [video](https://news.cgtn.com/news/7745444f79677a6333566d54/index.html);(https://web.shobserver.com/sgh/detail?id=653290)"(A netizen is in [comment area](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pk4y1s7Hs/?vd_source=eb825f989ccdcf86c17d1286c9b1d6c7)Show the sense of humor: "It is recommended to tell me on the screen, I can laugh at which node, how many decibels can be laughed, and at most a few teeth.")

In 2018, on the party building website of the Central Propaganda Department, a summary of the moment of humor of Xi Jinping was published [article](https://news.12371.cn/2018/06/14/ARTI1528953018360611.shtml)Essence It wrote, "Xi Jinping's humor is both a manifestation of wisdom and a reflection of self -confidence. Whether in the masses or leading cadres at all levels, Xi -style humor can be seen everywhere."

According to the government's response to the House incident, maybe only this kind of humor can exist.

"Risk -going risk, not decoupling" has been a widely publicity policy for the European Union for a period of time. ["Risk"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/李強批西方降風險概念-對中國經濟樂觀/a-66040846)In this statement, it officially appeared and became a concept. In the future, the European Union will use it as a guidance policy to launch a strategy to China.

The joint statement signed by the leaders of the EU countries stated that the EU and China will continue to be an important economic and trading partner. Although the two sides have different political and economic systems, Europe and China are interested in promoting the constructive stable relationship. The European Union will continue to cooperate with China to deal with global challenges.

The EU clearly stated in the statement that it will not consider large -scale decoupled with China. Although the text of the statement uses the word "institutional opponent", it is ranked behind "partners" and "competitors". In fact, the European Union did not change the definition of existing policies for China in this regard, that is, partners, competitors, and institutional rivals-this is the compass of the European Union's policy on China. However, German Foreign Minister Belbak said after visiting China in April this year that her impression is that "the aspect of the system opponent is getting stronger and stronger."

After the meeting, the German Prime Minister told the media that no one would discuss "decoupling", but trying to make the economy and enterprises in European countries not be in dependence on China. He believes that without this dependence, he can treat China's economic growth pragmatically. "This will last for several years, especially enterprises, how to realize the diversification of supply chains and markets and direct investment. However, economic cooperation will continue to exist," because this cooperation is required in the field of climatic food security and health.

The statement believes that, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China shoulders its special duties to comply with international order, the UN Charter and International Law.

Since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, China has not publicly condemned Russia to launch the war of aggression. At the same time, the community purchased Russia's crude oil and natural gas, and helped Russia to avoid Western sanctions as a transfer country. However, China promised not to provide fatal weapons to Russia. It is reported that Beijing made a guarantee to Brussels and took action against companies that violate the EU embargo.

[Is there a ghost in the army? ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯社会如何看待瓦格纳叛变/a-66053987)The Associated Press reported that a few days after Wagner's mercenaries launched a rebellion last weekend, Russia's deputy commander Sergeisurovikin in the southern Ukraine Group was detained. The news stems from two analysts who have channels for research on the United States and Ukrah. But whether Surovin is facing prosecution and where he is currently, it is unclear. The Kremlin spokesman Peskov stated to the outside world on Thursday (June 29) that the whereabouts of Surovijin were the affairs of the Ministry of Defense.

Earlier, the New York Times reported that U.S. officials believed that Surovin knew the rebellion plan of Porigin, and was rejected by Peskov on Wednesday (June 28). The White House has not confirmed the above reports.

What can be confirmed is that at the beginning of the Wagner's mercenaries, Surovijin posted a video in the social media called for an end to end the mutiny, and he never appeared again.

### Wagner Anti -Water Russian Media

The independent "Moscow Echo", which was closed after the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, said Alexeivenediktov, the editor -in -chief of the radio station, said that Surovin and the officers around him had not contacted his family for 3 days, but he failed to confirm whether Surovin was was ins Tress.

From October 2022 to January 2023, Surovijin served as chief commander of the Ukrainian war. After that, the Russian chief of staff of the Russian army took over the post, and Surovijin was relegated to the deputy.

### ** Someone in the army participated in the rebellion? **

Gustavgressel, a military expert of the European Foreign Affairs Commission, believes that it is unlikely that no one knows about the Vagina mercenaries. After the army was withdrawn from the front line, even in the process of mutiny, it was still using equipment provided by the Russian military. What's more, the two military towns of Rostov and Volneri, who passed the military fleet, are not only stationed in the Russian regular army, where the training grounds are specially provided for "final battle" training for officers and soldiers on the front of Ukraine. In such a place, no one came out to block the rebellion of Wagri, which was too incredible.

The US Intelligence Department is also investigating whether Surovin has participated in the rebellion. But this idea is doubtful. Gracer analyzed that Surovijin is currently the commander of the Russian Air Force. During this rebellion, only the Air Force threatened the Wagner Army and implemented an air strike on it. Therefore, "this is not consistent with the image of the traitor."

![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-06-30T15-16-00Z/63411908_401.png)Where is Surovinjin? What do he know?

### ** Expert: Solovy Gold Stand on the side of the country at a critical moment **

From the perspective of the development of the mutiny, it is difficult to conclude that the highest -level Russian army participated in person. Tatianastanovaya, a senior researcher at Cuniki Russia Central Asia, in Berlin, believes that Pricigo is designed to force Putin to pay more attention to Wagner and give support. She said on the telegram platform that Wagner did not plan a "normal" mutiny plan, and did not consider whether the road to waving the army Moscow was unobstructed and whether she had no suspense. Steinova does not rule out the possibility of Surovin's knowledge of soldiers. "However, at a critical moment, he clearly stood on the side of the country."

Steinova pointed out that the camp of Russian Defense Director Shai Yigu and Chief of Staff Glacimov had deep cracks with Surovijin, but it was never secret. What involves is not a dispute over power, but how the Ukrainian war fights, and it is also related to how to deal with the relationship with Wagner's mercenaries.

Unlike Shaygou and Gracorov, Surovin advocates maintaining a "work relationship" with Wagner and has been mediation. In May of this year, Wagner finally got the result of the urgent need of ammunition was the result of the efforts of Surovin.

### ** Start cleaning in the army?

Even the military reports of the Russian government have become more and more doubtful for the Russian military. Rybar, a blog channel on the telegram, wrote, "For many days, investigators have focused on the military leadership and battlefield commanders." It is reported that the targets of cleaning also include lower officers and ordinary soldiers.

Stannova believes that Porigin has many secret supporters in the Russian military. She believes that these people should be summarized as unsatisfactory crowds on Shao Yigu and Putin's policies. She asked, "Can you turn the good people into a conspirator and then use this opportunity to clean it?"

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-30T15-32-08-00-00/000000.png)After 10 consecutive hikes to fight high inflation, the Federal Reserve recently announced a suspension of positive interest rate hikes in order to allow interest rate policy makers to evaluate the US's economic strength.

The U.S. Department of Commerce issued a statement that the annual growth rate of personal consumption expenditure prices in May was 3.8%, which was a significant slowdown from 4.3%in April.

The main reason for the slowdown in the price index of personal consumption expenditure in May is that energy prices have fallen sharply, and the decline in grain prices is small.

After removing large fluctuations and energy prices, the annual growth rate of the core PCE index only slowed down slightly, from 4.7%in April to 4.6%in May, which represents that price inflation in many fields is still stubborn.

The South Korean government has denied a report on the concealment of the authorities' inspection reports in the offshore of Fukushima in Japan, saying that the allegations of the opposition party do not match the facts.

Yonhap reported that Song Jihao, deputy head of the Fukushima nuclear sewage issues of South Korea's largest Democratic Party in the Wild Party, pointed out that the government had inspected and prepared reports on the safety management of offshore nuclear radiation in Fukushima from 2014 to 2015. But the Food Medical Safety Department has not announced this report so far.

For the first time in the South Korean State Adjustment Room, Pu Shiran, Friday (June 30), refuted this statement, saying that Song Jihao's unrealistic proposal was mixed with two different things.

Park Shiran said that in order to check the safety of Japanese aquatic products, the South Korean Civilian Expert Committee was established in September 2014 and conducted field inspections in Japan. Later, because the Japanese side proposed to the WTO (WTO) on the import of Japanese aquatic products on South Korea (WTO) The appeal, the inspection activity was forced to stop, so there was no relevant report.

Park Shiran acknowledged that after the WTO appealed by the Japanese direction, the Korean government was justified and reasonable to prove that the embargo measures were proof, so they carried out the harmful assessment work and prepared relevant reports.

Park Shiran added that Song Jihao asked the Food and Drug Administration to publicize the above reports, but was rejected. However, the Food and Drug Administration promised that after the WTO ended the dispute procedures for the embargo on aquatic products, this report will be released.

Park Shiran emphasized that South Korea is still undergoing embargo on Japanese aquatic products. In this context, the announcement of relevant information will harm national interests. Therefore, the authorities have not announced this report so far.

The reporter of this station interviewed several people from China, now living in Canada, South Africa, and the United States. These who have recently returned to China and are going to return to China to visit relatives have given their answers.

Chinese people search for "immigration" in a single day to break 100 million times **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-12082022093910.html)** What are China like before and after the epidemic and the epidemic? **

The nearly 30 -year -old youth Liu Haiyang comes from Langfang, Hebei, and is currently living in Canada. From November last year to January this year, he returned to China for more than three months.

He said that returning to China this time is the first time he has been in more than three years. The biggest impression of his return to China was the depression of China: "After I returned to China, I was first isolated at first. After the isolation, the epidemic control was strict at that time. I felt that China was very depressed. It was closed. Later, in December 2022, China ushered in the national Omikon's mutant virus. After that, China has fully liberalized the control of the epidemic. Instead, it feels very depressed. "

Because many of his old classmates worked in Beijing, this trip returned to China, he deliberately went to Beijing after the epidemic control measures were released. The feeling that this trip brought him was: "The most prosperous places such as Wangfu and Sanlitun, such as Beijing, are very depressed. No one. Then it felt ironic at the time that no one came out to go shopping. Instead, you can still see a lot of abandoned, waste nucleic acid testing small pavilions. "

Xie Fanfei, who was engaged in mining in Linbobo Province, South Africa, and his 40s this year, returned to China for five weeks from March -April this year. He told reporters that because he returned, China's epidemic control measures had been liberalized, so he did not experience isolation, but was asked to wear masks in public places such as subways, buses, and airplanes.

For him for seven years before that, he has made him the most uncomfortable thing about air pollution: "I can't adapt to the air now. I ca n’t stay, the local environment is not good, and there are many people. "

Although it was only five weeks to return to China this time, Xie Fanfei had two flu. In addition, China's forced living space also made him feel uncomfortable: "The domestic space is also small, I go back to live in my dad's old house, how can I feel uncomfortable, too small. I can take a bath in the toilet and take a bath. It is also uncomfortable, there is small water flow and small space. "

Miss Liang from Guangdong is in his thirties. For security reasons, she only accepted interviews in this station. She came to study in California last year and was preparing to return to China to visit relatives next year. However, she was worried about returning to China this time: "After the outbreak, China’ s sealing control last year was very scared. If you go back, I do n’t know if the government will do something again, which makes people ca n’t come out. ”

She also said that she is currently busy applying for a tourist visa for her parents. I hope they can also come to the United States to take a look: "China always says that the United States is dangerous and messy, they are worried, I think I stay in the United States Very unsafe. But in fact, my life here is very calm, and they can't help but worry about them. So when you see it, you can still come and take a look. "

** Stay overseas or return to China? After the epidemic, China gave them the answer **

Liu Haiyang told reporters that there is a big difference between China and his impression of China in this journey to China: "I have not returned to China overseas in the past three years. I don't mean that I want to develop overseas. In the past three years, I am also (I am also (I am also in these three years ( Because of the epidemic), I can't return to China to develop in China. After three years, I am going to return to China to take a look, but when I returned to China, I saw the situation in China and felt that it was not the same as China I imagined three years ago. "

He said that returning to China this time made him feel the suffocation of Chinese society. He explained with his own experience, saying that he felt very kindly different before the new crown epidemic, but now there are very different differences: "Especially for the service industry to send takeaway, sometimes the takeaway is sent to me after the takeaway is sent to me later It's rough to call. They are about to take out the knife and stab me, it is terrible. "

Liu Haiyang gave a negative answer to whether he would return to China in the future. He said that it was this trip to return to China after three years that he made him determined to develop in Canada in the future: "Although I have seen the strict city sealing in China on the Internet in the past three years, this kind of problem, that kind of problem , But I always feel that the Chinese economy has recovered after the epidemic, and all aspects are fine. But when I really see the status quo of the Chinese epidemic, I feel that the economic situation in China is not good. It is difficult to find a job. The anger is very heavy, and it feels not very comfortable, not what I remember before. So I think it is still not developing in China, and it is developed overseas. "He said that in the future, he wants to go to Europe to retire.

For Ms. Liang, whether to return to China in the future is still unknown. What she wants to do is to read books in the United States first. But she also told reporters that in her heart, the idea of finding a way to stay in the United States is becoming stronger: "The natural environment here is good, and people's work intensity is not so great, and unemployment is not as serious as the current domestic. In fact The Chinese are still very rolled here, but I don't want to live this kind of life. Although I still have the idea of returning home in the future, I still think about it. I may change my thoughts in the future. "

However, the actual situation of Chinese society and the complaints of the people are rarely reflected in the official media. There are Chinese people who have just "wired" to the United States questioned that if the CCP really does well, why are there so many people who have escaped from China?

Regarding the historical achievements of the Communist Party of China and the news of the 102nd anniversary of the CCP's establishment of the Communist Party of China, it is overwhelming on Chinese official media.

Search on Google.com with the "102nd Anniversary". The results obtained from the first three results are: "The Symphony of the 102nd Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China in Beijing was held in Beijing", and Xinhua News Agency's "Beijing University celebrates the 102nd anniversary commendation conference of the founding of the Communist Party of China. "The 102nd anniversary of the 102nd anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China" and Sina Finance Network.

** Escape China for freedom **

CCTV News Client also released a news on Friday (June 30), saying that "the total number of members of the Communist Party of China reached 98.041 million." It is mentioned in the news that the latest statistics from the Central Organization Department show that as of December 31, 2022, the total number of Communist Party members of the Communist Party of China had exceeded 98 million, an increase of 1.33 million from the net at the end of 2021, an increase of 1.4%.

However, after this news was sent through the Xinhua News Agency Chinese Twitter, the feedback obtained was mainly questioning and irony. Some friends replied in a ironic tone under the news, "Fight for everyone to join the party, and every family has civil servants. People across the country eat emperor food, and the Chinese dream will be realized quickly when they go to bed."

Wang Zhihua Wang Zhihua, a democratic person in Hunan in New York, did not agree with the news. He analyzed to reporters, "In China, the status of the Communist Party of China is a stepping stepping of this society. Therefore What does this have to do with faith? "

Wang Zhihua, who is in his 50s this year, has just "wirled" in the United States in mid -May. For him, this was a fleeing escape. Before escaping, Wang Zhihua's life was very sad. "In China, you either have no awakening, or it is very painful. Living in such an environment and living in a dictatorship system, this life is very painful You. Your child is educated by brainwashing, and then you have no political freedom. "

Wang Zhihua has participated in local democratic activities in Zhuzhou, Hunan since 2020, and has been "cared" by the police. Because of commemoration of June 4th, he was detained twice by the police. He said that his escape was mainly to escape the harassment and persecution of the police.

Wang Zhihua departed from Guangdong on April 25. After Hong Kong, Istanbul, Kido, and north, it took less than 20 days to swim through the Border River on the Mexican border and enter the United States. He said, "Running in the direction of freedom, all the way north, I really don't know fatigue. In the tropical rain forest in Panama, I can fall asleep as soon as I sit down. A kind of attractiveness to do things like this. "

He said, but now people who have escaped from China are almost from all strata. "A large number of routines have appeared, those who escape, and those who have money are also running. Those who have no money are running. They all run away from freedom and dignity. "

On the day when Wang Zhihua fled, the Chinese economy continued to decline. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday (June 30), the manufacturing industry has shrunk for the third consecutive month in June, and the non -manufacturing industry is also exhausted, and the two new orders and the number of employees of the two continue to decline.

It is also in the past three months that there are many desperate young people who have committed suicide. Among them, it has been confirmed by the Chinese media that in April, 4 young people who did not know each other in the Tianmen Mountain Scenic Area, Hunan, Hunan, met and committed suicide in the cliff.

On the one hand, the ruling party is rising in singing and dancing, on the one hand, the crisis of socioeconomic and people's life is crisis, and politics lacks freedom. Since the media, Wang Jian Wang Jian, on Thursday (June 29), talked about the Chinese economy's downward and employment frustrated young people in the comments on the YouTube platform on Thursday (June 29).However, this ideal China has not appeared after the 102nd anniversary of the Communist Party of China and 74 years after the establishment of the government. Hu Ping, an honorary editor -in -chief of Overseas Political Affairs Magazine "The Spring of Beijing", analyzed that the early leaders of the Communist Party of China accepted a specific historical scenario accepted communism. Dual needs. It produced in the West, because everyone thought that China could not work at that time, so it was necessary to learn the West; it was opposed to the West, and it satisfied their national self -esteem. "

Hu Ping believes that when these early CCP leaders accept communism, they have great limitations in themselves. "The most important thing is that once you believe in communism, you have to believe that you must smash the old world, but only usefulness can only be used, but only usefulness can only be used, but only usefulness can only be used, but only usefulness can only be used. Only the means of violent revolution can achieve this, then you have to join the violent revolution. Once it is involved in violence, it has a logic itself, and you will keep going. "

The Communist Party of China started with violent revolution in the early days. After the establishment of a regime in 1949, it still achieved the goal of governing through violence from time to time. In modern Chinese history, this tyranny method has caused the Chinese people many times. But to this day, the ideal social blueprint that Fang Zhimin is still difficult to achieve.

Hu Ping said that two very contradictory things were accommodated during the administration of the Communist Party of China. "On the one hand, it is Gao Yang's idealism, and on the other hand, it is very despicable and brutal revolutionary realism. These two things themselves are very sharp Occasions, strong tension. "

He emphasized that in this process, the ingredients of idealism will become less and less, because the brutal struggle of reality will increasingly push the governor to a ruthless situation.

Three Uyghur brothers who fled to India ten years ago are now planning to seek asylum from the Canadian government. According to their lawyers, the three brothers have been detained by the Indian authorities since 2013 and are facing a threat to China. In addition, the Arab countries praise the Chinese government's Uyghur policy, called Xinjiang society "harmonious" and religious freedom. According to observers, the majority of Muslim countries exclude Uighurs for their national interests. In this episode, we will further understand these situations, and the talks of relevant people are recorded by Anke.

Three Uyghur brothers fled from Xinjiang ten years ago and have been detained in India since then. Their lawyers said their goal was to seek asylum in Canada.

Their lawyer Muhammad Shafi La Su(Muhammed Appendix)He said that the three brothers were detained in India for 10 years and seemed to have been seeking asylum in India, and they faced the possibility of being expelled back to China.

Latsu said in an interview with Radio Free Asia recently: "The Indian government feels the threat of China. This is why they are hesitant to release these people and give them political asylum. They would rather detain them. "

Since the arrest of Jamam and Kashmir region in northern India in 2013, the brothers Adili, Abdulhalk and Abduslam Turson have been transferred to various detention centers of Kashmir. La Su said they are now detained in a prison in Jammo.

Latsu said that if a country provides political asylum to the Three Brothers of Turnson, he will ask the Supreme Court of India to release them.

In February this year, Canada proposed to resettle 10,000 Uighurs refugees, bringing new hope to them.

In order to help people apply for shelter, a humanitarian organization called the "Canadian Uyghur Human Rights Promotion Project" set up an online application form. Latsu said that he plans to use the application form on behalf of the brothers.

He said that he hoped that this would write a letter to the Canadian government before he requested asylum but did not get any response and got better results.

Latsu said he also wrote to several Arab countries on behalf of the three brothers, but he said that officials in these countries "do not care about the behavior of infringing human rights."

The United States and the United Nations urge not to repatriate Uyghur refugees in China. More and more evidence shows that as many as 1.8 million wum people and others have been detained in the "re -education" camp, torture, abuse, sexual abuse, and forced labor.

In 2013, in the face of the persecution of the Chinese government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, at that time, the three brothers of the 16 -year -old, 18 -year -old, and 20 -year -old Turzon were difficult to cross the rugged Karakon Mountains and entered the Kashmir Radak area in India.

They were arrested by the Indian Tibet Armed Police Force by the local Indian border forces and detained for about two months.

Latsu said that the three brothers admitted to crossing the border and were transferred to a police station in the city of Kashmir. In July 2014, they were accused of illegally entry and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment.

But Latsu said that the Indian authorities later sued the three brothers based on a special security law of Kashmir, and extended their detention every six months in the past 10 years. Latsu pointed out,

"This law is extremely strict and allows the government to detain individuals without trial."

Latsu said that during the imprisonment, the three brothers managed to maintain their religious worship and learned Urdu, Hindi, and English. He said,

"They pray five times a day in prison and read the" Gulan ". They are fasting during Ramadan. They always maintain the religious dedication spirit."

Kashmir independent reporter Akash Hassan wrote many articles on their cases, and he said that they were repatriated to China.

Hassan said that the Indian government has instructed that "the relevant authorities start the repatriation procedure. Therefore, these people may be repatriated back to China at any time."

Latsu said that he also asked the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to help. He told Liberty Asia,

"They emphasized that if the government officially recognizes these people's refugees, the United Nations refugees will provide them with various support and assistance."

However, the United Nations Refugee Department does not have the same requirements for other Indian refugees, including the Rohingya refugees who have escaped Myanmar in 2012.

Radio Free Asia on June 13, the representative of the United Nations refugee office in India office (Rama Dwivedi)The list of questions about the three brothers' cases was sent, but the reply has not been received.

The reporter Hassan said that even if Latsu or another lawyer can submit the case of the three brothers to the Supreme Court of India, the court is unlikely to make a favorable decision on them.

He said that India implements double standards for Uighurs and Tibetan refugees.

Hazan said: "On the one hand, India welcomes thousands of Tibetan refugees that escape from China controlled by China, and a large number of Tibetan refugees live in India. The treatment is related to the Muslims of the Uyghur. It seems that under the leadership of Premier Modi, India is increasingly embracing right -wing Hindu nationalism. "

Human Rights Observation Organization, Director of the South Asian Department, Minaksh Gandli(Meenakshi ganguly)In an interview with Liberty Asia on June 13 that the Indian government should stop repatriation of Uighurs back to China and not regard them as criminals.

She pointed out that although India has not signed the UN Refugee Convention, it is still obliged to comply with international law in cases involving Uighurs.

In addition, through two official visit to the Uyghur region recently, the Chinese government sent a chilling information to the Uighurs and its allies: the oppression policy of Chinese President Xi Jinping is correct, and the Arab countries support these policies.

According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, when inspecting Kashgar and Urumqi from May 22 to 24, Wang Huning, the highest policy adviser, told local officials to "comprehensively and accurately implement" Xi Jinping's policy of governing the country.

These policies include more than six years of large -scale detention, long -term imprisonment and forced labor. This move was condemned by the US government as racial extinction and was condemned by the United Nations as potential to endanger human crimes.

Shortly after Wang Huning's inspection, the Arab National Alliance delegation consisting of 22 regional issues of Arab countries visited Xinjiang from May 30 to June 2.The delegation visited the Aidili Mosque of Kashgar. The mosque has been open to tourists for many years, but basically prohibits Muslim believers from entering. The delegation also visited the old town of Kashgar.

The visit made overseas Uighurs and human rights activities frustrated. They said that the visit of the delegation highlighted China's confidence in its suppression of its action, and most of the world's desire for refueling in China.

Robert McCo, director of the Government Affairs Department of the United States-Islamic Relations Commission, said: "The Muslim leaders of Islamic countries allow China to use them to cover up race extinction of Turkic Muslims and other ethnic minorities," which is disappointing. "

Standing on the side of China — and the Uyghur, who mainly persecuted the government for Muslims, remained silent -obviously more in line with their national interests.

Mai Cao said: "Every country takes the best interests that it considers. At present, the Muslim country is providing a cover for China because they think this is in line with their economic interests."

Wang Huning is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Political Bureau of the Supreme Political Agency in China and the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. For a long time, analysts have always regarded him as a close consultant and confidant for Xi Jinping. This is his first visit to the Uyghur region as the leader of the China Government's Central Xinjiang Coordination Team.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wang Huning emphasized to local officials that Xinjiang policy is "part of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core."

Robert McCord added that Wang Huning said that the stability and public order of Xinjiang said that it is important to realize the stability and long -term safety of Xinjiang's social stability and long -term stability than Taishan. According to Xinhua News Agency, Wang Huning also asked officials to "unswervingly promote the normalization and legalization of counter -terrorism and stability."

The victim of Washington organized the Communist victim commemorative foundation China Researchers and Director Zheng Guoen(Adrian Zenz)Said: "Wang Huning said that the normalization of the surface and the fact that the surface of the Chinese Communist regime tried to depict was consistent." But in essence, it is very persistent on the emphasis on comprehensive security. "

Wang Huning also said that the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is "an important strategic force to achieve the overall goal of the party's Xinjiang work", and its functions should be "give full play".

However, researchers at the University of Sheffield Halham said that the functions of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps sanctioned by the U.S. government, including abroad detention and imprisonment, land acquisition, forced population migration, suppression, publicity, social engineering, religious persecution, and religious persecution, and religious persecution Forced labor.

David Tobin, a lecturer in East Asia Research from the University of Sheffield, said that Wang Huning's visit showed the confidence and rigidity of the CCP's operations in Xinjiang.

Tobin said: "The party -state now thinks that they are conducting and the actions are more confident. However, they must send leaders to remind regional leaders to implement policies. This fact shows that they realize that this balance and this current peace is unstable. It may be temporary, because the problem caused by any detention system is huge. "

The Tibetan group of this station [Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06302023093159.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06302023093159.html/@@stream)Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, Tibet sends out to invite you to look at Tibet with me. The Lhasa authorities have recently hit the people's illegal use of satellite antennas and confiscated the Tibetan equipment watching foreign programs. In addition, the authorities are randomly searching for the Tibetan temples, asking Tibetan Buddhist monks to cut off the relationship with the Dalai Lama, which is consistent with a decree that requires civil servants to cut off and exile leaders. When the Tibetan Government of Tibetan Government, the administrative Central Division of the Tibetan Government, Pakistani, has recently called for "real autonomy" in Australia to give a speech in Australia. He said that for Tibetans, the most important thing is the "quality" problem of rule. Previously, the representatives of the Chinese Embassy had pressured the Australian News Club to ask them to cancel the speech of the Tibetan exile leader. Bian Ba Jiren was invited to attend the opening ceremony of the "Xi Jinping era, the Chinese Tibetan policy" seminar on June 27th in New Delhi, India. In this episode, we will further understand these news. The conversation was recorded by Anke.

The Lhasa police and two people familiar with the matter said that the Chinese authorities have searched for Tibetan residences in the Lhasa of Tibet since June to determine whether the Tibetans receive foreign broadcasting and TV programs through satellite antennas.

According to the Lhasa Police website, from June 8th to 9th, the Broadcasting and Television Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region, including Lhasa, conducted illegal satellite broadcast investigations on each household with the police. So far, the authorities have confiscated about 50 satellite antennas.

In 2009, the Chinese government provided the government's approval satellite antenna for each family of Lhasa, but residents could only watch a limited number of national control programs.

For Tibetans, it is illegal to pass the satellite contact or watch the national -approved broadcast programs. A Tibetan who lives in Lhasa who refuses to disclose his name in order to speak smoothly.

"The satellite antennas of these families are installed by the Chinese government. Satellites can only receive programs controlled by the country, and the number is very limited. Tibetans cannot buy other satellite antennas or pay for other news and information. Yes illegal. "

The authorities said that their measures were to ensure the harmony and stability of Tibet, and the investigation would continue.

But Tibetans believe that this is another way for the Chinese government to prevent them from getting external information and restricting their communication. Bai Majiale, a researcher of "Tibetan Observation", based on the advocacy and monitoring organization of London, said,

"This operation is the government's combat Tibetans to listen to foreign news and programs using satellite equipment, and track Tibetan mobile phones to monitor them with external communication."

Another Tibetan who refused to disclose the name for the same reason said that before checking the private residence, the Lhasa authorities had banned the use of satellite antennas at hotels and hotels.

A person familiar with the matter said that although the satellite antenna installed by the government is only played by state -owned programs, they can sometimes receive foreign programs.

"However, to do this and not be caught depending on the control of human skills."

In addition, the exile Tibetan sources told Radio Free Asia that the Tibetan authorities are randomly searching for temples and forcing monks to sign documents to cut off all the connections with the most important spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism in Tibetan Buddhism.

Chinese leaders generally believe that the Dalai Lama is a splitter, and intends to split Tibet from the control of Beijing.

At present, the Dalai Lama, an exile in India, only said that he sought that Tibet as part of China can obtain greater autonomy and ensure that the language, culture and religion of Tibet are protected.

Radio Free Asia reported in 2022 that the Chinese authorities began to demand that Tibetans who work in government units sever all their relationships with the Dalai Lama as employment conditions. The local government seems to have incorporated the temple into this regulation.

A Tibetan Tibetan who required anonymous for safety reasons told Liberty Radio Tibetan Tibetan group. Starting from June, the Chinese authorities searched the temples in Shenza County and Suxian County under the premise of maintaining safety. The exile person said,

"The authorities searched the main temples of all the residences of the monks and the temple. The monks in the temple of Shenza County were also forced to cut off the relationship with the Dalai Lama His Holiness and became part of the Anti -Dalai Lama Group."

In a photo received by Radio Free Asia from Tibet, you can see that the monks in Shenza County signed their name on a board on the wall.

The brand reads: "We will resolutely oppose the Dalai Group and maintain loyalty and dedication to the country."

Another exile Tibetan who was unwilling to disclose his name said that as part of the search, the authorities have been reviewing the manuscripts and books of the monks and praying for the banner from the shrine. The exile said,

"They did not send any forms of warnings before these random search. The monks in these temple were called to meet, forced to sign the documents, and abandon the Dalai Lama and divisionism."

In addition, the leaders of the Tibetan government said on June 21 that if Beijing gives real autonomy, the Tibetans will be willing to accept Chinese rule. When it comes to the status of Scotland and South Titian under the rule of Britain and Italy, the Tibetan administrative central leader Si Zhengbian Baba Ren said,

"If the autonomy like Tibetans is given, they will be happy to live under the framework of the constitution of the People's Republic of China. This is not the question of who ruled and who ruled. This is the core of the rules,"

Bian Ba Jiren reiterated in the Australian National News Club in Canberra's Australian National News Club on "Solving the Conflict of Han and Tibetan and ensuring peace in the region". The Tibetan conflict, the strategy of promoting the real autonomy of the Tibetan under the rule of China, as the Chinese Constitution was exposed by the Chinese Constitution.

However, he emphasized the independent status in Tibet history and stated that unless this status was recognized, China had no reason to negotiate with the Tibet Autonomous Region.

The one -hour speech of Bianba Ren also involved the Chinese government's attempt to control the reincarnation process of the Dalai Lama, monitor Buddhist temples, and restrict Tibetan actions. Although the Beijing authorities have done their best before, Bian Ba Jiren made the speech.

Earlier in June, representatives of the Chinese Embassy met with Maurice Reilyl, chairman of the News Club, expressed his opposition to attending the event and asked to withdraw his invitation.

Since the invasion of Tibet in 1949, China has been controlling Tibet and refused to acknowledge any concept of the Tibetan government, especially the legitimacy of the Dalai Lama, who lives in Dalai, India. Beijing has also increased the intensity of eroding Tibetan culture, language and religion.

A speech published at the National News Club was broadcast on Australian television, and well -known media workers attended. Observed people believed that Beijing may have lobby Riley because it is worried that Bian Bajiren will get a wider exposure.Earlier on June 21, Bian Ba Jiren delivered a speech on the geopolitical significance of Tibet at the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy.

On June 20th, Bian Bajiren observed the process of the Australian Parliament. Members Soffi Skolls and Susan Templeman introduced the situation in Tibet under the rule of Chinese rule in detail. He also met several Australian members.

In an interview with the Tibetan Tibetan Community Association Chairman, KALSANGTSERING, he welcomed the visit of about 2,500 Tibetans living in Australia on behalf of about 2,500 Tibetan Tibetan groups.

He said: "The honor of Si Zhengba Bayren in Australia and the Australian Parliament is overwhelming. Obviously, members have given so much support to the Tibetan cause."

Bian Ba Jiren appeared in Canberra on June 20.

Earlier, according to the Sydney Pioneer Morning Post, the Chinese government was criticized for speeches by trying to stop the Tibetan government leaders in the Australian National News Club in Canberra.

Representatives of the Chinese Embassy recently met with the chairman of the reporter's club Morris Riley, which expressed opposition on June 20, and asked to revoke his invitation to him.

"Sydney Pioneer Morning News" quoted a letter from the Chinese Embassy to Lili, saying, "China regards Australia regardless of China's position and concern, allowing them to use the national news club platform to engage in division activities, expressing strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition. The essence of the Dalai Lama Group, respecting the core interests and major concerns of China, eliminating its negative impacts with actual actions, and preventing the healthy development of Sino -Australian relations and media cooperation. "

Despite the pressure of Beijing, Riley told the local media that there was no plan to cancel his speech, and tickets were still sold on the website of the news club.

He pointed out that he told the Chinese Embassy officials that the news club was "institution of freedom of speech, freedom of media, and public debate."

Human rights activity person, former Tibetan exile parliament member Kim Zongyun(Kyinzom Dhongdue)Tell the Tibetan group of Radio Free Asia that the National News Club is a stage for everyone to share their views. she says,

"We all know how the Chinese government has established influence and dependence through trade and economic relations with Australia. In the past ten years, we have seen that the top Australian education institutions have canceled the Dalai Lama's speech. Stress. But it is unimaginable to put pressure on the National News Club this time, because the representative of the National News Club is freedom of speech. "

The Dalai Lama represents Kama Xinchi in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia that Australia will not succumb to China. He said,

"Australia is a democratic country, so we believe that the Australian government will not expand its influence and destroy Australian institutions."

According to the Voice of Tibetan reports, the Tibetan administrative Central Secretary Politaic Baden was invited to attend the opening ceremony of the "Xi Jinping Tibetan Policy" seminar on June 27th in New Delhi, India. Bian Ba Jiren pointed out that some Indian media regarded the "Tibet Autonomous Region" as a whole. He said that if the international community supports the "intermediate road" policy proposed by the Dalai Lama and the vision of the Tibetan people, it must acknowledge the independent position of Tibet in history, otherwise the international community's support for Tibet is meaningless.

After the cancellation of the new crown epidemic restriction measures, the phenomenon of smuggling women and girls in trafficking in the border increased again. This phenomenon stopped due to the closure of the border during the epidemic, but is now recovering.

According to the US "Wall Street Journal" reported on the 30th, in recent months, the Sino -Vietnamese border has continued to have a population case.

Human Rights Observation Organization Asia Deputy Director Phil Robertson(Phil Robertson)Said: "What we see is that the" population trafficking "situation is slowly recovering, partly because the demand has not disappeared." He also said that there is still gender imbalance in China, and it can still make a lot of money by selling these women and girls.

Last year, China's "Iron Chain Women" incident has strengthened the attention of the phenomenon of selling women. The imbalance of gender proportions in China is the result of deep -rooted male and female culture and decades of decades of only children's policy. According to the 2020 census data, in the age of 20 to 40 in China, the number of men is 17.5 million more than women. Most of these men live in rural areas.

According to Chinese police, court documents and human rights organizations, in recent years, more and more trafficking brides have come abroad, including Vietnam, Myanmar and North Korea.

In the northern region of China and North Korea, assistance organizations said that many women who escaped the Pyongyang regime were forced to prostitution or married Chinese men. Many of them and other fugitives were eventually arrested and sent to the detention center by the Chinese authorities. Human rights observers estimate that nearly 2,000 North Koreans have been detained at the detention center near the border between China and North Korea. Once the border control related to the new crown virus is canceled, Beijing is expected to be repatriated to these North Koreans.

The report also mentioned that another factor that caused the resurgence of population trafficking activities was that young people in Vietnam generally believe that after the epidemic, China's life is much better, which makes many Vietnamese women easily be seduced by false work opportunities.

As the vane of the policy of the next stage, the meeting pointed out that in terms of exchange rates, "resolutely prevent the risk of the exchange rate up and down, and maintain the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level."

It is reported that Minsheng Securities expects that the current RMB exchange rate situation has attracted the attention of the central bank and requires the central bank to start management tools. If the key point of the market psychological expectation game, the method of relieving the pressure of depreciation may be that the foreign exchange liquidity regulation tool is enabled to maintain the exchange rate trend in the short term.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-30T16-51-00-04-00/000000.png)Liu He, when he served as Vice Premier of the State Council of the State Council, was waiting to meet with US Treasury Secretary Yelun on January 18, 2023. [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-30T16-51-00-04-00/000001.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-06302023092235.html/@@images/image)Agence France-France-France-France-France-France-France-France-France-A-Langk: https://www.rfa.org/Mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhao/gx 06302023092235.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-06302023092235.html/@@stream)The "retreat" of Liu He, one of the most important economic think tanks of Xi Jinping, one of the most important economic think tanks of Xi Jinping, was actually the same reason behind Yi Gang after losing his party's position but accidentally re -election. On the word "outside", the earth's incompetence in Li Qiang's cabinet caused the turtles in the former Li Keqiang's cabinet to retreat!

Last Friday, on the 23rd of this month, the "South China Morning Post" in Hong Kong quoted five sources as saying that the last deputy prime minister of the Chinese Communist regime Liu He still participated in China after the Chinese leadership personnel reorganized and unloaded all positions. The government's internal conference on economic affairs has a high influence.

One of the sources said that the Chinese leadership highly evaluated Liu He's rich experience and knowledge. Another source said: "Liu He was asked to provide opinions on key issues such as domestic economic policies in China and how to deal with the United States on trade and economic issues."

It is reported that Liu He's rich knowledge and experience are considered "invaluable", especially in Beijing to formulate strategies to respond to the United States. When determining which areas should cooperate and which areas should be countered ... Liu He's professional knowledge and experience, as well as his connection with key decision makers in other countries, allows "Liu He can become China's reconstruction with other countries, especially the economic relations with Western countries."

According to the author's opinion, here is "price" to describe Liu He's still important to Xi Jinping's regime-from the current stage, it is even more important. It is not very vivid. The precise statement should be "no one substitution."

In a simple sentence, through the economic and trade team of the State Council at the Economic and Trade team of the State Council at the 14th National People's Congress at the 14th National People's Congress at the 14th National People's Congress in March of this year, Li Qiang and Li Keqiang are far from a order of magnitude. Either He Lifeng in the financial and related fields, or Ding Xuexiang, and Liu He can be said to have no comparability at all.

After the "Two Sessions" of the Communist Party of China in March this year, the author published "Why Xi Jinping is jealous of Li Keqiang in this column? ", Said that from 1982 to 2002, for a full 20 years held by the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Li Keqiang has pressed him Xi Jinping in both political qualifications or real education. Today, Li Keqiang has already sued his old hometown. And in the past ten years, Xi Jin usually gave one of the inner reasons for Li Keqiang's small shoes that had pressed his political qualifications and actual academic qualifications, which was his mentality of Xi Jinping's "Wu Dazhen store".

After the article was published, a reporter asked about why Xi Jinping cleared all his cabinets while Li Keqiang returned his villagers? The author's answer is: Hate House and Wuyu!

Although it is a joke, it is not unreasonable.

After the newly introduced by the new State Council in March this year, external media described the image of "the State Council of the State Council of the Communist Party of China".

As early as January of this year, before the second Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was finalized for the "Two Sessions" personnel arrangements, Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" published an analysis article of "the old leadership?" In Li Keqiang's cabinet, including himself, all deputy prime ministers and members of the State Council, namely Han Zheng, Sun Chunlan, Hu Chunhua, Wei Fenghe, Wang Yong, Wang Yi, Xiao Jie, Zhao Kezhi, all left. Even those who have not been announced in the 20th National Congress will be renamed as a post outside the State Council.

The head of them was Li Qiang, and then the executive deputy prime minister Ding Xuexiang, the other three deputy prime ministers were He Lifeng, Liu Guozhong, and Zhang Guoqing, the State Councilor Wang Xiaohong (concurrently served as the Minister of Public Security), Li Shangfu (also the Minister of Defense), Wu Zhenglong ( He is also the Secretary -General of the State Council), Yi Yiqin, Qin Gang (concurrently served as a foreign minister).

This article analyzes that of the 37 departments, directs and offices of the State Council, 27 leaders have just been replaced or will be replaced within one year, including key diplomacy, national defense, development and reform, public security, finance, central banks, state -owned assets and other ministries and commissions.

The article "Ming Pao" states that at least 70 % of Li Keqiang's chores' heads of the cabinet. The article said that this dazzling large class has never been before the history of the State Council of the Communist Party of China.

This article also specifically predicted the person in charge of some ministries and commissions of Li Qiangxin's cabinet, including the time of the director of the Development and Reform Commission from He Lifeng, the director of the Development and Reform Commission. Zhu Hexin, the chairman of CITIC Group, and Lu Zhiyuan, deputy secretary of Shandong and Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee who may replace the post of Minister of Finance.

Speaking of which, whether it is generally commented on the outside world or the view of the author himself at the time, after the closing of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last October last year, Wang Yong and Xiao Jie, members of the State Council of the State Council, who will succeed in the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Put on the list of "discharge" is completely based on the inertial thinking of "one dynasty, one dynasty". However, Yi Gang, then the president of the central bank and Liu Kun, who was then the Minister of Finance, should also "discharge" the analysis of Li Keqiang, which is based on the age of the two. Arrangement, whether it is a central member, a member of the Central Committee, or a member of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission.

In January and February of this year, the author published the "U.S." Lifetime Professor ". How much is it likely to continue to be in charge of the Central Bank of the Communist Party of China? "And" Several Possibilities for Possibilities of the Next Central Bank "two articles specifically analyzed this. Interested readers and listeners may wish to refer to reading.

As for the candidates for the new Minister of Finance, the author has also analyzed in an article that has never been published in March this year that Lu Zhiyuan is the most likely. According to this person's financial education and the background of the local financial director, and special arrangements for the deputy provincial and ministerial levels at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

This person was born in Suide, Shaanxi. He was admitted to the university at the age of 20. He was assigned to Yan'an Finance and Economics School as a teacher after graduating from his hometown in his hometown in 1988. In 1990, he returned to his alma mater. After studying for three years, he was in politics in full -day. In July 1993, he entered the Budget Office of the Xi'an Finance Bureau as a staff member. After that, it took 7 years to boil into the deputy director of the Xi'an Finance Bureau. class. In July 2002, he was renamed the deputy secretary and district of the Yanliang District Party Committee of the Xi'an City of the Communist Party of China.

Lu Zhiyuan, born in July 1964, is 38 years old at this time. Among the CCP officials of the same age, it is relatively late.On September 2, 2021, Lu Zhiyuan was announced by the Central Organization Department to be transferred to the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. On June 1, 2022, he was announced to be promoted to the Deputy Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Four months later, Li Ganjie, the then Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, and Zhou Naixiang, the director of Shandong Province, entered the 20th Central Committee of the Central Committee at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Lu Zhiyuan is one of them.

At that time, the second basis for Lu Zhiyuan to enter the State Council was that after Li Ganjie, the Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, "entered the bureau" in December last year. Lin Wu, who entered the 20th Central Committee with Lu Zhiyuan. The intention to make Lu Zhiyuan's "standby" is very obvious.

As a result, the author's analysis of the political prospects of Lu Zhiyuan above has not been issued, which makes the author at the time feel very surprising at the time of the Ministry of People's Congress, which was officially announced in the National People's Congress in March this year. The president of the central bank and the Minister of Finance were "comforted." As for Lu Zhiyuan today, he still stays at the position of deputy secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee as the new member of the Central Committee.

At that time, the Voice of America published an analysis article "Fighting the continuity and stability of the economic challenges and the stability of the Central Bank of China by the President of the People's Bank of China. Replaced by people with less international experience. The article quotes Wu Muyu, an associate professor at the School of Public Policy, the National University of Singapore, saying: "People like Yi Gang as the central bank governor will feel much more comfortable. This shows that China hopes to have at least the United States on monetary policy and financial cooperation. . "The article also quoted the comments from economists Sun Fei: These appointments" show that the government puts professionalism, management and fine -tuning art first when selecting the governor of the central bank and the Minister of Finance, because the helm of the core economic department needs superb professionalism Skill,".

According to the author, as of the end of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, then Li Qiang first replaced Li Keqiang's party secretary of the State Council of the State Council in the party. The decision to be a long -term succession should be because He Lifeng's "comfort".

Regarding that Chen Xi was Xi Jinping's "ordinary class" in Tsinghua University's "ordinary class", he began "Chen Xi and Xi Jinping are classmates and the same party" published in this column 10 years ago. The article analyzes the special relationship between Chen Xi and Xi Jinping in detail. The author was the first overseas disclosure that the two were not only the same window of Tsinghua in the past, but also the upper and lower shops of the same house. Not only were they the upper and lower shops of the same house, but Xi Jinping was also an introduced by Chen Xi.

Some former officials who had been supplied by the State Council of the Chinese State Council read the article as follows, and suggested that the author verify whether He Lifeng and Liu Kun also slept in the same specialty in the same major in Xiamen University. Although the author did not study the results, the author also noticed that when Liu Kun was appointed as the Minister of Finance in March 2018 as early as five years ago, the CCP official media deliberately emphasized that he and He Lifeng's Tongxiang and Xiamen University classmates of Fujian and Xiamen University. relation.

After the author's 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year, I only thought of Liu Kun, born in 1956, who was born in 1956, but did not notice that the 19th Central Discipline Inspection Commission members were arranged. However, after the 20th National Congress, he has not been arranged for the representative of the adults, nor is it arranged as a member of the CPPCC. After the analysis, he was uneasy and arranged for Liu Kun to enter the CPPCC, and did not arrange for him to take the time behind the scenes of the National People's Congress as a second -line post. It was because he had decided that he had served in the State Council at the time.

Compared with Liu Kun, Guo Shuqing, then Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank, was announced as a representative of the National People's Congress without being re -elected as a member of the Central Committee, which means that it is already one of the 14th Standing Committee of the People's Congress; The president Yi Gang failed to be promoted to the Central Committee members of the Central Central Committee on the 20th Central Committee. After being announced as a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the author also analyzed whether it may imitate Zhou Xiaochuan of the year. While announcing the re -elected governor of the central bank, he was also arranged to be the vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and became the central bank's long -term central bank.

However, among the members of the CPPCC announced in March this year, there is no Yi Gang in the list of vice chairmen. At the same time, he was announced as a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee and Deputy Chairman of the CPPCC Economic Committee. treatment. At the same time, Yi Gang was re -elected as the president in the "list of new components" announced by the National People's Congress. Such a card that does not follow the cards, which makes the analysts including the author, are all foggy.

Today, with the news of Liu He's "retreat", analyzing Yi Gang has been identified as "discharge" after the 20th National Congress of last year, but in March this year, it was announced at the National People's Congress. The reason behind the scenes is not based on the "comfort" for the United States, but because Li Qiang looked at it in the cabinet. To the person who speaks.

In the previous content, Liu Kun introduced Liu Kun. One of the goals is to explain that Liu Kun and He Lifeng, who have believed in He Lifeng, are all from the Economic Department of Xiamen University. The strong southern Fujian cavity is not daring to open his mouth in front of Americans. Compared with Liu He who has studied a degree in the United States, Yi Gang is a difference in heaven and earth.

If Li Qiang compares with his predecessor Li Keqiang, the same is true of the ability gap in foreign exchanges. In the future, I will compare Li Keqiang's ability and academic qualifications to write an article. Here is the topic of the previous article to continue to analyze whether the central bank's president Yi Gang can be "observed" for a long time.

As mentioned earlier, while Yi Gang became the "Bai Ding" of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he was arranged to be the then chairman of CITIC, who was arranged as the 20th Central CITIC member. To replace Yi Gang's first candidate.

Born in 1968, Zhu Hexin, who was ten years old than Yi Gang, was very beautiful-from the perspective of the long-term central bank, but like Liu Kun, he was also a soil. At least he has not arranged him to replace Yi Gang for the time being, which is likely to deal with the West, especially when dealing with the United States for a while.

One month after Yi Gang was "comforted" by the governor of the central bank, CITIC Bank announced on April 17 that Zhu Hexin resigned from the bank's chairman and non -executive director due to the needs of the work arrangement.

Therefore, Zhu Hexin will take over the voice of the central bank's governor. However, the author believes that since Yi Gang has been announced by the internal plan to be "observed", then this "observation" period should not be shorter for three or two. As for Zhu Hexin's current place, stay in this column and continue to analyze the next article.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

A Chinese woman said that when immigration officials were called into the "small black house" when they entered the country at Malaysia International Airport and claimed that they were unknown.

● The electric vehicle giant Tesla is expected to announce the number of delivery in the second quarter on Sunday (July 2).

![](Images/zaobao world/2023-06-30T19-38/000001.png)In the past few quarters, Nike has been working hard to solve the problem of excessive inventory level, because the issue of this storage has directly affected its profit margin. Nike's inventory at the end of the fourth quarter reached $ 8.5 billion, which was the same as the same period last year. However, Nike has reduced the deposit library by about $ 400 million. (Reuters)

#### Nike (Nike Inc)

#### (New York Stock Exchange code: nKE)

Sports equipment giant Nike has not reached the standard for the first time in three years. The quarterly performance released on Thursday (29th) brought out the dilemma of Nike's decline in profit margin, which led Nike's stock price to fall more than 4 % in the post -consignment transactions.

According to Nike's fourth quarter performance report as of the end of May this year, the Group's turnover was US $ 12.83 billion, and the quarterly net profit was US $ 130 million, which was $ 0.66 per share. This number is really inferior to US $ 1.44 billion in the same period last year, that is, $ 0.90 per share, which is really inferior.

The average prediction of analysts collected by Refinitiv is the turnover of $ 12.59 billion and a profit of $ 0.67 per share. Although these analysts have made some "psychological preparation" adjustments in profit, Nike's profit is still not up to the standard, which is a very rare mistake for Nike.

Nike's quarterly turnover increased by 5 % compared with 12.23 billion US dollars in the same period last year, and it was also higher than the analogy of analysts. It was the company's seventh consecutive quarter turnover exceeded the standard. This is mainly because China's cancellation of restrictions on the epidemic has driven Nike's sales in China. Nike fell 1.4 percentage points to 43.6 % in the fourth quarter, which was also the main reason for the failure of profitable profit.

From the perspective of the entire fiscal year, Nike's annual turnover was 51.2 billion US dollars, an increase of 10 % over the previous year. The average prediction of Refinitiv analysts for Nike's annual turnover was $ 5.99 billion.

However, Nike's annual profit has disappointed investors. Nike's annual net profit was $ 5.1 billion, a total of 16 % less than the previous year. Its profit per share is 3.23 US dollars, which is low as an analogy's average prediction of 3.24 US dollars.

As for the performance of the next year and the current quarter, Nike executives are a bit conservative. The retail giant executives predict that the turnover of fiscal 2024 will achieve medium -digit growth. Its chief financial officer Matthewfriend said: "Considering the current macro environment, Nike feels that his prediction is a" big number '. " 6.3 %.

Executives also expect that the current quarterly turnover is expected to be flat or growing low, and the gross profit margin will also drop by 0.5 to 0.75 percentage points. However, the gross profit margin throughout the year can increase by 1.4 to 1.6 percentage points.

Among the 22 analysts of Tipranks, 18 rated Nike's "buying", three rated ratings for "holding", and a rating of "selling". The average target price of the one -year period was 131.95 Dollar.

German Prime Minister Tsugs said that the "de -risk" of the European Union and China is more based on the corporate level, not the national level.

Reuters reported that Souls on Friday (June 30) attended the two -day EU Leaders Summit in Brussels on Friday (June 30) to reporters: "(EU to China) Risk is not a short -term project, because it mainly involves enterprises that need to be enterprises. Make a decision. "

Souls added that in the past, companies often need to bear major risks because they only choose to rely on one supplier and do not consider the geographical location of the supplier.

He pointed out: "This is about not putting all eggs in the same basket (decision) ... This is what they (enterprises) are doing now, they have already started this process ... This is not the country's decision to decide by the country. Yes, because we won't tell them (what should be) invest. "

In order to alleviate European -China relations, the Chairman of the European Commission, Feng Delin, has proposed to "risk" instead of "decoupling" with China.

On June 20, a plan issued by the European Union outlines the proposal about how to determine security risks, control key technology exports, and restrict future sensitive investment. The European Union is also seeking key resource supply (such as raw materials, semiconductors, and car batteries) for the fragile reform, and increasing investment in emerging technologies that are considered strategic importance.

The analysis believes that EU officials try to achieve a delicate balance, which must not only be able to conduct targeted intervention in areas with military influence, but also maintain a wider trade connection with the Chinese market.
