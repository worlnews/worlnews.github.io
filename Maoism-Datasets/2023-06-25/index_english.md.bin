Blintin said with Xi Jin that Washington knew "the challenges brought by China."

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday (June 19) in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. He is the highest -level American official who visited China after taking office in 2021 in Joebiden.

In the two -day visits of Brinken, both China and the United States proposed to have a stable relationship, but the United States seemed to be able to restart military communication channels. China emphasizes that the United States should "reflect" for the stalemate of the current bilateral relations, and there are nothing more important among the issues of Sino -US relations.

After Brinken left China, US President Joebiden first described US -China relations on the "correct track", and then publicly criticized Xi Jinping as a "dictator" after one day, which once again attracted strong criticism in Beijing.

Some media quoted the Chinese Embassy in the United States that the ambassador Xie Feng proposed to the White House with relevant officials of the United States State Department of "strictly negotiating and strong protests." A statement issued on Thursday (22nd) stated: "China urges the United States to take practical action immediately, eliminate negative impacts, and abide by its own commitments, otherwise all consequences will be borne by the United States."

Biden responded to reporters: "I don't think this will bring any real consequences."

Although it is generally commented that Brinken's visit to China has taken an important step in restoring the healthy development of bilateral relations, many observers pointed out to the BBC that whether it can truly return to normal is still to be carefully observed.

The director of the Ukrainian President's Office, Mykhailopodolyak, tweeted that "everything in Russia has just begun" and "the splitting of the Russian elite class is too obvious, and it is impossible to pretend that everything is solved."

BBC learned from Russian sources that Wagner militants have controlled all military facilities in Voronezh. The city of Volne is located between Rostov (Wagner said that the city is currently controlled) and the capital Moscow.

Officials of Volneri have not yet commented on this statement.

At the same time, Aleksandr Gusev, Governor of Volne, warned that there were many false reports on the armored column activities of the region.

Gu Xiefu also said that the Russian armed forces are currently taking action and combat measures in the Volnes.

At present, the latest development is that the Wagner's mercenary rebel soldiers claim that it has controlled the Rostov on the Russian river near the Ukrainian border.

A resident of Rostov on the River on the River told BBC Russian reporters that the entire city center was surrounded and blocked.

The person who was unwilling to be named said there was a soldier around. He said: "When (we) asked who they were, the soldiers said,‘ we are just good people ’.”

"The situation in this city is very calm: there is no panic, everything is like usual."

They also said that the streets that "seemed to be free" for ten minutes to walk the southern military headquarters who claimed to occupy the southern military headquarters, but the area near the military building was "closely surrounded."

###  Elf came out of the bottle

Incidents may develop in several ways. For Ukraine, Russia is not good at the time of trouble.

Just when Kiev is adapting to its long -term commitment counterattack, it is unlikely that when it is unlikely to expel the Russian army this year and next year, a lifeline appears.

As the Kremlin and Wagner are now focusing on the internal fighting, this has led some of the most powerful Russian combat forces to withdraw from the battlefield.

More importantly, this challenge to Moscow may seriously weaken the morale of all solid -line Russian troops stationed in Ukraine.

In the ideal world, all this will end with Russia's war and end from Ukraine. But things cannot be so simple.Another possible result is that the challenges of Porigjin's challenge to the Kremlin will be short -lived, and his army will be forced to surrender.

But no matter what happened, the elves have come out of the bottle.

In the past few months of Bakhmut, Russia's only major victory told the Russian people that the entire excuse for invading was lies, and the threat from Ukraine was fabricated.

Once the richest oligarchy in Russia, Hodolkovsky said: "We need help now, if necessary, we will fight."

After Ten years after Ho Dorkovsky and Putin turned over, he recently called for more severe sanctions on Russian presidents.

He said that if he decides to fight the Kremlin, it is important to "even support the devil."

He said, "Yes, this is just the beginning."

###  Expert: The severe challenge to Putin

** BBC Reporter ** ** Baby Bernede De Besman ** ** (Bern Debusmann JR) ** **, ** ** ** Helenahumphrey from Washington ** **

The world is closely paying close attention to the sharp upgrade of Russia, including former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and officials of the Central Intelligence Agency Mick Mulroy.

Malroe told the BBC that the head of the Wagner Group Priegojin now proposes a severe challenge to President Putin.

Without provocation, the Russian people were deceived. "

He told me that if Wagner's army can indeed threaten Putin's control over Russia, Russia may have to "re -adjust its military forces in order to protect themselves, rather than prevent Ukraine's counterattack."

He also said, "Even if the coup attempts, it also shows that the closest to this war knows that this is a terrible mistake."

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Billtaylor, told BBC that Porigerz called the rebellion this time, "It is almost definitely a coup to an attempt." "This is serious for Putin. This matter.

Taylor was in Ukraine last month, and he judged that Wagner was unlikely to succeed this time. "The Ministry of National Defense has equipment, aircraft, and tanks. They have a large number of military equipment to defeat the troops of Pleigin."

But he believes that Russia's internal crickets may help Ukraine to repel the invasion of the Russian army. "If the Russian army is now worried about their internal command chains, then the Russian soldiers who should fight Ukraine may be distracted or even escape."

###  瓦 What do you say?

On Friday, Porigin released a series of angry recording on the Internet. He accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered a rocket attack on Wagner's camp in Ukraine on Friday.

He said: "Today they conducted a rocket attack on our rear camps, and a large number of comrades in our arms were killed."

"They deceived us scams," he added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense denied a rocket attack against the Wagner forces.

Porigabin then stated that his troops would expel Shoshugu and called on the Russian army to flash aside.Image source, EPA

Porigin publicly criticized the Russian Defense Minister, Shiyugu.

"This is not a military coup, but the march of justice," he said.

Porigin also claimed that Sho Gulu personally commanded the so -called attack and escaped.

"It is necessary to stop the evil actions shown by the country's military leadership," he shouted.

Since then, Pricigo also claims that his troops have entered Russia from Ukraine, but did not provide evidence.

Earlier, he posted a video saying that Russia had no reason to invade Ukraine. This war was a disaster.

###  What is the Wagner Group?

Wagner Group St. Petersburg Office.

The Wagner Group was first discovered in 2014. At that time, it was a secret organization that supported the pro -Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and assisted Russia to annex Crimea.

The organization is also active in Africa and the Middle East. It is understood that only about 5,000 soldiers were at first, most of which were veterans of the Russian Elite Corps and special forces.

To this day, the organization has grown. According to the British Department of Defense in January, Wagner currently command 50,000 combatants in Ukraine, and has become a key part of the Ukrainian battle. Due to the shortage of Russia's regular army's manpower, the organization began to recruit a lot in 2022.

The National Security Council said earlier this year that about 80%of Wagner's troops in Ukraine came from prison.

Although the mercenaries were illegal in Russia, the Wagner Group registered as a company in 2022 and opened a new headquarters in St. Petersburg.

Dr. Samuel Ramani of the Royal Institute of National Defense Security said: "It is a public recruitment personnel in Russia's cities, advertising on billboards, and called patriotic organizations on the Russian media."

A few weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, people believed that the Wagner Group implemented a "fake flag" attack, giving the Kremlin an invasive excuse.

One of the most famous photos of Pricigin is that he is serving Putin (November 11, 2011, a restaurant outside Moscow). He then won the nickname "Putin".

Vagna participated in Russia to occupy the city of Udon Bach Murd. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not mention Wagner's role at first, but later praised its mercenaries to play the role of "bravery and selflessness".

The current leader of the organization, Pleigo, is a wealthy businessman and provides catering services for the Kremlin.

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Li Zhiying, the founder of the Apple Daily, who has been detained in Hong Kong since 2020, has been charged with four charges including the issuance of inciting publications and colluding foreign forces. The trial was postponed to September this year.

Li Zhiying is a British citizen holding a British passport. His son Sebastien Lai recently shouted to the British government and asked the country to use the Li Zhiying case as a "political priority" when dealing with the Hong Kong authorities.

In an interview with Agence France -Presse, Li Chongen said: "If they (the British government) do not resolutely protect their citizens in a place where they have business exchanges with them, what is the meaning of having their passports? What is the meaning of its citizen? "

Experts believe that although the Hong Kong authorities guarantee justice independence in mainland China, this decision shows that Beijing has the ability to influence Hong Kong's justice.

Kaowe Salvyi provides/RFA [ADIO-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jieduxinjiang/xinjing-06242023182931.html/@@stream(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jieduxinjiang/xinjing-06242023182931.html/@@stream)Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, welcome you to interpret Xinjiang with me. The U.S. government and rights defenders demanded that the 19 -year -old Uyghur student Camille Wayti, who had been imprisoned, was detained by the Chinese authorities for the release of a video of the "White Paper Movement" protest in November 2022. Another Uyghur college student was sentenced to 13 years in prison for using virtual network VPN. It is understood that the computer science major was arrested in 2017 for trying to evade review and obtain "illegal information". In addition, the recent Palestinian leaders issued a joint statement when visiting China to support the Uyghur policy of the Chinese government, and an expert said that this is because "the Uyghur issue does not meet the interests of Palestine." In this episode, let's understand these situations together.

The US government and human rights activities called for a 19 -year -old Uyghur college student to immediately release a prison in Xinjiang after being sentenced by the authorities for "preaching extremeism" in March this year.

Kamile Wayi, a preschool education student at a university in Henan Province, China, was detained in December 2022 because she posted a piece of "white paper in China in November in social media applications in November. In the video of the protests, in the video, people held white paper to protest the restrictions and lack of speech freedom of the new crown virus epidemic.

Wayti is one of dozens of young people detained by protests in various parts of China. The cause of the protest is the fatal blocking fire of an apartment building in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, causing about 40 Uyghur deaths.

Kewser Wayit, the brother of Wayti, told Liberty Radio in a report in January that Camillewiti was in Aush, the capital of Aush, the capital of Kizilukir Kiz, Xinjiang During the winter vacation at home, the authorities arrested her.

Radio Free Asia subsequently quoted a police officer of the State Insurance Bureau in an April report that Camille Wayi was detained. In addition to because of her posts on social media Communication by the elder brother in the United States.

In early June, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Economist Magazine that the authorities sentenced to Camille Wayi on March 25, but did not explain her sentence.

The arrest of Camille Wayti attracted international attention. The US government, rights protection, scholars, professors, and students asked the Chinese authorities to provide information about her case and released her.

The U.S. State Department spokesman said on June 9 in response to Radio Free Asia that he was worried about the continued detention of the Chinese People's Republic of China.

"We call on the People's Republic of China to ensure respect for her human rights and basic freedom, including all fair trial guarantees, and immediately unconditionally release all people who have been detained in unfairness."

MIT Human Stem Cell Laboratory, Director of Human Stem Cell Lab(Maya Mitalpova)Tell Radio Free Asia that she would defend it before Camillawiti was released.

"I won't remain silent, I will speak on behalf of Camilia until she was released. I will meet with US government officials at the State Council and put pressure on the Chinese government to demand the release of Camilei."

When Radio Free Asia contacted Kizilu Sukirkz Autonomous Prefecture's Office, a employee refused to provide information about Camille's sentence because the case involved national security.

"Even the family of Camille Wayi had no right to ask her case." And adding that the family must wait until they receive the final trial decision by the court.

The police of the National Security Bureau had previously told Radio Free Asia that for ordinary criminal cases, the family members of the charged criminals will receive a notice within 7 to 37 days. During this period, the Attorney General's Office will approve the arrest request.

The Public Security Bureau then reviewed the arrest warrant, which took two months. However, there are no such regulations on cases involving national security charges.

At the same time, the family of Camille Wayi expressed concern about her mental health, because her father has been brought to the "Re -Education" camp for two years in 2017, she has been making nightmares. She also suffered from eye diseases and should undergo surgery in Beijing this summer.

In addition, a Uyghur college student was sentenced to 13 years in prison for using a virtual network VPN.

A police officer involved in the arrest said that more than five years ago in Xinjiang, Uyghur college students who were arrested by the police bought Hemuti 敏(Mehmut memtimin)He has been serving for 13 years.

The computer science student was arrested in 2017 for trying to evade review and obtain "illegal information".

According to a police officer associated with Xinjiang University, the crime of buying and buying allergies is that he uses virtual special network VPN to bypass the official Internet sensor and check "illegal information". The police asked only to reveal that his name was Abul, he said, he said,

"The reason for the arrest of him was that he used a virtual network to pose a threat to national security," Alu Du external forces. "He was sentenced to 13 years in prison, and currently served the prison in Tumukuk Prison in Bachu County, Kashgar."

Buying and buying allergies is a computer science student at the Xinjiang University School of Information Technology in Urumqi.

When he was arrested, the authorities were detained the Uyepers and other Turk minorities in the "re -education" camp and the prison. The crime was suspected of extremism, such as the previous travel or abroad to contact religious activities. Many people were detained in Tumukhak Prison.

Many Chinese citizens use virtual special networks to evade review, but they are rarely arrested and punished for this.

According to independent researcher Jean Bonin(Again this)The information of the compilation was forcibly detained by the police in his hometown of Yecheng County in his hometown, which was about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) from Urumqi.

Benning has studied Uyghur in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for nearly five years. He has operated the Database of Xinjiang victims. The platform collects records of Uighurs and other Turkic minorities detained there.

His information is based on the Xinjiang police file data leaked and disclosed in 2022, indicating that shopping and allergies were arrested at noon on December 7, 2017.The joint statement issued shortly after the Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 14th, and announced that "the issue of Xinjiang -related issues is not a human rights issue at all, but anti -violent terrorism, exfoliating and anti -division."

The statement wrote and wrote, "Palestine resolutely opposes the interference in China's internal affairs by issuing Xinjiang."

The statement also announced that the Palestinian national power agencies support China on issues in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and acknowledge that the Xi Jinping government is "the only legal government representing the whole China."

Abbas is conducting a four -day visit to discuss the potential role of China in peacetime between Israel and the Palestinian in Israel and the Israeli occupation zone. Essence

Erken Ekin Ekin Ekin Ekin Erkin Ekrem, deputy professor of Hacetepe, Chinese Foreign Policy, said that although the Palestinians have reason to support Uighurs, standing with China is conducive to the national interests of the Palestinians.

He said that Palestinian national power agencies have become increasingly dependent on China, and Chinese funds, technology and support are needed on the international stage. Aike Rebu said,

"The Uyghur issue does not conform to the interests of Palestine. Therefore, the main concern here is Palestine's national interests." Ike hot wood also said,

"The benefits they have won from China exceed the benefits of supporting Uighurs. In this case, although Uyghur is Muslims, the Uyghur issue is not their priority."

Akba pointed out that the former Palestinian leaders, including Acyl Alafat, expressed support for China's Uighur policy.

As Abbas and Xi Jinping issued a joint statement, more and more evidence showed that as many as 1.8 million wum people and others were detained in the "re -education" camp, tortured, sexual abuse, and forced labor.

In a comprehensive report released in August 2022, the UN senior commissioner's office found that China's arbitrary detention of Xinjiang Uyghur and other ethnic minorities "may constitute international crimes, especially harmful human crimes."

However, experts said that some Muslims accounted for the majority of countries' policies in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, nor did they openly support these policies to avoid alienation or irritating Beijing.

Experts said that at the same time, China has been closer to the distance between the Arab countries and itself to fight against the influence of the United States in the Middle East.

GIORGIOCAFIERO, the CEO and founder of the Gulf State Analytics headquarters in Washington, told Radio Free Asia that Beijing had achieved a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. China is trying to show that it is a reliable partner to solve regional problems. Ciffiro said,

"If Chinese people can make some progress on this issue, then this will greatly convey a message to regional participants, that is, cooperate with Beijing when sensitive diplomatic things involved in the area instead of cooperating with Washington." Then, then

He said, "In the final analysis, China is very important for Abbas, which makes him say a lot of Uighurs do not like it."

(Voice of Germany) The German Federal House finally passed a new draft of the reform of immigration law on Friday (June 23) to encourage more people outside the EU to work in Germany.

The left -winged Socialist Party (SPD) Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Friday morning to introduce government plans to the parliament that "this draft law will ensure the prosperity of Germany." However, she added that [only when the bureaucratic obstacles were demolished during the execution process, the plan would play a role](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国官僚体制让外国医师难执业/a-52993197)Essence She said: "If you must fill in 17 different application forms to allow new nursing staff to enter Germany, this is unacceptable."

The biggest opposition party -conservative CDU and CSU Alliance welcomed some of the government's ideas, although they criticized the plan to reduce the threshold of foreign workers. Andrea Lindholz from the Case of the Capitalism said that the plan to reduce the necessary German level will only attract low -tech workers.

Lyocz also believes that the new law does not help solve the main problems she said: bottleneck bottlenecks, such as the processing procedures for foreign consulates are too long.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T14-27-00Z/66010605_401.jpg)The Minister of the Interior Ferser said that the New Law will help ensure the prosperity of Germany

Norbertkleinwächter, the German Options Party (AFD), a member of the extremely right -wing populism, fiercely refutes the draft law, arguing that the government's plan will turn Germany into a "garbage country". "The content of this draft of this 100 -page legal can be summarized in one sentence," he said, "That is: everyone can go in, but no one can be driven away."

Lamyakaddor, the Green Party, refuted the criticism of the German Options Party, saying that it would not be the most important prerequisite for German work. She ironically asked the right -wing people of the House of Representatives: "When you have to speak German at work, your integration effect is the best -you noticed?". She said: "For this country, finally and finally have a real good news. In competition with other successful immigrant countries such as the United States or Canada, we have made some key progress."

The Liberal Democratic Party (FDP), which represents the new liberalist part of the German Government Three Party Alliance, emphasized the economic benefits they believe in the new law. "The ridiculous is that now in Germany, it is easier to enter the refugee asylum system than entering the employment market." Liberal Democratic Party Council Konstantin Kuhle said, "We are reversing this situation through this law."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-24T14-27-00Z/17647870_401.jpg)In the field of medical care, Germany is quite dependent on foreign immigrants

### New "Opportunity Card"

A major innovation of the law is to launch the "opportunity card" and its related points systems, allowing foreigners who have not found a job to find jobs for one year to find job opportunities. The prerequisite for obtaining the card is to have vocational qualifications or university degrees.

These cards will be issued to those who meet certain conditions, and they will get points: it may be German/English language skills, existing connections with Germany, and potential partners or spouses in German workers. The opportunity card also allows to engage in temporary work per week during the finding work and trial period.

### The job opportunity for refugees and tourists

Those who are waiting for asylum approval and submitting the application before March 29, 2023 will also be allowed to join the labor market if they have appropriate qualifications and job opportunities, which will also allow them to receive vocational training.

For those holding a tourist visa, there are similar changes: before they meet the employment requirements, they do not need to leave Germany first.

### New "Green Card", do you want to apply?

### changes in degree recognition

For a long time, one of the main obstacles to immigration is to have a degree in Germany. But in the future, if technical immigrants can prove that they have at least two years of professional experience and a degree recognized by the original state, their degree will no longer need to be recognized in Germany. Those who have obtained job opportunities can come to Germany in the process of obtaining their degree and start work.

### Naturalization method will also be reformed

In Parliament debate, Martin Rosemann, a member of the Social Democratic Party, looked forward to the future: "High -quality young people around the world have not actively came to work in Germany." He said, "We must attract them, we must give them a prospect. Why will we also reform the citizenship law. "

The technical immigration law is part of the Schilderz government's measure for non -German to stay in Germany to relax.

The Associated Press reported that the agreement seemed to resolve a sharply upgraded crisis. This crisis was the most significant challenge faced by Putin for more than 20 years.

In 2019, they fled collectively. After more than three years, I moved to Jeju Island, South Korea, Thailand, and finally arrived at Dallas Airport in Texas, Texas, the Jesus, the Jesus of Christianity. The courage and will to pursue religious freedom are admirable, and the process of collecting collective escape is unpredictable. So what kind of suffering did they experience? Have you encountered danger of life? Can you get rid of the shadow of the Chinese government after leaving China? In the end, what key characters and key events behind it?

In the previous program, we told the members of the May Flower Church in Thailand and were reported by insiders who were rejected by Chinese national security personnel. As a result, the temporary residence in the suburbs of Pattaya, Thailand was leaked. The thrilling journey; and from the process of transferring from Jeju Island to Thailand, a newborn baby could not get a passport, delayed in Jeju Island, and could not go to Thailand. In addition, we also introduced the members of the May Flower Church to settle in the farm in order to settle in Jeju Island to maintain their livelihood. And why they decided to escape collectively.

In this program, members of the May Flower Church came to the main organization and participants of the rescue activities, the US folk religious rights organization, and the founder of Fu Xiqiu, the founder of the China Aid Association, introduced the second part of the story behind the success of rescue activities. Fu Xiuqiu introduced in detail the American brothers and sisters, willing to be a Christian ambassador, relay to accompany the congregation, watch and help, express love, and express their willingness to attend the same life and death. One of the Christian ambassadors who participated in the relay, Ms. Dina Brown was 68 years old. Members of the May Flower Church intimately called her "Grandma Brown", and Ms. Brown herself also laughed that she was the most grandmother in Taylor's grandchildren. According to Fu Xiuqiu, Ms. Brown also went to the Dubai camp to rescue the Chinese government's cross -border threat. Wu Huan, a fiancee of Wang Jingyu, who was kidnapped in Dubai, found Wu Huan on the streets of Dubai under the night of the night. After that, Ukraine rescued Wu Huanying to Western European countries. Ms. Dina Brown introduced in the show how to take the persecuted persecutor. She said that she and her family had lived in Elitria for nearly ten years, where she taught English, preach the gospel, and help the locals. Later, Eritrea's religious freedom space was severely suppressed, and their family had to leave to return to the United States. After returning to the United States, Dina Brown could not forget the pain of those who suffered, and decided to set up a non -profit organization to "seek freedom international" to help the victims escape and provide them with reorganization arrangements.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-24T18-43-00-04-00/000000.png)A local buyer is weighed Cordyceps sinensis. It is a traditional Tibetan medicine and is now very popular in China and around the world. [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-24T18-43-00-04-00/000001.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06242023183630.html/@@images/image)Reuters picture [Audio-LLINK: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06242023183630.html/@stream]](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06242023183630.html/@@stream)Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, Tibet sends out to invite you to look at Tibet with me. With the growth of climate and demand, the reduction of Cordyceps sinensis put pressure on Tibetan herders. This fungal sales, also known as "Himalayan Viagra" have declined due to reduced production. In addition, the Chinese government requires that Tibetan students can only use Chinese to participate in the college entrance examination. Critics say that the move is designed to eliminate Tibetan culture and make the region Chinese, and the number of Tibetan students who cannot go to college and receive higher education will increase amazingly. In addition, the Chinese government spent money to invite Tibetans to accept the blessings of the Panchen Lama supported by Beijing. In this episode, we will understand these situations together.

Cordyceps sinensis produced in the Tibet Plateau can be sold for $ 18,000 per pound. In a few cases, it can be sold to more than $ 50,000 per pound.

Despite the lack of scientific evidence, for centuries, it has been a traditional drug for the treatment of heart, liver and lung diseases, high cholesterol, low sexual desire and impotence. This parasitic fungus Chinese is called Cordyceps sinensis. It has the alias of "Himalayan Viagra", and the scientific name is OphiocordycePSSISISis.

However, in the harvest season in May this year, it is difficult for pickers to find slender brown root fungi.

Tibetan herdsmen who collect fungi to increase the meager income blame this on the shortage of rainwater, climate change, and increased demand. A Tibetan who lives in Derge County, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture told Liberty Radio,

"The output has declined year by year. Previously, the picker could collect at least 100 cordyceps sinensis, but now it can pick up 40 plants a day. Some people even say that they can only pick 10 plants a day."

A study published in the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018 stated that the decrease in the number of Cordyceps in the Himalayas was caused by climate change and excessive picking.

Its value has soared during the new crown virus epidemic, because people seek this fungal to treat viruses. The Tibetans in Derge County said that as the Han people, Mongolians and others tried to engage in and sell this fungal business, the price also rose. He said, he said,

"Due to limited production, everyone is difficult to survive now."

A Tibetan living in the Tibetan Zhenju area of Sichuan Province said that now, the low-quality Cordyceps is priced at about 30 yuan (4.25 US dollars) per plant, and the better quality of Cordyceps is priced at 50-60 yuan per plant ( $ 7-8.50).

According to a report from the "Scroll" of Indian digital news publications in July 2022, the market price that highly respected fungi in China rose from $ 6,000 per pound from 1995 to 2015 to $ 9,000. Today, the price ranges from $ 9,000 per pound to $ 18,000.

According to Business Insider and the National Public Broadcasting Station, in a few cases, the highest -level Cordyceps sells for more than $ 50,000.

A Tibetan in Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, a Tibetan Tibetan Tibetan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said that this year, many collectors transported Cordyceps to different cities in China and sold it at a price of 50-60 yuan.

This is a parasitic fungus, formed by the head of the moth larva, and was found in the plateau soil of 3,500 meters (10,500 feet) in Tibet, some parts of China, and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal Himalayas.

This fungus can be eaten directly, added to food or liquid, or grinded for traditional drugs.

A Tibetan resident in Qinghai Province living in Tibet said, "Before 2016, it could be harvested from 15 to 20 winter worms in a day, and it is difficult to pick it up from 8 to 10 plants now."

Like other sources, the Tibetans who refused to disclose the name in order to speak freely also said that although other Tibetans said that the product's market in China continued to grow, the Chinese government warned the Tibetans of Qinghai not to pick Cordyceps with environmental protection and other reasons. The Tibetan said,

"Due to snow and cold weather, it is still difficult to harvest Cordyceps sinensis in high altitude areas. Therefore, the cost of these Cordyceps sinensis is likely to rise and harvest to reach the peak at the end of May."

According to the Chinese government's records, only 100 tons of Cordyceps produced in Qinghai Province alone, with sales of 180 million to 200 million yuan.

In the spring of previous years, the herdsmen found rich Cordyceps sinensis on the mountains in the main producing area. Many herders can pick up enough Cordyceps in a month.

But now it turns out that this has become more difficult.

Another Tibetan in Litang County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture said that about 70%of his villages had picked Cordyceps sinensis a few years ago. But now, only about half of the collection of intensive picking.

According to a Tibetan businessman living in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region, high demand has also promoted the production of fake Cordyceps in the Chinese market.

In addition, Tibetan residents told Radio Free Asia that Tibetan students who have recently participated in the Chinese college entrance examination must be fully used in Chinese, which may make many people in an unfavorable position.

The examination will be held from all over China from June 7th to 9th, which will greatly help decide the fate of more than 13 million students.

In previous years, ethnic minorities, including Tibetans, were allowed to take their mother tongue to take the exam, but this year is the first time in Chinese testing in Chinese. In addition, ethnic minorities no longer get an extra five minutes as in the past to complete the test.

The test policy in Chinese alone occurs at the same time as other controversial educational policies. These policies aims to use Chinese as a teaching language of Tibetan schools -Tibetan activists say that this is part of Beijing's elimination of Tibetan culture and the Chinese plan in the region. A Tibetan Tibetan who required anonymous for safety reasons told Liberty Radio Tibetan Tibetan group,

"In 2022, the Chinese government implemented a model second education system. Under the system, all primary and secondary schools in Guoluo, Ganzi and Qinghai used Chinese as the main teaching language. Since this year, the Chinese government has used Mandarin as a media language for the college entrance examination. "

Opponents of the Second Education System believe that the policy will destroy Tibetan language and culture without legal basis. This Tibetan also said,Another resident who is unwilling to disclose the name tells Liberty Radio to cancel the extra time of ethnic minorities students. He said, he said,

"They can get extra time for 5 minutes in the past, but now with reform, these extra time have been canceled." Another resident also said, "These reforms make it almost impossible for Tibetan students to get good grades to enter the university, and without proper degrees, it is impossible to find a decent job."

The Tibetan also said that this trend is dangerous for the entire Tibetan community. He pointed out that

"We will see that the number of Tibetan students who cannot go to college and receive higher education has increased amazingly."

China's educational reform is contradictory with its national regional autonomous law. Researcher "Tibet Observation" in London's advocacy and supervision organization "Tibetan Observation"(Pema Gayal)explain,

"The law stipulates that if possible, ethnic minority schools should use textbooks printed in their own language, and should teach courses in these languages, which contradicts what the government is currently doing. Therefore, many Tibetan students cannot receive higher education. "

In addition, the Chinese government spent money to invite Tibetans to accept the blessing of Banchen Lama supported by Beijing. Jun Zannobu was appointed by Beijing after detaining the Panchen Lama selected by the Dalai Lama.

Tibetan residents told Radio Free Asia that the Chinese government paid 100 yuan (about 14 US dollars) to Tibetans, allowing them to participate in visiting and accepting Beijing as the second important spiritual leader of the Tibetan Buddhism second only to the Dalai Lama. blessing of.

Junzan Nobu is a Panchen Lama supported by China, and he is touring blessings in some Tibetan areas in the area -but many Tibetans think he is a counterfeit.

Tibetan Buddhism believes that the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama reincarnate after their death. After China's invasion and annexation in Tibet in 1950-51, the Beijing authorities worked hard to influence Tibetan affairs, including choosing a spiritual heir for the tenth Panchen Lama in 1989.

In 1995, the Dalai Lama, who was exiled, chose to be 6 -year -old. Guinima was indeed Guilinima.

The Panchen Lama's duties include the senior Lama Conference to find the reincarnation spiritual child of the Dalai Lama after the current Dalai Lama's silence.

In 1995, the 14th Dalai Lama acknowledged that the Eleventh Panchen Lama candidate angered the Chinese authorities. Three days later, the Chinese authorities detained the boy and his family. They have disappeared since then.

Beijing subsequently appointed another boy and praised Nuobu as their own candidate replacement.

The Panchen Lama appointed in Beijing is still not welcomed by Tibetans of Exiles and Tibetans in China because he is regarded as a person who is imposed to them in Beijing.

A Tibetan resident told Liberty Radio Tibetan group that Beijing was providing small money rewards for those who received blessings.

The resident said, "The Chinese government told the local Tibetans that anyone who participated and accepted Janzan Nobu's blessing will receive a reward of 100 yuan. The activities of the pond are arranged very grand and popular. "

The resident also said that Ganzano recently completed visiting the Shangri -La, Litang, BATANG, Mangkang, and Dhapa County. He also visited Katana Songzanlin Temple and Litang Temple.

Namrata Hasija, a researcher at the China Analysis and Strategy Center in New Delhi, said that the leaders of the Communist Party of China are using Janzan Nobu to promote their political agenda. she says,

"The Chinese government forced Tibetans to accept Judano Bob's efforts and attempts, because the Tibetans do not treat him as the Panchen Lama."

After ChatGPT was hot, a paragraph was widely circulated on the Internet: the artificial intelligence we used to imagine in the past is that humans write poetry, painting, painting and music, and AI to furnish brick to repair computers. Music, we have a brick to repair the computer by ourselves.

Although this paragraph has exaggerated ingredients, it can resonate with everyone in the spread, and it also shows that the scenes described in line with our current concerns, is it that artificial intelligence will eliminate more human positions?

This is an old topic discussed when artificial intelligence was born. If the degree of development of artificial intelligence in the past has made this problem most time -to -talk and predict, the emergence of generatory AI has made this issue a practical significance.

The academic and industry circles are naturally aware of how concerned the public is about. At the 2023 Annual Conference of Alibaba Luohantang, the opportunities and challenges brought by artificial intelligence have become the theme of the dialogue between Alibaba Group and the chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group and Alibaba Cloud Smart Group. At the subsequent scholars' speeches and media meetings, all academic circles and industry insiders expressed their opinions on this.

In terms of quantity alone, the rise of the generation AI will affect how many people work, and even how many people have unemployed. There is no particularly accurate estimate of economists, but a study at the end of March gives a research given by Goldman Sachs given. A approximate number: 300 million, that is, the generation AI will affect 300 million jobs in major economies.

This huge number naturally caused a discussion on the Internet. However, the industry generally believes that the "influence" here does not mean that the work is completely disappeared, and it refers to the reconstruction of the labor market. And the influence and reconstruction of the generation AI on the labor market, the participating scholars gave their own analysis.

In terms of influence on the labor market, the 2011 Nobel Prize winner of the Economics Achievement THOMASSARGENT is quite optimistic. He believes that the flow of jobs is two -way, old posts are disappearing, new positions are in the post, and new positions are in the post. produce. After the resource and manual re -matching, it will be found that the disappearance of the old work and the emergence of new jobs are a dynamic process, and this is the same.

Zhang Yong also held a similar point of view. It believes that the upgrading of technology will allow humans to see the emergence of more new formats and new industries. In the future, new industries and positions will continue to appear.

Although the academic and industry is not very pessimistic about the direction of this issue, the reconstruction of the labor market brought by technology will at least bring pain to specific industries and specific people within a period of time. Erikbrynjolfsson, director of the Institute of Digital Economics of Stanford University, explained a more specific explanation. In his research, it was found that the impact of the entire machine learning on all groups was actually not balanced. It mainly affects workers with low wages. High -paying people are less affected by artificial intelligence and machine learning. However, the development of generation AI and other generation AI has changed the situation. When this is a research label, the higher the salary will be affected.

This is also reflected in the report of Goldman Sachs. The impact of the generation AI on the labor market is different. It may create a new unemployed white -collar class. They may encounter similar to manufacturing workers in the 1980s of the 1980s. destiny.

In this regard, Eric Maskin, the Nobel Prize winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007, made a proportional division of this. 1%of the pyramid spikes will definitely benefit from the rapid development of technology, and 1%at the bottom 1% It will definitely be offered to the greatest impact, and 20%of the people at both ends may be affected to varying degrees. Pyramid -tip groups such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk will naturally benefit from the improvement of technology. But for some types of work without skills, if there is no skill re -training and learning, they may be useless in the future.

In addition to the impact of generating AI on the labor market, there are other more urgent concerns of academic and industry, that is, the threat of its rapid iteration on human society, more and more artificial intelligence experts The rapid launch of the model sounded the alarm. A few months ago, published by the Life Future Research Institute (FLI), a public letter signed by many scholars, CEOs and technical experts, called on all institutions around the world to suspend training at least six months than GPT-4, and use these six The AI safety agreement is formulated in a month.

Maskin also perceives the threat of human society in terms of analysis and processing information of artificial intelligence, and gives a slightly exaggerated example: "If AI shut down the Federal Reserve, it will not let him use a computer. Therefore, he believes that artificial intelligence may require more supervision, such as allowing computers to obtain data in certain fields, instead of saying that it can be used to obtain the desired data without constraints.

Even with such a threat, the 2010 Nobel Prize winner, ChristopherPissarides, still believes that slowing down artificial intelligence technology will be a big mistake. What everyone should do is not how to slow down this process, but to ensure how to use its rapid development to form a good application to nurture the development of society.

Compared with the academic community, the industry's attention to regulatory issues is more specific. For example, a major challenge brought by Zhang Yong believes that the rapid development of artificial intelligence is the problem of intellectual property rights. "Now the machine may really be stronger and stronger. But don't forget, what exactly do they come from all such original knowledge and original data? How can we respect the ownership of such information? "

From the past experience, the development of technology and the change of business models will bring corresponding regulatory problems. While ensuring the rapid development of technology, it can also make reasonable supervision and suppress the negative impact of technology on society. This will be a problem that all mankind should think in the next decades.

Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

In the evening, the plane landed at the southern coastal city of the Republic of Cyprus, Lamana, and received two text messages from two mobile phone operators within a few minutes: the first "Welcome to Cyprus!", "Welcome to Turkey!" I was a little surprised, so I sent a message to a friend in Greek Cyprus in London. I didn't know that she was not very happy when she saw it. After all, it was tens of kilometers away from the "North Cyprus Turkish Republic", that is, the area occupied by Turkey. I remembered that I also received a text message "Welcome to Spain" on the northern seaside of Morocco. Presumably, the mobile phone signal covered the scope overlap, and there should be no maliciousness.

In the 1990s, he had a concept of Cyprus because he read the Tang Shi Zeng's "I Return from the Battlefield". Although La Naka flashed as a transit station between the author to and from the Arab country as the author in the book. The name of the chapter of "Back to La Na" was deeply imprinted in my mind. After coming to the UK, there were students who transferred from Cyprus to school, and found that a school girl was found in the past few years. She has followed the British officer's husband in Cyprus for several years. In short, I have never felt how far this country is, but in fact, it is located at the edge of the eastern part of the Mediterranean, and it is closer to the Middle East. It has been ruled by strong surrounding forces, including Egypt, in history.

Living in the Graffiti Art Theme Hotel in the central center of Lana, the next day, I found that it just looked at each other across the square across the square. Sainlazaros, the Church of San Lazaru, is the Holy Land of Orthodox Church and the most important attraction for Lana. Lana's medieval military fortress is not large, just by the sea. Lanaka was Kition KITION City State in ancient Greece. Nuo Da's excavation site was charged by me alone. The archaeological museum displays cultural relics unearthed here. After all, Cyprus was ruled by the Ptolemy dynasty in ancient Egypt, and was presented to Egypt by Caesar as a gift.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-24T22-57-51-00-00/000185392_piclink.jpg)La Nata Saint Lasha Church is the Holy Land of Orthodox (Photography: Zichuan)

There is only the "North Cyprus Turkish Republic" recognized by Turkey in the world. It can participate in a day trip from Lanca. The itinerary includes the ancient castle, monastery in the northern coastal Kailinia, and the "ghost city" in the southeast. In 1974, Turkey occupied 40%of the territory in northern Cyprus Island, and the residents of Famagusta Famagusta, a "ghost city" in the southeast, were forced to flee to the south. My Greek friend in Cyprus, her parents are all local residents. Their houses are currently deserted in the "ghost city" and one occupied by Turkish immigrants. Her parents had been living in the southwestern part of Cyprus Island after escaping this area. Although there was still a landy deed in their hands, she could not recover the property so far, and she could not ask for any statement. It is really shocking to pass by the "Ghost City" blockbuster. It is similar to the feelings that the "Ghost Town" Pritia season of Cherland, Ukraine Chel Nellabees. It is a bit regrettable that the "Ghost City" has long been in danger, and it is not allowed to enter. It can only be seen when passing by.

Cyprus is not only an island that is divided by two regimes, but its capital Nicotia is also the only capital in the world today. This historical city can be seen everywhere. In the south, the Nicotician City Hall is built next to the archeological site; the lifelong affairs of the Ottoman Turkish Empire's rule, the arbiter between the Sudan and the people in jurisdiction (Dragoman), Hadjigeorgakiskornesios also seems to be telling visitors. Modern Cyprus was once a British colony, and there is a monument to commemorate the British colonial rule in the city of Nicotesia.

The city of Nicoxia is not large. I live in the city center. I walked hundreds of meters to the LEDRASTREET for several hundred meters. The north and south were the buffer stationed by the British army. A British soldier on the whistle card found out, and I immediately shrink back when I saw that I took a picture. Ten tens of meters east are the inspection station. After two minutes, the team is rowed, handed over the passport, and was scanned after being scanned. There is no need to stamp. After coming out of the southern inspection window, I walked through the whole buffer and came to the North Sea Inspection Station. The male inspection staff strictly asked me to take off my sunglasses before scanning the passport and letting me go. Two days ago, when I took a tourist car with a tourist car, the tour guide told everyone not to take a picture. I saw the ban on the prohibited photo after the railing of the buffer area in the center of Nicoxia, but I have been taking pictures before. People stop. During the entire "entry and exit" process, no other Chinese faces were seen.

In the brilliant sunshine in the morning, I walked into the "North Cyprus Turkish Republic" and found that it was obviously dilapidated and dirty than the south. Public transportation seemed to have only small vans. There are station/caravan hotels built in the Middle Ages. The former St. Nicholas Church is now a cultural center. I watched an exhibition with only Turkish descriptions. The majestic Turkish father, Kelly, is next to the old city of Kerrynia. There are Turkish martyrs monuments nearby, and the important event of the National Father Square stands at the stone pillar of the Republic of Venice.

Entering the area controlled by Turkey, there are more cats. It can be seen everywhere. From time to time, cats are coming from the caravan hotel, and a black cat who has been chasing me and still calls on the road. After a few hours of walking in Beisai, the sky was getting darker and darker. With the thunder, there was a heavy rain. If he didn't want to leave, he returned to the Ledila Street Inspection Station and returned to the south.

It is understood that in 1974, Turkey occupied northern Cyprus Island. After the establishment of the "North Cyprus Republic", Turkish immigrants were continuously entered here, which caused differences between the local Turkish and new immigrants at the Supu Luther in many levels. At present, there is only a distinguished territorial dispute in Cyprus in the European Union. Although at least tourists who have been strictly controlled for many years can have at least traveled from the south, but in recent years, the influence of Turkey has continued to expand under the leadership of strong man Erdogan. When can the solutions that can be satisfactory to all parties for the North -South disputes are still far away.

In just 5 days of schedule, there are basically no other Chinese tourists, but there are some immigrants who have obviously come from Southeast Asia to operate small restaurants, coffee shops and other business.

The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH in English), located in New York City, has long been known for its scientific exploration, research and education. The 2006 movie "Museum Wonderful Night" made the Natural History Museum reputation. The film describes a nighttime guard played by Ben Steler found that the museum's exhibits will suddenly live after the night, and become a crawling of reptiles. The wonderful universe coexisted with the Egyptian Pharaoh.

In addition to high box office income, the film also attracted countless curious visitors for the museum. I also visited the Museum of Natural History based on the curiosity of the movie. What surprised me the most was that the museum itself far beyond the image of Hollywood movies. The specimen is not an animal that died hard, but the protagonist of the living story.

** Gilder Center **

The Natural History Museum was established in 1869. Since 154, the museum has scattered in 10 buildings of different sizes from simple and simple units to dozens of exhibition halls today. The scope from archeological fossils to astronomical geography, from human learning to insect research. In addition to exhibitions and scientific research, the museum also provides two degrees: PhD in Biology and Master of Earth Science Teaching through the Richard Gilded Institute.

Due to the huge and complexity of the building, there are many unreasonable dead ends, often they must go back after walking to the end, exhausted. The museum announced in 2014 that a building was added. In addition to adding a new entrance to the west side of the museum, it opened many dead ends that made people walk to the legs. This is the "Richard Gilde Science, Education and Innovation Center" opened in May this year(Richard Gilder Center For Science, Education,And Innovation)Essence Di Kate, chairman of the museum who just took office for a long time(Sean M.Decatur)It is announced that "interdisciplinary disciplines can be in -depth combination of exhibitions, research projects and educational activities of museums, so that visitors can understand how all the lives on the planet are closely related."

Gilded Center by Gangni(Jeanne Gang)The design of Studiogang, the leader, covers an area of 230,000 square feet and costs 465 million US dollars. Gang Zhenni explained that the design was inspired by the natural landscape made of wind and rain, but I think it is more like the cartoon "Modern Primitive"(The Flintstones)s home. However, the Gilder Center is not primitive at all, and it is full of cutting -edge scientific research under the appearance of imitating natural landscapes.

** Scientific evidence transparency **

Di Kate, who was born in a scientist, emphasized that in addition to exhibiting scientific specimens, the museum's task must also provide a research process to make conclusions and evidence transparent. For example, the museum samples ancient fossils and specimens for molecular samples. Through advanced genetic analysis or computer tomography, the diversity of creatures is deepened, and the commonality between creatures and creatures is discussed.

Dikate also takes 18 newly built, renovated or re -used classrooms as an example. These classrooms provide analysis and processing facilities for large data sets for high schools and college students. These datasets are either from the museum's own scientific research or partners from museums such as NASA. In addition to teaching students how to make data into different visual effects, they also show the importance of data sources and how to affect the world of our lives.

The Museum of Natural History attaches great importance to the people's trust in science. Fu Te, Honorary Chairman of the Museum(Ellen Futter)It is believed that although virtual display has a certain potential and impact, it will never be better than the power of reality. "Artificial intelligence can be a constructive tool, not a scary tool. Virtual and true integration can improve the experience of visitors, but the real attraction is still stronger than everything."

** Real power **

When it comes to "real things", the most popular and iconic of the Natural History Museum is the lifelike DIORAMA display cabinet. DIORAMA is Greek "see through". The museum places animal specimens in a carefully built display cabinet with realistic landscapes, plants and lights, allowing visitors to feel the scenes of animals in natural habitats. DIORAMA of the Natural History Museum has a history of hundreds of years. They are often known as "the first virtual reality" because they evoke the relationship between specimens and nature in a way of immersion, and deepen the visitors' experience and understanding of the ecosystem.

The Museum's DIORAMA provides "the first virtual reality" with animal specimens, and the new Gild Center has a butterflies flying everywhere. The living ants come to present "real reality". There is an exhibition area in the insect hall on the first floor of the Gilder Center. Visitors can see how hard -haired leaf cutting foraging and how to collect leaf fragments. There is also a transparent flyover in the exhibition area. The leaves cut the leaves and brought the leaves of the leaves across the other end of the bridge to cultivate the leaves into a special fungi as a food. Visitors can observe how the ants diligently carry the leaves fragments of the leaves, how to coordinate each other, understand the social structure of the cut leaf ants, and their key role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. Essence

Diorama and leaf -cut ants not only attract visitors, stimulate their imagination, but also precious tools for scientific research and education. In addition to telling the story of collections, it can also contribute to science or broader issues. Di Kate believes that the Insect Pavilion has seized the interests and curiosity of all ages, "educating us to obtain more information about biodiversity loss from studying insects, and the connection of these losses with climate change." He It is hoped that the museum can become an action appeal to drive their attention and actions of biodiversity and climate change from stimulating the curiosity and surprise of visitors.

Fu Te said, "The Museum of Nature History is about the past and present, and it is also a prediction of the future." It is for this way. In connection, they understand why these extreme phenomena occur, protecting our planet by telling a comprehensive story, and taking action for the future.

"When Zixia returned to Qufu, the forum had already begun. Only two soldiers came to the gate of the city, and there were no one on the street. All the shops were closed and the door was blocked with wooden boards. The carriages and trailers of the vassal states are everywhere in horsesuria and donkey dung ... "This is the novel" 醢 "in Yan Ge's English short story" Elsewhere "(Two)The beginning. Zixia is the protagonist of this novel. The characters in the story include Zigong, Zilu and Ran Yong. Yan Ge is empty, telling English readers a story that happened in ancient China. Yan Ge began to write English writing in 2016. She grinded a sword in 7 years. On June 1, 2023, her first English work set was published by the British Faber Press.

Throughout June, Yan Ge horses non -stop, participating in a new book meeting, exchange meeting in the United Kingdom, and sharing her new work with readers. Her second stop is Edinburgh's Topping & Companybook Sellers bookstore. Yan Ge currently lives in Norvich, a "Literature City" in England. From Novic to Edinburgh, you need to take a train for more than 6 hours. Yan Ge took the train and checked in the hotel, and accepted my interview, and her meeting would immediately interview. She has already been used to this kind of life that can cope with any place.

The British RCW Literature Broker on its website page introduced its author Yan Ge: "Yan Ge was born in Sichuan, China in 1984. She is a novelist who wrote in Chinese and English at the same time. When she was 17 years old, she was 17. The first short story collection is published in China. She is the author of 13 books, including 6 novels. She has won many awards, including the famous Mao Dun Literature Newcomer Award. ... she lives with her husband and son in Novic. "

Yan Ge told me that a few years ago, if anyone asked her if she would write in English, she would resolutely answer "No" because she thought that only Chinese was her literary language. Later, when she started living in the United States, Ireland and Britain, she found that she lived in a thorough "English environment". One day, she was inspired and wanted to write a story that happened in Dublin, but in her mind, the characters, dialogues, and plots of the story were all English. She felt that she was circled and could not start. In the end, she decided to write this story in English.

I asked Yan Ge's challenge in English. She said it was a kind of guilt, "Why don't I write in Chinese and write in English? English readers are not higher than the first year of Chinese readers, English is not better than Chinese ... My language , My motherland and my Chinese are the center of my world. Why should I leave them and come here and knock on the door of the English literature creation circle? This makes me feel uneasy and guilty. "In fact, Yan Yan The song did not give up her Chinese writing. Not long ago, she had just completed a long Chinese novel.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-24T23-03-11-00-00/000184945_piclink.jpg)Yan Ge (the photo is provided by the respondent)

Yan Ge's "knocking on theft" is also the result of her academic water. The nine novels in "Other places", except for the last article, the rest comes from her master's degree. In 2018, Yan Ge started learning creative writing at the University of East Ingelia University. This university is also the first university in Britain to open a creative writing major. The Nobel Prize winner of Literature Shihei Yixiong was studying here in 1980. At that time, the graduation work of Shihei Yixiong also became his debut.

Yan Ge explained that her graduation work was almost 60,000 or 70,000 words, and then she spent nearly a year to create a novel "醢". She introduced: "The last story in the book is also the longest story, not the content of my graduation work. In order to write that story, I have learned about the relevant ancient texts. I need to spend a lot of effort to make the world I imagine. It is understood by English readers. For example, they may have never heard of the Warring States Period. At that time, China was not uniform, and there were many vassal states, which was very different from modern China. For many English readers, it occurred in the Warring States Period. The story is like a science fiction novel. I need to make some explanations in the text, but I don't want to give too much explanation, because that will destroy the story itself. I try to find a suitable foothold. Take a step forward. "

I found on the Amazon website that this story has also become the favorite story of reader Podpolny. He commented: "In this novel, my favorite is" 醢 ". It tells the story of a Confucian disciple's story (During the Confucius era and later). He came from a very poor family and worked hard to adapt to the fierce high -level political and power struggle. The orgasm is very exciting, and although the turning point of the story can be predicted very early, it is still exciting. For this story, the whole book is worth reading. "

Open the directory page of "Other places", and I ask what the creative process of Yan Ge's novels is most impressed by her? She pointed to "Turning in Summer"(When Travelling in the Summer)Essence In front of my eyes, the first page of ancient text was mentioned, and the words "Shen Kuo" and "1095" were mentioned in the text. I guess this is another story that happened in ancient China. Yan Ge told me that this page of ancient texts is a page of Shen Kuo's "Forget Huai Lu", which records what you need to bring during summer travel. This page of ancient texts from Canadian writer Madeleinethien. "Madeleine is the editor of" Brick "magazine. This is a project of their magazine. I hope I translate this page of ancient texts into English. Then, they invite people to translate it into other languages based on my English translation. Some friends who know ancient texts help me understand the meaning of this text. I am more and more interested in this page of ancient texts. I want to write a story and turn these unrelated, random items mentioned in the text into the story in the story. Important, critical items, and they appear at least once in the story, learn from the writing method of the French Surrealism ... This is also an inspiration for my creation of this novel. "Yan Ge recalled," Travel in summer The writing of "Time" naturally happened, just like flowing water, she did not have any planning.The name of "Switch elsewhere" to this novel is also an accidental idea of Yan Ge. "The contents of these 9 stories are very different. Their style, theme, and stories are different ... When I send the first draft to the agent, I can’t find a suitable vocabulary that can summarize these 9 stories. I am I started thinking about more than 30 books, and the agent was dissatisfied. Later, I said casually, how about "elsewhere)? I didn't expect the agent to agree. The name is appropriate, because for readers in English, the story that happened in the novel set in China is a story elsewhere. For the protagonist in the story, the story in the book occurs in Ireland, Britain or the United States, although it is the European center "Here" is their elsewhere. This has formed a duality. This 'in other places', in addition to geographical, is also a mental state. For example, for those who move to others, their hometown will always be elsewhere. When I took this name at that time, I didn't think so much. "

When I asked Yan Ge's inspiring writers, she took the new work "Stockholm" and "Free Water"(FreeWandering)Take an example. "The form of" Stockholm "is like‘ Autofiction ’, which is a bit similar to Rachel Cusk, or Maggie Nelson (Maggie Nelson)Work style. In "Freedom", the protagonist came to a new city, but he was actually dead ... Shi Zi Yixiong's "Unshayous" affected me to write this novel. "

Yan Ge said that there are many writers who have influenced her, but she said that she prefers "theory." She likes French philosophers, such as Michelle Foucault, Paul Lico, and also likes British philosopher British philosopher born in Austria. She said that compared with literary works, the theory had the deepest impact on her. She said: "These theories are what I am good at, and it is these theories that have prompted me to keep exploring." But what made Yan Ge feel a little bit regrettable that she loved the theory and read the doctoral PhD in literature, but after a while, she had a period of time, but after a while, she had a period of time. After time, she realized: "I don't have enough time and energy. I cannot become scholars and writers at the same time. It is impossible to do two things well at the same time." She finally gave up her doctoral studies and chose to focus on creation. Now, she has completely relieved: "I have always liked theory, and I have accepted this reality now. I am just a fan of theory."

Speaking of the consistent creative style, Yan Ge said that he would maintain some emotional link with the novels he wrote, but also maintain a sense of alienation with these novels. This is the same. "You have to alienate yourself from the work. When I create these imagined worlds, I need a solid foundation. This foundation is the emotional link of these stories. Therefore, these stories will be very personal. Some even contain autobiography. But because of this situation, I have to alien myself from these stories, because I am not writing a diary. The biggest danger of autobiography is that it is easy to move myself. Your you. People who like apples like pear also like Apple, and feel "this apple is delicious". What you have to persuade is not yourself, but a stranger. Obviously, this stranger has no emotional accumulation as you. Therefore, The more you want to write a personalized story, the more you want to alien yourself. "

Despite the beginning of English, Yan Ge believes that his works are not necessarily written for British and American white readers. She explained: "English is the current world language, and I am an English writer of a colorful race, so many people are my ideal readers. I think if I pursue white readers to read my novels, or deliberately deliberately It is very problematic to attract white readers. "In short, no matter what skin tone readers, and what country from the readers, Yan Ge hopes to establish contact with them through their English works. "In the past, Chinese writers were more like 'lines'. They told the first -hand and fresh stories about their kingdom. Now the literary works of Asian writers are more diverse." Other places "is not me, I am not here. It tells the story that happened in China, but as a new literary attempt for a writer and a mature writer. I hope I can establish a contact with the people around me through my works. "

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-24T23-03-11-00-00/000184946_piclink.png)Similar reflection of Yan Ge is also reflected elsewhere. Because her husband is an Irish, Yan Ge himself also lives in Ireland. In a literary activity, when someone asked her to how much she was Irish writer, Yan Ge replied: "Obviously, I am Chinese, I am Chinese, I am Chinese, I am Chinese. If I have commonality with Ireland writers, it should be our joint spirit of rebellion in English. Ireland literary works often subvert the literary tradition of British, including the use of English language, which also presents this, such as Ireland, such as Ireland The writer created 'Irish English' (Hiberno -nglish), I also have such a rebellious spirit. "

I noticed that the cover of "Others" is a bright orange flower. Speaking of this cover, Yan Ge was a little emotional: "When they show me the design draft of the book seal, I was deeply moved. The designer hopes that the elements related to my hometown in the book seal are selected. The city flower hibiscus flower in Chengdu is completely their idea ... and my mother's name has 'Rong'. This is an accident, and it seems to be destined. "I opened the title page of the book," Tomy Mother, Yang Shirong ".

This year's Shanghai summer is Liu Xiangcheng Photography Exhibition, who belongs to the Pudong Art Museum, and lives in a middle -aged man who used to be a very precious living habit because of photography. Touched by the works. Because Liu Xiangcheng told a story about the image of China and the progress of this country with his efforts and cameras for most of his life. Let him feel the projection of the image of this society.

When photographers made a spiritual revolution in painting, the artists began to express their inner life in an abstract, non -material way, as if musicians did not rely on the meaning of material world significance, and the art of artists began to be even more artistic. Hold the muse in his heart according to your own thoughts. When Vasili Cuming Sky proposed the painting theory of painting from the traditional material reality in 1911, the art of photography also began its own rapid progress. For more ordinary people, today I will see a portrait portrait of the character of Yuxuan from the Republic of China, which is more durable than the shock that Meitu Xiuxiu installed in each mobile phone user today, although today’s mobile phone program In the later period, the portrait in the screen can be modified more red and white, and uses an unreal full full full screen to soothe many us who need to lose weight in this era.

In Yang Fudong's series of gaze in Shanghai's local culture, his black and white photography "International Hotel" smiled at the time when the female player touched the water from the swimming competition. Those four willow leaves bend their eyebrows, their lips, and girls with wavy curly hair are sitting by the artistic decoration pool in the international hotel, filled with the youthful atmosphere, and reproduce the collision of Shanghai Chinese and Western cultural collisions in the 1930s. The woman in the advertising pictorial who led the trend of the same fashion. Those elements that are refined and touched by creators, showing the beauty of women's youthful youth. Whether it is the old -fashioned swimming pool or the youthful woman in the old swimsuit, we all feel the simple and beautiful human nature.

Our smartphones are becoming more and more advanced, and we have more and more photos. As the famous printing company Yachang said in its social media video, no printed works are not good works. Historians told us that in the 1980s, this earth was born 6 billion photos every year. The number of photos like the ocean feeds a giant company like Kodak. But to this day, there may be so many numbers of photos in the world in three days, and the number of them printed out is unknown. We may have missed a lot of great works because they may always be buried in digital tsunami. We have never had time to edit the photos we took, because the number clouds are very large, we live with our digital clouds, although these digital files called photos record the little bit of our lives.

Liu Xiangcheng and Yang Fudong recorded the video writers of this country and this era. Susan Santaig said at a pointed way, "Photography has always been fascinated by the upper society and the underlying society." For these two great creators, I have always been wondering how they face the sacred black in their works. The lofty feeling comes from the history of the history and the way of history, and there are more ethical and aesthetic relationship between individual themes and more magnificent human progress or backstur situation. This relationship drives them to see Get more, look farther, look the farthest. In Turkish writer Olham Pamuk's novel "My Name is Red", it once described the hard work of a group of loyal calligraphers. They will copy the scriptures with the most beautiful and detailed handwriting throughout their lives, and at the end of their life, they will be regarded as they have completed their works and their work. And all their eyes, they finally dedicated their eyes to God.

When the light appears, the photo appears. As long as the exposure occurs, the light hit the film or carefully designed sensors in the form of a particle. This is the source of the photo. And most of the photos will start shooting less than one percent of the shutter. The great photographer will accumulate the most important thing in their lives in the film and sensor for less than a second of the film and sensors. A work. The measurement standards of this life were all fixed in this second. Think about the one -second of Liu Xiangcheng's shooting Gorbachev in the Klimlin Palace in Moscow, and one second from Yang Fudong to the sea and the other shore in Tiantai Mountain, Zhejiang. The political meaning in news reports and the contemporary spirit in classical works are all the moments of capturing a lofty spirit in human history.

Liu Xiangcheng spent more time to recording the survival status of all strata of China's reform and opening up. This typical news and documentary creation, known as the "Chinese scene", occurred in an era of progress in all industries in China every week. When we face huge photos in the exhibition hall, we crossed the people who queued for winter storage of Chinese cabbage during the poverty period. We entered the art world that flourished but has not yet entered the monopoly art world. Whether it is ordinary people in the end of the 1970s and early 1970s, or the commercial noble or industry elites in the 21st century economic age, the vibrant on each person's face will make us ask us, whether it is happier or more happy or more happy at that time. We are more satisfied with now? Personally, it is better to recall the growth of the opening of this country's country. It can eliminate most of my nostalgia for it. But I will also persuade younger friends to explore this photography exhibition called "Legend • Times • People". Imagine the paleness and weakness they have experienced.

For the masculinity Luo Han who appeared in Yang Fudong's works, and the high -level spiritual texture filled with the famous Wei and Jin celebrities, "come by flourishing and return to the whole world", everyone will be happy to show the spiritual world presented in the fictional works.

Can't see the development trend of diversification of import channels at all

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In 2022, Germany imported from China to the highest level of history. "In some products areas, this is quite dangerous -because China is almost dominant in the market of these products." The latest research report released by the German Institute of Economics (IW) pointed out that especially some raw materials, chemical raw materials and electronics Components, almost no other suppliers can be found except China.

The German government calls for [German Economic Circles to reduce dependence on China](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国对华经济依赖持续加深-问题出在哪/a-65259582)Essence But for many industrial enterprises and export -oriented enterprises, [China is an extremely important market](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国市场不可替代/a-65198442)Essence Chinese Prime Minister [Li Qiang visited Germany this week](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567)And the Prime Minister Salz and his cabinet members held a German -Chinese government consultation.

However, according to the observation of the German Institute of Economic Research, in recent years, new development trends have appeared in Germany and China trade exchanges: "More and more commodities from China to Germany, but in the contrary, Germany's export growth has almost fallen into it. Stagging. "Researchers at the agency found the types of products imported from China.

Taking the data of 2021 as an example, in the 298 products worth more than 10 million euros, more than 50%of the imports from Germany came from China. In 2022, 211 of these products increased significantly.

According to a survey by the Institute of Economic Research, in the fields of laptops, magnets, keyboards, and vitamin C, magnesium and caffeine, products imported from China occupy particularly high. "Generally speaking, in the fields of some raw materials, chemical raw materials, and electronic components, the influence of China's influence can be observed." In these fields, the development trend of diversification of import channels is currently not seen.

Researchers pointed out that when certain products are indispensable for enterprises, and in the visible future, it is almost impossible to be replaced by other suppliers' products, such a development trend is quite dangerous. In this case, Germany will fall into a dangerous dependence.

The author of the research report of the German Institute of Economic Research also said that it is not a topic that is completely decoupled with China or farewell to China. "As for which areas exist in such danger, the company should find them out with the support of politics now." Otherwise, the so -called risk of de -risk is just empty words. "

Description: A new research report shows that due to the warming of the climate, by the end of this century, 75%of the total glacier volume in the Himalayan mountain area of Xingdu Kush/Himalayan may be discharged. This will cause the local 240 million residents to face the threat of floods and droughts.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) Studies by a team of international scientists show that ice and snow in the Himalayas are accelerated. According to the assessment of the International High Mountain Development Center (ICIMOD) located in Kandu, Nepal, in the 2010s, the melting speed of ice and snow in the region increased by 65%compared with the previous decades.

"We are losing glaciers, and these glaciers will no longer exist after 100 years," said the center's environmental scientist and reporter Philippus Wester.

Xingdu Kush/Himalayas stretch 3,500 kilometers, crossing 8 countries in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.

The defendant pointed out that if the temperature increases by 1.5 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees Celsius compared with the previous industrialization era, by 2100, the glaciers in the entire region will lose 30%-50%of its original volume.

Where [Glacier melting](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球冰川消融速度正在加快/a-57375682)The most depends on its specific location. If the temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius -this is the result of the current global climate policy, if it continues to continue, the eastern section of the Himalayas, the glaciers in Nepal and Bhutan to the end of this century will lose 75%of its volume.

### The flood of the Himalayan Glacier Fracture and Roaring Broke in the Indian Dam

### The source of water from 200 million people in Asia

There are 240 million residents living in the Kush-Himalayas. The glaciers of this area are also the origin of the world's top 10 rivers, including the Ganges, India, Mekong, Yellow River, Yangtze River, Ilova River, etc. The total population of these large river basins is as high as 1.65 billion, agricultural irrigation, food, energy and energy, and Economic development depends on the above rivers.

Izabella Koziell, deputy director of the International Gaoshan Development Center, said that the water source of 200 million people in Asia rely on these glaciers and snow. Once this ice circle is lost, the consequences are "unimaginable".

The report pointed out that the flow of 12 rivers that originated in the region may reach its peak in the middle of this century. "Although it sounds more water, because the melting speed of glaciers is accelerating ... However, water often appears in the form of floods, not stable water flow." West said that after the peak of traffic passed, the flow of traffic passed the past past past passed. The amount of river water will become less and less.

At present, many residents in high mountain areas use glacier water and snow melting to irrigate crops. However, the time of snowfall becomes more unstable and less and less. This situation is also very unfavorable to the animal husbandry. Some locals have moved from mountain villages to other places to make a living. The melting of the two large amounts of ice and snow constitutes a danger to the settlement of downstream.

Experts said that this situation highlights "the need for emergency action to protect the climate," West said. "Each small increment will have a huge impact. We really need to make efforts in slowing climate warming ... This is our urgent request."

China and India are facing the dilemma of reduced water resources. In October this year, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Indian Prime Minister Singh jointly signed the "Memorandum of Understanding of the Cross -border River Cooperation for the Ministry of Water Resources of the Sino -Indian Water Resources". But this memorandum of understanding obviously does not solve all conflicts. The Brahmapra River is called the Yarlung Tibetan River in China. China plans to build multiple dams in the upstream section of this river, which may pose a threat to Indian fisheries.

(Voice of Germany) El Niopy is a natural phenomenon that changes the global weather model. After a lapse of four years, the soil coming back, which may exacerbate the high -owned food inflation.

Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Forecasting Center stated that the El Nino phenomenon already exists and is expected to "gradually strengthen" in the next six to nine months, which will bring a new extreme weather period to most regions of the world. Essence

"(The phenomenon of Qiang El Niini again) is quite likely.")) Professor Ququ(Harald Kunstmann)Said, "If this happens, it can be expected to have extreme climate and abnormal phenomenon that is usually accompanied by this phenomenon."

The Name of Elnino's phenomenon comes from Spanish Elniño (boy), which refers to the phenomenon that the East Pacific seawater will be abnormally heated every few years. It has promoted the floods of the Americas, tropical storms in the Pacific Ocean, and brought drought to many parts of the world, including southern Africa.

These natural disasters have severely damaged fisheries, agriculture, and other economic departments, and they also exacerbate the impact of climate change. In 2016, the El Nino phenomenon caused the hottest year since the record, and scientists worry that it may lead to [global temperature reached a new high](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界气象组织警告未来五年将创下最热记录/a-65668526) 。

Earlier this month, researchers at the EU Copenie Climate Change Service Center found that the global surface temperature increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the first time before industrialization, and this was the future temperature limit of the 2015 Paris Climate Summit reached a consensus.

"In June, the heating of 1.5 degrees Celsius is not the same as small." Questerman told Germany. "We may soon exceed this threshold, not only for a few weeks, but also a longer period of time."

### ** El Nino phenomenon brings huge economic losses **

Even after the most extreme weather passed, the economic impact caused by El Niopy's season will often continue.

According to the study of Dartmouth College, after 1982-83, the economic impact lasted for five years, with a total loss of approximately $ 4.1 trillion (3.7 trillion euros).

Researchers said in a paper published in the American "Science" magazine that after the El Niopy season in 1997-98, global economic growth has suffered $ 5.7 trillion.

Cricaham, a doctoral student of the ecosystem and social project of Datmouth College(Christopher Callahan)Said: "We can say certain that social and economy will never recover quickly after being hit." He said that after the El Nino phenomenon, growth may be affected by 14 years or even longer.

Researchers at Datmouth College found that the El Niopy phenomenon from 1982-83 and 1997-98 led to the GDP of the United States in 1988 and 2003(GDP)A drop of about 3%. Agriculture such as Peru and Indonesia accounted for 15% of the country's GDP, and the GDP in 2003 dropped by more than 10%.

Bangladesh is one of the countries with the worst affected by climate disasters in the world. The children in the picture are in the Buriganga to reduce heat. The country ’s frequent rumors of the devastating hurricane and flood disasters, and the rise of sea level, also caused one -fifth of the country to face permanent flood threats.

"Economic impact is firstly fisheries. The industry suffers huge losses due to the rise in ocean temperature." Qukinsman told Germany, "Then it will attack large agricultural areas in Africa, South America and even North America. If the harvest is not good and the infrastructure is damaged due to the storm, the insurance industry will be affected. "

### ** Food and energy prices may rise sharply **

The model released by Bloomberg Economic Research Company this week found that the previous several times of El Niopy led to nearly 4 percentage points in the price of non -energy commodities, and oil prices rose 3.5 percentage points, which weakened global food safety.

Bloomberg found that the inflation rate in Argentina and Brazil was about 0.75 percentage points higher, and the inflation rate in the Philippines and India was half a percentage point.

Worried that the El Nino phenomenon may be the most warmed and caused the highest loss in history. Analysts believe that it may also extend the high inflation of food.

The peak of prices after the new crown epidemic may have passed, but it may take several years to return to the 2%inflation target set by the United States and the European Central Bank.

Germany's largest private loan institution Germany said in a research report last week that more and more warnings about the phenomenon of Elnino have led to a significant increase in the prices of coffee, sugar and cocoa in recent weeks. As the harvest is affected by bad weather, other food prices are expected to follow up.

"(Price increase) may have a particularly negative impact on emerging markets. In emerging markets, foods usually account for at least one -third of consumer expenditure. The geographical location of them is more vulnerable to climate change such as floods, and their geographical location El Nino increased this possibility, "Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.

In India, agriculture is the cornerstone of the economy, and the annual monsoon is essential for grain production. Indian Reserve Bank President Das(Shaktikanta Das)Recently, it said: "Close and continuous attention ... absolutely necessary, especially when the expectations of monsoon and the impact of the El Nino phenomenon are still uncertain."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-25T04-39-09-08-00/20dc-biden-china-vflt-master1050.jpg)US President Biden said on Tuesday evening that Chinese President Xi Jinping has been in the drums by the Chinese government, and he does not know about the spy balloon of this winter. After crossing the United States, this balloon has been led by the United States [being shot down by an American fighter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/politics/chinese-spy-balloon-shot-down.html)Essence

At a campaign fundraising activity in California, Biden said that it seemed to be an impromptu speech on the incident that caused the rupture of Sino -US relations for several months, revealing that the American intelligence agency learned in the incident in Beijing. Internal chaos.

"When I shot down the balloon and the two computers filled with spy equipment, Xi Jinping was very angry because he didn't know where the balloon was there," Bayeng was at a grand event held in Kentfield. About 130 guests said. "No, I'm serious. For the dictator, if they don't know what happened, this is very embarrassing."

On Tuesday night, other U.S. officials were surprised by the Presidential Association's discussion in discussing these sensitive information in public, but an official who heard relevant intelligence briefings and requested anonymous to say that Biden's remarks accurately reflected the internal assessment of the US government.

The day before the president made the above remarks, [](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)[Secretary of State Anthony Brin Kenkee in Beijing and Xi Jinping](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)[Meeting](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/), To ease the cracks brought by the spy balloon incident. Blint's itinerary was initially canceled after the spy balloon incident was made public, but was considered to be a "thaw" for [Biden sought "](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230523/biden-china-g7/)One step of constructive steps, "thawing" includes a possible dialogue between leaders of the two countries later this year.

"The very important point is that he is now in a situation where he wants to build a relationship again," said Biden when he talked about Xi Jin. "Our Secretary of State Tony Blins has just been there; it is good to do it. This takes time."

However, if the president's discussion of the spy balloon incident is considered to be degraded to Xi Jinping, it may complicate diplomatic contact, because Xi Jinping firmly controls power in China and attaches importance to his image to control everything. Chinese officials have never disclosed the source of the balloon, nor did they respond to Biden immediately.

"It should not appear where it appeared," Biden said when he talked about the balloon at California's fundraising event. "It deviated from the route, first flew across Alaska, and then flew across the United States. He didn't know about it," Biden added. He refers to Xi Jinping. "When the balloon was shot down, he felt very embarrassing. He even denied it there."

At that time, people found that the balloon drifted over a nuclear missile launch field in Montana, and then passed through the city of Kansas. Finally, it was shot down by a snake missile missile launched by a F-22 fighter in South Carolina. A big wave settled. U.S. officials have previously stated that they suspect that the balloon is investigated by the US military base in Guam and Hawaii](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230216/balloon-ufo-us-china/), But was blown away from the route, turned to Alaska, and eventually came to the United States, but they did not disclose that Xi seemed to be unaware of the matter.

This is not the first time that Biden has published an explanation of foreign policy at the fundraising party. In a similar occasion in New York in October, he reminded the donor that since Kennedy and Khrushchev started the Soviet Union in Cuba in 1962, the world has not been close to a nuclear destruction as much as it is now. "We have not faced the possibility of ending the end of the world since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis," Biden said at the time, which caused a moment of disturbance.

In California on Tuesday, Biden said at home donors to Democratic Party donors at the investment banker Mark Robinson and the wife of Stephani Robinson, who had been a business management consultant and an investment banker. When stating the overall view of international affairs, Biden focused on China, which was a topic he recently thought about. Through this occasion, he tried to alleviate the rise of Beijing's economy and the increasingly strong world on the world stage that made the United States anxiety.

"Don't worry about China," Biden said. "I mean, worry about China, but don't worry about China," he said in the laughter of the audience. "But I really think so. China is true -facing real economic difficulties."

After talking about spy balloon, Biden then said that he's efforts in consolidating the "dialogue between the four -way dialogue" of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India made Xi Jinping very dissatisfied, which was to counter the influence of China in the Indo -Pacific region. Bayeng met with the "Quartet Dialogue" leaders of the "Quartet Dialogue" at the Seventh -way Group meeting in Hiroshima, Japan last month.

"What really made him very uncomfortable was that I insisted on re -organizing the so -called 'Quartet dialogue'," Biden said. "He asked me to stop me for me, because it would be very unfavorable to him. I said 'We are just -we are not surrounding you, we just want to ensure international order and ensure the smoothness of the sea and air channels.' On this issue We will not give up. "

"So," he then said, "Now we are India, Australia, Japan, and the United States.

"When we are discussing AI, we are essentially discussing 'What is the mind' '' What is consciousness '? When discussing VR or' Augmented reality ', is it discussing' What is reality ''? Thinking from this level, we will find that a lot of things have not changed in essence. "

The curator and the founder of the "Pan Biological Art Studio" Wei Ying have long been paying attention to the integration of art and technology for a long time. She believes that looking back at the technological history and seeing the process of technological evolution, people can keep people rational in the current enthusiasm and at the same time To get more contact with new technologies, be able to dispel charm for technology, and "symbiosis" will be a better attitude.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence represented by ChatGPT, "AI anxiety" has flooded the future of major industries and individual development. The era of intelligent creation is coming. In the traditional sense, knowledge production and communicationrs, such as the most typical paper media, will accelerate the demise, or can we usher in more possibilities? Recently, during the 100 special event organized by the newspaper "Xinrui Weekly" under the newspaper of CITIC Publishing Group, Liu Hailong, a professor at the School of Journalism of Renmin University of China, Mei Jianhua, a professor at the School of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Shanxi University, and Lai Lili, an associate professor at the School of Medicine Humanities, Peking University. Wei Ying, the founder of Biotechnology Studio, and Wu Yang, editor -in -chief of "Xinrui Weekly", analyzed people and mediums in the current realistic situation.

Liu Hailong believes that the emergence of AIGC technology has put forward higher requirements for people. People must have the ability to raise good problems. If the problem is not good enough, the quality of answers given by AI is not good. Liu Hailong mentioned that since students' use of AI tools in future employment is an inevitable trend, then teachers can ask students to write down the questioning process of AI, or let students show them what modifications and supplements they have done on the basis of AI generation homework. In this way, teachers can know the understanding of students' knowledge. On the one hand, AIGC may lead to "more rolling", prove that they are better than AI to be replaced by AI; on the other hand, the appearance of AIGC also allows people to return to the learning model of ancient Greece or Confucius more than 2000 years ago- It is not to get the truth through personal reading but questions and conversations.

However, AIGC's working principle is based on the existing database as a probability calculation, which is average, that is, some "mediocre" answers. How can Socrates also gain inspiring answers and creating brilliant knowledge when communicating with the most mediocre people? This requires good questions. A good question does not come from the existing knowledge base, otherwise you will get a self -finger -involved and repetitive answer. Good questions depend on human beings and fresh stimuli. Fresh stimulation is accidental. Liu Hailong said, "The biggest feature of traditional media is accidental, allowing us to see what we didn't want to see. We are now a choice. We can only choose known. also the same."

Liu Hailong quoted the "elimination of others" proposed by philosopher Han Bingzhe to describe ChatGPT, which is necessary to answer, and never get rid of it, that is, a slave to obey human beings. "In this era, we hope to eliminate 'others', and everything must meet our requirements. We must control everything. Everything must be informationized and digitized. It will appear in front of you immediately. "Traditional paper media provides an independent" other ", which provides accidental to break the information cocoon room, and at the same time provides publicity, connects the crowd, and creates the possibility of communication and transmission of thoughts.

Lai Lili believes that human materiality will not be eliminated, and information must also have a material carrier. People must mobilize the body's participation into the world of information. Therefore, people's material dependence on the paper media will not disappear easily, and the emergence of new media can also promote the transformation of people, such as changing the current education model of people's thinking.

Mei Jianhua also supports the "plug -in" of artificial intelligence as an auxiliary knowledge framework. However, the consciousness of their own problems requires the stimulus of ideological resources, such as paper media and new life experience. These processes cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence. Therefore, even if the high -precision AI translation has been widely used in academic production, Mei Jianhua still requires students to experience the philosophical way of thinking by translating philosophical texts. "Inspirations in academia need to be repeated and thought through a large number of self -repetitions," Mei Jianhua said in his speech. "The real education has not changed for thousands of years -punching thousands of times,"

As early as 2018, Wei Ying set up a course that combined "brain machine fusion" and art in order to explore the boundaries of science and technology and science fiction to see how artists can use this new medium. From as much as possible as possible to "technical removal" as possible, Wei Ying believes that "AI is definitely not the first, nor is it the last thing that combat the art circle." So painting turned to pursuing more mental and abstract things. After the coming of AI, art is facing the reflection of transformation again. And, what art do we need now? Wei Ying said that only by understanding the new technology and the evolution of the history of technology, can we not be led by technology, and with the support of the humanistic discipline, the works made by the artist will be more solid.

_ "Xinrui Weekly" published the 100th issue of issue, published the first collection of previous essence articles — "Complex World", 25 interdisciplinary thinkers used philosophy, art, anthropology, and archeology. The cutting -edge thoughts respond to reality issues. CITIC Publishing the contemporary direction of human thought, with humanities and social sciences.

Speaking of the boring of the office, I originally thought that there was nothing to say about the Internet cockroaches that are exhausted and difficult to eliminate work.

But not long ago, when a friend at work told me how exciting her 10 -year -old son had the first email account, I found that there was still some say.

She told me: "Whenever he receives a new mail, he will be extremely excited." Most emails were sent by her or teacher. As he received the mail, he just announced that there were 175 seals in total.

When I was immersed in a tragic idea -in the face of the income box full of emails, how long will his joy become a fear, my friend interrupted me: "Guess how many electronics I have a sealed electronics Mail. Unread. "

"100,000?" I said, she must have no me, I have 120,000. "No," she said, "300,000." I told a colleague about this. He said that there was more than 500,000. I think the reporter's income box is particularly easy to flood. The next day I asked how many unexpected emails had an investor I met. She frowned and said, "More than 400,000."

Like us, she has given up struggle in the face of endless figure bombing. As the company's senior management, the "garbage" emails within countless companies were copied to her, as well as a variety of marketers, promoters, and propaganda personnel not invited to send her a lot of spam from the outside.

When I mentioned the matter with another colleague not long ago, he said that he was considering doing something that I had been considering: setting a permanent automatic reply of "not in the office" to warn the sender "because the email was flooded I may not reply quickly. "

This is just an email (2019 U.S. employees look at emails for more than 3 hours every day), plus news tips from Slack, Teams, G-Chat or WhatsApp, anyone can complete any important tasks for any important job They are all miracles.

Of course, some information transmission is necessary, just as there are some necessary online meetings and telephones that have surged since the beginning of the epidemic. But we have reached such a point: the frustrated efficiency loss is exceeding the benefits brought by communication.

Microsoft(Microsoft)A recent report confirmed this. The report found that it is difficult for employees around the world to keep up with "massive data, information and communication at any time."

Studies have shown that people spend 57%of their working days on e -mail, conferences and other communication, and only 43%of the time is used to engage in effective creative activities.

As a large investor in the field of generating artificial intelligence, Microsoft claims that the method of solving this dilemma is artificial intelligence -it is incredible. The technology giant claims that artificial intelligence will liberate employees who have been under tremendous pressure from time to time and release their creativity.

Maybe. But this is not enough.

First of all, employees cannot continue to think that the cold proposal about "productivity improvement skills" helps. You can try your best to filter emails, block subscription emails, and block notifications, but do this will never solve the problem of overload of your inbox, because this problem is not caused by you.

On the contrary, the root cause of this problem lies in the use of layers of communication technologies by layers of communication, without considering how this will affect their broader goals -or employees' productivity and energy.

I have rarely encountered companies like Gitlab. This software company has given detailed guidance when it uses emails, Slack or other tools to complete various tasks.

It is out of need: for a long time, it has to use a lot of remote labor. However, the company's efforts made by cutting the so -called "communication branches" that troubled large -scale organizations are generally applicable.

Seeing German Volkswagen(Volkswagen)It is exciting to wait for the company to turn off the email system and other measures at non -working hours, although these measures are difficult to implement in practice.

I also like Daimler, a German Auto Group(Daimler)Allow employees to automatically delete the email settings during vacation. The "disconnection of connection right" policy that restricts non -working hours is increasingly popular, and it is also worthy of welcome.

However, what we really need to pay attention to is how we work during working hours. Before this problem is resolved, we are destined to endure the office life, which is always more tortured and frustrated than the ideal version of office life.

At the beginning of the Ukrainian war, the former British Prime Minister Johnson was one of the minority of Western leaders who assisted Ukraine and formed a trouble with Zellezki. The current Prime Minister Sonak inherited this tradition. Regardless of military, financial or human, he supports it.

In terms of military, Ukraine has not achieved the expectations so far. Before the end of the war, it was confirmed that Ukraine could not join NATO, because it was necessary to avoid dragging all countries in NATO into the war (see ["Can Ukraine join NATO in the future: Can Ukraine join NATO?"(https://www.ftchinese.com/story/001099910?archive)To. It is unknown whether Jelianzki will participate in NATO's summit in NATO in Vernish, the capital of Lithuania. Maybe the United States, Britain, Germany, and France, which have not yet been introduced, provide long -term security guarantees for Ukraine (that is, an alternative to NATO). It made Zediski unable to refuse. Now he is the core figure of NATO.

In terms of Ukraine's post -war reconstruction, this year's Ukraine RecoveryConference (Annual Meeting, held in Lugaro, Switzerland in 2022, aimed at proposing a route map for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war in Ukraine.)Just ended in London. Prior to the meeting, the British dispatched the royal family -Charles III held a enrollment at the San James Palace. Welcome to the participants in the meeting to thank them for their contributions to the success of the meeting. The royal family cannot interfere with British internal affairs, but it is the number one ace of Britain's soft power. The history of the dynasty, the palace, the king, the century -old etiquette, the huge servant team of servants, etc., which have been stretching for thousands of years, are all the world's only European dynasties living fossils in the world.

The recovery meeting was chaired by Sunak. The Ukrainian recovery plan was described as "the Marshall Plan of Ukraine" by 24 France. The Marshall Plan, also known as the European RecooveryProgram, was a plan for economic assistance and assistance to reconstruction in the United States after World War II. Ukrainian Prime Minister Shimagal has said he is expected to receive nearly $ 7 billion in assistance in order not only to restore and develop into a powerful member of the Western world.

Sunak, who presided over the platform, was actually burnt.

After the death of Elizabeth II last year, all the inheritance of the throne was orderly, and it was successfully transferred to Charles III. However, the last winner Sunak after the British ruling party's fighter dispute was not good. Most of the Conservative Party's high seats led the world of the House of Houses and Houses, but the chaos is now unable to get rid of the discipline. Following last year, the image of the Conservative Party has been severely damaged by the Reservoir Party.(https://www.ftchinese.com/story/001099991?archive)To. In the voting of the House of Commons last Monday night, more than 300 Conservative MPs abandoned their cars (Johnson) Baoshuai (Conservative Party). parliament). Sunak deliberately arranged other meetings during the voting time period to avoid participating in voting. It is estimated that to avoid irritating the older superior Johnson, but at the same time, it is necessary to indicate that the voters do not support the "party door" incident. Prime Minister status. After the vote, Johnson no longer counterattacked the parliament with a fierce words, retreated to the media, and served as a columnist of the tabloid "Daily Mail". This is the best way to fight for voters. How many positions he still has in the hearts of voters, no one knows. He is less than 60, and the three children of the third wife are under 5 years old. Can he still shake British politics in the future? Very unexpected.

But the most important thing is not whether Johnson has come back to Dongshan. The most important thing is that he should not add chaos to the Conservative Party. But who knows whether Johnson is the only candidate to defeat the Labor Party in the hearts of the Conservative voters in the hearts of next year? Although Sunak is talented and talented, it is just the view of most Conservatives. He seems to be in a bad weight among voters. In the history of Prime Minister, who is closer to voters than Blair and Johnson? Now public opinion is talking about the prospect of the Labor Party in the next year.

The British fiscal situation is as anxious as burning. Regardless of the inflation rate, loan ratio, or the number of national debt, all numbers make people heartburn, which has a high historical meaning:

The British government will reduce the inflation rate as the most important entrance to solve this economy. But so far, the inflation rate is still high, and it is disappointing, because the price increase has not been relieved. Although the inflation rate is no longer a double digit last year, it is still as high as 8.7%. Basic or core inflation (Underlyingor Core Inflation)It rose 7.1%in May, higher than 6.8%in April, the highest value since March 1992, and was far away from the ideal 2%.

The one -year strike is still continuing, with only one purpose -requires the increase of wages to keep up with the level of inflation. I have received a letter from the school. The school teacher will strike two days in July, and some students are asked to go online at home. However, many industries have stopped strikes and returned to normal work after obtaining salary.

However, although the growth rate of wages jumped from 6.1%to 6.5%before, the wage growth rate in April still lagged behind the 8.7%consumer price inflation index, which means that the actual wages of the British are declining. Nevertheless, the growth of wages in the UK has soared, the employment rate has also risen, and the economic recession has not entered. But this has improved the expectations of people's interest rate hikes again, which is to curb the ruthless inflation pressure.

However, the interest rate hike brought a mortgage crisis. The Bank of England increased interest rates from 4.5%to 5%last Thursday-the last high interest rate in the last time was April 2008. Britain will be affected by 1.4 million mortgagers. The British Minister of Finance has met with major banks to discuss solutions to reduce the financial pressure of the lender.

People blame the British government's powerless governance, but the British government does not need to use the black pot for anti -globalized international background -Brexit Labor labor shortage, reducing the trade between Britain and Europe. Rescue subsidies; Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the biggest pushing hand in the predicament of Western countries, including Britain, and various economic sanctions on Russia have interrupted free trade. Britain is both economic damage and requires a lot of subsidies in Ukraine. British debt and gross domestic product(GDP)It has risen to more than 100%since 1961, and the public sector borrowed in May.On the occasion of this article, the Great News of the Wagner Group in Russia's mutiny rebellion, Sunak has emerged in Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms on Saturday(COBR, Cobra Conference, the British government's crisis and emergency international events). It is expected that he will communicate with Zediski and leaders of NATO to communicate the emergency.

For those emotional people, electric vehicles have touched a lot of emotional buttons. There is an instant acceleration excitement, the strengthening of self -consciousness -feels like the coolest child in this street, and the self -confidence that he thinks he stands on the correct one side of the history of climate change.

But the new generation of electric pickups in the United States brought this intoxication to a new height. Ford(Ford)F-150 lightning(Lightning)——The electric version of the best -selling car models in the United States -can supply a family for three days when the hurricane is raging, or power for a remote work with electric tools.

The electric pickup truck owner boasts that having a electric pickup card, like a zero -emitted vehicle -mounted electrical appliance: multiple power sockets equipped on the car, can give inflatable mattresses, fry, coffee, and camping. Time to turn on the air conditioner. A Rivian electric car owner used his electric pickup to supply a audio system for a 150 -person, no wedding system, and in Texas, a urological doctor claimed that he had performed the first case in the world. Rivian electric vehicle power supply ligation surgery.

Some car owners say they like this kind of private power plant like a power assembly system, but energy experts said that these functions are not just interesting. Electric vehicles can return their electricity to the United States to be trapped in the Power grid under the control of people, not just to obtain electricity from the grid. As many people are worried that electric vehicles will put pressure on the power grid that is originally unstable, public institutional companies and car companies have stated that they may become part of the solution. Electric truck owners can even make money stored in the grid by selling electricity stored in the truck at the price at the peak time at the price of the night charging price.

American Natural Resources Protection Commission(NRDC)It is not said that this is not Tianfang Tan: According to the calculation of the committee, if every battery electric vehicle on the road before 2035 can enter the power grid directly to the power grid, which can provide power for each family of the state for three days.

Columbia University(Columbia University)Electronic Engineering Associate Professor Martias Pretidel(Matthias Preindl)He said that he dreamed that one day electric vehicles could be used as spare energy storage facilities. In a limited time, they add up to "provide more power more than all traditional power plants", and the emissions are less than the peak power plants that currently used to cope with extreme needs.

Of course, first of all, the United States must let more electric vehicles go on the road -or more accurate to let them drive on the lane -anyway, most of the 95%of the cars are driving on the lane. More and more models have been launching: GM(GM)The electric pickup Silverado will be listed this year, and its model promises a range of 400 to 450 miles. Most experts estimate that only 1%of all cars on the road in the United States are electric vehicles, but sales are rising rapidly: the International Energy Agency(IEA)It said that last year, US electric vehicle sales increased by 55%, accounting for 8%.

33 -year -old Westley Ferguson(WestleyFerguson)It is helping to promote this growth. Like many electric pickup buyers, he has never owned electric cars before, nor has he had a truck -Ford CEO Jim France(Jim Farley)It is often said that most Ford F-150 Lightning buyers are the first time I buy pickup cards. Ferguson told me on the phone that he wanted an electric car, "because investing in a gasoline car feels like investing in the past, and it feels like investing in the future."

Last year, he and his wife purchased a $ 67,000 Ford F-150 Lightning Pot, and shortly after that, their homes in Florida because of the hurricane "Ian" in Florida.(Ian)Three days of power off. During this period, Westley received the power supply extended line to the truck to supply power for refrigerators, electric lights, fans, TVs, bells, recorders and speakers, and consumed about 10%of the electric vehicle battery every day. Later, once, in order to grab the front seats to watch the rocket launch, they spent the night in the camping. They used this truck to inflatter the inflatable bed, cook, and the air conditioner in the car -all these picking cards 3 consume this pickup 3 %To 5%power.

35 -year -old Google(Google)Engineer Brian Calbeck(Brian Calbeck)Tell me how he "adds to tinkel" how his Rivianr1t "uses, stores, and reuses energy." Last year, he manipulated the car to run the audio system at a family wedding held in a remote place. He said that if in his hometown of California, electric vehicles transmitted power in power grids to become a reality, and he will be "the first person to sign the contract" -but the premise is that public institutional companies can be priced reasonably.

There are thousands of electricity companies in the United States that are operating, and the interests of many stakeholders must be coordinated. I am not sure if the electric vehicle can help transmission to the power grid in my lifetime. Now, I think I can blow the inflatable mattress and save frozen meat in extremely hot weather, and I am very satisfied. This is my electric car lifestyle.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) polls can transmit public views and intuitively reflect public opinion in real time, but reflect the "instantaneous" state at the time. The Voice of Germany compared the results of the polls involved in the "American people on the Chinese view of China", which has been conducted by Gallop for many years. The results may reflect how American society views the international status of China and its geopolitical impact on the US geopolitical impact on the United States. Essence

### overall observation

Gallop has investigated the overall view of the United States in China in the questionnaire since 1979. This year, the two countries have just established diplomatic relations. At that time, 64%of the respondents held a positive view of China and only had a negative view of only 25%. However, in the next few years, the situation has changed. In 1985, the proportion of Americans who held positive views on China fell to 38%, and the respondents with negative views rose to 51%. From 1984 to 1985, the heads of state and government head of state and government visited for the first time. Since then, the official interaction and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides have become more active, and the Americans have significantly improved China's perception of China.

After the Tiananmen incident in 1989, the US officials imposed sanctions on China, and the people's perception of China also reversed. During the year, the proportion of respondents holding a positive view of China fell from 72%to 34%of the negative views from 13%to 54%. Over the years, the proportion has been kept in a stable range, and 45%to 60%of the respondents holding negative views.

In recent years, the US -China relations have declined, and the image of China in the international community has been created, which is also reflected in polls. Since 2018, interviewees with negative perceptions in China have continued to rise sharply, reaching a new high of 79%in 2021, and the proportion of people with a positive perception of China has fallen to 20%. The questionnaire results in 2022 are consistent with 2021.

### Who is the largest enemy in the United States

Another long -term survey results show that in the past 10 years, since Xi Jinping's main administration, Americans have increasingly felt that China has pose a threat to the United States.

For "Which country is the largest enemy in the United States?" In this issue, 18%of the respondents thought it was Russia in 2015, and 15%thought it was North Korea. %And 9%.

After 2018, the proportion of people in the United States as the number one hostile to the United States began to rise steadily, [2021](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/盖洛普美国人对中俄好感度创新低/a-56761933)Increased to 45%, surpassing Russia (26%), and for the first time before other options. In 2022 and 2023, 49%and 50%of the respondents believed that China was the largest enemy in the United States.

### Taiwan Strait conflict risk awareness increases

In February this year, the Associated Press and the Chicago "National Public Opinion Research Center" (NORC) in the United States [polls](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/民調多數美國人嚴重關切中國影響力/a-64806510)Also show that Americans have serious attention to China (60%of the respondents) have more concerned about Russia (53%).

Specific to threatening methods and degrees, Gallop's questionnaire in 2023 shows that 66%of the respondents believe that China's military power constitutes a "key threat" to the United States. The relevant proportion is 39%and 46%, respectively. In 2023, 64%of the respondents believed that China's economic power constituted a "key threat" to the United States, and 30%believed that they were "important threats", and in 2015, 40%and 44%were respectively.

For the "Taiwan Strait conflict threatens the interests of the United States?" In 2023, 47%of the respondents believed that this would be "key threat" (23%in 2004). "(51%in 2004).

###  upgrade

After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the over -the -world of the US -Canada border.

The top ten also include: Singapore (fourth place), the Netherlands, Taiwan, and [Hong Kong](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球竞争力排行榜-美国第一香港第二/a-18480371), Sweden, [United States](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美重夺竞争力第一-中国超越台湾/a-43905223)And the UAE.

### Taiwan Sixth

The news that Taiwan's rising one and sixth ranking last year also attracted the attention of Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen. She said on Facebook: "We have more than 5 years of progress, three of which, including government effectiveness, corporate efficiency and infrastructure construction, Taiwan's ranking has moved forward." Hong Kong decreased two more than last year. China dropped four.

The ranking reflects the views of a country's private economy. The Lausanne Institute of Management in Switzerland used 164 hard indicators and a questionnaire survey of 6,400 managers to conclude the competitiveness of a country. These numbers flow to the four major areas: business capabilities, national efficiency, corporate efficiency, infrastructure.

The ranking shows that small countries often get higher scores. This is because small countries have greater flexibility in the face of uncertainty in the world economy.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-25T07-28-00Z/65960573_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65996760/65960573)(Voice of Germany Chinese), driven by China, has set off a fierce competition for lithium raw materials worldwide, while Germany and Europe have become more and more passive. [Electric vehicles are becoming more and more popular, lithium batteries are not in short supply, and this kind of light metal compete for this kind of light metal is becoming more and more intense, because the future of electric vehicles cannot be separated from lithium batteries](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汽车电池制造中国已领先-欧洲追赶难/a-47993702)Essence Chinese companies invest billions of dollars to ensure the mining rights of lithium ore in Africa and Latin America. Experts believe that as of 2025, China will control one -third of the global lithium ore output. This offensive was initiated by Xi Jinping, the leader of Chinese party and state, three years ago: "We must strengthen the international supply chain to depend on China and establish an effective countermeasure and deterrent mechanism for foreign countries that try to destroy China."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-25T07-28-00Z/65000367_401.jpg)Under a salt lake in Bolivia, there are rich lithium mines.

### Promoting diversification

In view of China's offensive market strategy, the Professor of the Institute of Economic Research, TobiaSheidland, has called on the German industry to strengthen the diversified construction of the supply chain. He said: "The dependence on Chinese lithium products has constituted a great danger to German companies. Once German -Chinese relations are nervous, German companies will lose channels for medium -term products."

At a meeting at the end of March, Feng Delin, the chairman of the European Commission, also warned the EU's high dependence on Chinese raw materials. She said that [97%of the European Union's lithium products came from China, and in 2050, the demand for lithium would increase 17 times. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/宁德时代在欧美投资遭遇阻力/a-64944983)In the case of intense political relations with Beijing, dependence on Chinese raw materials will become a problem.

### China is a popular partner

Compared with European companies, China ’s investment in South America and Africa is more competitive because Chinese companies rarely need to consider environmental protection and human rights standards. Ryanberg of the US Strategy and International Research Center told "Foreign Policy": "Governments of related countries are also very clear that cooperation with Chinese companies will definitely not reach the quality of Europe and the United States, but cooperate with Chinese companies to have headaches for headaches for Chinese companies There are also few things. You don't have to consider so many legal terms, you don't have to worry about environmental protection standards, let alone worry about complaints from non -governmental organizations. "

The southern countries have high dependence on investment from overseas, but these countries are reluctant to repeat past errors. When selling raw materials, most of their profits are arranged. Mexican President Andrés Manuellópezobrador and Bolivian President Alsei hopes to imitate the "OPEC" model of the Organization Organization of the Petroleum to establish a lithium ore alliance. Alice said: "We will appear in the market with a confident and decisive attitude, and the lithium price we formulate will eventually bring our national economy."

### The advantage of German company

Economist Heidelan believes that as long as a country pays attention to environmental protection and sustainable development in the process of mining lithium ore, then German companies will have a unique advantage. He said: "The mining process of lithium usually causes great damage to the environment. Unless you invest a lot of funds to avoid this destruction, this will increase costs. For German companies, in countries that do not pay attention to environmental protection, Participating in competition will be difficult, because you must not be better than Chinese companies. But on the other hand, in those countries that focus on sustainable development, German companies will have good opportunities, because German companies can use their own experience to take their own experience and take them. A quotation of attractive. "

Chinese companies are also focusing on Africa: According to the estimates of the US Geological Association, Zimbabwe, Democratic Congo, Ghana, Namibia, and Mali have 4.38 million tons of lithium ore reserves. However, the actual output of the above countries is only 40,000 tons each year, but the output is expected to increase to 500,000 tons per year in 2030. Zimbabwe will be the main country.

Chinese investors have already taken action: Zimbabwe's largest lithium ore -Biga Mine has been in the hands of China Mining Resources Group. The Chinese company Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt has a controlling stake in Arcadia, the second largest lithium ore in Zimbabwe.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-25T07-28-00Z/64670990_401.jpg)Lithium -rich original ore

ClintonPavlovic, an analyst at Hawking Luwei International Law Firm, said: "In the past three years, Chinese investors have invested or committed to more than $ 10 billion in the lithium mine project in Zimbabwe. With other raw materials required to develop electric vehicles, such as cobalt, manganese, nickel, and graphite, the country has great appeal to investors. The country's attractiveness to investors has not changed. Moreover, this ban is not applicable to foreign companies that have invested in the country.

Other African countries also hope to instruct investors to process raw materials in the local area so that they can leave larger profits in China. In Nigeria, China has also controlled the mineral market. In January this year, Mingxin Mining Company held a foundation ceremony for Nigeria's first lithium mine processing plant. Not long before, Nigeria just rejected the cooperation request of American electric vehicle companies Tesla, on the grounds that Tesla was only interested in buying raw materials lithium. Later, Mingxin's mining company from China obtained the power of mining.

In response to the overthrow of this verdict, Biden issued a statement saying: "The ban on the states only start, their policy claims extreme, dangerous, and disconnect with most Americans."

Supporting and anti -abortion groups today gathered against Taiwan in the capital Washington, and Vice President Kamala Harris talked about the "crisis" of health care related to reproductive rights in North Carolina.

About 20 states, mainly located in the south and central regions, have completely banned abortion or strictly restricting abortion, while other states in the coastal areas take action to protect abortion.

The abortion clinic of about 12 states was closed, forcing tens of thousands of women to go to his state to abandon.

Bayon said: "Republicans of Congress want to ban abortion across the country. To achieve this, they will let the abortion drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to withdraw from the market, making contraceptive measures more difficult to obtain."

In the past, those who come to be chased. As the two major economies in Asia, China and Japan are both similar in economic development and essentially different. The analysis of the same and difference of the Sino -Japanese economy is not only the academic hotspot that the theoretical world is concerned about, but also helps market players and policy makers to optimize long -term strategic choices.

From the entry of the empirical relationship between population structure and economic growth, China and Japan exist in the historical evolutionary stage: Japan in 1990 and China in 2020 in 2020, in terms of the static ratio and dynamic direction of the population structure, they are also high. With a long -term challenge of population aging. From the historical data of major global economies, including Japan, there is a non -linear correlation between the population structure and economic growth. The aging of the population structure will cause economic growth to slow down. However The characteristics of evolution, the ratio of labor to the elderly population has two important data barriers. When this proportion drops to about 7.5 and 4.8, the economic growth rate will move down twice. With the key indicators of China's population structure crossing these two data barriers in turn, China's economic slowdown will be a natural objective trend. Although the deceleration is irreversible, it is still available.

Japanese experience and global laws provide valuable reference experience for China's economic development. Only by continuously optimizing and deepening the reform and opening up through continuous resource allocation, can the Chinese economy avoid repeating Japan's economic risks that appear in similar stages (real estate bubbles, return on investment returns The rate is reduced, technological progress has declined), and the modernization of Chinese -style modernization is seeking high -quality development. From the perspective of the evolution of the internal and external situations and China's strategic choice, the long -term development of the economy has always been promising: First, there are more possibilities in China, regardless of market depth and breadth. The foundation; the third is to open yourself, and the deepening of reform and opening up will release considerable long -term momentum.

** The changes in the population structure of China -Japan population are similar **

Based on statistical analysis, we compare the similarities and differences between the changing cycle of the Chinese population structure and the changes in the Japanese population structure. First of all, from the perspective of the total fertility rate, from 1950 to 2020, China ’s total fertility rate was higher than Japan, especially from 1950 to 1985. In the 1990s, China ’s total fertility rate was basically around 2%, and Japan was 1.5%up and down. After entering 2020, China’ s total fertility rate was lower than Japan. In 2021, China ’s total fertility rate fell to 1.15, which was lower than that of the generation of generations with a total population of 2.1. The total fertility rate of Japan in 2021 was 1.30. In the long run, the total fertility rate of the mid-day and Japan in 2050 will be maintained at the level of 1.30-1.40 for a long time. The total fertility rate is lower than the 2.1 required for maintaining positive population growth, which means that the absolute value of the total population will gradually decrease. According to the UN forecast, China's total population will decrease by about 109 million to 1.3 billion in 2050, while the Japanese population will decline by nearly 30 million to 100 million.

Judging from the historical trajectory and future forecasts of the population structure, China has a high degree of similarity in the cycle of population structure from Japan from 1990-2020 in 2020-2050. Specifically, in 2020, China ’s 14-65-year-old labor population accounted for 68.6%, the population of over 65 years old accounted for 13.5%, and the population under the age of 14 accounted for 17.9%. This is basically consistent with Japan after 1990 (in 1991, Japan ’s 14-65-year-old labor population accounted for 69.8%, the population over 65 years old accounted for 12.9%, and the population under the age of 14 accounted for 17.3%). Comprehensive National Health and Health Commission and the "China Population Forecast Report 2023 Edition" prediction, from 2020 to 2050, the proportion of elderly people over 65 years old will climb to about 30%, and the proportion of labor population will decline to 60 %about. This is also the same as that the level of population structure since 1990-2020 (the elderly over 65 years old in Japan accounted for 29.5%of the total population in 2020 and 59%of the labor population).

We observed the impact of the changes in population structure on economic activities after Japan's inflection point in 1990: 1. The proportion of labor population has declined, and the rigid demand for housing to buy houses has declined. House prices in six major cities in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan in 1992, fell significantly by 15.5%. At the same time, the average national house price in Japan declined by 43.6%from 1992 to 2009; 2. Aging and suppressing capital accumulation, government bonds accounted for the rapid proportion of GDP, which led to a decrease in return on investment. The growth of aging and negative labor has led to the rapid decline in the savings rate of banks in Japan. Therefore, the Japanese government had to stimulate investment growth through the issue of government bonds. Due to the decrease in marginal remuneration in capital, the negative growth of labor force, the return on investment will be low year by year, and the economy will enter a long -term long -term entry. The period of low interest rates; 3. The birth rate declines to suppress innovation. Due to the highly positive proportion of the young population and innovation, Japan's fertility rate decreased significantly after 1990, and the reduction of innovative population, and the insufficient growth momentum of the entire factor led to long -term weakened labor productivity in Japan.

** A new round of labor population will pressure on China's economic growth. **More importantly, based on our analysis, the impact of the decline of labor and the population of the elderly has nonlinear characteristics on economic growth. With the further decline of labor to the elderly, the long -term growth rate of GDP will continue to move down. Specifically, we find that when the labor force and the population of the elderly fell to the level of 4.8 again, the economic growth range will go down again. Take Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan as an example. In 1992, the ratio of Japan's labor and the population of the elderly fell below 4.8. Since then, the economy has fallen into "20 years of loss". In 1992 to 2013, the average annual growth rate of Japan was only 0.84%. In 2017, South Korea ’s labor force to the elderly fell below 4.8, and the average annual economic growth rate of 2017-2022 (excluding the three years of the epidemic) fell to 2.5%. When the Chinese economy fell below the 7.5 labor/elderly population for the first time, the economic growth rate had shifted from high speed to mid -high speed. According to our estimates, the ratio of China's labor population to the elderly in 2021 may have fallen below 4.8.

If the law of changes in population structure and economic growth, the economic growth rate of China's economic growth in the future may usher in a slight shift of trend gravity. To be precise, the long-term level of China's economic growth in the next 10-15 years may be a new normal. In addition, the decline in the labor population will directly affect China's potential economic growth rate. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that in 2022, China ’s 16-59-year-old working age population was 87.556 million, accounting for 62.0%of the national population. Compared with 88.222 million in 2021, a decrease of 6.66 million people, which is equivalent to about -0.83%of the labor growth rate. Assuming that the elasticity of labor is 0.46 (our estimation), the labor element factor causes the potential growth rate to fall by about 0.38%. In the long run, as the labor population continues to decrease, labor elements may drag the average annual decrease of potential growth rates by about 0.88 percentage points (2023-2035).

** Economic deceleration is difficult to avoid.

From the perspective of the laws of economics and population science, the changes in population structure are experienced by any country, and the pressure brought by aging is similar, but different development paths, strategic selection and response models will bring very different macro fortunes Essence

The historical experience of the Japanese economy is worthy of attention and attracting it. However, from the selection of the difference between the difference between the resource endowment and the development path, the Chinese economy is expected to achieve quality increase during the deceleration process.

First of all, from the perspective of economic elements, China's post -development advantage is more obvious than that in Japan after the turn of the population (post -issuing does not mean an absolute advantage, but refers to the space and possibility of development). Specifically, compared with Japan, China has more possibilities in the market depth and breadth. From the perspective of the region, the degree of development of the Chinese market is largely differentiated. Although the structure of the labor force element in most regional regions is approaching, there is a significant difference in the development and accumulation of capital elements, land elements, data elements, and human capital elements in various regions. Therefore, compared with Japan, China has continued to develop more space for different regions through deepening factor reform.

Secondly, the savings rate is reduced to suppress the formation of capital, but it may not reduce the technological progress rate. The US savings rate has been lower than Japan for a long time, but in the world's major countries, the US technological progress rate has long maintained the world's first. This shows that the reduction in savings rate will curb the return on industrial or financial capital, but as long as the efficiency of human capital efficiency is improved, the return on investment returns can be hedge. Although China has passed the inflection point of the population, it is more fully prepared to achieve high -quality economic development, and the core foundation of future human capital innovation is the data element. According to our predictions, the scale of data owned by China in 2025 will account for 30%of the world's data circles, which means that China will become the world's number one economy in the world. The huge data scale will support China to form its own unique data -intensive industries, and the increasing characteristics of data capital scale compensation will further support China's potential economic growth.

Finally, there is still room for innovative talents to attract more innovative talents through reform.

Canada is still with [the most violent wildfire season ever](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230611-1403173)Fighting, but due to the tightness of the labor market and the difficulty of work, recruiting firefighters became more difficult.

Reuters survey in 13 provinces and regions in Canada showed that Canada hired about 5,500 wild firefighters. The data does not include the remote educating area (Yukon) that has not given feedback.

Canadian wildfire expert Mikeflannigan said the number was 2,500 less than the number of firefighters required by Canada. He pointed out that extinguishing forest fire is a difficult, high temperature and smoky work, and there may be a long -term impact on health. "It is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and retain talents."

Ontario has extended the application time of firefighters this year, strengthened the recruitment marketing efforts, and started to provide training subsidies to ensure that more manpower was recruited.

The number of firefighters in British Columbia and New Scovan Province has decreased. Alberta province had to conduct several rounds of fire recruitment to fill the manpower gap.

Canada ’s wildfire season is abnormal and fierce in advance this year, and 6.5 million hectares of land have been burned. Affected by climate change, wildfire will continue to burn, and the fire may be further expanded.

Limited resources make the fire extinguishing work difficult. All provinces and regions in Canada share firepower and equipment as needed, and ask international partners and military for help under extreme needs. However, this year's wildfire broke out in the east and west, which triggered competition against firefighters and fire -extinguishing helicopters in various places.

#### Work 12 to 14 hours a day

Firefighters participating in the fire extinguishing mission work for 12 to 14 hours a day. Each task is up to two weeks. The working environment is full of smoke, highly tension, and is usually in remote wilderness areas.

In addition, the salary of firefighters is also lacking competitive. Basic time of salary ranges from US $ 18 in Manitoba to $ 30 (about 18.4 to S $ 30.7) in British Columbia.

In order to deal with wildfire, the authorities have deployed about 550 armed forces personnel and more than 1,700 international firefighters. The relevant costs are paid by the provinces. With the continuous spread of wildfires and threatening the community, provincial institutions rely on the help of structural firefighters to protect their homes.

#### There are 90,000 volunteer firefighters

However, according to data from the Canadian Fire Director Association, 90,000 of Canadian 126,000 structural firefighters are volunteers. They must bear both the pressure of protecting their community and daily work.

In order to fill the manpower gaps, some provinces have called for additional fire extinguishers during the peak of the wild fire in May and June. 157 people in Alberta responded to the government's call; New Stockher sent the first team of fire extinguishing volunteers composed of 30 people last week; 300 volunteers and forestry workers were trained in Quebec. Service work.

The cost of additional manpower is not cheap. According to data from the federal government, in the past 10 years, the national wildfire protection costs have exceeded 1 billion Canadian dollars in the past 10 years; since 1970, the cost of protection for wildfire has increased by about 150 million Canadian dollars every ten years.

The Canadian government currently pays a cost of paying 38 million Canadian dollars for employment, training and retaining firefighters. It costs $ 256 million for equipment funds within five years. In addition, the authorities are also conducting a pilot project of a training structural firefighter.

McMalon, chairman of the Canadian Fire Director Association, said: "Men and women firefighters who fight for the wild fire are doing a huge job, but the fact is that the man is still nervous."

The United States and the United Kingdom have selected their adult elites very early, and their methods are to allow some 18 -year -old children to enter a famous university. Other children in this age are basically told: "Sorry, children, no hope in this life may not be admitted."

A small number of happy people comes from wealthy families properly. Many Ivy League(Ivy League)There are more students recruited by colleges and universities from the highest income family than 60%of the students recruited from 60%of their revenue. For a long time, these two countries have been annoyed by how to make the source of students. Many American liberals are worried that this month is expected to be further consolidated at some time this month, because the Supreme Court is expected to announce the illegal measures with racial consciousness in college admission.

Regardless of the court's decision, American universities have a way to make themselves more elite. They can learn from British Elite University. In the past few years, British universities have become more diverse in terms of class and race. This is feasible, but the premise is that you want to do this -and the United States may not want.

The pressure from the government makes Oxford University(Oxford)He and Cambridge University(Cambridge)Falling into an embarrassing situation, I have to reform the enrollment. (Yes, we must pay attention to Niu Jian, because they are the main channels for adult elites.) When I recently visited these two universities, I was shocked by many accents and changes. Niu Jian now mainly adopts "situation admission"(contextual admission)Including the use of algorithms to measure how unfavorable conditions are overcome when the applicant has reached its academic level. For example: Is your school private or public? How many proportion of students can get free school meals? Has your parents went to college?

Admissions instructor will give the applicant's ordinary secondary education certificate(GCSE)——The exams that British students took at the age of 16 -comparison with their classmates. It is more meaningful to get 7 A schools with average scores of 4 A. Getting 7 A in a school with an average score of 10 A. The smartest child in poor schools may be more than Eaton(Eton)The 50th students are smarter.

For those poor students who are annoyed by those who are distressed by the poverty -stricken students who are distressed by the poverty -stricken students who are concerned about their abilities and achievements. The interview became not so terrible. A mentor at Oxford University told me that if a smart worker class child was stuck in the interview, he would think: "I will not make you feel unsuitable here." In order to offset interview guidance accepted by private school students The advantages, Oxford University increasingly distributed the text they have never seen to applicants.

Niu Jian held countless summer schools and open days for poor students. The dean of an academy at Oxford University said that they visited at least once a day every day. Students from similar backgrounds lead students to visit. The information passed to the children is: "You belong to here."

This is very effective. Last year, among British undergraduates recruited by the University of Cambridge, public school students accounted for 72.5%of the record. From 2018 to 2022, more than one -seventh -born undergraduate from Oxford University from the UK, "Social Economic Vulnerable areas". 28%of Oxford students are identified as "black and few ethnic groups"; the number of women in undergraduates is slightly more than men. Scholars told me that disadvantaged students are more likely to encounter social or mental health problems, but they usually get good degrees. These universities did not relax their standards. On the contrary, they discovered more talents by expanding the talent pool.

Even if there is no equal rights measures, American elite universities can do this. First, they must abolish equal rights measures for white applicants. Duke University(Dukeunversity)Peter Asidiakno(Peter Arcidiacono)A study by the leader found that from 2009 to 2014(Harvard)Among the admitted white undergraduates, more than 43%are the athletes, children of alumni, and "people on the list of deans" (usually the relatives of the donor) or "children of the staff members". Otherwise, three -quarters will not be accepted. There is no such form of corruption in Britain. A person who has long been an admissions instructor for Oxford University told me that the admissions instructor has not encountered a donation as a bait for admission students for decades. Alumni of famous British schools do not expect their children to get preferential treatment.

The solutions for many American social issues are obvious, but they are not political in politics: gun control and negotiation with pharmaceuticals on drug prices. Similarly, as long as you are willing to accept more restrained donations (although the highest in the world), American elite universities can become less oligorate. Harvard University's $ 50.9 billion was donated by more than 6 times the total donation of the top universities in the UK.

Stanford University(Stanford)Martin Kanova from the School of Education(Martinsarny)Indicates that American universities may not change. Their business model depends on the funding of the rich, while the rich expects to be rewarded from it. He added: "The election system is the same. Once you let private funds enter public products, it becomes unfair."

Both countries have long been false elite rule. The United States intends to keep this state.

** Russia has experienced chaotic and dramatic episodes. In more than a day, Wagner's mercenaries launched a rebellion and marched towards Moscow, and then the rebellion ended unexpectedly. **

Let's briefly review what happened:

* On Friday (June 23), Wagner's leader Yofgeni Porigin (Porigen, Yevgeny Prigozhin) accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu, saying that he launched the Ukrainian war.

24 hours after chaotic, Moscow ushered in a new day. On Sunday, the military rebellion against Moscow had passed.

The BBC reporter interviewed on the streets of Moscow on Saturday. Several people said that they were not worried about the Wagner Group, although they were still on the way to Moscow.

A Moscow told the BBC that they "haven't seen any tanks yet, so we won't worry."

Another person said that in 1991, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and during the Constitutional crisis in 1993, they experienced tanks on the streets of Moscow, so "we will survive no matter what happens today."

A woman named Galina told Reuters that "this is not scared of this. I have confidence in our president and our people."

But another resident Nikolai said the incident was "fearful". He told Reuters, "This is very disturbing, and this is the case for you and your loved ones."

At present, the threat to entering Moscow has passed, but the safety situation is still tight. The order that residents stayed at home on Monday this Monday were still executed.

The Institute of War (ISW), located in Washington, said that the rebellion of Porigjin may have disappeared, but the Kremlin is now facing a "extremely unstable" situation.

ISW analysts wrote: "The rebellion exposed the weakness of the Russian security forces, showing that Putin was unable to use his troops to eliminate internal threats in time, and further eroded his monopoly on military forces."

This analysis also pointed out that the soldiers of the Wagner Group were warmly welcomed by the Rostov residents on the Rosteov on the River on the River.

Abdulle Abella Sulov(Abdujalil Abdurasulov)Report from Kiev, Ukraine

The negotiations continued for a whole day, and the result was that Porigo agreed to ease the situation that night.

Be Belarus President Lukashenko is a close ally of Putin. He talks with Pleigo on Saturday.

As a part of the transaction, Porigerin has been allowed to go to Belarus, and the Kremlin said he would revoke all his allegations to him.

Lukashenko's news office said the negotiation was under the consent of Putin.

As part of the agreement, the Kremlin agreed to revoke his prosecution against the leaders of the Wagner Group, and also provided security guarantees to the Wagner soldiers.

Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has been using Belarusian territory to attack Ukraine, which has effectively harmed Belarus's sovereignty.

The weakening of Putin's control of power has threatened Minsk's Lukashenko regime, which seriously depends on Moscow.

Putin News Secretary Dimitri Peskov said that Wagner's mercenaries can sign the Ministry of Defense Contract, and soldiers participating in the rebellion will not be prosecuted.

### Is this the ending of the Pryopin and Wagner Group?

A expert told Broadcasting Corporation that Porigerjin moved to Belarus, and the Wagner soldiers were absorbed to the Russian army, which may mean the end of this infamous mercenary organization.

Andrew D'Anieri, headquartered in the American Think Tank Atlantic Council, said the information from Russia was chaotic and unclear, and it was difficult to say what would happen in the end.

But he also said that Wagner's retreat did not mean that all private military companies in Russia were "out".

"Even if they are illegal in Russia in the strict sense, in the past year, we have seen the surge in such organizations."

### What can this Ukrainian war mean?

James Nixey, head of the Russian Eurasian project in the Chartham Institute, said Ukraine will benefit from the Russian crisis.

Nixi told BBC that Ukraine is likely to continue to "poke Russia" and try to make internal manufacturing in its domestic manufacturing.

He said that Putin was the worst day for President President for so many years.

"He was losing the war," Nixi said.

"This is not to say that Ukraine feels very easy to win ... But this is not what Putin expects after President's president for so many years."

The Kremlin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said the Wagner rebellion would not affect Russia's military offensive in Ukraine.

### Western allies in Ukraine close attention

The New York Times quoted people familiar with the matter and said US security officials received information as early as Wednesday, saying that Prittjin was preparing to take action.

What they care about most is how this will affect Moscow's control over its nuclear weapon library.

The US intelligence agencies have been paying close attention for several months, and the tension between Wagner's leaders and Russian Defense Secretary Shoshugogu and others has continued to intensify.

After this incredible 24 hours, the European Union, the United States, and allies are paying close attention to Russia.

The Pentagon issued a statement earlier, saying that the Minister of Defense Austin(Lloyd J.Austin)In the past few hours, the Minister of Defense from Canada, France, Germany, Poland, and Britain discussed this situation.

The statement said: "With the continued development of the situation, the United States will maintain close coordination with allies and partners."

Austin also said that the United States' support for Ukraine will not change.

At the same time, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau met with senior government officials on Saturday to discuss the situation where Russia was happening.

After the 
###  incident, Putin is no longer strong

Wagner's rebellion is a watershed, which is a very dangerous moment for Putin.

When you take power for so long, you will think that you cannot defeat, and you can survive in any case.

16 months ago, Putin launched a "special military operation" in Ukraine to "safer Russia."

But in recent months, the Kremlin has been attacked by drones, and western Russia has also been shelled.

And now the mercenaries launch an armed rebellion, marching to Moscow, demanding the withdrawal of the National Defense Minister appointed by Putin, and then they decided to retreat.

This is a surprising 24 -hour. In these 24 hours, Putin faced the biggest challenge to its authority since he came to power more than 20 years ago.

The mutiny was over -after reaching an agreement after the Kremlin and Wagner's mercenary group. The Wagner soldiers can return to the base and will not be prosecuted, but their leader Pleigo must leave Russia and move to Belarus.

As for President Putin, after this incident, he was no longer strong.

See what happened in Rostov -Wagner, a private army has been able to obviously easily seize the control of military facilities in a major city in Russia, and then advance north to Moscow.

As a person behind the rebellion, Porigo can still retreat. Although he tried to overthrow Russia's military leadership, allegations against his armed rebellion had been revoked.

### potential influence far beyond Russia and Ukraine

_ Joe Inwood _

_BBC reporter, once reported that Ukraine and African affairs_

Porigo may have retreated from the edge of the cliff, but the incident in the past 24 hours will fundamentally change his relationship with the President of Russia.

Pricigo has been known as the "Putin chef" for the catering industry. For many years, he and his Wagner's mercenaries have played a key role in Russia's foreign policy, although it is hidden.

In Putin's unable to publicize or unwilling to do publicly, Wagner was used to conduct military intervention.

For example, supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad and trying to interfere with the 2016 US elections on the Internet, Wagner has played an increasingly important role in some of the most chaotic places in the world.

But the place where the mercenary footprint is the most is Africa.

For example, in Mali, a coup in 2020 and 2021 witnessed the establishment of a military power, and Wagner participated in a large number of long -term Islamic rebellions. Although they thought they were there under the instructions of the Russian government, Wagner was really going to the local area.

In the Central and African Republic, it is said that they are helping the government, resisting the rebels, and defending the capital. Wagner is accused of having an invasion of human rights.

Given Vagna's may now seem to be excluded by the Kremlin, what will their soldiers in Africa and their government support?

In addition, Wagner also controls a large number of mineral resources, which is the source of most wealth of the organization.

Since Progojin has fallen out of favor, can he still maintain control of these resources?

He said, "This is not a military coup, but a march in justice."

However, the Russian Ministry of Defense denied the statement of attacking the Wagner Camp and emphasized that the Russian army had been busy fighting against the Ukraine.

Wang Mo's father confirmed this Sunday that the National Security Police came to the door on the same day, and Wang Mo was currently detained by the authorities for 10 days.

_The author of this article is a scientific commentator_

Eggs are equal to embryo. It is difficult to imagine what other rules in biology are more basic than this. However, now we must rethink this rule. Last week, at a stem cell meeting held in Massachusetts, researchers revealed that they did not use eggs nor sperm, creating "synthetic" human embryos. These structures, more accurately, are embryo models, which are cultivated from a single alive cells separated from real human embryos. Coincidentally: Another researcher team created a heartbeat embryo model.

These seemingly major breakthroughs -have not been published in journals that have been reviewed by peer -aim to understand infertility, miscarriage and birth defects. But they also caused moral and legal concerns. The scientific community, as well as a wider society, now need to consider the artificial embryo trained by these laboratories -essentially how close to the real human embryo. Putting public discussions, coupled with updating regulations and considering how to commercialize such research, it will encourage the public to support the transformation of valuable research that may be transformed into treatment methods.

About one -fifth of pregnancy ended in abortion. However, it is surprising that the scientific community knows very little about the reasons, partly because it is difficult to study embryos in the body. Another choice is to study the development of embryos in the laboratory, including the remaining embryos donated by patients with external fertilized patients. In the study, the use of human embryo is subject to strict legal constraints, which are based on the timetable of embryo development.

After completing the fertilization, the fertilized eggs will be split for about 4 days, and then contracted into blastocyst. After that, the blastocyst was bed in the uterus, which marked the beginning of pregnancy. On the 14th day, the embryo experienced "the formation of the original bowel". At this time, the prototype of the body began to form, and different cell lines appeared. One of the characteristics is "primitive stripes", which occurs when symmetrically developed on both sides.

Generally speaking, in the United Kingdom and many other countries, the cultivation of human embryo cannot be cultivated for more than 14 days. This means that what happened after -, including how embryos organize themselves into different types of organizations -the exact scientific details of the other types are still a mystery. Researchers can cultivate more longer for animal embryos, but have limited correlation.

This is the martial arts place of "embryo model based on stem cells". At the same time at Cambridge University, England(Cambridge)And California Institute of Technology(California Institute of Technology)Magdalina Kernezka Gez(Magdalena Żernicka-Goetz)A research team led by the professor is separated from human embryo to an embryonic stem cells, and induced the proliferation cells to be self -assembled into an embryo -like structure. The development time has just exceeded 14 days. Jernitz Katz and two other authors were designated as a inventor of a related patent;(Weizmann Institute of Science)Jacob Hannah(Jacob Hanna)Another research team of the leader published a pre -printed book of similar results on the same day.

Gordon Institute of Cambridge University(Randonstititite)A competitive team said in describing the unpublished research results that they had cultivated a synthetic embryo that could detect heartbeat, although it was deliberately designed as a lack of organizations that are crucial to further development.

Why is this heavy? In many countries, synthetic embryos do not conform to the formal definition of embryos (although the use of embryo stem cells is still regulated), but is considered to be more similar to human tissue that is more similar to laboratory culture, and is more loose supervision. However, the pursuit of biological authenticity has formed a "22nd military regulations"(catch-22)Format contradiction: The more similar to human embryos, the more useful it is -but it is more ethically a problem.

Synthetic embryos can also be made with re -coded adult stem cells, which avoids some restrictions. However, no matter what kind of technology is used, the current speed of science has surpassed our supervision ability -worry about what an unbridled scientist may make is not unreasonable.

British law prohibits the use of synthetic embryos to make babies, but researchers have tested relevant principles on animals. Chinese scientists have implanted monkey embryo models into female monkeys, although these pregnancy will soon abortion. Such pregnancy may be destined to fail; or, or technological progress may make them feasible.

If it is the latter, scientists must be vigilant -self -supervision does not prevent Chinese gene editing human babies. As the center of this new study, the University of Cambridge is inquiring about the wisely governance framework, but the problem of synthetic embryos is not just a problem on campus. As long as we can avoid harm, this exciting research on miscarriage can bring many scientific benefits and human happiness.

The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed this Sunday that the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier "Ronald Reagan" visited the central city of the city in the middle of the city and will stay until June 30.

The Hong Kong is upgraded and expanded by the United States during the Vietnam War, and is currently authorized by the Vietnamese government to use. This is the third time that the US aircraft carrier visited the port since the end of the Vietnam War. In 2020, the U.S. "Roseford" aircraft carrier also visited Pangang to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese Navy had previously held joint military exercises with the "Reagan" aircraft carrier and other U.S. ships in the South China Sea and received Japan's largest destroyer "Into".

The outside world noticed that a training ship of the Chinese Navy also visited Vietnam Port Last month as part of "friendly visits" for Thailand, Brunei and the Philippines. However, the "Reagan" is on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the 10th anniversary of the 10th anniversary of the Sino -Vietnamese sovereign dispute and the 10th anniversary of the "comprehensive partnership" of the United States and Vietnam.

Earlier this month, Vietnam protested to Beijing, demanding that the Chinese scientific science ship, maritime police ship and fishing boats who stayed in the exclusive economic waters of Vietnam left the relevant South China Sea waters. The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously stated that the visit of the "Reagan" was a normal friendly exchange activity, which reflected the common commitment of all parties to promote regional peace, stability, cooperation and development.

American Intelligence Officer reported to the military and senior government officials on Wednesday (June 21), and Russian mercenary organization [Wagner head of Perigo](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230624-1407486)He is preparing to take military operations against senior national defense officials.

The New York Times quoted anonymous informed officials on Saturday (24th) that American intelligence had mastered the signs of Pryigor's planning a few days ago, and worked hard to refine the relevant materials into a complete assessment report.

It is reported that this shows that the United States knows the upcoming incidents of Russia, and the situation is similar to the end of 2021. The US intelligence agency warned that Russian President Putin plans to attack Ukraine.

However, the report also pointed out that unlike 2021, the United States decoded and released intelligence at that time to try to prevent Putin's operations. This time, the US intelligence agency remained silent about Porigen's plan. U.S. officials believe that if the United States says, Putin will blame the United States for planning a coup; and they have no interest in helping Putin's split in an embarrassing split.

The New York Times said it was unclear when the United States began to learn about Purigen's plan. Officials familiar with the situation revealed that American intelligence officials made a briefing to government and national defense officials on Wednesday; after further confirmation of the plan, intelligence officials informed the situation to a small number of Congress leaders on Thursday (22nd).

It is reported that in recent months, US intelligence officials have tracked the increasing hostility between Pricigen and the leaders of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and spent a lot of time analyzing it. The conclusion is that this is an obvious sign of the tension of Russia caused by the Ukrainian war. It is the product of Russia's efforts to provide sufficient supply for its troops.

U.S. officials believe that the confrontation with the Russian Ministry of Defense is true, not a political show, and the huge casualties that Russia suffered in Bachmut is the promotion factor. Porigon has not dealt with Moscow's senior management for a long time, but the United States has only held preliminary warnings that he might take action in recent days.

In addition, the report said that the U.S. intelligence agencies may not know what the Poligon movement may have, but they immediately worry that this may affect the control of Russian nuclear weapons.

The report pointed out that [Pricigen launched a mutiny](https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230625-1407570)Later, US officials have been cautious and rarely published comments. On the one hand, it is because the situation is progressing rapidly, and on the other hand, it is also because he does not want to give Putin's excuse to blame the liability for the west. However, some US officials say they can expect that Putin will eventually say that a mutiny is a conspiracy for Western planning.

The Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov revealed the most important principles between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The purpose is to end the rebellion of the Wagner Group's leader through the reconciliation process.

On the morning of June 24th, the Russian Wagner Force Commander Yavigani Porigerjin announced that his troops controlled the military facilities of the Rostov region (southern) and threatened to go to the capital Moscow. Although Putin issued a warning and promised to respond severely to "betrayal", the column did move towards there.

On the evening of the 24th, Priego announced the mediation by President Belarus. He ordered his troops to return to the camp, and the city of Rostov did say that the Wagner soldiers began to withdraw from the city.

Russian RT Channel quoted Peskov's call statement, which revealed many points contained in the agreement, the most prominent of which is:

* Wagner soldiers who initially refused to participate in the "Battle" of Porigzin will have the opportunity to join the Russian armed forces and sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense. * They will not be prosecuted by any law. * Wagner's troops return to the camp. * Unwilling to return to the headquarters and parts of the camp signed an agreement with the Russian Ministry of Defense. * End criminal allegations against Porigo, and then he will go to Belarus.

Peskov explained that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko agreed to mediate in the solution and pointed out that the mediation was "the personal initiative of the Belarusian President."

A spokesman for the Kremlin confirmed that what happened on the 24th (Saturday) would never affect the process of the so -called Ukraine's "special military operation" in Moscow, which has been ongoing since February 2022. He also emphasized that according to him, the Russian army continued to successfully repel Ukraine's counterattack.

#### What happened next?

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-25T13-09-00/52-1687697738.jpg)Despite being attacked near Volne, the Wagner Force did not seem to encounter too much resistance to Moscow.

By Saturday, the 24th, Wagner's founder and leader Yfgeni Porigin and his troops left Rostov less than 24 hours after the rebellion started.

The Kremlin confirmed that the Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed with the mediation of the Belarusian President, ending the rebellion that constituted Putin's biggest challenge to Putin since he came to power in 1999.

Russian President spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know that President Vladimir Putin had changed his confidence in the Secretary of Defense Sherge Shoigugu, and denied that the negotiations with Porigerza include discussions The issue of firing officials of the Russian Ministry of Defense.

The rapid advancement of Wagner's troops to Moscow and the lack of resistance of the Russian army caused people to question Putin's control of power.

#### Back to the camp

The Russian website released a photo of Priegojin's departure from the Southern Military Region headquarters of Rostov, and his soldiers controlled the location on Saturday morning.

The International Telecommunications Agency confirmed that the Wagner and all its institutions have completely evacuated the Southern Military Region headquarters of Rostov near Rostov near Donetzk (eastern Ukraine).

The Wagner soldiers penetrated from Rostov from the Donetsk area and fought against the Ukrainian army in the front line.

A reporter from the Peninsula reported that after the Wagner forces withdrew from Rostov, life began to return to normal.

On the other hand, Governor of Volneri announced that the Wagner Group forces have withdrawn from the area normally and nothing happens.

According to a Russian website, 5,000 soldiers from Wagner are on the way to Moscow, and Porigo announced that his troops would stop and let them return to their original positions.

Wagner's troops controlled the military facilities of Rostov and Volne, and Rostov was Russia's operation center in Ukraine. Although it was hit near Volne, it seemed to have not encountered too much resistance to Moscow.

Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

In addition to achieving external equity financing, listing is usually considered to be an important way to become a public company, fulfill the obligation to disclose information, transparent the company's decision -making process, standardize corporate governance, Maybe many readers have not noticed that although they are not listed, Taikang Insurance has done it in corporate governance specifications, even more than some listed companies. Founded in 1996, Taikang Insurance was a large financial insurance service group covering three core business of insurance, asset management, and medical care. In the 2022 Fortune World Fortune 500 rankings, Taikang Insurance ranked 346th with a operating income of US $ 40.608 billion.

On June 19th, as an independent director of Taikang assets, I went to Taikang's home with other independent directors and foreign supervisors to investigate the House of Taikang and Taikang. Mr. Fan Kuijie, an external supervisor, was the witness of the founding process of Taikang. He shared a lot of first -hand stories to provide us with rare information for us to understand the unique governance culture of Taikang Insurance.

So, how does Taikang Insurance that is not listed regulate corporate governance?

First, although it is not listed, the shareholders' meeting, the board of directors, the board of supervisors, and the independent directors system have generally proved that the effective modern corporate governance system is introduced by mature market economy countries, which is indispensable.

The very important gene in the corporate culture of Taikang Insurance is learning. In the words of Mr. Chen Dongsheng, "innovation is the first to imitate." In view of the lack of the operation experience of the board of directors in China at that time, Mr. Chen advocated the practice of borrowing and learning the board of directors of international first -class enterprises, and took the initiative to invite some international capital to invest in Taikang Insurance and appoint directors. At present, Taikang Insurance has a total of 22 shareholders. In addition to Chinese shareholders such as Jiade Investment Holding Co., Ltd. and Beijing Wuhong Joint Investment Co., Ltd., as well as foreign shareholders such as New Deal Tida Investment Co., Ltd. Equity structure. Among them, Jiade Investment Holding Co., Ltd., Beijing Wuhong Joint Investment Co., Ltd. and Xinzhida Investment Co., Ltd. are the top three shareholders, holding 23.77 %, 11.39 %, and 10.99 % respectively.

Four years after its establishment, in 2000, Taikang Insurance was invited to serve as independent directors, so that some leaders of international accounting institutions such as KPMA participated in the governance of the board of directors and strengthened the company's audit and internal control.

Second, the respect of the board of directors as the core of corporate governance is reflected in all aspects, from the design details of the board of directors, to the governance culture reflected in the governance structure museum.

In mature market economies such as Britain and the United States, the board of directors of shareholders and management teams connected to the funding not only represents the shareholders' supervision and management team, but also through internal division of labor to reasonably check the balance and complete the change of the board of directors and performance evaluation. The organization of the board of directors is essential for maintaining the stable operation of the enterprise, and the board of directors has become the core of corporate governance.

The respect for boards as the core of corporate governance is often a concentrated manifestation of a corporate governance culture. So, how does Taikang Insurance respect the respect of the board of directors as the core of corporate governance?

During the investigation at Taikang Training Institute, in addition to visiting enterprises such as Ali and other companies to show the unique culture of the company's unique culture, the visual shocking 3D image and the new crown epidemic were donated by the staff of the love pictures made by the staff of Wuhan Hospital when they left. I am particularly surprised that Taikang Insurance has established a museum governance structure to collect various original materials and archives that founded Taikang Insurance and the establishment of corporate governance structures that year. As a scholar of researching the company, this is the first time that I have seen a museum named after governance structure, although I have not verified whether this is the first. The various display of the museum announced the adherence of Taikang Insurance for the spirit of the contract. At the same time, the generations of the generations who visited the generations strongly felt that the entrepreneurial team led by Mr. Chen Dongsheng was difficult and difficult for the entrepreneurial team.

The next door of the Museum of Governance Structure is the meeting room of the board of directors of Taikang Insurance and the Manager's Office of Manager. The board of directors of Taikang Insurance can be described as typical of the board culture of the board of directors. On the wall to the north of the conference room, a oil painting describing the Red Army's Long March encouraged each other during the Long March of the Red Army. On the wall south of the conference room, like the usual practice of large international companies, it is posted with large avatar photos of the current directors and supervisors to show respect for the existing directors and supervisors.

Interestingly, the board of directors of the board of directors constitutes a wall of 9 meters high, which is three times the height of the door height of the office meeting room of the opposite manager. The management team's sense of respect for the core of the board of directors jumped on the paper.

And these are not the most shocking. The most shocking thing is that in the board of directors, the lobby merchants that were not open to the public displayed photos of previous Taikang Insurance Director and Supervisor, and photos of outstanding employees from Samsung to five -star honor in Taikang Insurance. Similar to the Lingyan Pavilion, which is similar to the 24 viaers in the Tang Dynasty, it has become the honorary hall of Taikang Insurance, which records the outstanding executives and employees who have contributed to Taikang Insurance. One day, you can post your photos in this lobby will become the direction of many Taikang employees for life. This is the special governance culture of Taikang Insurance.

Third, the reason why the board of directors won management was because of major decisions in Taikang Insurance, which can always hear different voices from the directors, making related decisions more scientific and feasible.

It is worth mentioning that Taikang Insurance, which is not listed, also hired an independent director with a low proportion. Independent directors from outside, part -time, and reputation played a very unique and important role in the decision -making process of Taikang Insurance's board of directors. Let's start with the first stop of the investigation that day. Taikang House is a new attempt for Taikang Insurance to enter the medical and nutrition industry from Life Insurance. In the process of project demonstration, although a large number of investigations and interviews were conducted in the early stage, some directors were opposed by some directors in several boards. One of the strongest opposition is an independent director. Although after the after -in -law, in the strategic decision of Taikang's entry into the medical and care industry, the suggestions given by the independent directors at that time may not be correct, but his negative opinions undoubtedly reminded the board of directors to think about where the future breakthrough is going on in the future. In the end, Taikang Insurance has laid a solid foundation for the leading enterprise to formulate industry standards for the medical care industry today.

We can see that Taikang Insurance is more passively hired by independent directors in order to meet the requirements of regulatory (in fact, it is what happened in recent years for non -bank financial institutions to regulate company governance by hiring independent directors. The first independent director introduced by the agency) is to fully draw on the successful experience of international governance norms, actively absorb and accept the reasonable elements of it, and boldly use it for me. In Mr. Chen Dongsheng's words, it is "to stand at a height of 10,000 meters to see the world, and to observe the world in time and space for 100 years, so that there can ,farther".

These may be the mystery of non -listed Taikang Insurance Standards.

Last year, China's population had a negative growth, and the global population would fall from 2040-2060, and the earth may become empty. In order to improve the fertility rate, various countries have also racked their brains. Unfortunately, they have little effect. This is because the most factors affecting the fertility rate are the changes in women's work opportunities and concepts brought by urbanization. In the end, the fertility rates of various countries tend to be a low level. The trap (Brickerand IBBITSON, 2019). In addition, there are some neglected social forces. Similarly, some more effective solutions are facing general opposition.

** Soap opera is comparable to contraceptives **

Just as everyone was worried about China ’s fertility rate was significantly lower than Japan, Professor Li Wenjie of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology proposed a novel idea. He said that as long as you shoot more TV series, the husband and wife who do not have children in the play are miserable when they are old when they are old when they are old. , Can increase fertility rate. But I am afraid that Professor Li is contrary to his wishes. The most common plot of family dramas in the Mainland and Hong Kong family is the contradictions and filial piety brought by the children in the family. They are also miserable in their parents.

Everyone said that high house prices are the best contraceptives, but few people notice that TVs are also the best contraceptives. Various TV programs occupy a lot of women's time, which has changed their concepts and reduced their willingness to fertility. Brazil was once a country with a high fertility rate, but 72%of the heroine in Brazilian TV networks has no children. These soap operas are even more popular than football games. Studies have found that the TV network is in one area, and The subsequent fertility rate in this area decreased (LaFerrara Et Al., 2012). After more than ten years, Brazil has less than 3 million newborn children.

Similar things also happened in Germany. At that time, West Germany sent TV shows to East Germany. The main purpose was to show the richer and more beautiful capitalism and shake the East German regime. However Drama, more than half of the families have no children. Due to the geographical impact, some areas of Dongde cannot receive signals and cannot be seen. As a result, the fertility rate in these areas has not changed, and the fertility rate that can be watched has decrease , 2022).

The United States once launched the sixth season reality show "16 -year -old pregnancy", telling the various problems encountered by the girl's accidental pregnancy. The effect of the results naturally reduces the fertility rate of the girl, but fortunately, this is consistent with the purpose of the reality show.(Kearney And Levine,2015)Essence

In recent years, women's characters in TV series with high ratings have been as basic as women. Family dramas must have high costs, school district houses, difficult to go to school, and counseling these plots. The purpose of these TV series may not exacerbate social anxiety, but it has caused a decline in marriage rate and fertility.

** The "overflow effect" of the family planning policy ** **

The biggest problem with the problem of fertility is that as long as some people decide to be less, it will affect the fertility willingness of colleagues and friends around them. On the one hand, because people are social animals, they have mutual imitation, follow social norms, and do not make alternative habits; Families who want to have many life will worry that after the resources are scattered, the children will not be able to compete with their children. For example, Chinese ethnic minorities are not restricted by family planning policies, but their fertility rates have also decreased, and they are more culturally closer to the Han ethnic minorities (Rossiand Xiao (2020). In other words, the family planning policy has produced "overflow effects" and "unpredictable consequences".

As far as I see, there are many research on the reduction of fertility in TV series, and there is no one that increases fertility. Of course, you can try to make some soap dramas or reality shows to show the successful women with two or three babys, or to shoot some happy reality shows of the happy family. This may be more effective than the plot designed by Professor Li.

** The population problem is not heavy, but in the structure **

In many people's eyes, now life is too stressful, people and people are too fierce, and population reduction is a good thing. Environmentalists also hope that the population will reduce the burden on the earth and the atmosphere. In fact, even Liang Jianzhang, chairman of Ctrip and Peking University professor of Peking University, who strongly urged the country to vigorously subsidize young people, has repeatedly recognized that there are too many Chinese population. The key to population problems is not the total amount, but in the structure, there are too many elderly people, too few young people, and pensions become a big problem. Such a social structure is difficult to have scientific and technological innovation, and investment will continue to decline. Growth trap.

It is a pity that many countries use household subsidies and tax reduction to improve fertility rates. Even if some developed countries generally accept "unmarried fertility" and "mothers earn money to support their families, dads bring their baby at home", the fertility rate is just the fertility rate. Slightly picked up.

In response to the impact of the reduction in the economy, some methods have been in effect silently. For example, the state and families increase the investment in education, increase the average human capital, and bring the "engineer dividends". Older generation. Another example is that the time for raising children is reduced, and parents' labor time increases.

** The way of being opposed **

There are some methods of disputes and resistance, such as gradually extending the age of retirement and introducing immigration, but this is a global trend after all. China's retirement age is still formulated in 1978. From the global perspective, China's retirement age is too early. The same attitude towards immigrants is the same. Before the epidemic, many countries began to plan ahead and absorb immigrants. After the epidemic, even the countries that opposed immigrants in the past became positive.

In response to the reduction of the labor population, the most common approach of various countries is to increase the introduction of automation and robots.(Abeliansky and Prettner,2023)Essence Countries with lower fertility rates, such as South Korea, Singapore, Germany, Japan, and the United States, the more active in this point. Although the mainland of China has increased its strength, there are only 246 robots per 10,000 people, less than 932 in South Korea, Singapore's in Singapore, Singapore, Singapore 605 are also less than Hong Kong and Taiwan, China.

The most surprising thing is that experts such as Liang Jianzhang and Yi Fuxian are very opposed to the introduction of robots to cope with the reduction of population. The reason is that the robot does not consume, so it cannot drive economic growth. This view has been accepted by many people, but in fact it is a mess. They envision is a completely closed economy, but in an open economy, countries use robotics to produce, and if there is trade interoperability, the economy will increase, and per capita wealth and consumption will increase. In order to avoid wealth concentrated in robotic manufacturers, the state can encourage individuals to invest in robots or distribute and adjust through taxation.

Moreover, the new generation of robots are different from the past, and the design has increased the cooperation with manpower, so that it will not simply replace manpower and cause social contradictions. Studies have found that after the introduction of robots in Europe in the past ten years, more new products and new work have been created, and the employment rate has increased(Gregory,Salomons and Zierahn, 2022)Essence

The emergence of AIGC and ChatGPT has made many people worry about losing their jobs. The next generation is facing difficulties and opposing sounds.Let's imagine the future, the invention of contraceptives and condoms has greatly reduced fertility. If the population is too serious in the future, some experts suggest that legislative stipulates that young people can get contraceptive tools only after two children are born, similar(Shi Yongqing, 2021)Essence Many people strongly oppose this idea for the first time, but it is not unreasonable to think about it. If the problem of the continuation of human races is so bad to such a point, it is possible to prohibit the production of contraceptive tools. Such legislation restrictions, if they cooperate with the preferential subsidy policies of multiple children, can reduce social resistance and encourage the effect of fertility.

However, in the future world I conceive, robots and humans can reach a reasonable proportion. The abundance of material will greatly increase people's value, and the cost of raising will be significantly reduced. There is no need to legislate to restrict contraceptive tools, and everyone is willing to have two or more children. The similar environment has appeared many times in history. Don't forget that human genes are selfish. After the burden is reduced, they are naturally willing to copy or even sacrifice themselves to complete the continuation of genes.

In terms of trade and investment policies, the EU is on the United States. On June 20, the European Commission announced the economic security strategy. The discussion document stated that the geopolitical conflicts of the epidemic, the Russian and Ukraine War, the hostile economic action, the network and infrastructure attack, the geopolitical conflict of foreign interference and false information and the intensive exposure of the risks and fragility in our society, economy, and enterprises were exposed. The document pointed out that the European Union is not the only area where the challenges in response to economic security, regardless of developed countries and developing countries, have entered this trend.

**trend**

Speaking of the trend, a study by the Chinese issue research institution Merics has compared the changes in economic security policies in the European Union, the United States, Japan, China and other countries. Studies have stated that traditional economic security policies are defensive and deal with trade and investment that threatens national security, such as weapons exports. The current development situation is a policy of turning offensive, and combined with economic security and toughness, not only does it not allow themselves to expose to security risks, but also ensure that its economy can resist impact and the weapons of third countries. From 2017 to 2022, some countries have strengthened defensive and offensive economic security policies. The defensive policies since 2017 include foreign direct investment review, export control, network security and data protection, while offensive policies include sanctions and supply chain toughness. The decline in economic security policies in the later period mainly focuses on how to enhance toughness. The development trend in 2023 includes the institutionalization of further strengthening the toughness of supply chain, how to prevent and cope with economic coercion, foreign investment review, and economic security plans.

The European Union is not incorporated into the economic policy with this strategic document forecast. The EU has actually carried out a series of related legislation and has also taken some corresponding actions.

Strategic documents point out that the EU's economic security risks include four aspects: supply chain, key infrastructure, technical security and technical leakage risks, economic coercion. It also pointed out that risks in these fields may threaten national security under certain circumstances, such as dual -use technology leakage. In terms of positioning supply chain tough risk, the European Union upgraded its industrial strategy in 2021 and conducted the first round of in -depth review of the strategic dependence of six strategic fields including raw materials and semiconductors. In 2022, the European Commission conducted a second in -depth evaluation of five fields including rare earth and magnesium, magnesium, solar photovoltaic board, and network security. In terms of response measures, the European Union is recently carried out a series of legislation, such as the "Key Raw Materials Law", "European Chip Law", and "Net Zero Industry Law". s hard work.

The European Union is also upgrading its own economic security tools. In early June, the EU Parliament and the EU Council reached a final political agreement on counter -stress measures. In terms of foreign direct investment review mechanisms, according to the European Commission, since October 2020, the European Commission and member states have reviewed more than 1,000 FDI transactions. The European Commission will submit the amendments to the review mechanism at the end of 2023 Essence In the 5G in the infrastructure, in 2020, the European Union issued a 5G network security toolbox. One of the functions of the toolbox was that member states identified high -risk suppliers and then prohibited or restricted the supplier entering its 5G network. In June of this year, the European Union released a second report from a member country to use the toolbox. The report shows that 10 of the 27 member states have obliged to restrict or prohibit high -risk suppliers from entering their 5G networks for their mobile network operators. The European Commission's internal market commissioner Bretton expressed concerns about the unsatisfactory use of the toolbox, saying that it would have a dependence on high -risk suppliers and brought huge security risks to the EU. He demanded that a member of the high -risk supplier has not completely used the tool to speed up the actions.

In other words, the European Union has entered the trend of economic and security mutual interconnection, and the European Commission wants to accelerate this trend through this strategic initiative. Strategic documents say that the trend shows that only by using new measures to make up the traditional national security route to ensure our economic security can the EU's prosperity, sovereignty and security.

** Refers **

Like some other documents and policies in the European Union, "not mentioned China, but point to China" also exists in this economic security strategy.

Visteig, Executive Vice Chairman and Competitive Affairs Commissioner of the European Commission, described this, "The threat of economic security may change with time. She also admits that the EU will use geopolitical filterration methods in risk assessment, and the treatment of the supply of system opponents and dependence on the alliance are different.

The strategic documents did not mention China directly, but the EU's relevant legislation and policies were all related to China. The European Commission concluded in the second in -depth review of strategic dependence in 2022. The European Union has possible strategic dependence on rare earth, magnesium and solar photovoltaic boards, because the production of these fields is highly concentrated in a certain country in a certain country That is, China, whether in the European Union or outside the European Union, the European Union faces severe supply risks because it is difficult to achieve diversification of supply. The use report of the 5G network security toolbox released by the European Union in June this year shows that 10 member states demand that its mobile network operators restrict or prohibit high -risk suppliers from entering its 5G network. Among them, a member state has decided to exclude Huawei and ZTE in the Outside 5G networks. The intention partner G7 of the economic security strategic documents, which jointly issued a statement of economic toughness and economic security during the summit in May this year, let alone the statement referred to.

Merics researchers Gefang believes that even if the economic security policy indirectly points to China, the European Union is committed to clarifying that the policy is not related to China, and the focus of economic security policies is avoided in China, thereby avoiding the deterioration of relations with China. She pointed out that the European Union really adopted the economic security policy that it does not target the specific country. Its priority is not to defend or curb China, but to protect the EU's economic security. The EU's economic security awakening is not based on China, but because of Russia. However, Goffran also pointed out that the strategy is also about China, because China does constitute risks in the European Union's common understanding of national security, fair competition environment and common understanding of rules.

**obstacle**

The European Commission intends to provide a framework and a comprehensive strategic route for existing and some legal and policies, and also provide a foundation for the discussion of economic security for member states. Doubt and concerns of trade advocates and member states.At the upcoming EU summit at the end of June, the economic security strategy proposal and relations with China are above the agenda. As for what form the strategy will be implemented and what extent will be implemented, it is unknown.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-25T14-12-32-00-00/000185538_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

What are the links between the property market bubble and the growth of foreign trade? The author believes that the overdraft consumption of the property market has increased China's economy's dependence on exports.

It is believed that the growth of foreign trade is obviously not a lot of good, especially when the export structure cannot be improved, such as the increase in the proportion of high -tech products. For the high growth of China's foreign trade in history, many people in the market and society believe that the environmental problems and resource consumption in China in the past are also caused by excessive exports, especially a large number of exports Ordinary products that cannot reflect the cost of all factors such as environmental and resources -but when the global value chain is in an unfavorable position, the exporting country can only get a small amount of benefits; if it continues to be at the bottom of the "smile curve" of the international value chain It will accumulate the cost of external society to deteriorating.

** The crisis in the middle of 2008 caused China's growth to lead the carriage exports and moved. **

As one of the three carriages, exports are considered to be the leading driving force for China's economic growth -the speed leader among the three carriages is normal. From the perspective of export growth and nominal economic growth rate, after the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s until the global crisis in 2008, export growth exceeding the nominal economic growth was normal. After the global financial crisis in 2008, although China's exports have basically continued the high growth trend, compared with the position of China's nominal economic growth position, the two quietly changed their positions, from the original exports higher than the economy, to the nominal economy, and the nominal economy The operation combination pattern of the growth rate of upward and export growth below. Obviously, the financial crisis has affected the demand for overseas. The evolution of China's economic growth pattern. In fact, as early as 2008, after the global financial crisis in 2008, it began to gradually shift to the pattern of domestic demand.

After the global financial crisis in 2008, in the case of no longer leading exports, the maintenance of China's high -speed growth trend has shifted to infrastructure investment and real estate. As the overseas financial crisis began in the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, the Chinese macro department was very vigilant about the bubble of the property market, and in 2014, it began to implement "dual -limit" measures for purchase restrictions and loans. Infrastructure investment, such as railway, highways, airports and other large -scale projects such as "Iron Public". Over time, in particular, the debt capacity of the main government's government investment and operation institutions has risen, and infrastructure investment has begun to show signs of weak growth. Therefore, after 2016, the real estate industry investment re -received investment relay sticks, becoming the main force of fixed asset investment growth. From the perspective of the growth of the three carriages, after the financial crisis in 2008, investment, as the first driving force for China's economic growth, has no need to understand the inherent mechanism behind it. Investment in the leading growth of the three carriages is enough Let all parties know.

** The 2019 epidemic causes China's growth leader to return to exports **

After 2015, in 2019 before the epidemic, the contribution of foreign demand to China's economic growth was less than domestic demand. The growth rate of consumption and investment in the three carriage exceeded the export. The location has been quietly allowed to be located in consumption. Even if the "dual -limit" of the property market has been removed and real estate investment has received investment relay sticks, the growth rate of investment in the growth rate of fixed asset investment in the whole society still transitions from leading consumption to slower consumption than consumption. Essence After 2014, the Chinese economy began to enter the "bottom lingering" stage -the Western world still has not emerged in the shadow of crisis, so it is difficult to expand foreign demand, and domestic demand investment has maintained high growth. The "sloping" after the quick -shift is weak. From 2015-2019, China's economic domestic demand power and consumption leading investment, this situation directly leads to policies and market expectations that drive economic growth with consumption. In fact, from the inherent mechanism of economic growth, consumer economies are a relatively stable society, and economic growth is quite slow. Only economic and social development enters a developed mature stage. Consumer society is suitable. Consumer society can only fall into "medium income trap", not the innovation society, but to stagnate society. This means that the leading growth of consumption during this period is unsustainable; in fact, in fact, regardless of the growth of consumption and investment during this period, it has decreased.

From 2020 to 2022, China's export growth was once again leading the three carriage, and it was in a long-term leading position. Exports have become the leading driving force for China's economic growth again. From the perspective of appearance, it is the result of the impact of the epidemic: the different causes of the epidemic cause strategies, which has caused different economic and social living conditions at home and abroad. China has become a global production center. The predicament of the early resistance has made global contributions; it is manifested in China's economy, which is exporting prosperity. With the changes in the epidemic situation, the market has generally believed that China's exports will gradually move down; after the normalization of economic and social life in various countries, the export advantage established by China will gradually decline, and the growth and export growth will gradually slow down. Even facing the "cliff -like" decline.

The epidemic has made deep -level changes in the economy and society of various countries, and increased its attention to economic security, sustainable growth and social stability. The environment facing China's foreign economic exchanges has become more complicated. After 2022 Inflation has implemented a currency tightening policy represented by interest rate hikes, and economic operation pressure and financial market risks have risen. However, despite the slowdown in external demand, the "highlights" of China's foreign trade continued exceeding the market at all times, and they re -occupied the leading positions of the three carriages.

** The property market bubble promotes export leading **

Obviously, the current export has become the leading driving force for China's economic growth, which is not the result of the world economy re -entered the new prosperity cycle. Therefore, the leading position of exports in the three carriages of China's economic growth is not helpful for the formation of China's endogenous growth momentum- —The foreign trade prosperity does not bring optimistic expectations for enterprises, thereby promoting investment growth and confidence. The author once pointed out in this article "How long can the highlights of foreign trade last" that the formation and change of China's international economic competition advantage is a long -term gradient process; The helpless choice of the company under the bubble. In the second half of the property market bubble, the consumption capacity has been overdrawn. In the first half, the driving effect on investment and consumption expansion has been degraded, and the situation of weak consumption weakness has gradually formed. With the continuity of the property market bubble, domestic consumption capacity is becoming more and more affected, the domestic manufacturing industrial market is becoming more and more compressed, and enterprises are increasingly dependent on exports. The business experience of the enterprise must be rising pressure and decline in confidence.** Editor of this article Xu Jin jin.xu@ftchinese.com**

(Voice of Germany Chinese) [The mutiny initiated by the Wagner Legion in Russia](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳烧俄厨子撤退然后呢/a-66025628)It has attracted widespread attention from the international community. [Tagesschau column in German TV published an analysis article on this](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/russland-revolte-wagner-100.html)Summarize the four important cognitions that the Wagner Army can get from the incident from rebellion to retreat within 24 hours.

The article pointed out: First, Putin's private military model has failed. In the past, Putin successfully expanded Russia's global influence with the help of private troops such as Wagner, and at the same time, he was able to deny his participation in international conflicts. However, the rebellion of the Wagner Army showed that this model of reliance on the private army has long lost control and greatly threatened the stability of the existing system.

### Wagner Group "Rebellion" Head: What is the significance of war?

Second, the rebellion exposed the weaknesses of the Russian army and intelligence systems. Within less than 24 hours, the soldiers of the Wagner Army allegedly approached 200 kilometers from Moscow. In the process, the substantial resistance they encountered was minimal. Although it is not clear whether they can continue to move forward at a similar speed, important military bases, such as Rostov, can control the rebels without effort. The Russian army deployed most soldiers in Ukraine or border areas may be the cause of this. The rapid offensive of the rebels exposed Russia's serious deficiencies in intelligence collection and early warning.

### Putin is no longer irreplaceable?

The third point of the "Daily News" column in Germany TV is: the leader of the Wagner Army [Porigoin](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/普里戈津何许人也他有多大影响力/a-66020810)May be a substitute for Putin. To this end, the article reviewed history and pointed out that in 1992, when some Soviet troops opposed President Gorbachev, the public expressed his opposition to the uprising. But now in Rostov and Vornesh, people have not heard similar situations. The videos circulating on Twitter even showed that some people welcomed Wagner to hire mercenaries and expressed support to them.

The article pointed out that although these videos are initially confirmed, it may be just an individual situation, but this may indicate that the Pleigo and the Wagner forces have become a substitute choice for Russia's dissatisfaction. One possible factor is that Porigoin always goes on the front line, which is in sharp contrast to those military leaders who have rarely participated in the war.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-25T14-19-00Z/66026089_401.jpg)The Wagner Corps soldiers shake hands with the people when evacuating southern theater of Russia

The author said: Successful, cruel soldiers and extreme nationalists, this combination obviously resonates with more and more people in Russia because it is largely in line with Putin's long -term information. Although Russia has persecuted the opponents, nationalism is accepted. This opens a door for people like Porigjin, as long as they follow the established rules. [Rebellion of the Wagner Force](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳身上有多少希特勒/a-39919985)It reveals the internal risk and limitations of this model.

In the fourth revelation, the author of the article believes: "Putin's unpredictable image has been ruptured. The hesitation and decisiveness he showed in this conflict is in sharp contrast to the image of his consistently shaped leaders." At the same time, for Putin This rebellion really made his possibility of ending his rule was also obvious in front of each citizen. Germany's Kerba Foundation(Körber Foundation)Russian -issue expert Leslieschübel said to a "Daily News" to German TV: Today, the idea of being president except Putin may have been formed in people's minds. This topic is now now. It will definitely be the discussion of Russian tea after dinner.

With the consent of President President Putinko, President Lokashenko, President of Russia, conducted a mediation with the Wagner Mercenary Summit who launched a mutiny.(https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230625-1407576)Essence However, the analysis believes that Lukashenko may not feel "victory" because of this, because Pritigon may be "thrown" by Putin to Lukashenko.

Agence France-Presse reported that the Russian Western policy researcher Katiaglod, a Russian-Western policy researcher at the London European leadership network (ELN), said: "I don't think this is Lukashenko's own wishes. The use of the Kremlin Palace, he would rather not be in Pleigo. "

Glort added that it is possible to bring "multiple risks" to White Ross alone in Beroos alone, because after the election in 2020, the large -scale target of the Lukashenko regime is large -scale. Street protests and cruel suppression make the loyalty of the security forces extremely important.

"For Lukashenko, the only benefit of (accepting Porigo Ren) is that it is used as his personal army to fight any potential rebellion."

Since 2020, Lukashen has more dependence on Putin regime to maintain its political survival, and has repeatedly met Putin as a "Putin's friend" as a time.

Recently, [Lukashenko allows Moscow to deploy nuclear weapons in China](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230526-1398285)Essence The opposition believes that the acceptance of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons is a symbol of White Ross's loss of sovereignty.

"IISS) strategy, technology and arms control director Williamalberque said," Putting nuclear weapons into Beros is Russia's slow -moving action of Russia. "

"I think Lukashenko has felt that he has been forced to the corner. Obviously, if Putin said," help me a busy ", he will do this, hoping that this can win some kinds of chips for him."

On the other hand, Glort also pointed out that as the mutiny has weakened Putin's authority, Lukashenko's most worried is that the Kremlin is no longer as powerful as before. Because Lukashenko's regime is only based on the two key pillars of "violence" and "Russia's support".

The Atlantic Council's very resident researcher, Hanna Liubakova, said that although the status of Lukashenko can be strengthened by mediation, "in the long run, his regime will encounter a backbone effect."
