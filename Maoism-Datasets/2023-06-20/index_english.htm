Qin Gang rarely interpreted Taiwan's issue with "the most prominent risk". According to analysis, although China has repeatedly reiterated that Taiwan is the core interest of China, for the United States, the United States has its own "China" policy and will not be abducted by US -China relations.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st-06192023034858.html">Brosky and Xi Jinping met in the Great Hall of the People</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-06182023075433.html">Brinkee meets Qin Gang analysis: Provide an opportunity for a tension between the United States and China</a></em><em> </em><strong> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st1-06172023220613.html">Whether Brintken arrives in Beijing's Sino -US relations to improve global attention</a></strong></p>
<p>According to the press release of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Qin Gang clarified the strict position on the core interests and major concerns of the Chinese issue in Taiwan, and put forward clear requirements.</p>
<p>"The issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue in Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk." Qin Gang said that China urges the United States to abide by the "one China" principle and the three joint communiqués of China and the United States. The promise of "Taiwan independence" is really implemented.</p>
<p>According to the Voice of the United States, a senior official of the US State Department emphasized that China's military upgrade in the Taiwan Strait is a "issue of global attention." The official said that the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait are in line with the "long -term interests" of the United States.</p>
<p>Professor Lu Industry, a professor of National Politburo, told this station that after many dialogues in the United States and China, the press releases issued by each other can see that China especially emphasizes the importance of Taiwan issues, but the United States usually lighten to deal with Taiwan issues. The main difference is that China believes that Taiwan is its core interest, but from the perspective of the United States, the United States has its own "one -China" policy, and its subjectivity about the US -Taiwan relations. The United States believes that it should not be abducted by US -China relations.</p>
<p>"(Qin Gang)This time is different from before. In other words, he explicitly told the United States that this is the core interest, but at the same time, it is also the place where both sides are most likely to wipe the guns and get angry or have misjudgment of each other. "Lu Yingzhong said immediately," The first policy of the United States mentioned the so -called differences on the two sides of the strait(differences)It should be handled through peaceful ways between the two sides of the strait, and the United States has stable in this position. "</p>
<p>** Analysis: U.S. -China talks will help alleviate the current situation of the Taiwan Strait's current situation.</p>
<p>Regarding whether the talks can help the tension of the Taiwan Strait, He Chenghui, deputy secretary -general of the Taiwan Security Association, said in an interview with this station that "has eased the current situation, but the long -term trend remains unchanged."</p>
<p>He said that for China, it is not a good time to launch a war against Taiwan at this moment. Once the war fails or is difficult to carry out, it is enough to shake the Chinese Communist regime. Therefore, China will make the "drag titles" and make the outside world mistakenly think that the situation is slow, but it will only accumulate backwards.</p>
<p>Standing in the United States, He Chenghui believes that the current Russian and Ukraine War is in full swing. Western countries do not want to fight on both sides, tendency and slowing situation. As the U.S. Indian commander Aquirino said publicly that he was awarded two heavy tasks to prevent the CCP from invading Taiwan. "At least everyone gradually condenses consensus, expands this kind of amendments, and responds positively and rapidly. Let this aggression be eliminated invisible."</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan problem in China China Soft and Hard Hand </strong></p>
<p>Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the director of the Foreign Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with Blink in Beijing on the morning of the 19th. When he mentioned the issue of Taiwan, Wang Yi also reiterated that the maintenance of the country's unity is always the core of China's core interests. The fate of Chinese children is the historical mission of the Communist Party of China, and "China has no room for compromise."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-19T04-46-00-04-00/000002.png" />When the US Secretary of State Brills, Wang Yi and Wang Yi and Qin Gang met, China both mentioned Taiwan's issues.(Reuters pictures)China's issue in Taiwan shows the handling of "hard and hard, both hands and inside and outside". Wang Huning, the highest -level official of Taiwan affairs and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, emphasized that "the development of cross -strait relations in the people and the people are in the people. The results of cooperation benefit compatriots on both sides of the strait. "He also talked about" peace "and said that" the peaceful development of cross -strait relations is the right path to maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, ... to the right path to the national rejuvenation. "</p>
<p>The former editor -in -chief of the Global Times, who has always faced the world of war wolf, said that in response to the talks between Brinken and Qin Gang, he posted on his personal Weibo. But in the core interests, he is resolutely not allowed. "He also reminded," No matter what the front appears, we don't need to be impatient, impulsive, and panic. "</p>
<p>"On the one hand, he knew very well that it was a catastrophe to China. But on the other hand, he couldn't give up the core bottom line." He Chenghui interpreted that Hu Xi's informal document was close to the conflict of China's mainstream interesters.</p>
<p>He Chenghui reminded that in order to avoid conflicts, Western countries were willing to take a step back in certain interests. However, in addition to the concession in China, others will not be concessions. "In the negotiations set in China, Western countries will always suffer, because you never understand it, China will not refund in substantive issues, then this negotiation is invalid from beginning to end."</p>
<p>Lu Industry analyzed that in the past, Hu Xijin played the role of "throwing throttle" in Chinese nationalism. Now he publicly puts soft tunes, helping the Chinese leadership to promote interaction and exchanges with the United States in the future. "Regardless of his intentions, there will be some situations that help ease the tight US -China confrontation."</p>

OECD(OECD)It is now expected that Germany's economic growth rate will be the lowest in major economies this year. However, the trend after this year is even more worrying. The current geopolitical adversity -the upgrade of tensions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the United States and China -highlight the vulnerability of the international economic model pursued by Germany, and also highlights its challenges in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Tumz(Olaf Scholz)It has always been ambitious to re -adjust its economic direction, including reducing Germany's dependence on Russia's energy and creating a new industrial supply chain. The Souls government has been acting quickly. Increased the target of renewable energy power generation to 80%, increasing the attractiveness of Germany as a green investment destination. Germany will invest tens of billions of dollars to promote the development of the semiconductor industry.

<p>The obvious overloaded fishing boat was photographed many times before sinking.</p>
<p><strong> A immigration ship sinks on Wednesday (June 14), and hundreds of sneaks are unknown. The BBC has evidence that the Greek Coast Guard has doubts about the description of the incident. </strong></p>
<p>The reporter analyzed the navigation trajectory of other ships in the sea, and believed that the overloaded fishing vessels remained in place within seven hours before sinking. The maritime police insisted that during this period, the fishing boat sailed towards Italy and did not need to be rescued.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities have not responded to BBC's survey results so far.</p>
<p>The shipwreck killed at least 78 people, and the United Nations said that the whereabouts of up to 500 people were unknown. There is a voice questioning that Greece should have taken more actions to start comprehensive search and rescue.</p>
<p>In this regard, the United Nations calls for investigation to deal with the practice of this is the practice. Greek officials insisted that the staff on board showed no help, and until the moment before sinking, the fishing boat was not dangerous.</p>

<p>Their data shows that a small seas that of immigration ships later sinking for a few hours of activities, and these data brought questions about the official statement of navigation of fishing boats without difficulty.</p>
<p>The fishing vessels are not equipped with tracking equipment, so they are not displayed on the map, as well as the maritime police and naval ships because they do not need to share their position.</p>

<h3>The official incident of the sea police sequencing suspect</h3>
<p>The EU Border Administration (Frontex) said that the bureau first discovered the immigration ship at 08:00 at 08:00 last Tuesday (13), and knew that the Greek authorities would be known as the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Alarm Phone, a hotline for emergency help for immigrants at sea, said that they received calls at 12:17 GMT, saying that fishing boats were in critical condition.</p>
<p>We use the BBC facts to identify authentic videos and photos, as well as court documents and maritime records to analyze the next hours of ship dynamics.</p>
<p>Marinetraffic animation shows that a ship named "Lucky Sailor" suddenly turned north at 15: 00GMT. The "Lucky Sea" Ship East provided its Log Book to the BBC, and confirmed that the maritime police asked the ship to be close to the immigrant ship and provide food and water to the other party.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, at 15:35 GMT, the marine police helicopter found the immigrant ship. Greek officials still claimed that the fishing vessels were still sailing at the time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/_130128892_71a641f6-dffa-4c4b-83ec-7619e95d03d8.png" />Image source, Marinetraffic</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The yellow mark on the map is the place where the immigrant ship sinks. From the direction of the ship's movement there, a few hours before the shipwreck, the fishing boat has not moved.</p>
<p>But two and a half hours later, about 18:00 GMT, another ship "Faithful Warrior" sailed to the same sea area, and also supplied immigrant ships.</p>
<p>The "Loyal Fighter" shipowner reminded BBC to inquire with the investigation authorities.</p>
<p>A piece of video was reported from the video of the "Loyal Fighter", which claimed that the ship was recorded on the migrant ship with a rope on the sea, and no other ships were seen in the clip.</p>
<p>The BBC facts verified the video and confirmed that the appearance of the boat was in line with the immigrant ship seen in the photo -and it did not move in the clip -the weather conditions also met the report at the time. The shooting time of the video is unknown.</p>
<p>Between 19:40 GMT and 22:40 GMT, Greek officials originally declared that immigrant ships maintained "stable routes and speed".</p>
<p>The authorities' initial statements said that they kept cautiously and observed immigration ships, but they later released a close -up photo -and it was taken during this time -showing that the immigration ship did not go.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/_130128897_bdb6f606-fca8-41ae-8320-ff8d3634928f.png" />Image source, Greek Coast Guard</p>
<p>Image adding text,A Greek government spokesman later said that the sea police had tried to board the immigrant ship for risk assessment, but someone on the ship unlocked the cable and did not want to be aid.</p>
<p>Within seven hours, all ship activities focused on a clear point, indicating that the immigrant ship was almost at all.</p>
<p>The proportion of animation maps shows that the immigration ship sailed for a few nautical miles. It is expected to be within the expected ship where the immigration ship is in the most deep place in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The anxious person on the boat causes the ship to swing and will also promote such movement.</p>
<p>During this time, Greek officials insisted that the immigration ship was not dangerous and instead sailed to Italy safely. Therefore, the maritime police did not try to step forward to rescue.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/816" /><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/_108802839_624_transparent-nc.png" /><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/816" /><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-19T09-25-40.000Z/_108802839_624_transparent-nc.png" />By 23:00 GMT, the immigrant ships of hundreds of people sank, and the ship tracking animation showed that many ships rushed to the scene for rescue.</p>
<p>One of them was CeleBrity Beyond, a cruise ship. Someone on the boat took a photo after the maritime and sent the clip to the BBC.</p>
<p>The luxurious yacht "Queen Maya" was then ordered to rescue 104 survivors and send them to the shore.</p>
<p>The rescued people were sent to Kalamata, who returned to a safe place, but also left a series of questions for Greece's overall response.</p>

Stein Mel emphasized the importance of US -China relations on "global security and cooperation"</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) The topic of the Chinese State Council's visit to Germany has not attracted much attention in China so far. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin just announced the schedule on Thursday on Thursday. The official media did not focus much on the intergovernmental consultation between Germany and China, and not much voice pointed out that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与中国压力山大的伙伴关系/a-65941273">The attitude of the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party in the Berlin to treat the Chinese government. Criticism. </a></p>
<h3>The environment is not the past</h3>
<p>In the opinion of the scholar of the European Research Center of the Shanghai International Institute of International Issues, China's party and state leadership now needs to respond to Germany's different policies to China in the past.</p>
<p>This foreign policy researcher believes that compared with Merkel's administration, many factors in Germany and China have changed, "including the international environment, regional security situation, and the German internal affairs environment."</p>
<h3>is how to re -position relations with China</h3>
<h3>bilateral relationship becomes more complicated</h3>
<p>Wu Qiang, a political scholar in Beijing, analyzed a deeper analysis of the relationship between the two countries. In his opinion, Germany and China relations have currently entered a "self -reflection" stage -and this coexistence at the same time with each other.</p>
<p>Wu Qiang is one of the few international political scholars who are in China and are still publicly expressing criticism. He taught at Tsinghua University, but was later fired for publicly publishing his criticism of the CCP.</p>
<p>"Mutual dislocation between China and Germany involves the issue of Taiwan and the Russian and Ukraine War." Wu Qiang said in an interview with Deguanglian reporters. How to continue the question. "</p>
<h3>Facing problems in German companies</h3>
<p>Although China is the largest trading partner in Germany, for German companies, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济遭重创-在华德企商业信心探底/a-64092035">China's political environment has brought them more and more difficulties</a>Essence The Chinese authorities have put forward more requirements for international enterprises that have carried out business in China than in the past, hoping that they can completely avoid getting involved in the political field, especially not to ask for criticism of politics and human rights.</p>
<p>It is expected that the German government will also mention China's anti -spy law at this government consultation meeting. This law can make Chinese authorities more easily convicted of foreign companies and their staff, such as the assessment of Chinese national statistics.</p>
<h3>Questions about German National Security Strategic Files</h3>
<p>Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang is expected to have a strategic document to China that is about to introduce the German government, and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国出台首份国家安全战略-中国是对手也是伙伴/a-65912004">The national security strategy just announced recently</a>A lot of questions are raised -the German national security strategy released last week mentioned six times in the text.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has criticized this document, because in Beijing's view, this is a evidence that democratic countries in the world feel that they have received the threat of Chinese nationalist policy.</p>
<p>Scholars Wu Qiang analyzed: "The most headache for Beijing is the so -called collective security order established by the United States and the West -this pattern has included the Western Pacific and Southeast Asian countries. Build this security pattern together. "</p>
<h3>China's interests in the Asia -Pacific region</h3>
<p>Beijing also noticed that more and more Germany showed concern about the security situation in the Asia -Pacific region, and China originally regarded this area as its own sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Therefore, when German Defense Minister BORISPISTOSRIUS announced in early June that it would send German naval ships to the Asia -Pacific waters for cruise next June, it also caused China to be vigilant. This topic is expected to be mentioned in Berlin's government consultation.</p>

<p>"We are a nation, and we used to be an independent country; whether China looks at us, we are an autonomous nation."</p>

<p>Former U.S. State Council ’s Asia -Pacific Affairs Assistant Secretary of State, Yale University Cai Zhongzhao, a senior researcher at China Center, SusanNTHORNTON, pointed out in an interview with the BBC connection that from the practice of diplomatic rituals, it is indeed very true that the head of state to meet foreign countries, but Xi Jinping has met many in office.

Whether China and the United States can get along with the fate of the future. At present, the international community is generally worried about the status quo of Sino -US relations. I do not want to see conflicts between the two countries. They are unwilling to choose a side team between China and the United States. I hope that China and the United States will coexist and cooperate with friendly cooperation. Based on the attitude towards history, the responsibility of the people, and the world, the two countries should deal with Sino -US relations, contribute to global peace and development, and inject stability, certainty, and constructiveness to the world of chaos.</p>

But it is very regrettable that China and the United States, especially the United States, cannot correctly understand the motivation of China's foreign policy, and the impact on China's development on the world. There is no very correct impact on the United States, which is in line with actual understanding. This is one of the most important reasons that lead to difficulties in Sino -US relations. "</p>
<p>"China is willing to sit down with the United States. If you want to come up with a way to solve the problem, I think this is a realistic attitude, and it is in line with the interests of both parties and the interests of the world."</p>

Essence She believes that China ’s statement of the United States, such as accusing the United States, trying to block China -mainly to explain to domestic audiences.</p>
<p>Fang Xianya said: "The sanctions on computer chips are deeply damaged to the Chinese economy. There are currently many problems within China: the Chinese economy has not been able to enjoy the" retribution consumption 'after the new crown epidemic, as many analysts expect, people are still closely tight Hold the wallet. "</p>
<p>"Such narratives have become an excuse for convenience: If these Western sanctions tried to cover China, everything would be fine."</p>
<p>Anthonyzurcher, a BBC reporter in Beijing who interviewed Beijing in Beijing, said that although the United States regarded the recovery of high -level contact with China as a success in the United States, and seemed to be cheerful, they acknowledged that there was a larger scale between the two countries. More tricky differences. Among them, Taiwan is undoubtedly the most controversial one, which is enough to upgrade from the dispute between tongue to a full gun battle.</p>
<p>Zekel said that at the time of the United States and China expressed the willingness to normalize the relationship between the two countries, the two countries also had their own interests that were destined to have conflicts. How the relationship between the two countries develops is how to control differences.</p>

<p><strong> Brinten emphasizes the importance of maintaining direct communication between high -level direct communication </strong></p>
<p>Blingken said that during Beijing, he held an important conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and had a "frank, substantial and constructive discussion" with Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, director of the Foreign Affairs Office, and Qin Gang, a member of the State Councilor and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>For the three goals set before this visit, that is, establishing open communication channels, directly asking questions about attention, and seeking cooperation in the aspects of common interests.

"He pointed out that both parties believe that" responsible management of this relationship. "</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[US Secretary of State Brilling Kenkeng Beijing Press Conference]&gt; Since China has always called Taiwan's issue as the core of China's core interests, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%B8%83%E6%9E%97%E8%82%AF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> #Bollingken&gt;</a>&gt; It was mentioned at the press conference that he discussed with the Chinese issue with China. He specifically mentioned why once a crisis occurs in Taiwan, it will have an impact on the world. <a href="https://t.co/86nCIrDFuB">pic.twitter.com/86ncirdfub&gt;</a>&gt;&gt; - Liberty Asia Radio(@RFA_Chinese)<a href="https://twitter.com/RFA_Chinese/status/1670863647139315712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> June 19, 2023&gt; </a>Wang Weizheng, dean of the School of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Political Science at the University of Edfei University in the United States, told this station: "This time, Brincken visited Beijing to visit, and it can be said that a 'stop loss point' for spiral decline for the relationship between the two parties."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Worried about China's provocative operation, Brincken reiterated the US policy to Taiwan </strong></p>
<p>In response to the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits issues that are concerned about from all walks of life, Brinken said: "I have proposed the concerns of the United States and more and more countries' provocative operations in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The long -term 'one China' policy. This policy has not changed. "</p>
<p>On the issue of Taiwan, Brintken reiterated that the United States has not changed its policy based on the three joint communiqués of Taiwan relations, the United States and China, and one of the six guarantees on Taiwan. He also said that the United States does not support Taiwan independence and also opposes any attempt to change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait unilaterally. He also pointed out: "Our obligations stipulated in the Taiwan Relations Law, including ensuring that Taiwan has enough weapons for self -defense."</p>
<p>Blindken also mentioned the recent close contact with the United States and China, and once again emphasized the importance of restoring military communication channels between the United States and China. However, he revealed that China did not agree with its suggestions, "At present, China has not agreed to promote this process. I think this is a problem that we must continue to solve. It is very important to recover these communication channels."</p>
<p>When it comes to the Russian and Ukraine War, Brinken also reiterated that China and other countries are welcome to play a constructive role in solving the Russian -Ukraine conflict based on the principles of fairness and peace in the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p><strong> Blinden emphasizes the supply chain "de -risk and diversified" </strong> **</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th, Brinken held a round table meeting with the American business leader in China to understand the problems faced by these companies, including the recent "punitive operation" of China for American companies.Regarding the "decoupling" of the US -China economy, Brinken emphasized at a press conference that what the United States has done is "de -risk and diversified" instead of seeking to curb China economically: "As I said, we are not decuming to be decoupled . We are reducing risks and diversification. "</p>
<p>However, scholar Wang Weizheng believes that no matter how much the United States guarantees to Beijing anymore, I am afraid that it will not be effective, because "China may have identified it, and the future competition between China and the United States is basically a competition in science and technology and economic strength."</p>
<p>Brinken also said that the trip also specifically mentioned to China the US citizen citizen and people who faced outbound banned by the Chinese side, and said they would continue to work hard to ensure that they were released and returned to the United States safely.</p>
<p>Wang Weizhi believes that if Beijing wants to release some goodwill to the United States, these people can be released, but the Bayeng government will never use this.</p>
<p><strong> There are more high -level interviewers in the United States and China: bilateral relations are still difficult </strong></p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the US State Department spokesman Matthewmiller on the 19th, the two parties emphasized that the United States and China should work together to deal with the common transnational challenges such as climate change, global macroeconomic stability, and anti -drug. The two sides also agreed to restore personnel exchanges and will increase direct flights between the two countries. In addition, Qin Gang agreed to accept the invitation of Brincken to return to Washington at the right time of each other and continue to discuss. Blingken also said at a press conference that it is expected that in the next few weeks, senior US officials will visit China more. The United States also welcomes Chinese officials to visit the United States further.</p>
<p>Wang Weizheng pointed out that China originally hoped that the US Treasury Minister Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Raymond to visit China first, but Biden also hoped that Brins would go first in order to meet with Xi Jinping at the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. Essence He said: "In the next 3-4 months, the visit of senior US-China officials may recover, but the situation of competing with each other will not change."</p>
<p>Experts believe that this time Xi Jinping and Brinken held a 35 -minute short -term meeting, showing that China is willing to cooperate with the United States and strive to stabilize the relationship. However, Bonnieglaser, director of the Asian project in the German Marshall Foundation in the United States, also pointed out that it should not exaggerate the results of this trip, because the future relationship is still facing many difficulties.</p>
<p>She specifically pointed out that in Wang Yi's statement, China clearly pushed all the responsibilities of the deterioration of US -China relations to the United States: "This is not the basis for us to stabilize each other's relationship. The United States cannot accept such an interpretation. The signal still exists. In the future, these will still be a challenge. "</p>

<p>"Reuters" recently quoted sources, saying that the British Security Secretary of State Tomtugndhat (14th) and the Minister of Development, Tang Feng, who visited the United Kingdom, met and discussed the common security interests. Although Britain currently has an office in Taipei, it only has formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. Therefore, according to past practice, British senior ministers generally do not meet with Taiwanese officials.</p>
<p>"Inter-Parliaments" (IPAC) Executive Director Luke Depulford said that according to his understanding, this is the first meeting of British-oriented officials and believes that it has been an important way to get an important thing. One step: "We welcomes this meeting very much, and this meeting has sent the right information. We should congratulate the Security Minister to overcome the pressure of other departments and create a precedent. In the future, all British ministers can imitate it."</p>
<p>However, neither Britain or Taiwan officials have not officially confirmed the meeting. However, Tang Feng uploaded a photo about Togen Dart's works on Twitter last Thursday (15th), expressing his hope to obtain the scriptures from Togen Dart to reveal it vaguely in this way. A certain form of contact was performed.</p>

<p>He believes that if China responds fiercely, it has even canceled the British Foreign Minister's visit to China, which shows that the overbearing of the Chinese Communist regime is not reasonable.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-20T-26-32-11-00-00/000000.png" />The 6.5 -meter -long "TITAN" type deep submarine vehicle was operated by the "OceangateExpeditions" company. It lost contact with the water surface after about 1 hour 45 minutes on the 18th.</p>
<p>As of the evening of the 19th, the dense sea and air search and rescue continued to be carried out in areas of about 1,450 kilometers outside the CAPE COD and about 3960 meters of water depth.</p>
<p>The United States Coast Defense said that they had launched a comprehensive search at 1450 kilometers east of cod; the Canadian Coast Defense Force also said that aircraft and ships would send aircraft and ships to the search area to participate in rescue.</p>
<p>Major General Johnmauger, who supervised the search and rescue operation in Boston, told the media: "Searching in that remote area is a challenge, but we deploy all availability resources to ensure that you can find out of contact submersible and rescue it. People. "</p>
<p>"We use our best to start search and rescue, and our staff are very important to this task."</p>
<p>For 5 people on the submersible, the key to rescue is time, because the oxygen supply of Titan submersible is about 96 hours. Mogg said on the afternoon of the 19th that he believed that there was still more than 70 hours of oxygen stock on the boat.</p>
<p>On this submersible, there are well -known British billionaires and pilots Hamish Harding. On the 18th, he posted on Instagram "I can finally proudly say that I joined the marine door adventure."</p>
<p>The 58 -year -old Harding also said at the time: "NewFoundland is the most harsh winter in the climate environment. This trip may be the first and only manned task to explore the Titani in 2023."</p>
<p>Mogg was unwilling to confirm the identity of 5 people. Harding mentioned in the post that there were several legendary explorers on the submersible personnel. Some people have participated in the Titani adventure task for more than 30 times since the 1980s.</p>
<p>At that time, the Titani, who claimed to be a giant wheel, sank from Southampton to New York in April 1912, hitting the iceberg in the North Atlantic, and more than 1,500 passengers and crew members were killed on the ship. Titanic wreckage is currently located in a sea bed with a sea bed of about 592 kilometers and a water depth of about 3810 meters outside of NewFoundland.</p>
<p>Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at the University of London (UCL), said that from the current news disclosure of the news, the loss submersible may face two endings.</p>
<p>He said that if the submersible is just an electronic or communication problem, he should be able to float to the sea and float, waiting for the rescue personnel to find it.</p>
<p>"Another situation is that the pressure shell of the submersible is damaged. If so, it is extremely bad."</p>

<p>The US economy is far richer and more energetic than the European Union or the United Kingdom -and the gap is still expanding. The influence will be far beyond the category of relative living standards. Europe's dependence on the United States in terms of technology, energy, capital, and national defense is gradually weakening the EU's aspirations that the EU may have "strategic autonomy".</p>

<p>Chen Du has been a full -time daughter in the past few months.</p>
<p><strong> 29 -year -old Julie has made game planning in a company in Beijing, and her frequent overtime has gradually made her unbearable. In April of this year, after discussing with her retired parents, she decided to resign and go home to accompany the second elder, and also planned a good plan for the next life. </strong></p>
<p>Except for more time to accompany her parents, her family does not need her to help too much. However, she said that as the only child, herself who never did housework before starting to clean up the room.</p>
<p>Julie said that the daily life expenses were mainly borne by her parents. Mom also proposed to give her a living expenses of 2,000 yuan per month, but she did not collect it.</p>
<p>Her parents did not seem to be high in her requirements. I just hope that she can "maintain a normal state of living, don't sleep too late, don't indulge herself too late."</p>
<p>The "full -time children" lifestyle like Julie became popular among Chinese young people, causing heated discussions online and academic attention. Most of them were frustrated or in the bottleneck in the early stage of the workplace. They decided to return home to live with their parents and get recognition by accompanying their parents or undertaking some household chores.</p>
<p>Some people even signed a simple labor contract with their parents, which listed above to pay and pay -how much does it cost to accompany the parents for an hour.</p>
<p>Behind the "full -time children" is China's high unemployment rate. According to the latest official data of China, in May this year, the unemployment rate of young people aged 16 to 24 rose to 20.8%, which has set a record high since two consecutive months in 2018. Among them, the situation of college graduates is even worse. According to Zhuo Xian, a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council of China, the unemployment rate of college students is 1.4 times that of the overall unemployment rate of young people, and it is the main group of young people's unemployment population.</p>
<p>Lu Xi, an assistant professor at the School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore, said: "Full -time children are an unavoidable phenomenon in the tide of social unemployment, and behind it is the status quo of serious decline and atrophy of the entire socioeconomic economy."</p>

<p>The most difficult graduation season in history in 2023: Chinese young people "squeeze" temples to pray for work</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-61632336">Chinese university graduates exceed 10 million "this year is really difficult"</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-57304453">Chinese young people struggling between "inner volume" and "lying flat"</a></p>
<h3>workplace anxiety</h3>
<p>Julie said that in the past five or six years, overtime is a commonplace. A few months before resigning, the company was more compulsory to ask for overtime. She often leaves home at 9 o'clock in the morning, and returns at 1 o'clock in the evening. "Live like a walking dead."</p>
<p>"Don't take sleeping pills at night, dreaming is in the company, and the content of the dream is related to work. Then wake up in the morning and go to work again. I feel that I work in 24 hours."</p>
<p>In China, the 996 working system (facing 9 to 9, every Saturday day) is quite common, especially in the technology industry. In the fierce market competition, many start -ups are required to work overtime because they have no core competitiveness that they can only pursue speed and intensity, so they are required to work overtime, and they usually do not pay the corresponding remuneration.</p>
<p>Julie said that if there are colleagues in the company, the human resources department will receive hundreds of resumes soon, and recruiting newcomers will never be a problem, which also encourages the company's overtime atmosphere. "After three months of overtime, I found that I didn't know the colleagues of the team."</p>
<p>Her parents accepted her home as a "full -time daughter" because they felt that their daughter could not find the object at such a big age. The big reason was related to overtime. So she expressed her understanding of her resignation, hoping that she could find a relatively free job.</p>
<p>Chen Du, who engaged in real estate -related work in Chongqing, resigned early this year and returned to a small county in his hometown of Yunnan, and became a "full -time daughter".</p>
<p>During the new crown epidemic, her industry was particularly sluggish. The company calculates wages by the basic salary plus commission, and its income has decreased sharply in the past one or two years. The deduction of daily expenses includes 2,000 yuan per month, and there are basically few.</p>
<p>"The assessment is getting stricter, and when the performance is the best, the goal cannot be achieved," Chen Du, 27, said. Coupled with the depression caused by long -term control in many places during the epidemic, she felt that "suddenly I can't see hope."</p>
<p>"During the time last year, I felt that why workers were so sad, got up early every day, worked in unparalleled, and did a lot of salary every day. I thought it was too sad. Why would people live like this? "</p>

<h3>Gap year? Old?</h3>
<p>Some people compare the "full -time children" with the "Gapyear" popular among foreign university graduates. Many graduates use this transition time to practice themselves in the society, or plan to change or enhance the competitiveness of the workplace for the next step.</p>
<p>However, some scholars have pointed out that "full -time children" are suspected of being old, and the impact on family and society cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>Scholar Lu Xi said that young people who choose "interval to a year" generally have very clear plans. The most common is to go out to study for a master's degree in the workplace, or participate in other vocational training, even if a few people choose to go out to travel to travel It is also a choice that has very strong expectations and confidence in the future career.</p>
<p>Most of the "full -time children" in China are forced to stay at home. There is no clear career planning. Social practice cannot be accumulated at home. With the increasing competition in the employment market, there are more and more people in the exams and postgraduate entrance examinations; even if they are examined, they will face greater squeezing in the future unemployed market, and may not be able to find a suitable job.Lu Xi said that in this case, many people doing full -time children are actually "self -worth without self -anesthesia when they have no way to get social affirmation and acceptance."</p>
<p>At the same time, from the perspective of the government, quoting new terms such as "full -time children", or encouraging the phenomenon of "full -time children" on the Internet, mainly to avoid using the words such as "high unemployment rate" to reduce society to reduce society Contradiction, he said.</p>
<p>But in the final analysis, "the essence of full -time children is unemployment," Lu Xi said straightforwardly.</p>
<p>"Considering the labor participation rate and the proportion of postgraduate entrance examinations and examinations, the unemployment rate of young people in Chinese young people will be far more than 20%. Therefore, there will be more and more full -time children in China in the future, especially in the group of fresh graduates."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-20T02-03-53.000Z/_130064381_gettyimages-1231685759.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>

<p>Some scholars believe that the essence of full -time children in the final analysis is unemployment.</p>
<p>Lu Xi said that the full -time children will reduce the disposable income of the parents, especially when the parents pay a certain pay to their children, which will eventually lead to the downgrade of the consumption of the entire family.</p>
<p>For parents, these money can originally flow to the market to buy goods or services. For their children, taking money from their parents means that their future revenue expects decline. At the same time, due to the decrease in new wealth created, their own consumption will decline.</p>
<p>"The more full -time children, the faster the consumption of society," Lu Xi said.</p>
<p>From an individual perspective, he suggested that young people can choose to start their own business, or transfer their eyes to foreign markets, such as looking for opportunities in Southeast Asian countries with a more economical economy. He also warned that this needs to be done by personal opportunities and personality, not suitable for everyone.</p>
<p>Zhou Yun, a sociological assistant professor at the University of Michigan, compares "full -time children" with "full -time mothers" as an analogy. She said that more than two decades ago, a "full -time" trend in American society -the white -collar mother who had been educated "independently withdrew" the workplace and returned to the family as a full -time mother. At that time, the women had to make the choice of "ideal employees" and "ideal mother" at that time. "These mothers are not so much‘ independent exit ’, it’ s better to be ‘squeezed out’. ”</p>
<p>Similarly, in today's China, the "not optimistic employment situation, the workplace's requirements for 996 '" ideal employees', how will people imagine the future after the epidemic, imagine a series of social factors with society and the country. " Don't be a full -time child, she said.</p>

<h3>Hard employment</h3>
<p>Julie said that her parents have retired, and each person has a pension of thousands of yuan per month. For her, being a "full -time child" can only be an appropriate measure.</p>
<p>In the past half a month, she has invested more than 40 resumes to the intermediary company and recruitment unit, but most of them have sinking the sea, and only two have received interview notices.</p>
<p>"I felt that my work was not easy to find before resigning, but after I really resigned, I found that the work was even difficult to find," Julie said.</p>
<p>She studied abroad and returned to work in Beijing after graduating in 2017. At that time, China's GDP growth rate reached nearly 7%throughout the year, achieving the first rise in seven years. She quickly found a decent job.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the Chinese government has focused on rectifying the Internet, games, teaching and training, and many companies have revealed the news of large -scale layoffs under the impact. Coupled with strict control during the epidemic, commercial activities have stagnated, and China's economy has slowed sharply. In this case, the competition in the employment market has intensified, the depreciation of academic qualifications, low work salary, and prevalence of overtime make many young people difficulty in employment.</p>
<p>Julie said that she was surprised to find that more and more new colleagues around him either graduated from key universities in China or studying abroad in overseas famous universities. She said that the game planning itself does not require too high education, and the reason why these high students come in compete to compete to a large extent that they cannot find a job in a better job. Employment space for graduates of prestigious schools.</p>
<p>The two interviews she just received recently was eventually defeated to students who graduated from prestigious schools. She regrets her decision to be anxious to return home to employment, "I regret not going abroad to continue a graduate student."</p>

<h3>Reinventing?</h3>
<p>Some people say that although the lives of full -time children are very comfortable, "lying down" is only appearance, anxiety is their norm.</p>
<p>"No (anxiety) is impossible," said Chen Du, Yunnan. There are two voices in her heart in the opposition: "One is very willful, I feel that there is such time, and I have not figured out the future plan, so I must enjoy the present; the other I am reminding you to give you three or four, four or four For a month, you have to start thinking about what to do next, and you can't go like that. "</p>
<p>Although their parents did not say anything, they also had anxiety in their hearts. My parents occasionally ask her, how to plan next.</p>
<p>"In fact, they can actually hear it. They are a little worried," Chen Du said, "I don't know the future plan, but I can't tell them that I don't know, I will say that I will rest for a while. "</p>
<p>Looking back at the experience of doing a full -time daughter in the past few months, Chen Du said with emotion: "Parents are very hard -working and diligent people. Now when I think about it, I really feel embarrassed. They got up at seven or eight and went to work. They worked so hard at the age of 50, but I lay flat at home. "</p>
<p>"I think if I go on for a long time, I will really be old," she said.</p>
<p>Her mentality has changed. From the "want to lie down" after the workplace was frustrated, she transitioned to "the volume must be rolled." She already has new goals. Forced yourself, simply set the schedule, and ended the comfort of the comfortable full -time daughter. She has left the real estate industry and returned to a big city to start a business.</p>

<p>Chen Du, a family in Yunnan, said, "If you go on for a long time, I will really be old."</p>
<p>Beijing's Julie said that she would try to control the anxiety. "After all, the resignation was to maintain mental health. If she couldn't find a job to continue anxiety, it was equivalent to white resignation."</p>
<p>In order to avoid "old -fashioned", Julie set herself a boundary. "Consumption other than consumption other than traveling, can not use parents' money."</p>
<p>She sold her old book and the star -making products that she had saved when she was young, and saved some pocket money. She also made the savings of previous work into wealth management products. "If the market is good, she can earn 50 to 100 yuan a day."After finding up to work for almost a month, there were still few interviews, and Julie decided to switch to career. With the help of a full -time child, she gave her a convenient life -no need to pay for rent, and the time was relatively loose -she started to write a web article for a living, and set the goal of 5,000 words a day for herself.</p>

<p>Just as the geopolitical tension in the Asia -Pacific region and the difficulty of the Chinese economy were in difficulties, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, who took office in March this year, arrived in Germany a few days ago and launched a formal visit. Xinhua News Agency reported that on the afternoon of June 18, Prime Minister Li Qiang took a charter of the State Council and left Beijing. At the invitation of German Prime Minister, Tonalz and the French government, he went to Germany to hold a seventh round of the Sino -German government for consultation and officially interviewed Germany. Visit and attend the new global financing contract summit. Wu Zhenglong, a member of the State Councilor and Secretary -General of the State Council, left Beijing with the same machine.</p>
<p>Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of Sydney, Australia, said in an interview with this station on Tuesday (20) that Li Qiang's choice of European interviews was to get rid of the situation of internal and external difficulties. He said: "He is now internal and external, especially the decline in the economy can't stop, and he cannot solve it. Especially to apply the power of the Communist Party of China to a comprehensive control of society and the economy. Destroy the economy and eliminate wealth. "</p>
<p>Li Qiang's visit to Germany and France is just the West's support for China to support Russia, trade protection methods, and deterioration of human rights.</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: Europe believes that China does not directly threatened it </strong></p>
<p>Feng Chongyi said that Li Qiang's trip also shouldered that Europe moved closer to Beijing in the field of diplomacy to compete in the United States: "He has a united front strategic plan to combat the major enemies in the United States and all places outside the United States as the object of the United Front. Europe is a region where they have been working hard and achieved quite successful. Because Europe has an inherent needs, he needs to establish a multi -level world, and China has not threatened directly to Europe in geopolitics. "</p>
<p>Germany President Frank Walter Stein Melben emphasized the importance of Sino-US relations on "global security and cooperation" on Monday. After writing on Twitter. "He calls for strengthening the communication channels between the two countries."</p>
<p>Cai Shenkun, a financial commentator who pays attention to the situation in China and even the international situation, said that Li Qiang's visit to Europe has many considerations, mainly to save the domestic economy. He said to this station: "The economy in the first half of the year has a downturn, and exports have almost comprehensively declined. Affected by the epidemic, the consumer purchasing power of the world has slowed the rhythm. Therefore, China also imagined that the foreign trade surplus during the epidemic situation in the past three years is possible. This possibility Sex does not exist. In this case, he must maintain a connection with the economic or political aspect of the Western power. "</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union have become more and more vigilant on issues such as the Russia -Ukraine War. On Monday, NATO Secretary -General Yanz Stoltenberg said in Berlin that many people had previously believed that buying natural gas from Russia was "pure business decision and now tasted suffering." He also named China, "We must never make the same mistakes against other authoritarian regimes, especially China."</p>

<p>Cai Shenkun said that Li Qiang's visit to Europe expects to improve the relationship with the West, especially if you want to differentiate the relationship between morality and France and the United States, which is almost impossible. He said: "Especially when the Russian and Ukrainian war fiercely, you have to divide the steps of Europe and the United States, and it is impossible to succeed. Moreover, a prime minister can't finish such a task."</p>
<p>According to Xinhua News Agency, Li Qiang left Beijing by "charter". Unlike his former Li Keqiang, he visited the special plane. According to public information, Wang Yi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, recently visited Russia and Europe, all took special planes.</p>
<p>According to Chinese industry insiders, special planes are used for senior government officials or important characters, such as President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and important figures such as Huawei Finance Meng Wanzhou returned from Canada. The charter is usually renting the entire aircraft, which is paid by the government or enterprise. When the charter machine needs to go off and land in accordance with the relevant procedures of civil aviation regulations, such as security checks, registration and other procedures. Dedicated planes enjoy exemption, without having to go through these processes during the take -off and landing process.</p>

<h1>The People's Bank of China has stimulated the economy and lowered the LPR interest rate</h1>

<p>Description: This is the most obvious sign of the Chinese government's concerns about economic stagnation, indicating that under the decline in exports, engineering stagnation, and weak consumer confidence, Beijing hopes to stabilize economic output. The interest rate reduction does not show that the decision makers are not panicked although they are worried about the status quo. Agency France-Presse-Getty Images' interest rate cuts are very different from the policy of Western Bank of China, and Western central banks have been pushing high interest rates to cope with inflation.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T02-25-51-08-00/20China-Ratecuts-bkfh-master1050.jpg" />The People's Bank of China reduced the important interest rate of loans issued by the state -owned banking system on Tuesday. This is the most obvious sign of China's economic stagnation so far.</p>
<p>The interest rate cut is very small -only one -tenth of the country's one -year and five -year loan benchmark interest rate. However, because almost all corporate loans and mortgage loans in the country are linked to these two interest rates, interest rate cuts may have a certain impact on the overall economic growth rate.</p>
<p>The actions of the People's Bank of China have made China and Western policies very different. Before the suspension of interest rate hikes earlier this month, the Fed spent more than a year fighting against inflation. The European Central Bank has also been pushing high interest rates to deal with inflation.</p>
<p>However, there are opposite problems in China: expenditure and private sector investment are so weak that companies have been racing prices to retain customers. In the four months of May, consumers and producers prices were actually declining.</p>
<p>Lin Han Sheng, deputy general manager of the China Bank of China and current professor of finance at New York University, said that interest rate cuts are a slow medicine for the Chinese economy. Each company usually negotiates with the borrowing limit with the bank each year, and then the loan ranges from weeks to several months. Only when new loans or existing loans are issued, lower interest rates are performed.</p>
<p>Lin Hansheng said that the central bank's interest rate cutting on Tuesday "will penetrate the entire system, but it will only penetrate."</p>
<p>Family needs to wait longer to benefit. In China, the interest rate of mortgage loans is almost adjustable. But adjustment usually occurs in January, and said in an interpretation statement on Tuesday when the People's Bank of China announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Therefore, although buyers in the next few months may benefit from new interest rate cuts, many owners will need to wait longer to benefit.</p>
<p>The measures on Tuesday were the first time that China had lowered loan interest rates since August last year. At that time, the Chinese economy was still struggling in Shanghai two months after the epidemic blockade. The latest information issued is that Beijing hopes to stabilize economic output in the case of decline in exports, stagnation of engineering, and weak consumer confidence. At the end of last year, the government suddenly abandoned the prevention and control of the new crown virus, bringing people's expectations for the rapid recovery of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>The interest rate reduction indicates that there is concerns about Chinese economic decision makers, but it is not panic. In contrast, when the global financial crisis accelerated at the end of 2008, the benchmark interest rate of the Bank of China deposit and loan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/business/worldbusiness/27yuan.html">1.08 percentage points on a single day</a>Essence During the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, China reduced the loan interest rate by 1.44 percentage points a day.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65967606/60003556"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-20T02-48-00Z/60003556_303.jpg" /></a>The United States ordered Nvidia to go to China with unable to export high -end artificial intelligence chips, but local Chinese players can still try to get it.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Reuters reported on Tuesday (June 20) that under the control of the United States, if you want to buy a high -level Nvidia (Nvidia (and Huida) AI chip, Shenzhen's Huaqiang North is a good choice.</p>
<p>Reuters reporters actually walked into the Siege Plaza Building in Huaqiangbei. The 1st to 10th floor was crowded with various stores, and the selling things were available from camera parts to drones. The chip will not be sold directly, but if you ask it carefully, you can buy it.</p>
<p>It is reported that these chips are not cheap. Two local suppliers revealed anonymously that they can provide a small number of American A100 artificial intelligence chips, one for a price of 20,000 US dollars, which is twice that of the general price. It is not illegal to buy and sell US high -end chips in China, but the US export control measures actually create an underground market, and sellers do not want to attract the attention of the United States or Chinese government.</p>
<p>With the intensive situation of politics and trade, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欲限縮中國晶片發展-出口管制有用嗎/a-65767213">the United States to limit China's development of artificial intelligence and super computing technology</a>Last September, Nvidia was required to stop exporting A100 and H100 chips to China and Hong Kong. This is the company's two most advanced chips. Subsequently, the United States sacrificed a series of export control related to semiconductor.</p>
<p>However, AI continues to flourish globally, and the demand for high -end chips has increased, especially by Nvidia's microprocessors. It is generally believed that it is best to develop machine learning technology, it is best to use this processor.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-20T02-48-00Z/60619140_401.jpg" />At this stage, Nvidia is influenced by the US export control. It is not allowed to sell A100 chips to China, and replace it with low -performance chips such as A800 and H800 and sell it to Chinese customers.</p>
<h3>Avoid US sanctions underground markets</h3>
<p>Ivanlau, the co -founder of Hong Kong New Corporation Pantheon Lab, intends to buy 2 to 4 A100 chips to operate the company's latest AI model. These sellers have obtained chips from outside the United States, and 1 chip quotes can reach HK $ 150,000 ($ 19150). "We are talking to two sellers now and find a way to buy some," Liu Jianfeng said, "They directly tell us that there will be no warranty or support."</p>
<p>Reuters interviewed 10 suppliers in China and Hong Kong, who said that they could easily buy a small amount of A100 chips. In addition to showing China's strong demand for these chips, it also represents that small -batch transactions are relatively easy to avoid US sanctions.</p>
<p>Local sellers have revealed anonymously that buyers are usually applied developers, startups, researchers or gamers, and even officials of local governments. Reuters cannot estimate how many A100 and H100 chips have flowed into China in total, and it is impossible to know how much these transactions have met the demand.</p>
<p>The statement provided by Nvidia to Reuters stated that the company did not open the export of A100 or H100 chips to China, and only sold <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/逃避美国禁令-英伟达为中国市场芯片降速/a-63690343">alternative products with reduced performance</a>, Conquering American norms. The statement wrote: "If we receive a message saying that a customer violates our agreement with our agreement and the illegal exports are restricted, we will take appropriate action immediately." Comment on request.</p>
<p>Earlier, the British "Financial Times" also reported in March that Chinese artificial intelligence companies will sign a lease agreement with third parties through cloud service providers to use this <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體中國ai公司設法繞過美芯片出口管制/a-64940713">bypass the US export control order</a>Obtain high -end chips in the United States.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-20T02-48-00Z/56683785_401.jpg" />In recent years, the US -China Science and Technology War has taken chips as the core. The United States and its allies have sacrificed a series of export control orders. The picture shows the US President Biden's 2021 administrative order to sign a chip shortage, holding a chip in his hand.</p>
<h3>How do Chinese sellers get American chips?</h3>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Chinese suppliers mainly purchase chips through two ways. One is that after Nvidia shipped a large number of goods to large US companies, they try to purchase excess inventory flowing into the market; the other is through India, Taiwan, and Singapore and other places. Registered companies import. This means that there are very few chips they can get, and they cannot meet the needs of establishing a complex AI large language model from the beginning.</p>
<p>According to about 40 A100 sellers listed by an electronic product procurement website, most sellers are located in Huaqiangbei. However, on Taobao, Xiaohongshu, and Douyin, you can also find the message selling A100. The aforementioned enterprises did not respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p>Some suppliers also reminded that the fraudulent behavior of impersonating the A100 with the refurbished old chip is becoming more and more common. The more advanced H100 chip just launched in March this year, it seems more difficult to buy.</p>
<p>The Department of Economics of the Chinese University of Hong Kong purchased 4 A100 chips from local sellers for research. Vincichow told Reuters that he heard that he was selling a pack of 8 H100 chipsets. However, only one of the 10 suppliers interviewed by Reuters said they could purchase H100.</p>
<p>86Research analyst Charliechai, an analyst at Shanghai, said that the United States is likely to not care about such small chips. He said: "Only when China catch up and constitutes a greater threat, we will see more stringent law enforcement." He added that at this stage, Chinese sellers may fall after the premium sales of A100 and H100 chips, because China may fall because China is because China Many AI startups will eventually evacuate this market.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-20T02-48-00Z/61735384_401.jpg" />The picture shows Chinese President Xi Jinping inspected a semiconductor company in Wuhan in 2018.</p>
<h3>China Semiconductor Industry Explosion?</h3>
<p>According to the "South China Morning Post" reported on the 19th, Wei Shaojun, a professor of the Institute of Microelectronics at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said in a industrial forum in Guangzhou last weekend that in the face of US scientific and technological export restrictions, China's semiconductor industry should be more open and emphasized.In response to the restrictions on the US semiconductor exports, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs once said that this move violated the law of industrial development and criticized the United States to "do nothing to maintain science and technology hegemony." The spokesman Mao Ning also said in March: "Facts have proved that restricting suppression can not stop China's development, it will only enhance China's determination and ability of self -reliance and technology innovation."</p>
<h3>chip supply to eat tight semiconductor industry in the ascendant</h3>

<p>On June 13, Professor Yang Jun of China University of Political Science and Law published an article (hereinafter referred to as Yang Wen) in Singapore's "Lianhe Zaobao" (hereinafter referred to as Yang Wen). Essence</p>
<p><strong> Will the West willing and can stop Russia? </strong></p>
<p>Yang Wen believes that the Russian -U -U -U -Uta war occurred in the 21st century. The annexation of Crimea and invading the Wudong area are all appeased.</p>
<p>The author believes that the United States leads NATO is indeed not passively appeased, but the arson of the arson of the arson. The latter acts more than the former. Before the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, as the only superpower after the end of the Cold War, the United States took the initiative to adopt a strategic offensive. NATO continued to expand eastward and aggressive. He was garristed and deployed offensive weapons at the entrance of Russia and continued to compress the strategic space of Russia.</p>
<p>In 1990, U.S. Secretary of State Baker promised to Soviet President Gorbachev, "If NATO can maintain a garrison in Germany, NATO will not expand eastward, even in an inch." The fact is that NATO has expanded eastward in the next five rounds. Russia is based on Russia. This judgment has been deceived many times, also warned many times, and proposed to negotiate. The last time it was announced on December 17, 2021, the "Draft Treaty of Russia and the United States" was announced, all of which were neglected and rejected. Putin was interviewed by the US NBC in June 2021 and held an annual press conference on December 23. Two angrily criticized "NATO East Expansion" and "shamelessly deceived us."</p>
<p>Russia maintains special interests to the CIS countries and has also maintained special influence, which is in line with geopolitics and historical inertia. If the outside world rises and penetrates, it will inevitably conflict with Russia. On June 13, 2023, Putin reiterated that the launch of special military operations was "a reaction to the red line (referring to the continuous eastward expansion of NATO) by crossing Russia". Essence</p>
<p>"2014" obviously refers to the riots and riots in February 2014. On February 22, Ukraine's highest Rada impeached and dismissed President Yanukovich, who was pro -Russian. Russia planned the "Color Revolution" in U.S. U.S., as revenge, annexing Crimea on March 21.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, the United States quickly led the Western allies to severely sanction Russia and continued to assist Ukraine. If the purpose of the United States and NATO is only to defend the value of democracy and freedom, or to justice for Ukraine, then it is naive. In fact, the political elites are intimidated and the vertical champion is to maximize the interests of the country. The difference is that the strategy is the strategy. Whether it is clever, can be achieved, and how to achieve it.</p>
<p>Yang Wen was optimistic, "If European and American politicians were more resolute and fatal, no matter how much the brave man was afraid, and then implementing some effective curb strategies, the probability of the Russian and Ukraine war would not happen."</p>
<p>According to the author's opinion, is the United States curbing Russia's strategy is not valid? The polar bears had been forced to the corner, and they could not retreat, and they became angry. According to Russia's logic and justification, NATO will not annexes Crimea and special military operations. Will war will not happen if Europe and the United States fight against Russia? May wish to analyze the responsibility and origin of the war.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Russian and Uchians has complex historical latitude and latitude and continuous realistic responsibility, which is also a sign of the big collapse of the European security system. If the responsibility is distinguished, Russia, the United States, and Wu roughly four or three or three, which is also the three dimensions of objective analysis. The United States' war responsibility has been described earlier.</p>
<p>Putin is of course the primary responsible person of the war. The national strength does not match the individual's ambitions, seriously misjudge the situation, trapped himself and the people in the abyss, and accelerates Russia's decline into a second -rate country. The United States does master confidential information such as the Russian army transferring troops and combat, showing how deep and successful the top -down penetration of the high -level military and political and frontline troops of the Russian military and political and political, and it must have been operating for many years. Before the war, the Director of the Central Intelligence Bureau (CIA) worshiped to visit Russia secretly, and took out the evidence for the last warning. At this time, Russia had been iron -hearted and blindly optimistic about the battle situation, so he refused.</p>
<p>The intention of Putin's war may not be as analyzed by Yang Wen, "comprehensively and completely re -incorporated Ukraine into the Russian Federation." It is to overthrow the Zeelianzki regime and support a puppet's pro -Russian regime. It is the same as that in 2014 to annex Crimea in 2014, and in 2022, the so -called "national referendum" is organized under the Russian muzzle. , Then the Russian and White Ultra "Slavic National Federation" was established. In this way, although he could not restore the vast territory of the Soviet Union, at least it became the "heroes" of the unified Slavic nation.</p>
<p>The idea of this "world hero" has a relationship. The most unreasonable means are the means and cannot be used. Even if you want to penetrate and buy, you can get it. Eat too ugly, indigestion, and even food poisoning. There are differences in differences between the country and the country, but it should not solve the problem through the war of aggression. This obviously violates the "UN Charter" and fails to achieve a quick decision. Now that it is difficult to ride a tiger, the setting sun is more than Huai, and how to end the scene is no longer autonomous.</p>
<p>Since this century, there are three regimes that have aroused public anger: First, Afghanistan Taliban, who has destroyed the Bamiyan Buddha of the World Cultural Heritage, now violates his promises when he has emphasized power, and once again prohibits women from being educated and worked; second, North Korea is North Korea. Kim Jong -un conducted the sixth nuclear test, and many countries broke their diplomatic relations or expel the ambassador. Third, Russia Putin invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>There is also a war responsible person is Zeelianzki. He replaced the dismissal pro -Russian president, of course. There is no big deal for pro -beauty. The problem is "one side" pro -beauty. Regardless of the repeated warning of Russia, it will even join NATO and the European Union to enter the constitution, blatantly confront Russia, and rush to the front line. Funeral. It can be said that this is a country's internal affairs, but when it comes to Russia, it is a brutal neighbor, and it is the Slavic brothers.</p>
<p>The primary responsibility of the head of state is not the fast of ourselves and the great exhibition, but to protect the people's people's survival and dignity. The excellent performance during Zellezki could not cover the mediocrity before the war. Two successful precedents are significantly clever.</p>
<p>One is Finland. After the defeat of the Sufen War in March 1940, Finland has been a "little daughter -in -law" for more than 80 years, and succumbed to the prostitution of the Soviet Union and Russia until the century of no time after Russia had no time to distinguish between Ukraine. ; The second is Singapore. The model of the small country has repeatedly claimed to be "not choosing a side" between China and the United States. He also dared to tell the truth from China and the United States many times. China and the United States also bought it. It is regarded as a friend, and Malaysia did not dare to annex it.</p>
<p><strong> Western restraint is not appeased but rational to avoid war out of control </strong></p>
<p>Yang Wen criticized the United States appeasement, "withdrawing from U.S. military advisers and observer in Ukraine, and further condoning Putin to be afraid and launched a comprehensive war."Yang Wen quoted the point of view of Kane, a strategic researcher at Hopkins University in the United States, and questioned why Ukraine had no right to fight against Russia.</p>
<p>According to the author's opinion, Ukraine certainly has the right to attack the Russian homeland. In essence, the drone attacked Moscow, the Russian border settlement, and the attack on the Crimea Bridge (Russia's Crimean as the territory). The United States and NATO are restricted to attack Russia with their weapons.</p>
<p>This is not an appeasement, not as Yang Wen called, "the result is all in a larger, more and more inhuman war, the sea and quagmires", but a recognition rational reason, avoiding the sharp upgrade or even out of control of the war. On June 12, French President Macron revealed the bottom line of Western military aid, "Never attack Russia (local) to avoid any form of conflict upgrade."</p>
<p>The United States and NATO are restrained and do not provide long -range missiles; they provide the "Haimas" rocket launcher, but do not provide rocket bombs with the longest range; one year after the war, the Ukraine will not be able to upgrade to provide heavy weapons such as fighter planes and tanks, but it will not provide the most advanced advanced, but the most advanced is provided. model. In this case, Russia also has corresponding restraint.</p>
<p>If the red eyes are really killed, the Ukraine attacked Moscow and St. Petersburg with Western aid missiles, causing major casualties, and there is a high risk of direct conflict between NATO and Russia. Putin must retaliate severely. The first to suffer from the Ukrainian people, the world condemn, what can I do with Putin? Both sides have the blood of innocent civilians. Do you laugh at 50 steps?</p>
<p>Putin has launched a war. Of course, the Russian army would not wait to die. It had to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which led the U.S. military to use tactical nuclear weapons to retaliate. This may be a catastrophe for Ukraine and even Europe and the world.</p>
<p>Because the Russian army has a huge nuclear arsenal, the author has repeatedly said that although the strategy is defeated, it can be undefeated. The United States and NATO have no willingness and courage to end, or allow them to use their weapons to attack Russia, so Putin has no fear of war. The longer the war is dragged, the higher the chance of the Russian army.</p>
<p>Yang Wen criticized that Western aid weapons of Western aid were "after repeated tangles, delay and obscurity". They named Germany who first assisted only hundreds of steel helmets. Recently, the "Leopard 2" tank was delivered for more than a year.</p>
<p>In the West, especially in the United States, the military aid is already very large, but he could not satisfy Zellezki's appetite, so that he reminded him to be "grateful" when he talks with Zendiski. On June 13, the U.S. State Department announced the 40th plan to provide US $ 325 million in weapons and equipment, and has provided more than 40 billion US dollars in military aid. On June 12, the United States will open up the wind after the United Kingdom may provide Culfur bombs that are disabled in international law and can penetrate the front of the tank. Putin responded on June 13 that Russia also had depleted uranium bombs. "We will also retain the right to use the same ammunition."</p>
<p>As for the slow aid weapons of Ukraine in the West, it was not appeasement, but utilitarian. At that time, not only in the West, but almost the world believed that within a week, the Russian army would overcome Kiri Fuxi. What else would help Ug? Do you donate to the Russian army as a loot? Due to the weakness of the Russian army, the Ukraine stubbornly supported the first week before getting in exchange for its own vitality.</p>
<p>In fact, the victory of the Ukraine in the first week is inseparable from the US intelligence support and tactical command. For example, the Russian helicopter group suddenly descended from Kenfu suburbs to try to establish an outpost base. The tactics were the same as the invasion of the Czechoslovak capital Prague in 1968 and the invasion of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan in 1979. The Russian army was ambushed by the black army, most of them were annoyed, and most of them retreated. Otherwise, the heels will be established. A large number of military aircraft and soldiers who have been standing in the back are rushing, and Kiev will not be able to keep it. Zeleiski can only establish an exile government on Lavff near the Polish border, and Russia can follow the original script. Establish a puppet regime.</p>
<p>As for Germany's cautious military aid, there are also their national feelings and historical tangles. Germany launched World War II, which brought heavy disasters to the country and the world. Fascism and war crimes were severely liquidated after World War II, and there were strict legislation in China. This has led to Germany's public opinion and the government for military care, and they can't live a psychological country, and they are afraid of misunderstanding in other European countries.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, how could Germany turn 180 degrees and re -embark on the road to expand? How could Shuerz quickly determine and set up a 100 billion euros special defense fund, promising to increase national defense expenses to the standard GDP standard in NATO accounting for 2%? Germany has been forcing the United States to announce the "M1 EBrams" tank, which is not practical, and then announced that the practical "Leopard" tank is announced to avoid Russia to retaliate in Germany. It is mature and clever politics.</p>

<p>Description: Elsberg revealed the United States' lies in the Vietnam War. With the upgrading of Taiwan issues, he disclosed that in 1958, the United States considered the use of nuclear weapons in mainland China to protect Taiwan, hoping to cause discussions on the Anti -Spy Law and the Taiwan Strait crisis. Donal F. Holway/The New York Times Daniel Elsberg and his wife Patrisia. In 1971, he disclosed the behavior and consequences of the Pentagon's documents left a mark in history, defining his life.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T04-07-30-08-00/18dc-ellsberg1-czkm-master1050.jpg" />Daniel Elsberg, a military analyst, who experienced the disillusionment, was famous for leaking the so -called "Pentagon Document" in 1971. In the last few years of his wonderful life, he hoped that he would be sued. He hopes that I can help him achieve this goal.</p>
<p>The allegations he expects is to deal with the national security secrets according to the "Anti -Spy Law". His plan is to give me another confidential document he took away decades ago. Wing this file. He hopes to give a chance to give the Supreme Court, which clearly applies the law to those who leak government secrets to reporters. Today, former President Trump is facing 31 allegations that it is against this "Anti -Spy Law", although the case is completely different.</p>
<p>Elsberg disclosed the Pentagon Document in 1971 -a confidential research report on the Vietnam War, showing how a generation of military and political leaders lied to the public -his behavior and consequences left in history. The mark has become an incident that defines his life.</p>
<p>But in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html">some</a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/">讣 讣</a>Among them, you can also vaguely see an episode in 2021. At that time, he gave me a top secret document that the content of the US military leaders promoted the first nuclear blow to China in 1958. Risks and deaths of millions of people.</p>

<p>When examining his influence on future generations, it is also worth noting that he also hopes to start to pay attention to the issue of "Anti -Spy Law" by revealing.</p>
<p>"If you are sued, I will reiterate my beliefs, that is, what I am doing -just as I have done in the past -not a crime," he told me, he also said that the use of the bill "will be out of The confidential disclosure of public interests should be regarded as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The government has a variety of means to prevent and punish the behavior of disclosing information to reporters and the public without authorization, and in most of the history of American history, the government has never tried to send the leak to prison. The Anti -Spy Law has been written as early as the "World War I", but it was not until the second half of the 20th century that the government began to try to use it to prosecute the leak instead of the spy -the initial effect was very small.</p>
<p>In 1957, the military put forward the allegations of "Anti -Spy Law" on a military court in the military court that the crime was to provide reporters with information about a controversial missile plan, but the prosecutor canceled the allegations. In 1971, the Ministry of Justice successfully initiated such prosecution for the first time in cases of Elsberg and his colleague Anthony Russell who had helped him. However, the case was rejected by the judge because the government's behavior was improper and illegally collected evidence.</p>
<p>Ten years later, the Ministry of Justice of the Reagan government tried again to sue a national defense analyst with the Anti -Spy Law, which(Jane’s Defence Weekly)Provides a secret satellite photo of a Soviet shipyard. He was convicted. However, only one person was sent to prison because of such behavior that often happened in decades. This was strange and unfair, so President Bill Clinton pardoned him in 2001.</p>
<p>However, the Ministry of Justice used the "Anti -Spy Law" to investigate the leak from time to time from the beginning of President George W. Bush's administration. The law set a severe punishment for the defendant -10 years of imprisonment for each crime -and prohibited the defendant from arguing that their disclosure was for public interests to recommend that the jury declared innocent. Most defendants accepted the confession agreement to avoid the risk of being sentenced to long -term imprisonment, thereby excluding the opportunity to appeal whether the law was concluded in this case.</p>

<p>In 2014, Elsberg and I discussed that the government used the increasing use of the law. At that time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/us/politics/snowden-to-join-board-of-press-freedom-foundation.html">I wrote an article</a>The former contractor Edward Snowden who leaked the secrets of the monitoring activity, the former contractor Edward Snowden, joined Elsberg to participate in a non -profit press freedom organization. (Elsberg has publicly stated that Snowden and his ambitions are similar, and the latter has accused the "Anti -Spy Law" alleged in Russia.)</p>
<p>"The question is -I want to say that almost no one realizes that this is a problem -the Anti -Spy Law is applicable to those who provide information to the US public, rather than secretly providing information to foreign forces like spies People, whether this is in line with the Constitution, "he told me. "Few people now ask this question. When I reveal the Pentagon's document, I did not think of this -I think I violated the law of the law and someone reminded me that. I did violate it."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T04-07-30-08-00/18dc-ellsberg2-zhqc-master1050.jpg" />In the "Anti-Spy Law", Elsberg said, "It is obviously too broad, not just for people like me." Leon Neal/Agency France-Presse — getty Images</p>
<p>In the following years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/us/politics/terry-albury-fbi-sentencing.html">more</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/us/politics/daniel-hale-leak-sentence.html"> reporter</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/reality-winner-nsa-sentence.html">Frontman</a>Facing the allegations of the Anti -Spy Law. In 2019, the Ministry of Justice under the leadership of the Trump administration crossed another boundary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/assange-indictment.html">"Anti -Spy Law" sued the founder of Wikiilic Decryptor Julian Assange</a>——It is not because of leakage, but because of the collection and release of leak information. The Department of Justice of the Biden Government retained these unprecedented charges; Anshan delays the trial by fighting for not being extradited in the UK, but the appeal has repeatedly failed.Elsberg said that decades ago, he also had another confidential research report based on the internal record of the government, but when the Pentagon's document leaked, he did not hand over the report to reporters because it involved it involved in it because it involved it. It is another different topic: In 1958, the CCP's shells of the island controlled by the CCP triggered a crisis. The report shows that the distance between the world is closer than the public is allowed.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks, I carefully read the research report on Taiwan and counseled experts on the history of the crisis in 1958. Write in me <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/us/politics/nuclear-war-risk-1958-us-china.html">article</a>When, Elsberg talked with me many times. He prefers to call through video calls in his family office full of books in California. In a long call, his wife Patricia also joined us.</p>
<p>He said that some of his motivations were Taiwan issues <a href="https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2021-05-01">again</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/opinion/china-us-2034.html"> nervous</a>Essence He said that the war planner of the Pentagon is likely to formulate an emergency plan again. If China wants to attack Taiwan, and conventional weapons seem to be not enough to repel China, they will use nuclear weapons. He believes that the possibility of any such terrible measures is worth public discussion.</p>
<p>But he said that another reason was that he publicly acknowledged that he would retain and spread confidential documents without authorization, and he hoped to be charged according to the Anti -Spy Law. He wanted to be a test case, and submitted the Ministry of Justice to punish the leak to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the clauses that are prohibited from retaining national security secrets are too widely written, so that on the surface, it can also be used to prosecute a reporter, publisher, and even those who will be prosecuted by a secret newspaper article. The article tells the spouse or retains the readers who have not reported to the authorities. He mentioned that the gradual expansion of this law had disappointed the public's cicada effects that the public obtained information generated in democratic countries, and expressed disappointment with San's "Anti -Spy Law" allegations.</p>
<p>"It is obviously too broad, not just suitable for people like me. Asanic now feels this pressure," he also said. "For 50 years, I have always told reporters. The weapon of the bore is aiming at you. '"</p>
<p>In short, at the age of 90, he was willing to take the risk of prison disaster that he had been removed when he was 42 years old. However, although the Ministry of Justice has become aggressive in the use of the Anti -Spy Law, it obviously does not want to participate in Elsberg's plan. The article was published and attracted some attention, but what disappointed him was that no one had charged him.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-20T04-31-32/1-1687234886.jpg" />Dispute between natural gas</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, Russia and the European Union countries sanctioned each other. In this context, the European Commission passed the issue of "saving natural gas for safe winter seasons" to cope with Russian natural gas supply interruption.</p>
<p>Peninsula TV station focuses on the development of natural gas war and Europe's natural gas dependence on Russia. Previously, Europe made a way to overcome the natural gas and energy supply crisis last winter and reduced the consumption of natural gas. Now the import volume is about one -third of the historical import level.</p>
<p>According to the plan report, according to the European Commission, Europe has quickly diversified its natural gas resources, and spent more than $ 50 billion last year to fill its reserve. Energy costs have lost nearly trillions of dollars in continental Europe.</p>
<p>These days, with the decline in natural gas prices, Europeans are optimistic about the upcoming winter reserves, but the main exporters in the Gulf area and energy experts in Europe have warned that the next winter may be worse, and it is announced that There is still a long time at the end of the energy crisis.</p>
<p>The plan report also monitored the tension of Russia and Ukraine after the end of the Cold War, and discussed with international experts in the field of European energy replacement to reduce dependence on Russia's natural gas imports. , Africa or East China Sea imported natural gas, and long -term dependence on any of these alternative challenges.</p>
<h4>alternative to Russian natural gas</h4>
<p>Regarding Russia's substitution, researcher and international expert Anasas Hargie said that although it is impossible to rely entirely on Russia's natural gas, Europe cannot completely get rid of Russia, but only countries that can win a lot of natural gas for Europe are the only countries. U.S.</p>
<p>Anasa Hagi believes that the demand for natural gas and liquefied gas will be great in the next few years. It is expected that its prices will rise sharply, which means that the European natural gas crisis will continue because the cost is high, and the European continent will be unbearable.</p>
<p>Gulmila Razayev, chief researcher of the Institute of Energy Research in Oxford Energy, said in the European situation that due to the interruption of Russia's natural gas supply, the European Union was still recovering from a historic crisis. Although the market has recovered from this impact, it has recovered, but it has recovered from this impact, but the market has recovered from this impact, but In the next two years, more natural gas supply interruptions may exacerbate risks. Therefore, he emphasized that the EU needs to seek the protection of natural gas resources through new channels.</p>
<p>Gulmila Rizyev believes that in addition to natural gas, Europe has other options. It can rely on many suppliers and alternatives, but the problem is often in terms of cost and commitment to long -term contracts. Don't want to be involved in it, looking for alternatives and temporary solutions.</p>

<p>The blockade implemented during the new crown epidemic was boring, anxious and painful, but some of us also gave birth to an inexplicable excitement. It is difficult to be prohibited from going out of the house. This day may be difficult, but at least we can use this idea to comfort me: we are experiencing a major historical event. In the future, we can tell this time with my grandchildren. Some people will make it into a movie.</p>
<p>However, at the time of Britain's official new crown investigation, and this country has completely lifted the legal restrictions, it is less than 16 months, but the blockade not only makes people feel like a long -term thing, but also seems to be quickly dissipating from our consciousness. Many people have only blurred memories of that period, and only a little bit faintly felt about when it happened during that period.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli said on Sunday (June 18) that the Italian government has ruled that the CEO of Sinochem shall not designate Pirelli, although Sinochem Group holds the company 37%of the shares and 60%of the board seats are its main shareholders.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/義大利總理退出一帶一路仍能與中國友好/a-65761538">Italian Prime Minister Melonini</a>(GIORGIA MELONI )'s right -wing government last Friday (16th), according to the country's "GoldenPower", announced a series of measures to protect the endurance and its management of its management to protect the strategic significance of the country's strategic significance assets. Earlier, Sinochem Group notified the Italian government in March that the company will renew its contract with the current CEO Marcotronchetti Provera and update the existing shareholders' agreement with the Italian Holding Company.</p>
<p>The Italian government stated in a statement announced on the 16th that the "Cybertyre" of Pirellium's "smart tires" is a key technology that collects vehicle data with chip technology. Potential major risks of national security.</p>
<p>The investor behind the Sinochem Group is the State -owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of the State Council, and Camfin is a private investment tool for Provella, with 14%of Pirelli.</p>
<p>The British "Financial Times" reported that "golden power" is a extensive power that the Italian government can veto the acquisition of acquisitions, forced the sale of equity, and restrict foreign investment in national strategic asset investment. When Sinochem Investment Pirellium in 2015, this power was not so great, and the transaction was not reviewed by national security.</p>

<h3>What are the regulations on Italy?</h3>
<p>According to the earlier shareholders' agreement reached by Sinochem Group and Provella, the CEO of Pirelli has the right to designate the successor, and Sinochem proposed to update the agreement and cancel the clause. He currently enjoys the power of appointment of the executive CEO, and gives him to the Pirellium Pirellium, which is controlled by Sinochem. The updated agreement was submitted to the Italian government in March, which caused the review.</p>
<p>According to comprehensive media reports, the Italian government ruled that only Camfin had the right to nominate the next CEO of Pirellium, and it also prohibited the participation of Sinochem's participation in the relevant decision -making of Pirelli's operating strategy and financial planning. Any changes in Pirelli in the future -including failure to renew or sign a shareholder agreement -also must be reviewed by the government.</p>
<p>Italy stipulates that among the 15 members of Pirelli, Sinochem Group can only choose not more than 8 and decide 4 of Camfin. In the future, the "some" strategic decisions of the board of directors in the future must be approved by at least 80%of directors. If the previously submitted shareholder update agreement, Sinochem Group may have decided nine directors and Camfin will leave three members.</p>
<p>In addition to the separation of its financial and capital pool (Cash Pooling) from Sinochem Group, the company must also appoint a new Italian citizen to join the board to ensure that its ruling is observed.</p>
<p>In addition, the Italian government also requires Pirelli to refuse to refuse Sinochem Group to share any information, including any information related to proprietary technologies. Sinochem Group is also ordered to not have any intervention imposed by Beijing.</p>
<p>Sinochem Group refused to comment on this. The lawyer's analysis of the "Financial Times" may still be examined by the Italian government's decision.</p>
<p>Pirelli shareholders will vote on July 31 to vote for the new board of directors, and will be served as the next CEO by the current Deputy CEO Giorgio Bruno. The current CEO Provella will continue to serve as the executive vice chairman.</p>

<h3>: The Italian government has been intervened very little</h3>
<p>The Financial Times reported that a senior Italian official who was familiar with the case said that Italy could order Sinochem Group to reduce or even completely sell its stocks in Pirelli. Therefore, the country has shrunk the scope of intervention to "minimum" It's right.</p>
<p>The official said, "I think they (Sinochem Group) should be relieved when they learned that the shares were not affected," and pointed out that Sinochem Group also retained its seat at the Pirelli board.</p>
<p>It has promoted Italy to join Beijing "[Belt and Road]"(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/義大利傳將與中國談判退出一帶一路/a-65598090)"Michelegeraci, deputy minister of the Ministry of Economic Development, warned that Italy's intervention in Pirelli this time not only did not have enough persuasiveness, but also furious Beijing, and increased the risk of business in China in China.</p>
<h3>Italian considers low -key exit from the Belt and Road Initiative</h3>
<p>Jerach said that China will be dissatisfied with this, "but they are smart and will not retaliate immediately in a clear and visible way." But in the future, if there is a problem in China in China, it will be the Italian government. Decide to pay the price.</p>
<p>He criticized the reason why the Italian government used "golden power" because Prime Minister Melonini and Treasury Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti needed anti -China, pro -beauty and NATO image.</p>
<p>He said that Pirelli's tire chip technology has nothing to do with national security or strategic assets. "If you are tracking a truck driver, where is he driving, how fast, and whether he stops to the toilet, this is not a national secret."</p>
<p>He also said that in the eyes of other foreign investors, it will be a destructive signal: "It is seen in the world that the Italian government is playing dice in investment rules."</p>

However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."</p>

<h3>Analysis: Pay the way for Xi Jinping to attend the San Francisco APEC Summit in November</h3>
<p>After talking with Qin Gang, Brinken wrote in Twitter that the two sides discussed how to manage the relationship between the two countries in charge through open communication channels. The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>mask meaning</h3>
<p>As can be seen from the photos, the US delegations led by Brinken were led by the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and a member of the Central Political Bureau and the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee. The personnel were wearing a mask, and the US personnel also put on the mask "with the customs" in addition to Blink. In March of this year, the picture reached by Beijing AIDS reached an agreement showed that in the three -party talks, all officials did not wear a mask, which was in sharp contrast to the picture of Beijing officials now meeting with Bollingken.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>suspense revealed</h3>
<p>Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be in the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>Blinger to complete the main goal of this trip</h3>
<p>According to usual, the US Secretary of State visits China, and Chinese leaders will meet with it. However, there are exceptions, such as when Plingken's former Pompeo visited China in October 2018, Xi Jinping did not see him. At that time, the Sino -US trade war had debuted, and US Vice President Pence had just delivered a tough speech on China. The relationship between the two sides was very tense. Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.</p>

<p>In the past forty years, China's rapid development experience has told us that if a country wants to achieve substantial economic success, there are actually two most important conditions: one is that the people must be diligent enough, and have longing for a better life and practicality. The efforts of China and the entire East Asian nation have a very good tradition in this area -work hard, diligent, and down -to -earth; followed by the openness of the external environment, especially for economies that develop exports as the main driving force, In the case of the development rhythm of the development of freedom of trade and conservative trade, it will be different.</p>
<p>Starting from the Russian and Ukraine War, the world has abandoned the past liberal standards of "trade first". At present, it is more considered as a higher level of consideration. Each country and every region carefully divide the definition of "safety". From product standards to production process standards, from organizational structure to executive nationality, it can be said that they are drawing as much red line as much as possible. Prevent any potential leakage. Under such a background, the pressure of China's exports can be imagined. We have seen China's export data in May. It can be said that in addition to maintaining two -way growth of imports and exports except with ASEAN, there have been relatively large scale with other areas. The decline, especially in Europe and the United States with relatively high profits. There is both the reason for the weak market, but it is more caused by some market trends.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Ukraine opened the first stage of the long -rumored counterattack to recover the land occupied by the Russian army. However, there have been reports that the Ukrainian army has progressed slowly and Russia's stubborn resistance. In this context, Moscow officials claimed that Ukraine's offensive failed.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian military remained strictly silent for the entire battle. Until Monday, June 19, it announced that it has achieved some small victories so far, liberated 8 villages, and about 113 square kilometers (70 square miles) territories.</p>
<p>Maria said on Monday that "the biggest blow has not yet arrived."</p>
<p>She wrote on the Telegram message application, "There are several goals in the progress of the operation, and the military is doing these tasks."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-20T07-43-37/2-1687246756.jpg" />Russia: Ukrainian shells were injured by 20 people in Walnovaha</p>
<p>She said, "The enemy will not give up the position easily, and we must be prepared to fight hard. In fact, this is what is happening now."</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said later last week that Ukraine's counterattack did not achieve any meaningful success. However, some Russian military bloggers said that Kiev received a small profit at the cost of huge troops and equipment.</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to independently verify the authenticity of the most controversial military operations at the front line, Reuters can confirm that the Ukrainian army has made progress in the early stages of counterattacks.</p>
<p>On Sunday on the 18th, the Washington Institute of Think Tank quoted sources as saying that the Ukrainian army may temporarily stop the counterattack to "re -evaluate the tactics of their future operations."</p>
<p>The Institute of War also emphasized that the main operations of counterattacks have not yet begun.</p>
<p>In its daily analysis of the Daily situation, the Institute said, "The Institute has previously pointed out that Ukraine has not invested in most available troops for counterattack operations and has not yet started its main action."</p>
<p>It pointed out that "the suspension of action is a common feature of major offensive operations, and this suspension does not mean that the Ukraine counterattack is over."</p>
<p>Ukraine President Vladimir Zeleki said in his night video speech that military offense was a "stress", but the Ukrainian army did not let the pressure concentrated on the Russian army slip away in this case.</p>
<p>Zeleiski said, "In some areas, our warriors are moving forward. In some regions, they are defending their positions and resisting the occupant's raid and intensified attack."</p>
<p>He claims, "We have not lost any position. Only the liberation of some positions. Only they have lost their losses."</p>
<p>Officials from the two NATO member states said Moscow tried to predict that Ukraine would launch the target of attacks and was re -deploying some troops.</p>

Earlier, the area was flooded by the flood due to the huge Khahofka Hydropower Dam on June 6.</p>
<p>In short, the Ukrainian military said its counterattack was under plan, but at the same time acknowledged that there was a "dilemma" in the front line.</p>
<p>In the southern part of the country, Ukraine Commander Valreri Zalu Nikini wrote in Telegram on Monday that Ukraine's advancement was hindered by defensive work, densely thunder areas, and "a lot of reserves", but the operation will be carried out as scheduled.</p>
<p>In a video, he also appeared with the chief of staff Sidei Shaptla at the command center near the front line. Through this, Zaluigini may also refute the rumors of Russian official media, and they have repeatedly claimed that he was seriously injured in a missile attack in May.</p>

Agence France -Presse pointed out that India believes that this bank has historical significance and will expand and consolidate relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Modi went to the United States many times. The last official visit was September 2021. However, this is the first time he visited the United States with the highest diplomatic visits in diplomacy.</p>
<p>"This is not a conventional visit, this is the fundamental turning point between India and the United States." C. Rajamohan, a scholar C. Rajamohan, scholar of Asia Society PolicyIntute in New Delhi, told Reuters: "This is not to suppress China or Anti -China problem is related to establishing a new power balance in Asia. Asia is polarized and there is no single forces dominated. "</p>

In addition, he will speak in the US Congress. Asian International News (ANI) reported that Modi would also meet with Tesla CEO Elonmusk.</p>
<h3>to deal with China?</h3>
<p>According to the pre -speeches announced by the Indian Prime Minister's office, Modi said that India and the United States continued to deepen cooperation in the fields of defense industry, space, quantum, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and jointly committed to promoting the "free, open, and inclusive India -Pacific India Regional vision; his meeting with Biden will also help promote the operation of multilateral systems such as the G20 (G20), Sifang Security Dialogue (QUAD), and Indo -Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).</p>

<p>The Associated Press quoted Jitendra Nathmisra, a diplomatic scholar of the Global University of Global (O.P. Jindal Global University). It is necessary for China to fight each other and cannot fight alone.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that India and the United States did not trust each other during the Cold War, but during the recent tenure of the President of the United States, the relationship with India has supported cross -party support, and the two countries have closer to the past 20 years. Based on this, Biden further deepened his cooperation with India and regarded it as an important partner to fight against China's influence and strengthened the security of the Indo -Pacific region.

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>2000 kilometers border, 120,000 square kilometers dispute</h3>
<p>The total length of the China -India border is nearly 2,000 kilometers, and there are also 120,000 square kilometers of territorial disputes. The border with territorial disputes involves three parts: Western (600 kilometers), mid -section (450 kilometers), and eastern section (650 kilometers). In May 2020, there was a conflict (mid -section) in northern Sikkim; on June 16, a soldier conflict in the Palestin Valley (western section) of China and India caused dozens of casualties, at least India, at least India, at least India. It was said that 20 soldiers died.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>McMahon Line</h3>
<p>Markma Hong Line(Mcmahonline, the eastern section line)It is a border between British India and Tibet, which is drawn by a British adventureist to measure India. In 1914, the British diplomat McMahon convened the three -party meeting of Central, India, and Tibet. Because the Republic of China did not agree to divide the McMahon line in Tibet, and the Tibetan party failed to get an independent change in advance discussions, he also gave up the recognition of the McMa red line. As a result, Tibetan did not sign the "Simra Treaty". India and Myanmar believe that the McMahon line is a historical boundary. To this day, although the People's Republic of China refused to recognize the McMahon line, it regarded it as the actual control line. In the 1962 Battle of the China -India, although the Chinese army once occupied Darwon, the area, it was later withdrawn to the north of the actual control line.#</p>
<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>South Tibet (India: Arunechal)</h3>
<p>The southern Tibet is known as "Arunachalpradesh" in India, with an area of about 60,000 square kilometers and is located on the south side of the Himalayas. The west is Bhutan, Myanmar east is India, and the south is Tibet in China. China calls the south of Tibet and belongs to the administrative division of the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, according to the division of the "McMahon Line", the place belongs to India, and India also actually controls the place. However, the Tibetan side and the Republic of China refused to sign on the treaty. This route continues after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1948, India, which was just independent, began to send troops into this area. In 1960, India completely occupied the south of the wheat line, and China controlled north. In 1972, India established Arunechal's central area in the area. In 1987, the district was changed to "Arunecal Pradesh".</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>Britain occupied the Kim Kingdom in 1887 and sent troops to Tibet the following year. In 1950, India was called the protection of Sikkim after independence. In 2003, after the Indian Prime Minister Vajapa visited China, Beijing acknowledged New Delhi's sovereignty over Sikkim, and India also recognized China to Tibet sovereignty. After 2005, Sikkim is no longer marked as a sovereign state on the map published by China.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>Battle of China and India in 1962: Indian Prime Minister Nehru defeated</h3>
<p>In April 1960, in order to seek resolution of territorial disputes, the Chinese and Indian governments were negotiated with Indian Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi by Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, but did not obtain consensus. The China -India border war broke out in 1962. When the Chinese army launched an offense at the same time from the east and west places on October 20 of that year, the military force was 5 to 10 times that of the Indian army. The Chinese army had been deeply deepened to India today's Arunachal and Himalayas. The entire war continued for a month, causing a total of 2,000 people to be killed. On November 20, 1962, China unilaterally announced a ceasefire and withdrew it to 20 kilometers after the McMahon line. After the war, China -India relations have entered a trough due to border conflicts.</p>

<p>From December 19th to 23rd, 1988, Indian Prime Minister Ragov Gandhi conducted a formal visit to China and met with Deng Xiaoping. This is the first time that Indian Prime Minister has visited China in 34 years. This visit has been regarded as a sign of the warmth of the Sino -Indian relations after years of tension. In 1993, while Indian Prime Minister Narasimharao visited China, the two sides signed the "Agreement on Maintaining peace and peace on the actual control line of the China -India border." This interview marked a new era that Sino -Indian relations have opened. Since the 1990s, China and India have signed a total of 5 agreements on peaceful resolution of border conflicts.</p>

<h3>2017 Zhongyin Donglang area confrontation</h3>
<p>Doklam, which covers an area of about 100 square kilometers, is a controversial area between China and Bhutan, and India has never declared sovereignty to the place. In June 2017, India sent troops to cross the border between China and India on the grounds of "receiving help from the Bhutan government" and "supporting Bhutan sovereignty" to prevent China from building roads there and form a confrontation with the Chinese army for 71 days. Bhutan is the only country in China's 14 neighboring countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China, and its country's diplomatic power and defense power are in India. In 2014, Modi was Bhutan as the first visit to Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Chinese official media "Global Times" reported on the 20th that Modi's trip to the United States and India relations was strengthened. The newspaper visited Lin Minwang, deputy director of the South Asian Research Center of Fudan University, saying that India is essentially "riding a wall." Lin Minwang believes that the United States said that Modi visits the United States is a "turning moment", but it is just the saying of "wishful thinking". This expectation is "destined to fail", "because India only wants the benefits and will not bear the obligation of the American allies.""Biden regarded democracy against non -democracy as an organizational principle of foreign policy. From this point of view, if India is a vigorous democratic country, it is much more convenient," said Nurdin. However, some experts said that, compared with China, India is at least a democratic government.

<p>Donaldcamp, a scholar of the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS), told AFP that although the United States urged India to take further measures to Russia, it did not seem to have a huge obstacle to the progress of the U.S. -India relations.</p>

This relationship lasted for decades; however, the White House observed some signs from the recent public speech of Modi, showing that India is faintly far away from Russia.

<p>The US Minister of Justice, Galan, suddenly visited the Hague International Criminal Court (ICC) of the Hague, Netherlands (June 19) to meet with the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the US Department of Justice did not announce the schedule of Galan beforehand or provided any information to the media. Garland's visit to Hague is a sign of the transformation of Washington's policies for the Court of Wars of the World Wars.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court said on Twitter on Monday that Galan met with Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, but did not provide any details of the two people.</p>
<p>Garland and Karim Khan met to show that the relationship between Washington and the International Criminal Court has improved.</p>
<p>Many major powers, including the United States, China and Russia, are not members of the International Criminal Court. When Trump served as President of the United States, he imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>After taking office, Biden lifted the sanctions and supported the international criminal court to investigate Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the International Criminal Court arrested the Russian President Putin, accusing him of illegally transferred hundreds of children from Ukraine for war crimes. Biden previously said that the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant to Putin.</p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly denied the charges of the Russian army committed atrocities. The Kremlin claimed that the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant issued Putin was "invalid".</p>
<p>However, in the Bayeng government, not everyone's support to establish a more friendly relationship with the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Last month, some US Congress said that the State Council and the judicial department were cooperating with the International Criminal Court, but accused the Pentagon of the Pentagon to prevent US military intelligence sharing and destroy the prosecution of war on Russian officials.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T08-50-30-04-00/000000.png" />Students from a university in Nanchang ate a suspected "mouse head" at the campus restaurant last month, and the official insisted that it was a duck neck. China's official released the latest survey results on the 17th confirmed that foreign bodies were mice and non -duck necks. Network screenshot/RFA information</p>
<p>The "referring to mice as a duck" recently happened in Jiangxi universities became "hot search" on June 1, and after more than two weeks, the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, the Public Security Department, the Public Security Department, and the Public Security Department, and The "Joint Investigation Team" composed of the SASAC and the Market Administration made a notification: The "Joint Investigation Team" of Jiangxi Province determined that "the foreign body in the meals of the Jiangxi Industrial Vocational and Technical College is a mouse head", not the previous school and the Market Administration bureau's embarrassment for adultery. The "duck neck".</p>
<p>Not easy!Although after more than two weeks, the Communist Party of China can finally distinguish whether it is a rat head or a duck neck!So the question is: Who came forward to force the students who had to eat the mouse after the incident had to change their mouths and said it was "duck neck"? What sin should these people who use power upside down black and white? Intersection What legal responsibility should be held? Intersection How to investigate the CCP responsible people who are fraudulently faked, reversed black and white, and forced students to make false statements?</p>
<p>If the Chinese Communist regime cannot conduct a thorough public investigation on the above issues and seriously deal with those harmful people thieves, then the current conclusion is that the CCP has to make the fool who wants to protect the handsome and not to lose his death under the turbulent people's sentiment. Surgery. Therefore, the students who were forced to change their mouths to admit that they were "duck necks" in the next time they ate the mouse head. It will become an important vane for measuring this matter.</p>
<p>If the student is like Deng Yujiao and has since lost his freedom and cannot meet with the media freely, then it shows that the evil has risen from the school and the Market Administration to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The next script will continue to be proven by countless historical facts -the Communist Party of China will join forces to stand on the side of the evil side with the people. The Chinese Communist Party will re -transfer the problems raised by the people back to solve the people who have raised problems.</p>
<p>In fact, the "finger mouse is duck" in the falling area of the Communist Party of China is worse than the Qin Dynasty Zhao Gao's "refers to the deer as a horse". "Refers to the deer as a horse" occurred in Xianyang, the capital of the Qin Dynasty more than two thousand years ago. The struggle there, you died, and Li Si did not know that it was a sika deer, but to live in the troubled times in the troubled times. "Refers to the mouse as a duck" occurs in the current academy cafeteria where technology is developed, and the authenticity of things, even if it is not possible to be discerned with the naked eye, there are countless methods that can accurately identify what the essence of foreign objects that students eat. , And not threaten the security of the regime.</p>
<p>However, the matter of "referring to mice for duck" happened, and the "Internet hot search" continued to be over half a month later, the simple and discernous truth conclusion was preliminarily concluded.</p>
<p>However, when I came late, I couldn't get better, and the Chinese Communist Party finally had the ability to distinguish between mice and duck neck. Friends feel that the Communist Party still has the ability to distinguish the mouse head and duck neck. Is it blessing or a disaster for the people of the CCP's occupied areas?</p>
<p>And the problem now is: How will the Communist Party treat the student who eats mice? Is it open to commend him to tell the truth and give compensation, or give compensation, or is it secretly suppressing it as a "source of excitement"? It is worthy of our reference.</p>
<p>I personally think that the doom of that student is likely to have just begun. In the future, whether he can go to school freely ... and even speaking and traveling, it deserves close attention. According to the experience of fighting with the Communist Party: It is likely that before the matter is calm, he will be in a state of being disappeared as Hunan Deng Yujiao assassinated with a fruit knife to try to rape her cadres.</p>
<p>I believe that the CCP will use actual actions to prove that the current "referring to mice is a duck" is more evil than the "referring to the deer as a horse" that happened in the Qin Dynasty.</p>

<p>On the occasion of Modi's three -day visit to the United States, human rights organizations and political oppositions accused Indian leaders accusing Indian leaders suppressing objections and pursuing the split policy of discriminating against Muslims and other ethnic minorities.</p>

<p>The organization plans to screen a BBC documentary that criticized Modi in Washington on Tuesday, which has been banned by the Indian government.</p>
<p>This documentary deeply discussed the supervision responsibility of Modi's deadly anti -Muslim riots that killed more than 1,000 people in 2002 as the chief minister of Gujarat. Human rights organizations believe that the number of official deaths is underestimated.</p>
<p>In 2005, Washington revoked Modi's U.S. visa because he was worried that he did not take action to stop the violent incidents of Gujarat. A survey approved by the Supreme Court of India later waived Modi's blame, but the stain at this dark moment was no longer wearing.</p>
<p>Recently, Modi has been criticized for revising the legislation of the country's citizen law. The law is rapidly citizenship for some immigrants, but it excludes Muslims outside. In addition, the increased violence of Hindu ethnicists to Muslims and other religious minorities, as well as India's largest opposition leader Lahul Gandhi recently was convicted for mocking Modi's surname.</p>
<p>Pilson wrote, "The Modi government also showed public prejudice in protecting the BJP supporters and affiliated agencies accused of being accused of a series of crimes," here is the first alphabetic abbreviation of the Modi's Indian People's Party.</p>
<p>"At the international level, it is proven that the Modi government is often unwilling to stand with other governments on a critical human rights crisis to refuse or avoid condemnation of serious human rights acts in other places."</p>

<h4>The relationship between India and Russia</h4>
<p>The United States also avoided publicly condemning India's silent criticism of the invasion of old allies in Russia and the increasingly dependent on New Delhi to Russia. Russia's oil accounted for 19%of India's annual crude oil imports, and 2%in 2021.</p>
<p>In an interview published on Monday, the Wall Street Journal asked Modi about the United States' criticism that it did not take a stronger position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He commented on this: "I think this view is not common in the United States, I am not common in the United States. It is believed that India's position is well -known and understandable in the world. The world's primary task of the world is full of confidence in the fact that peace is peaceful. "</p>
<p>In the interview, Modi called for reforms to the United Nations and other global institutions to make them adapt to increasingly "polarized world order" and make them better represent the world's less wealthy countries.</p>
<p>He said India hopes to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council. "I should ask the world if I want India there."</p>

<p>Modi's trip to the United States will begin on Wednesday, 21st, and he will lead foreign dignitaries and officials to participate in the International Yoga Day Conference held in the United Nations Secretariat of New York. Yoga, an ancient discipline, was first practiced by the Indian saints. It is now one of the most successful cultural exports of India after Bolili.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, Modi successfully posted the United Nations on June 21 as International Yoga Day. Since then, he has used yoga as a cultural soft power to expand his diplomatic influence of his country and shape himself as a "asceticism" leader.</p>
<p>Modi's formal state visits will begin on Thursday, 22nd, including meeting with Biden in the oval office, delivering speeches at the joint meeting of Congress, and hosted by Bayon and First Lady Gil Biden, hosted Luxury White House Dinner.</p>

<p>After three years of the epidemic, after a great impact on the economic and political system of the world, due to the gradually slowing down due to the epidemic in countries in the world, when the economy began to recover, China ’s outbreak of the new round of the epidemic has once again strengthened the civil society again. Controlled, but unlike the zero -epidemic prevention policies that have been pushed in the past three years, more controls have imposed on the general public this time. , And the "Cultural Market Comprehensive Law Enforcement Team", commonly known as "cultural management".</p>
<p><strong> 1. Political risks allowed funds to escape and lead to downside of the economy </strong></p>
<p>Behind China ’s strengthening of the people’ s strengthening measures is because of the three years of the epidemic. Under the policy of forced “clearance” and “seal control”, foreign capital began to gradually evacuate China. In addition, the other factors are to avoid political risks. The examples of Ma Yun's arrest have made these foreign -funded giants recognized that even if they maintain a good relationship with the current senior executives of the Communist Party, they may still be arrested and confiscated by any reason for any reason. property.</p>
<p>In order to prevent foreign capital and private funds from evacuating, the Chinese authorities have also strengthened a series of control measures for funds. However The unemployment rate within China, and after the evacuation of these capitals, even brought problems in the fiscal taxes of various local governments, but even if the local government's taxation problems occur, the amount of taxes paid to the central government every year will not be reduced. Economic growth has reached the standard, and increasing the tax that the local governments must pay to the central government are required. Therefore, local governments have begun to set up various names to collect taxes and fines from the people. Tour and parking fees, but this further deteriorated the non -optimistic private economic situation.</p>
<p><strong> 2. Establish an agricultural management team to strengthen rural management </strong></p>
<p>However, it is not just a problem with taxation. In order to improve the self -sufficiency rate of food and avoid further loss of domestic funds, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Ministry of Agriculture and Rurality set up a "agricultural management team" in various places to help local governments enhance "agricultural land recovery under a signal order last year. Indicators such as farming rate "and" cultivation of farmland "improved the area of agricultural land in various localities, but the actual results of local officials' actual implementation are stunning. In addition to cutting off the woods to implement the policy of returning forests and returning farming, the hillside is also hard just as the ground. The mode of transforming into a terraced field is completely ignored the problem of soil and water conservation.</p>
<p>In addition, because the indicators given by the central government are only one grain, the local agricultural management team has also been forced to eliminate the forthcoming vegetables and sweet potatoes and other non -indicated crops. The project also includes the management of the use of agricultural machinery, which contains a license and license for the use of agricultural machinery for cross -regional agricultural machinery. , Resulting in delayed harvesting and germination of wheat.</p>
<p><strong> Three, strengthen various management to make the problem more serious </strong></p>
<p>In fact, whether all local governments have begun to enable taxes and fines to the people, or the launch of agricultural management teams to strengthen rural production capacity, it has shown that China's official policy can only be proposed in response to the economic decline, but the management principles of bureaucratic agencies' management principles can be proposed. Just look at the digital reports, and the same management model has appeared once during the Great Leap Forward. The famous "satellite" and "large steel refining" are because the production management cadres lie to the requirements of the superior leadership, which causes the number The culprit of many years of famine.</p>
<p>Economic deterioration can lead to the deterioration of social order and directly affect the rule of the Communist Party of China. In order to avoid any "rebellious" ideas, the original ideological control of the original ideological control is independent into the "comprehensive cultural market enforcement team" is that the future will be the future that will be future. For the implementation of policies, we can foresee that the Communist Party's ruling class may further tighten various control measures for the people in order to stabilize our rule, but whether this will cause further impact on Taiwan is what we need to observe further observation.

In this regard, the show guests of this station's "Asia Want to Talk" pointed out that China has a greasy arrangement for the "Followers" arrangement.</p>
<p>International experts Wang Hao pointed out that the two parties announced the above meeting one hour before the meeting, and the meeting was only 35 minutes. Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle of the meeting table, like the chairman of the meeting, the manager of the subordinate department on both sides, reporting to the chairman, listening to the instructions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T10-50-00-04-00/000002.png" />International Expert Wang Hao (Screenshot of the Program/Radio Free Asia) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx1-06202023094157.html/3.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T10-50-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Not in line with international etiquette </strong> <strong><em>* </em>* Wang Hao: There are humiliated mesagants of the form </strong></p>
<p>Wang Hao said: "This is the form of the emperor of the heavenly dynasty in the past. It is not the practice of modern international relations at all. It is not in line with the etiquette of modern international relations. It will cause unexpected consequences to support the US Congress support Blint and Bayen government to further improve US -China relations. "</p>
<p>On Personal Facebook, on June 14, 2018, Xi Jinping and the then Trump administration's Secretary of State Pompeo were adjacent to the pair of seats and wrote "there is no more harmless". Netizens wrote a message: "Listen to training", "This is the intention of China", "You have lost the country", "Chinese people eat hard and not eat soft".</p>

This is a domineering. However, the United States negotiated without results, and finally accepted. This is the second possibility. In short, there is a score in mainland China to give Americans and the world. After Bollingak returned to Huafu, the Republican Party, especially the Republican Eagle School, Interpretation or pressurization to the White House? This is a difficult game that he may face very difficult. "</p>
<p><strong> Return to teeth? </strong> <strong> Huang Jiezheng: Trump has also settled Liu He </strong></p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng mentioned that in February 2019, when the US President Trump met with Liu He, the Vice Premier of the State Council of the Chinese State in the White House, he also sat behind the desk and asked Liu He and then the then Secretary of State Pompeo to sit around the table and sat around the table. Essence</p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng said: "The attitude of the Chinese mainland is relatively high, is this good for China? Is the United States doing this for the primary election of the president who will start next year, or in order to play other diplomatic challenges? The economy has not spoke or answered the phone, is not positive. Will the United States take the initiative to be effective this time? Basin basically risked to continue observing. "</p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng believes that the Chinese side should be shot down with the current American survey of the air balloon in China in February. In addition, the recent Chinese warships and military aircraft are close to the U.S. military, and Li Shangfu has not been taken over by the Chinese defense. Very stiff.</p>

<p><strong> Huang Jiezheng: Even if you meet, even the pioneer of the road </strong></p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng evaluated Brinken's trip at least at least a window, and it also indicates that there will be high -level interviews: "If the aircraft has fallen at a low standard, the aircraft landed at Beijing Capital Airport. Meet it. The remaining percentage, including Xi Jinping, see it. It seems that he is a pioneer in the road. How can you look at the two parties later? Does the US Department of Commerce and the US trade representatives continue to visit? Of course, suspense is national defense. information."</p>
<p>Wang Hao observed that the US -China relations have fallen from Nixon to the lowest to 50 years from Nixon's visit to China. The United States has regarded the establishment of the US -China military dialogue mechanism as the primary task in Brinkee's visit. Brinken admits that it has repeatedly rejected. Before the meeting and after the meeting, the two parties did not show high -profile celebrations to the results of the talks.</p>
<p>On the issue of Taiwan, Wang Hao believes that the two sides still say each other. Blingken repeated the "one -China policy", emphasizing the internationalization of Taiwan's issue, the role of Taiwan in the international industrial chain, and the important position of Taiwan in international trade. The former Prime Minister Abe proposed that there was something in Taiwan in Japan. It is the world that the Bayeng government has expanded to Taiwan. This concept has been accepted by the seven major industrial countries (G7) and NATO meeting.</p>
<p><strong> Scholars' teachings should check the content of the US -China talks from the United States </strong></p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng pointed out that the United States will not be concessions in principle in Taiwan, but Taiwan should ask the United States Briefing to explain what the United States and China talked: "How deep does the Taiwan issue talk about when improving the relationship with Beijing? Requirements and new claims? The government must check with Americans. This question itself is an attitude, indicating that we attach great importance to it, and we must let the United States know what Taiwan should worry about. "</p>
<p>In this regard, Liu Yongjian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Foreign Ministry, said that the United States and Taiwan have good mutual trust and communication channels to unblocked. For the situation of the interaction between the United States and the middle, Meitai has always been closely linked. Blingken's visit reiterated that the United States and more and more countries have jointly concerned about China's provocative behavior in the Taiwan Strait, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, and pointed out that 50%of the world's freight is made through the Taiwan Strait and 70%of advanced chips in Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait crisis There will be huge economic consequences in the world.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-20T11-02-10-00-00/000000.png" />Many laboratories around the world have published pre -print books describing their research work in the past 7 days, but the content has not yet been reviewed by peers.</p>
<p>These laboratories use different technologies to promote human embryonic stem cells to form a structure similar to embryo. During the process, no sperm, eggs or fertilization are required. Embryo stem cells can develop into any type of cells.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to provide a model for scientists to study human embryos. It is hoped to have new opinions on the causes of birth defects, genetic diseases, infertility, and other problems during pregnancy. Based on ethical issues, such research has restricted past restrictions.</p>
<p>The first research content was announced on the 14th. At the annual meeting of the International Society for Stem Cellresearch, a scholar at the University of Cambridge and California University, describes her team's work at the International Society for STEM CELLResearch. The report was first reported by the British "The Guardian".</p>
<p>The Jacobhanna team of the Weizmann Institute of Science published a pre -printed book on the 15th to introduce their work in detail to use stem cells to cultivate human embryo models.</p>
<p>The Zenica Gauz team subsequently published a pre-print book to provide more information. Chinese and other laboratories in China have also followed up, and they released pre -print books later last week.</p>
<p>Researchers refuted media reports that called these cells as "synthetic embryos", saying that they grew out of stem cells. Strictly speaking, they were not synthetic cells or should not be regarded as embryos.</p>
<p>Both Tenica Gosz and Hana said that they have developed an embryo model for 14 days. This is the legal number of days that many countries stipulated in laboratories to conduct human embryo experiments.</p>
<p>14 days later, the embryo began to tissue cells to form organs including the brain. This period was called "black box" because people knew less than 14 days of human embryo.</p>
<p>Cambridge University announced on the 16th that the project has been launched to formulate the first management structure for British stem cell human embryo model.</p>
<p>Related researchers emphasized that they will not put the embryo model into the human uterus in the end, even if they are put in, they will not create a baby.</p>
<p>Jamesbriscoe, a Francis Crick Institute, called on researchers to perform experiments "carefully, cautious and transparently."</p>
<p>"The danger of doing so is that the wrong steps or unreasonable claims will have a chilling effect on the public and policy makers, which will be a major setback in this field."</p>

<p>In September 20, 2021, in the detection of seg by detection of seg from detection, it did not meet international norms. The Taiwan government requires scientific and technical dialogue with China through the "Cross -Strait Agricultural Products Quarantine Inspection and Cooperation Agreement" platform to resume trade, but China does not respond.</p>
<p>After the Kuomintang in Taiwan led a delegation to China to participate in the Straits Forum, the China State Council announced on the 20th that the General Administration of Customs decided to restore Taiwan's Sakya input from June 20, but "must come from the registered packaging factory and orchard" Essence</p>
<p>The Taiwan Agricultural Committee stated on the same day that he was happy to see the restoration of pineapple and Shakya input in mainland China. At present, the platform of the "Agricultural Quarantine Inspection Agreement on Cross -Straits" has not yet received the Chinese notice to re -entered pineapple, Shakya, and not provided registration conditions for registration. Essence There are a total of 1009 orchards and 50 packaging factories in Taiwan's pineapple and Shakya industry. Currently, only 25 in the orchards, 3 packaging factories, and 14 farmers in Taitung have obtained permission. The Agricultural Committee called on China to communicate the quarantine specifications of the business under this platform, so that all packaging factories and orchards can be followed.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang issued a press release on June 20 to return this vice chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Liyan, to communicate in China several times last August and strive to get a response.

The Chinese side only releases some agricultural products such as Taitung County, which is governed by the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Liu Shifang said: "Chinese intends to create only those who recognize the" 1992 Consensus "can you go to mainland China. This is not a truly free trade and equal way. Of course, it will affect Taiwan's election and Taiwan. Speaking and media, this is political release agricultural products.

According to Reuters, the Chinese people can purchase the top -level chip of American production in the electronic area. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/tj-06202023113850.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T12-06-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Audio-1-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/tj-062020202313850.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/tj-06202023113850.html/@@stream)With the increasingly stricter of competition upgrades in the United States and China and the increasingly stricter measures for the US -China chip exports, China's underground chip market has recently been exposed by the media. So, how do these chips flow into China? What is the use of China?</p>

<p>Reuters disclosed this Tuesday that the Chinese people can purchase the top chip of American production in the Shenzhen Huaqiangbei Electronics Area. Although the related chips are not displayed on the shelves, customers can buy it after asking the store. These chips are not expensive. Some stores have anonymously told Reuters that a small number of high -end Nvidia A100 artificial intelligence chips they provide are priced at $ 20,000, which is twice that of normal prices.</p>
<p><strong> After the ban on the US chip ban, China ’s high -end chip supply is in short supply </strong></p>
<p>Although it is not illegal to sell American -produced chips in China, since the United States has implemented chip export controls on China, the Chinese black market has also emerged. Therefore, electronics industry hopes to maintain a low -key and avoid the attention of these chip business to the United States and relevant Chinese departments.</p>
<p>Since September last year, the U.S. government has banned artificial intelligence technology company leading Nvidia exported to China and Hong Kong's exports of A100 and H100, the two most advanced chips. Under the competition of science and technology, political and trade competition in the United States and China, this move has limited the development of Chinese science and technology. However, with the rapid growth of global artificial intelligence and the rapid growth of related chips, Nvidia is regarded by countries as the most advanced chip in the field of artificial intelligence machine learning.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T12-06-00-04-00/000002.png" />The Nvidia chip displayed on a mobile phone screen (Reuters/Dado Ruavic/Illustration) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/tj-06202023113850.html/tj2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T12-06-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Chinese manufacturers avoid the US chip ban through small imports </strong></p>
<p>The above -mentioned merchants who sold American chips in the underground market in China said they purchased these chips at the United States at a price of $ 19,150, and they were told when they purchased that these chips did not provide after -sales service. Reuters asked 10 electronic product suppliers in China and Hong Kong to inquire and found that each manufacturer could provide a small amount of A100 chips, which shows that China has a strong demand for high -end chips in the United States, while related chip sanctions measures in the United States It can be avoided.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned merchants also pointed out that Chinese customers who purchase chips from them include application software developers, startups, researchers, gamers, and even local governments. Reuters said that it is impossible to estimate how many A100 and H100 chips have flowed into China in total, and it is impossible to determine how many purchase demand has been met.</p>
<p><strong> Chinese technology companies highly rely on American chips </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the underground market in China, Nvidia told Reuters that according to US law, Nvidia cannot export A100 or H100 chips to China, but can only sell lower -order products. If the company finds a customer's illegal export chip, Nvidia will immediately take corresponding treatment measures.</p>
<p>At the same time, the US Department of Commerce also stated that the export ban has greatly limited the ability of China to obtain high -end US chips, and the US government is not surprised to the incident of illegally obtaining American chips in Chinese merchants. investigation.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the impact of the export ban on production and operation, Nvidia launched a lower effective A800 and H800 chips for the Chinese market last year. Chinese technology companies currently depend on the import of these chips, including Alibaba and Tencent, leading technology leading companies.</p>

<p>There are more than 3,800 works in Lin Xi. Many songs are popular and loved by singers and fans. He was blocked by Beijing, which made Hong Kong and mainland artists encounter a common problem when singing his songs in the mainland. Eason Chan's Guangzhou concert show is just one of them. Most of the songs sung at a concert in Guangzhou in April this year in April this year were written by Lin Xi, but the song list only listed the song name, and the lyricist was left blank. After Eason Chan's Guangzhou concert was poorly tampered with as the storm of poet names, the relevant song list may also leave the lyricist to leave or do "anonymous".</p>
<p>Critics believe that if Hong Kong artists are allowed to change their names or remove their works in order to enter the mainland market, it is the "accomplice" that tampered with the facts and disguise themselves into a "accomplice" for those who are in power and creative freedom. Since 2014, mainland China has continued to block the entertainment industry through blocking artists, and has a particularly strict sealing order to artists holding different political claims.(Comprehensive report)</p>

<p>Description: The export atrophy, the sluggish property market, the unemployment rate, the high unemployment rate, the loss of consumers' confidence ... Under these problems, the Chinese economic recovery has not appeared. The government has taken some stimulus measures, but their effectiveness has been questioned. Qilai Shen for the New York Times China ’s investment activities in China had a period of active in the end of last winter, and this spring was stagnant.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T12-28-41-08-00/00China-Econ-01-hfkc-master1050.jpg" />In December last year, when China suddenly canceled the blockade and other epidemic prevention measures, officials and many investors in Beijing had expected the economy to recover.</p>
<p>But things are contrary to their wishes.</p>
<p>After a series of investment activities appeared in the end of winter, by this spring, China's investment has stagnated. Exit is shrinking. There are fewer and fewer newly started housing projects. The price is falling. More than one -fifth of young people were unemployed.</p>
<p>In the past few years, when the economy is unsightly, China has tried many remedial measures, such as paying roads and railway construction costs through a large number of loans. During the state, the country had a huge funding for testing and isolation. The use of borrowing for additional stimulus expenditure can stimulate the outbreak of economic activities, but this will be a difficult choice for policy makers who are worried about debt pressure.</p>
<p>"The authorities have the risk of lagging behind the situation in stimulating economic changes, but there is no rapid solution," said Lu Ziyi, an economist who studied Chinese issues in Singapore to study Chinese issues in Singapore.</p>
<p>In order to fight against the new crown virus, China is isolated from the world in the past three years. This decision has prompted many companies to start transferring the supply chain to other places. China now needs to adjust the economy. Chinese leader Xi Jinping <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/">Meet on Monday</a>U.S. Secretary of State Brillings, the two countries tried to ease the tension of diplomatic tensions and paved the way for high -end economic talks in the next few weeks. Such discussions may slow down the increase in recent sanctions and countermeasures.</p>
<p>China's economic recovery is stagnant, and only a few types of expenditures such as tourism and catering have grown strongly. These numbers have increased compared with the extremely low level of the spring of 2022. At that time, the two -month blockade in Shanghai disrupted economic activities in central China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T12-28-41-08-00/00China-Econ-02-hfkc-master1050.jpg" />There are fewer and fewer new residential projects in China. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>The economy is particularly weak in recent weeks.</p>
<p>"From April and May to the present, the economy has obviously unexpected changes, so that some people think that the original judgment may be too optimistic," said Yin Yanlin, former deputy director of the CCP's highest economic decision -making committee, in a speech at an academic conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>Chinese government officials have been hinted that the economic stimulus plan may soon be introduced.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Last Friday, after the meeting held by the Chinese State Council, the new Prime Minister Li Qiang said: "In response to changes in the economic situation, more powerful measures must be taken to enhance development momentum, optimize the economic structure, and promote the continuous rise of the economy."</p>
<p>The weak Chinese economy is also good for the global economy. Over the past four months, Chinese consumers and producers have fallen, which has suppressed Western inflation by lowering the cost of importing from China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T12-28-41-08-00/00China-Econ-03-hfkc-master1050.jpg" />Tourism is one of the few categories of expenditures growing this year. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>But weak demand in China may also exacerbate the global economic slowdown. Earlier this year, Europe has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/business/eurozone-recession-economy.html">in a gentle recession</a>Essence The rapid interest rate hike in the United States has prompted some investors to bet on the United States at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Beijing has taken some measures to regain the economy. Implement tax reduction and exemption policies for small and micro enterprises. Reduce bank deposit interest rates to encourage families to consume more instead of savings. The latest government measures were introduced on Tuesday. The state -controlled banking system reduced the benchmark interest rate of corporate loans and housing mortgage loans.</p>
<p>But many economists at home and abroad are worried about the effectiveness of new measures.</p>
<p>Consumers are unwilling to consume, and investors are cautious about investing in Chinese companies. Compared with 2022, private investment has actually declined so far this year. The real estate market is still in crisis. Developers borrow more funds to repay the existing debt and complete existing projects, although China has been plagued by excess housing supply.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T12-28-41-08-00/00China-Econ-zpmg-master1050.jpg" />Consumers have been cautious, partly because the real estate market as a source of wealth is unstable. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>The housing market is in the center of the troubles currently facing. The construction industry accounts for a quarter of the proportion of China's economy. However, due to the default of the developer's debt and failed to complete the apartment paid by the buyer, the potential buyers have dispelled the buying plan.</p>
<p>Compared with the same period last year, housing construction in the first five months of this year fell by nearly 23%. This shows that the real estate industry will further fall in the next few months.</p>

<p>The 27 -year -old Chen Leiqian (Yin) was engaged in marketing in Beijing. She started to find a house with her boyfriend who had been dating for five years in 2021. But then they decided to continue renting and living after marriage.</p>
<p>"That is, the nation's house prices are falling, and then the economy is not good, but there are too many factors that are unstable," Chen Leiqian said.</p>
<p>Chen Leiqian worked in an online counseling company and cracked down on China in 2021 [Promotional Private Education and Training Industry]](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20210730/china-education-tutors/)Later, two -thirds of her colleagues in her department were fired. She also had a friend who could not afford a mortgage after unemployment in the technology industry, and lost the house due to redeemed.</p>
<p>When looking for an effective plan for a new round of economic stimulus, what may bring the biggest dilemma to policy makers is the cautious attitude of middle -class families like Chen Leiqian.</p>
<p>"You can sprinkle money to people, but if they don't have confidence, they will not spend money," said Elisia Garcia Elero, chief economist of the Asia-Pacific region of France.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T12-28-41-08-00/00China-Econ-04-hfkc-master1050.jpg" />The expenditure of dining in restaurants is growing, but on the other hand, the family strives to repay debts and avoid the purchase of commodities. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>It is not just family to work hard to repay debts, so is the local government, which limits their ability to increase infrastructure expenditure.advertise</p>
<p>The sluggish real estate industry has damaged domestic demand. However, since this year, exports have been flat, and in May, it has actually declined. China's exports have always been strong, and its weakness is particularly noteworthy, because since mid -January, Beijing has allowed RMB to depreciate about 7%against the US dollar. The devaluation of the renminbi has made Chinese export products more competitive in foreign markets.</p>
<p>More exports help create employment opportunities and may make up for the original weak domestic economy. However, it is unclear to how much China can rely on exports to help economic growth, as some of China's largest trading partners have transferred some purchases to other Asian countries.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Trump administration levies tariffs on a series of Chinese industrial products, making US companies buy products from China. Last year, President Biden persuaded Congress to approve extensive subsidies for American products such as electric vehicles and solar panels. Compared with May last year, China's exports to the United States fell 18.2%last month.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-20T12-28-41-08-00/00China-Econ-07-hfkc-master1050.jpg" />The United States has formulated subsidies for electric vehicle production to try to fight against China. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>Now, when considering how to boost the economy, it must cope with the loss of consumer confidence.</p>
<p>Charles Wang (Yin) runs a small tourist company with only eight employees in Zhangjiakou, northern China. After the epidemic, his business rebounded almost completely, but he had no plan to invest in expansion.</p>
<p>"Our economy is actually going down, and everyone does not have so much time and willingness to spend," Charles Wang said. "It's because everyone doesn't want to spend money anymore. Still, everyone is afraid, but rich people are also afraid."</p>

The United States and China are seeking the relationship between the two countries that ease the state of deep freezing. This state has aroused concerns about the increase in the risk of conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>The 35 -minute meeting this time was the climax of Brinken's two -day visit to China. The signal released by the meeting is that at least for the present, the United States and China do not want the relationship between the two countries to be disclosed. Competition and diplomatic efforts have a huge interest relationship.</p>
<p>Blintken and Xi Jinping held a meeting in the magnificent Great Hall on the west side of Tiananmen Square. Xi Jinping often met with politicians here. His opening of the game was harmonious and praised the two sides to make progress on some unexplained issues during the visit of Brinken, saying "this is good."</p>
<p>As the leaders of the two largest economies in the world, President Xi Jinping and President Biden are facing increasing pressure from other countries, asking them to curb the increasingly intense stance of the two governments. The stance of the two countries on major issues is relative: Taiwan issue, Beijing calls this de facto independent island as its territory; China's continuous expansion of military influence; development of advanced technology; Russia's war in Ukraine, and human rights issues.</p>
<p>Many problems have troubled US -China relations for many years. However, as the Chinese military and economic strength increased, and Xi Jinping and his assistants believed that the United States was at the end of decline, the conflict around these problems became more acute. It is unclear whether high -level diplomacy can change the trajectory of the relationship between the two countries, but U.S. officials said that at least they hope that such talks can make the two sides see each other's intentions more clearly and avoid misjudgment.</p>

<p>Officials in Washington and Beijing acknowledged that it is necessary to prevent the sharp decline in relations between the two countries. But even when the two governments explored how to rebuild the relationship during the visits of Brinken, the two sides were trying to show that they would not compromise on the core issue.</p>
<p>In the opening of the meeting with Brinken, Xi Jinping implied China's dissatisfaction. He said: "The exchanges between the country should always be based on mutual respect and sincerity. Make more positive contributions. "</p>
<p>Bollingak said later that he emphasized the needs of "direct participation and continuous communication" in all meetings. Washington has accused the Chinese government of deficiencies in this area. Broskens again on Monday for example: he said that he and assistants urged China to open the military communication channels in the talks -US officials believe that this is related to the crisis of waters and airspace around China. Important -but rejected.</p>
<p>Brinken also said that he also discussed other difficult topics: Ukrainian war, North Korea's nuclear plan, coercion economic policy, illegal detention of American citizens, and suppression in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The State Council stated that Brinton conducted a "frank, deep, and constructive communication" with Xi Jinping, Wang Yi, the highest foreign policy official of Xi Jinping, Chinese highest foreign policy officials, and Minister of Foreign Minister Qin Gang.</p>
<p>When talking about the competition between the two countries, he stated that the United States will "responsible managing the competition, so that the relationship between the two countries will not fall into a conflict" and propose the field of potential cooperation, including climate change, global food security and control of lethal fatal and fatal control.

<p>Blinger heard some fierce words in a two -day interview. On Monday morning, Wang Yi bluntly at the three -hour meeting of the Diaoyutai State Hotel, blaming Washington in Washington.</p>
<p>According to the official information released by China, Wang Yi said that the United States should cooperate with China, not "hype‘ Chinese threat theory ’. He said Washington must cancel sanctions against China and stop suppressing China's technological development. He accused the United States of [providing weapons] to Taiwan <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20221010/taiwan-biden-weapons-china/">provides weapons</a>, "To interfere with China's internal affairs" on issues such as Taiwan.</p>

<p>U.S. diplomats did not express expectations for major breakthroughs before attending the meeting. On the contrary, they emphasized the development channels that have worked hard to rebuild in recent months, and made progress in negotiations of small issues such as visas and commercial flights between the two countries. The two sides agreed to work hard to solve these problems in the next few months.</p>
<p>Blint is the first US Secretary of State to visit Beijing since 2018. When he visited, the relationship between the two sides had fallen to the lowest valley of decades in the past six years. In February, the Pentagon announced that a Chinese reconnaissance balloon was drifting over the United States in the United States -this prompted Brinken to cancel the Beijing trip that was about to perform at that time -the US fighter aircraft received an order to shoot down the balloon, which intensified the tension.</p>

<p>Blindken had confronted Wang Yi during the Munich Safety Conference at the end of February this year. He told Wang Yi that Washington believes that China is considering providing lethal weapons support for Russia's Ukraine War, which has led to further deterioration of relations between the two countries. China's response is to freeze some important diplomatic exchanges and strengthen domestic anti -American propaganda.</p>
<p>Although Biden and its assistants have adopted tough and comprehensive business policies such as export control in the strategic field (especially semiconductor fields) to try to limit China's growth in the strategic field (especially semiconductor fields), and also strengthened military cooperation with Asian countries. The Biden government has a weak attitude towards China. Some Republican councilors even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/politics/republicans-blinken-china.html">criticize Brinken</a>Visit China, saying that this is tantamount to concession to Beijing. When Biden is expected to seek re -election next year, the wording of American politicians on Chinese issues will become more and more intense.</p>
<p>Both officials said that Brinton's visit to China will contribute to other senior US officials to visit Beijing in the near future, including Treasury Minister Jennite Yellen, Commercial Minister Gina Raymond, and the special envoy of the presidential climate change affairs.

<p>Before Brinken's visit to China, China adopted a tough attitude and repeatedly accused the United States of lack of "sincerity". While calling for negotiations, it continued to harm China's interests, whether it was implemented with new sanctions or establishing a trade relationship with Taiwan.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Berlin, 20th) German Prime Minister Xiao Zi met with the visiting Prime Minister of the State Council of the Chinese State Council today. After the meeting, Xiao Zi reiterated the policy of German decentralized trade risks. Do not use risk as an excuse to alienate China.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-20T13-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Agence France -Presse reported that this was the first visit to Li Qiang after taking office, highlighting Beijing's emphasis on improving the relationship between China and the European Union (EU). The EU's criticism of Beijing has become more and more loud.</p>
<p>Germany and the European Union have been harmed due to the interruption of the supply chain interruption of Russia's natural gas and COVID-19 (2019 coronary virus disease). Since then, they have continued to strengthen the "de-risk" action to relieve China.</p>
<p>Olaf Scholz said at a press conference after the talks that Germany is "committed to actively expanding economic relations with Asia and other regions.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiang emphasized that "the lack of growth in the global economic recovery" at a press conference, and "China and Germany, as influential powers, should work closely to promote world peace and development."</p>
<p>Li Qiang also said that investors attach great importance to removing risks. "But if they are in the name of risks, they will decompose or treat some countries to act as possible ... then it will violate market rules and the principles of fair competition."</p>
<p>He also said: "I think most friends in the German industry will not regard China as a risk, nor will they agree to conduct any so -called de -risk actions against China."</p>
<p>Exporting power Germany has always enjoyed a special relationship with China. Former Prime Minister Angelamerkel's administration period, Germany adopted a pragmatic approach to China. On the one hand, China became a major market for German exporters. Obviously not to be revealed.</p>
<p>But to this day, in the first national security strategy report released by the German government a few days before Li Qiang's visit, it is called China as "partners, competitors, and hostile systems". "Facing more and more stress", and ignore human rights.</p>

<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in China on June 18th. When he got off at Beijing, he did not see the Chinese laid red carpet welcoming. I saw the red line on the airport's ground, which caused the outside world to associate with the outside world. American media and other American media interpreted Blinden being treated coldly by Beijing. In the Chinese public opinion field, netizens also rumored to be "extreme humiliation" on platforms such as Twitter and Weibo. We warned "Don't step on the red line" to humiliate the United States.</p>
<p>Asian facts investigation of the laboratory reviewing four pictures of US Secretary of State's visit to China, including Mikepompeo, found that the Chinese side did not necessarily spread the red carpet when getting off the machine, showing that Brinton was treated when they arrived in Beijing. Instead of some media and netizens, they refer to the use of shabby and take the opportunity to humiliate. As for the red line on the ground, it is a fixed line of the airport.</p>
<p><strong> Deep analysis: </strong></p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brosky's visit to China from June 18th to 19th. Since Pompeo's visit to Pompeo in 2018, the highest US diplomat visit to China for the first time; Blints restarted a visit that was postponed by the "spy balloon" incident. The itinerary is regarded by the outside world as a journey of ice breaking in the United States and China.</p>
<p>When Blingken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport on the 18th, Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, and the US ambassador to China, Nicholasburns, took over the plane. The scene of the scene also captured the moment when Brosky stepped on the red line, and this process became the focus of community platforms and media attention.</p>
<p>American media <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/jun/18/no-red-carpet-antony-blinken-beijing-biden-offiica/">Washings Times "(Washington Times)</a><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/antony-blinken-muted-greeting-arrives-china-1807480">"News Weekly"</a>When Blingken arrived in Beijing, there was no red carpet, and it was arranged by the head of the director at the level. China Xinhua News Agency reporter and former deputy editor -in -chief of "Global" magazine Liu Hong's WeChat public account <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SeU0z03Aj2iOvlat6iH45g">"Niu Boqin"</a>The post stated that in the past, the visit of US Secretary of State seemed to have a red carpet, but this time there was no red carpet, but there was a red line; he said that there was no association, "Does the United States know the red line of the Chinese side?"</p>
<p>The above -mentioned "Niu Piano" and "News Weekly" reports have become the source of the media quoted by media in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places. It also commented on the red line instead of the red carpet, telling Brinken not to step on the red line. Many netizens have spread Lincoln's videos and photos on Twitter, Weibo, Douyin and other platforms, and Tuka says that "there are no red carpets on the ground with red lines, everything is simple and extremely humiliated."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T13-40-09-04-00/000002.png" /><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T13-40-09-04-00/000003.png" />U.S. Secretary of State Brills arrived in China on June 18th. There was no red carpet when they got off the plane. The red line was drawn on the airport ground, which became the focus of many netizens and media.

<p>Asian facts check the laboratory to review the videos and photos of the former Secretary of State Pompeo, Rex Tillerson, John Kerry, and HillaryClinton. "In the past, the visit of the Secretary of State of the United States seemed to have a red carpet." For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpJNB2a2XN8">Pompeo's film to Beijing in June 2018</a>It shows that there is no red carpet in the apron, and the red line can be seen on the ground in 31 seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/842968609232228352">Photos of Tillerson's arrival in Beijing in March 2017</a>It shows that China has not paved the red carpet to welcome him, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/statephotos/32659745504/in/photostream/">another photo</a>You can see that there are also red lines on the airport.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T13-40-09-04-00/000005.png" /></p>
<p>When Kerry arrived in Beijing in April 2013, the airport was not laid on the red carpet. According to the US State Department, Xie Feng, the director of the US Department of Foreign Affairs, took over the aircraft.</p>

<p>As for the "red line" across Brosky, the Asian facts check the laboratory based on the International Civil Aviation Organization <a href="https://www.icao.int/SAM/Documents/GREPECAS/2011/GRPAGAAOP8/AGAAOPSG08WP14REv.pdf">Safety Operation Specifications for the Pingping Ping Ping</a>And <a href="https://xxgk.mot.gov.cn/2020/gz/202202/W020220228585885583214.pdf">Regulations on the Safety Management of Transport Airport Operation of Transportation Airport "of the Ministry of Transportation of China</a>Article 122, it is determined that it is a fixed label of the airport, called the "airline safety line". It limits that when the plane just enters or is ready to leave, it is not allowed to enter if it is guided or dragged a vehicle.</p>

<p>Many other netizens posted comparison charts in the social media. Compared with the differences between Blinden and French President Emmanuel Macron, they visited China, saying that Brintken had no red carpet and welcomed in a big battle. It was humiliated.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://politics.people.com.cn/BIG5/n1/2023/0406/c1024-32658827.html">Macron went to China in April this year for state affairs visit</a>, Statevisit (or "country is visiting") is invited by the head of state of one country by the head of state. It is the highest level of diplomatic activities between the two countries. The honor guard, 21 lings, etc.</p>
<p>The levels of Macron and Blintken are different in terms of access. Compared with the Chinese reception specifications of the two, it is meaningless and cannot be used as the evidence of China to humiliate Broscase.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>At least four former Secretary of State of Brosky visited the picture in the visit of the former Secretary of State, and the Asian facts investigating the laboratory found that China may not have to spread a red carpet at the airport to welcome US Secretary of State. As for the pick -up level, when Kerry and Hillary were in the middle of the visit, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also taken over by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the treatment of Brinken when he arrived in Beijing was in line with past practice. Some media and netizens claimed that the Chinese side "replaced the red carpet with the red carpet" shames Boringken, which is not the fact. The "red line" on the ground is the standard line of the airport.</p>

Shawrtz said: "The more we know each other on both sides, the more frequent exchanges, and the smaller the space for misunderstanding."</p>

At a press conference attended by the Prime Minister of Germany, there was no reporter's questioning link at the press conference. It is generally believed that this arrangement is made in accordance with the requirements of China.</p>
<h3>The first security strategy after World War II announced in Germany</h3>
<h3>Corresponding to the climate crisis</h3>
<p>Schildez said that the victims of the country with a large carbon dioxide emissions and climate change will cooperate in response to climate crisis. He talked about China's drought and the flood of the Alpha Valley in Germany. He said that fighting climate change requires the joint efforts of generations.</p>

<h3>Russia and Ukraine War</h3>
<p>When talking about the Russian and Ukraine War, Sharz said that he called on China to bear the responsibility of the UN Security Council's permanent member of the Security Council and exert a necessary influence on Russia. Shawrtz emphasized that only Russia's full withdrawal can achieve fair peace. In addition, China does not export weapons to Russia, which is also crucial. Shawrtz said: "China's position is still a nuclear threat, and even the use of nuclear weapons is absolutely unacceptable. I thank China for adhering to this position, which is also the common position of our two parties."</p>
<p>After the press conference, the German Chancellor Shrz published a tweet: Global problems can only be solved through joint efforts. Imperialist acts are by no means a solution to the problem. Play influence.</p>
<h3>economic decoupling</h3>
<p>Shawrtz emphasized that Germany did not pursue the decoupling with China, but the economic relations between the two sides still face a series of challenges, and some problems need to be improved and resolved. These include the market access issues of German companies in China and create a fair competitive environment. Shawrtz finally said to Li Qiang: "Let's continue the conversation in order to win mutual understanding and deal with global challenges together."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-20T14-26-00Z/65978455_401.jpg" />Lot: It is time to hold government consultations with China regularly.</p>
<p>Compared with German Prime Minister Shulz, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang's speech is very short. He said that China pays attention to the development of Sino -German relations and China -Europe relations, and is also willing to raise Germany and China relations to a new height.</p>
<p>He said that despite the weak global economy, the Chinese economy is still recovering steadily. Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang said: "Germany and China strengthening cooperation in the fields of technology, industry and economic, will also contribute to stabilizing the global economy."</p>
<p>When the German Chancellor Salz praised the results of the Dedaka government for consultation, some politicians also questioned the German -China government's consultation mechanism. Lot, chairman of the Federal House of Foreign Affairs Committee, pointed out: "Whether the regular government consultation with China has a future and it is worth reviewing.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) US Secretary of State <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯告诉习近平拜登认为美中有义务处理好关系/a-65956287">Blinger at the end of the visit to China, I met Chinese leader Xi Jinping</a>It seems to be a positive signal in German media. "South Germany" published a comment, "Sometimes, those who determine the political climate are small words." This comment entitled "Wo Jedes World" wrote::</p>
<p>"'Progress" is such a word. Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping pointed out in a meeting with US Secretary of State Tony Brillings that Sino -US relations have achieved' progress ". And the significance is not only that, this is also a huge political capital, and it must be clever to bet.</p>
<p>The biggest perception of Bollingin's visit to China is that people realize that although there are various competitions between the two sides of the (USA), they still hope to continue their diplomatic efforts and they can still find common languages. Brinken carefully calculated the concession to be accepted by the Chinese side, and the latter also signaled to return to the predictable track -the United States and Xi Jinping under the rule of Trump to strive for the third term and China during the epidemic period. This track. Since 2017, bilateral relations have fallen into a trough. Now, a period of cautious review has begun. How dangerous is the state of nothing to say between the two most powerful economies in the world? There have been sufficient examples in the past few years. The situation that China's system is easy to cause is to cover up the internal weakness by displaying strongly. The domestic anti -China mood in the United States has long been separated from reality. The internal tribe of China has launched a strong competition to see who is more tough to make the country be at a loss.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line</h3>
<p>The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

<h3></h3>
<p>Blingken arrived in Beijing on the morning of June 18, arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in the afternoon to talk with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang. However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."</p>

<h3>Analysis: Pay the way for Xi Jinping to attend the San Francisco APEC Summit in November</h3>
<p>After talking with Qin Gang, Brinken wrote in Twitter that the two sides discussed how to manage the relationship between the two countries in charge through open communication channels. The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>mask meaning</h3>
<p>As can be seen from the photos, the US delegations led by Brinken were led by the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and a member of the Central Political Bureau and the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee. The personnel were wearing a mask, and the US personnel also put on the mask "with the customs" in addition to Blink. In March of this year, the picture reached by Beijing AIDS reached an agreement showed that in the three -party talks, all officials did not wear a mask, which was in sharp contrast to the picture of Beijing officials now meeting with Bollingken.</p>

<h4>What details are eye -catching?</h4>
<h3>suspense revealed</h3>
<p>Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be in the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.</p>

From an economic perspective, neither the United States and China are allowed to start a war to compete for the scope of influence, and military, such a showdown will have no winners. Therefore, it is wise to consider how to manage this relationship. The United States took the initiative and China responded. After long -term mutual communication, this result cannot be underestimated. "</p>
<h3>Competitive partner</h3>
<p>The "Daily" published by Berlin focuses on the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang led a group to visit Berlin to participate in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/难度高悬念大德中政府磋商全面开启/a-65972739">intergovernmental consultation between Germany and Chinese government</a>Essence The author believes that China is launching a charm of Europe, and Germany is still regarded by China as the most important partner in the European Union. But this article entitled "Berlin's popular carpet from Beijing's opponents" wrote:</p>
<p>"However, the German government should not be blinded by Shun Er's words. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has undergone tremendous changes. It's right.</p>
<p>Beijing's increasingly offensiveness internationally shows its increasingly aggressiveness, its increasing military threat to Taiwan, the thorough suppression of the Hong Kong democratic movement, and the stronger intervention of economic activities, all of which have made Germany's domestic attitude towards China very Great impact. No one has talked about ‘it’ s a transformation with trade ’. Nonetheless, as the German Federal Prime Minister Shulz (Social Party) said last week, it was the timing of dialogue, ‘‘ in the current world situation, mutual exchanges are very meaningful. ‘</p>
<h3>is how to re -position relations with China</h3>
<p>The German government holds a pragmatic optimism on this issue, and the government spokesman WolfgangBüchner said he looked forward to a 'good and constructive communication ". The theme of this consultation is ‘Common and Sustainable Action’, which is intended to emphasize the level of partners in relations with Chinese relations. Regarding Germany -China relations, Berlin is tirelessly described as the definition of "partners, competitors and strategic rivals".</p>
<p>However, recently, the center of gravity is increasingly biased towards the direction of strategic opponents. The national security strategy announced in Berlin this Wednesday also shows this. The strategy emphasizes that China has repeatedly adopted the interests and values of the interests and values of us (Germany) ', and at the same time, the development partnership and the possible areas of realistic possible areas are narrowing.</p>
<p>The article finally wrote: "The lessons of the Russian relations have been absorbed. The federal government has a huge dependence on Germany to China (compared to Russia) and chose the slogan of" de-Risking ". Reduce risks and dependence so that Beijing will be threatened to implement and attack Taiwan. However, for some German companies and multinational companies, its dependence on the Chinese market and production bases has to be so great that it has to do so, and has to do it. Long -term transformation. "</p>

<p>As U.S. Secretary of State Brillings ended its visit to China, the Wall Street Journal was quoted on June 20 that it was quoted by news officials that China and Cuba were undergoing negotiations and planned to establish a new joint military training facility on the coast of northern Cuba. This will allow China to station in the army only 100 miles away from the Florida coast of the United States and start intelligence and other military operations. The report disclosed that the above -mentioned related negotiations have entered the later stage, but no conclusion has been obtained.</p>
<p>Johnkirby, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said in a press conference to answer media questions at a press conference on Tuesday that China has been working hard to improve its influence and intelligence collection capabilities in the Western Hemisphere. This includes the relationship between them and Cuba for a long time. The United States does not know or not monitored or did not take measures. He also said that the United States will continue to take measures to protect their secrets and national security.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning responded to the relevant questions at a regular press conference on Tuesday: "I don't understand the situation you mentioned. I hope that the relevant parties will use more energy on things that are conducive to improving mutual trust and regional peaceful development. "</p>
<p><strong> US media: </strong> <strong> China plans to establish new military training facilities in Cuba </strong></p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, the information of China's establishment of new military training facilities in Cuba has caused alert to the United States. The Biden government has contacted Cuban officials to try to stop the plan, and at the same time, it also understands the concerns of Cuba's might transfer some sovereignty.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that new military facilities can provide a platform for China, making it possible to permanently garrison in Cuba to expand information collection activities for the United States, including electronic eavesdropping. The most concerned about the United States is that this planning facility is part of China's "141 project". The project aims to expand the global military base and logistics support network of the Chinese military, and set up 15 overseas bases within 10 years, but Beijing has never acknowledged the existence of the plan.</p>
<p>U.S. officials also revealed that the Central and Middle Schools have jointly operated 4 eavesdropping stations in Cuba. A few days ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that China plans to establish a new monitoring station in Cuba. The White House later confirmed publicly that at least since 2019, China has had intelligence collection facilities in Cuba.</p>

Expert: China announces global ambitions </strong></p>
<p>Yao Cheng, a former Chinese Naval Command in the United States, told this station: "Because many space satellites in the United States, including space aircraft launch, many of them are in Florida. Cuba's location is very important to monitor American space operations. Intelligence collection stations are very necessary. (The Communist Party of China) has this plan long ago, including establishing some relay stations in some island nations in the South Pacific. It is for the need for space warfare. "</p>
<p>Yao Cheng emphasized that China's establishment of intelligence collection facilities in Cuba will pose a great threat to the United States: "It is no doubt that the American Biden government has alertness on it. Go to pressure. "However, he believes that China is unlikely to establish a military training facility in Cuba.</p>
<p>Patrickcroning, director of the Asia -Pacific Project Institute of the Hudson Institute of the American Think Tank, told this station: "For some time, people know that China has been expanding the global network of ports and intelligence facilities. As far as China is concerned, in Cuba near Florida to establish military training facilities and signal intelligence facilities, I think anyone in the military or national security community in Washington will not be surprised by this. This is that China is declare its global ambitions and the world. Military existence. "</p>
<p>Cronin believes that the United States may not prevent Cuba from establishing military training facilities and intelligence facilities in Cuba. As for how to cope with China's threat, he said: "The United States will continue to establish its allies and partner networks, especially in the Asia -Pacific region. China regards this as a threat to China, but the United States and its allies and partners will regard this as their own. Defense.

<p><strong> Beijing refuses Brinkei's suggestion that the White House officials will call on China to restore the communication between the two armies </strong></p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brills just ended a visit to China on Monday, but this trip did not allow Beijing to agree to restore the communication channels between the two armies to avoid misjudgment. On Tuesday (20th), the White House National Security Council is responsible for the senior director of China and Taiwan affairs, Sarah Belan(Sarahbera)At a briefing about this interview, the establishment of military communication is essential for reducing the friction between the two global powers.Bonnieglaser, director of the Asian project in the Marshall Foundation in the United States, tweeted a few days ago that the fact that China's refusal to restore military communication channels is disappointing and worrying. Beijing obviously does not accept the framework of "big country competition" proposed by the Biden government at all, which makes people question whether it is possible to stable relationships between the United States and China.</p>
<p><strong> Expert: China regards resistance to military dialogue as a means </strong> <strong> US -China confrontation is difficult to cool down </strong></p>
<p>Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu refused to meet with US Secretary of Defense Austin at the Shangri -La Security Summit earlier this month. Since 2018, Li Shangfu has been sanctioned by the United States for participating in the Chinese military from a sanctioned Russian company to buy fighter aircraft and missile systems.</p>
<p>Cronin believes that the impact of the lack of military communication channels in the United States and China will not be too great: "In the sea area or airspace near China, as well as the East China and the South China Sea, the possibility of incidents is very high. Above the sex event (ALOCALINCIDENT). Nevertheless, it is very beneficial to perform more direct military dialogue to avoid such local events. "He also said that China may still change its position in the next few months and restore it to restore Military dialogue.</p>
<p>Crotning also pointed out that the US sanctions on China's defense director Li Shangfu are not the main cause of Beijing's resistance to military dialogue. "China does not want to be decentralized or turning on the activities of the US military in the South China Sea, Taiwan and the East China Sea." He said that for China, they also resisted the dialogue between the two armies as a means to apply to Washington Influence is to change its support for Taiwan, as well as alliances and partnership networks that are continuously expanded in the region.</p>
<p>Yao Cheng believes that the reason why the US -China military dialogue is difficult to recover is that on the one hand, the United States has not revoked sanctions on Li Shangfu. "Second, the confrontation between China and the United States has been upgraded from all aspects of trade, economy, and diplomacy to military confrontation. Status. This is irreplaceable. I think the military confrontation between the United States and China can only be upgraded and will not cool down. "Yao Cheng pointed out that the military encirclement formed by the first island chain to China has become increasingly obvious, and Beijing has also seen Beijing. At this point, Xi Jinping's so -called bottom -line thinking and extreme thinking are based on fighting. The battle in the United States and China may be unavoidable. He believes that the reason why China receives Bollingin visits China is mainly to ease the current situation of military confrontation and strive for more time and space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-06192023132239.html"><strong> Brinken ended his visit to Huamei and China Agreement "Stable Relationship" </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/gt1-06192023055614.html">Xi Jinping's last time to meet with Brinden's significance of Sino -US relations</a></strong></p>
<p>Although the expectations of Blingken's trip were not high, they could successfully visit China, and dialogue with Xi Jinping, the top leader of China and the director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the CPC Central Committee. Channels are still regarded as new hopes into the U.S. -China relations that have turned sharply.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Blingken's communication records of the visit to China still show a significant difference between the US -China relations between the two countries. According to the website of the US Embassy in China, in fact, Brincken emphasized to the outside world after meeting Xi Jinping on Monday that there is no fantasy in the United States' challenges to manage US -China relations. "On many issues, we are deeply and even fiercely or even fiercely. Hold different opinions. "</p>
<p><strong> The first buttons have not been buckled </strong></p>
<p>According to Chinese official media reports, Xi Jinping mentioned when meeting with Brinton that the competition between large powers does not meet the trend of the times, and it cannot solve the problems of the United States itself and the challenges facing the world. China respects the interests of the United States and will not challenge and replace the United States. Similarly, the United States must respect China and not harm China's legitimate rights and interests.</p>
<p>The phrase "the competition of great powers is not in line with the trend of the times." Obviously, there is conflict with the US information from the outside world. Since President Biden took office, the US government has been emphasizing that the two countries are competitive relations in the United States and China, but China seems to be unwilling to admit it.</p>
<p>Li Weidong, president of the magazine of the Overseas Political Political Publication "China Strategy Analysis", believes that when Xi Jinping said this, the word "competition" was "competitive". "From the perspective of Xi, or in China, the competition mentioned in the United States is confrontation. Therefore, he said that competition does not meet the trend, and it is actually saying that confrontation does not meet the trend. China believes that you just want to block me, suppress me, and the banner of competition is actually fighting me. "</p>
<p>Li Weidong quoted a statement of Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, saying that in China ’s view, when the United States dealt with US -China relations,“ the first buttons were deducted wrong ”.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Qin Gang said at a press conference at a session of the 14th National People's Congress. This first button is wrong, which has led to the entire US policy of the United States from the right track of rationality and health. "</p>
<p>Li Weidong believes that in fact, China has misjudgment of the United States. "First of all, the United States does not want to hinder China's economic development, and China's economic development is also beneficial to the United States. It is difficult to reverse, which is also the tragedy between the United States and China. "Brincken said clearly when answering questions from the United States Cable Television News (CNN). The reason for restricting high -end chips is that your production of hypersonic missiles threatened the United States from the United States. National security, so I have to restrict you; and China said that my hypersonic missile was not targeted at you. You didn't come to my house's door. This hypersonic missile has nothing to do with you. "</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan, director of the Department of International Studies and Contemporary Linguistics of St. Tomas University in the United States, also believes that Xi Jinping's words focus on the word "competition", but his understanding is different. It is unfavorable to China, because as far as the global economic situation is concerned, when many countries slowly point their finger to China, it will actually have a certain negative impact on its economic development or stability of the regime. "</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan noticed that Xi Jinping actually wanted to dilute the word competition. "We can often see that when Xi Jinping talked about related issues, he did not use the words 'competition'. Many times they are talking about the cooperation between big powers. "</p>
<p>China is obviously not afraid of competing with the United States. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday (June 20) that China is negotiating with Cuba to establish a new joint military training facility in the local area, and the United States has been alert to this; The target 2025 plan and China have continued to increase pressure in the Taiwan Strait region in the past two years, and various signs have shown that China's initiative to compete with the United States.</p>
<p>"Therefore, Xi Jinping's lecture on weakening the" big country's competition "did not reduce the doubts of the United States, nor did it really transform the competition between the two countries into cooperation," Ye Yaoyuan commented.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T15-33-00-04-00/000002.png" />Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with POOL Photo Via AP in the Great Hall of the People on June 19, 2023 <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/wy-06202023102946.html/ap23170334217494.jpg">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-20T15-33-00-04-00/000003.png)</a><strong> Military communication? No!</strong>Since Pelosi visited Taiwan in early August last year, China has canceled the military exchange mechanism between the United States and China. At the beginning of June this year, US Secretary of Defense Lloydaustin also said when he visited Japan that China rejected the suggestion of the two countries during the Singapore's Shangri -La Safety Dialogue and emphasized that this was "unfortunate."</p>
<p>Regarding China's refusal to restore the US -China military exchanges, Li Weidong believes that this is not an essential issue. "This is actually very simple. How many times have been said at the Shangri -La Summit? China has requested the dismissal of Li Shangfu. Either you don't want to communicate, or you don't want to accept a communication under humiliation, that is, if you are sanctioning me, you have to talk to me, then I will not talk about it. "</p>
<p>Li Shangfu was appointed Minister of Defense in March this year. In 2018, the United States sanctioned Li Shangfu, then the Minister of Equipment Development of the CPC Central Military Commission in accordance with the "Agreement of the U.S. Martial Arts Act". The US State Department pointed out that this sanction is related to the purchase of ten Su-35 fighters in 2017 and the purchase of S-400-to-air missile system related equipment in 2018. At the end of May this year, the U.S. State Department made a statement that it would not lift the sanctions against Li Shangfu.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan believes that the purpose of China's refusal of military exchanges is to put pressure on the United States. "The so -called military communication between the two sides is to slow down the possibility of military conflicts, but if the bridge of this communication is not constructed, it is equivalent to this potential. Risks or pressures to bear the United States, which is also a kind of intimidation of China to the United States to some extent. "</p>
<p>However, according to the Radio of Hong Kong, Yang Tao, the director of the US Department of Foreign Affairs, said that when the visit to China was evaluated, the visit logo had a new beginning, but the United States must know the difficulties of the difficulty of military exchanges between China and the United States. He did not explain what the reason was here.</p>

So, will this situation go to a civil war in the United States?</p>
<p>French historian Ran Halévi published in the newspaper <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/ran-halevi-apres-l-inculpation-de-donald-trump-le-risque-de-la-guerre-civile-20230619">article</a>According to China, Trump may not be able to get rid of his dilemma this time, although the legal difficulties that may destroy any political figure life like this have not shaken him. , Defamation and paying the sealing fee to the stars -below, try to appear in the image of the victim, so as to wait to complete the continuous investigation of other allegations, encourage his supporters and increase his support in Republican voters Essence</p>
<p>Research director of the National Science Research Center in France explained that due to the extremely serious allegations against Trump, once he was convicted, he would be punished and may have been in prison for too many years.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-20T15-45-21/image-1-1686826059.jpg" />Former American President Trump(news agency)In this trial, for the first time, the former president of the United States appeared in court. The Federal Court will sue him with national crimes. In addition, these trials will be carried out at the same time as the presidential campaign. During this period, Trump will have to allocate time between the public platform and the defendant, and if he has won nominations for the Republican presidential candidate, then he will also respond to criminal allegations and repeated victims on conspiracy theories against the United States. Specification time between people. In the case of tearing the atmosphere of the polarization of Americans, 80%of the Democrats believe that Republicans pose a threat to the country, and Republicans have the same view of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The researchers pointed out that the allegations of the former president were very serious, and although according to Trump, they disclosed a judicial gang of "serious abuse". The author believes that the behavior of taking thousands of copies of confidential materials (even includes tight materials) is difficult to understand. Under the circumstances that the preservation of these materials and documents is illegal, this is a intentional violation of the "Spy Law". Just as his lawyer repeatedly told him, especially in view of Trump's negligence of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the storage secret materials as his campaign theme, he asked Hillary to imprison.</p>

<h4>Hard to explain</h4>
<p>Hallevi was surprised by Trump's practice of retaining these sensitive documents, because these documents had nothing else except that these documents could be sent to prison. Although he was required to return these documents many times, he still issued a false statement, only returned some of the documents, and kept other documents in the temporary location in his home, and said "in my mind Among them, these documents have been decrypted. "</p>
<p>The author believes that the interpretation of this evolutionary and unprecedented legal event that has evolved into a political confrontation can be attributed to Trump’s narcissism, arrogance, indifference to the truth, and strong consciousness outside the law. He is a "loser", and he and his supporters still think that he was overthrown in an unfair way, and he should be re -elected.</p>
<p>After mentioning allegations against him, Trump admitted that the kind Americans were the target of this judicial farm. He also said, "If these Republicans are as expected as their wishes, then my affairs will not end. The persecution of Christians and active people, he also added when he talked about President Biden, saying, "A corrupt president surrounded by thugs is trying to destroy the democracy of the United States."</p>

A member of Arizona stated that "with the eyes with the eyes", and another Trump supporters warned that government followers and their media partners- "If they will drive President Trump to step down, then they will be will be Facing the accountability of 75 million Americans.

Let the Ringno face the risk of sudden changes in the US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>MPs, Susadin Adu, asked the government on Tuesday (June 20) in the House of Representatives whether the government planned to link the ringgit to the US dollar to solve the problem of the recent depreciation of the ringgit. When the Ministry of Finance, Ahmad Maslan, pointed out that the government would not do so.</p>
<p>Ahmad Maslan said that the linked to the United States and the US dollar may lead to further rise in the interest rate (OPR) overnight. He said that Malaysia's overnight policy interest rate was 3%, and the United States was 5.25%. "If the value of the ringing currency is fixed at RM3.80, the overnight policy interest rate will also increase to 5.25%."</p>
<p>He said: "The current overnight policy interest rate of 3%has made the people very uncomfortable. If the interest rate of overnight policy is raised to 5.25%, the situation will be worse." The State Bank of Malaysia (central bank) announced in May this year that the overnight policy interest rate is announced. Raise 25 basis points to 3%. This is the first time that the central bank has raised overnight policy interest rates since 2022.</p>
<p>Ahmad Maslan said that after the link between the ringgit and the US dollar, Malaysia also needs to use a large amount of reserves to maintain the ring value. Authorities will also implement capital control and cause capital flows to be no longer free, because foreign funds will be restricted by then in Malaysia.</p>
<p>He emphasized that in the uncertain global financial market, a flexible ringgit exchange rate can reduce the impact of market changes on domestic economic activities. "The government will continue to increase national economic growth and competitiveness, attract foreign funds and investment inflows, thereby supporting the strong value of the ringing currency."</p>

The optimism of tourism throughout the summer is around many tourism -related stocks.</p>
<p>The US Transport Safety Administration said last Friday that more than 2.7 million people on Thursday (15th) alone passed the US Airport checkpoint to surpass the level before the 2019 epidemic.

<p>Although Forbes Magazine did not include Harding in the "Billionaire Club", Harding obviously still has enough financial resources to support its expensive adventure hobbies.</p>
<p>A year ago, he became the first British to participate in Blue Origin, a subsidiary of Jeff Bezos, a 5th manned space mission of Blue Origin, to travel.</p>

<p>In April 1912, at the time, Titani, who claimed to be a giant, sailed from a virgin virgin flight from Southampton, Britain, and sank in the North Atlantic. More than 1,500 of more than 1,200 passengers and crew members were killed.</p>
