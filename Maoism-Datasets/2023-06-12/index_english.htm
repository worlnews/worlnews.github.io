<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, the recruitment system seems to be out of order. In the past 20 years, most European countries have abolished the obligation to serve military service. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国取消义务兵役制-志愿兵进入兵营/a-15210272">For example, Germany suspended the recruitment system in 2011</a>Essence Only in the Federal House of the House of Federal House can start again under the tension or national defense situation stipulated in the Basic Law.</p>
<p>There are similar situations in many other European countries. Today, among the 29 European countries, including Turkey, only 6 countries have maintained the recruitment system since 1993. The situation of Britain, the United States, and Canada has lasted for at least 50 years.</p>
<p>In view of Russia's war against Ukraine, some countries have now begun some reflection. Some countries not only increase the national defense budget, but also discuss the re -implementation of the compulsory military service system, but these debates have only progressed among a few countries.</p>
<p><strong> Ukraine and Lithuania </strong></p>
<p>Shortly after Crimea was annexed, Ukraine and Lithuania re -implemented the obligation system for young men in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Then after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian government promulgated a law, and all men aged 18 to 60 could be called to join the army based on this law.</p>
<h3>"If the Russian army attacks Kiev again, I will participate in the battle"</h3>
<p><strong> Latvia </strong></p>
<p>This Baltic country is one of the three NATO members bordering Russia. The other two countries are Estonia and NATO New members Finland, which have never abolished the compulsory military service system. Now Latvia also wants to re -introduce the compulsory military service. Starting in 2024, all men aged 18 to 27 must receive 11 months of military training; since 2028, 7,500 Latvians will be called to join the army every year-according to NATO, this is the country's 2022 Number of professional soldiers.</p>
<p><strong> Romania </strong></p>
<p>In 2015, Romania's attempt to re -introduce the obligation system after the collapse of the Berlin wall failed, but in this spring, the current prime minister and retired general Nicolaeciuca once again expressed support for the support of obligations. A specific requirement of the Romanian Ministry of Defense is that under the circumstances, young Romanian people living abroad must report to military service within 15 days.</p>
<p><strong> Dutch and Sweden </strong></p>
<p>The Dutch armed forces lack about 9,000 recruits. This is why the Dutch government is considering strengthening the army through the compulsory military service system, as Sweden has done since 2018. Sweden abolished the compulsory military service system in 2010, but because sufficient volunteers could not be found to serve military service, this method was introduced in 2018. From then on, all Swedes, who are 18 years old, must report to the army, but like neighbor Norway: In the end, only a small number of people will be recruited.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T-19-29-00Z/65310543_401.jpg" />German Defense Minister Pestorius proposed the voluntary military service system shortly after taking office</p>
<p><strong> Norway and Denmark </strong></p>
<p>Since 2016, all Norwegians must be reported at the age of 18. However, only about 9,000 candidates participating in physical fitness tests each year were called for 19 months of military service. Due to the strict selection process, the official claims that the service in Norway's military service is similar to the reputation of other higher education education. Denmark in the northern neighbor of Germany still retains the recruitment system in law, but in fact, in the past few years, it has sufficient volunteers to fill the needs of troops.</p>
<p><strong>France</strong></p>
<p>French President Macron launched the "Service Nationalunivers" in 2019. In this framework, young people can voluntarily serve the country for a month. Now the French government is considering allowing all young people aged 15 to 17 to participate, two of them are completed in military -related institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Germany</strong></p>
<p>Germany Prime Minister Shulz rejected the voluntary military service system proposed by Minister of Defense Borispistorius. Recently, Evahögl, a German Federal Parliament, who is also the Society of the Social Democratic Party as the Semitz and Pestorius, suggested that the possibility of "voluntary service" in the army or civic institutions should be discussed.</p>

<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) A spokesman of the European Commission said on Monday (June 5) that a report from market participants received possible fraud reports involved some sustainable biofuels that have been certified.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that the European Commission was cooperating with state -to -laws and investigating these suspected cases with national cooperation. He also said that as the investigation is in progress, the number of imports will not be provided.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the matter said the complaint was proposed by Germany.</p>
<p>Bio -fuel is made of animal or plant waste. For example, it is made of vegetable oil, farm by -products, animal fat, etc. Bio -fuel is considered more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels.</p>
<h3>Garbage into fuel</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the European Commission said that fuel suppliers operate fossil fuels and biofuels in the international market. The European Commission "invites all economic actors to participate in the biofuel market to fully investigate and report any suspicious situation." He said: "The European Union treats any scams very seriously and will take appropriate action without hesitation to protect the integrity of its biofuel market."</p>
<p>The biofuel industry organization "European Waste and Advanced Biofee Fuel Association" (EWABA), in a letter sent to the European Commission and the German government last week, talked about the "terrible" situation caused by Chinese biological diesel imports to the European Union. The letter said that the exports of biological diesel in China have recently increased, which is considered to have possible fraud, and this situation "suppresses the entire EU's biological diesel market" and leads to the closure of relevant factories.</p>
<p>This letter also stated that only by waste, "sustainability and traceability is the unquestionable" biofuel, can it be promoted in the European Union. The letter said that unless the containment measures are adopted and a voluntary certificate of the use of suspicious fuel restrictions from countries outside the EU, "we will soon embark on an irreversible path, which will eventually lead to the entire collapse of the EU industry."</p>

Nothing was brought. We were scared." Because of the violent attack last Thursday (June 1), she and many residents left Shebienino.</p>
<p>Vyacheslavgladkov, governor of Belgorod, Russia, said that it was also attacked on Friday, causing 2,500 people to escape to temporary shelter. The local government arranged an evacuation, but some residents found it difficult to escape from the local area. A resident named Svetlana said: "The evacuation work is very poor; it is more like a word of mouth. The hotline number provided cannot be connected. There is a voice after dialing, please wait. You dial. What you dial. The number cannot be used at present. I have to find someone who can take me out by myself. "</p>
<p>Habikino, which has 40,000 residents, is only about 5 kilometers from the southwestern border of Russia. The locals said that in the past few months, the place has been shelled intermittently, but the intensity of the attack on Thursday has been paralyzed in the last Thursday. The video screen released by local news agencies in social media can be seen that the streets are shrouded in smoke, the buildings are destroyed, and the shell fragments are seen everywhere on the road. The local government said that at least 12 people were injured in the past 48 hours, and two women died.</p>

"The Ukrainian government denied any implication with these militants, but a Ukrainian military official admitted that he had" cooperated "with these groups.</p>
<p>Earlier in May, these "volunteers" group claimed to be a "volunteer" group composed of Russians who fought in Ukraine attacked the front line of the Belgore. Observer generally believes that these attacks embarrassed the Kremlin palace and caused people to worry about the Russian frontline territory that may be easily attacked.</p>
<h3>"We don't know who will protect us"</h3>
<p>The locals are also very worried. "We don't know who protects us and helps us." A student directly shouted in a video released in Telegram. He also expressed the anger of many people living in the region. "Why do we escape here? Push the front line away from us and save Belgore and Sipkino."</p>
<p>In view of the increasing number of raids in Russia in Russia in recent weeks, some residents in Belgore asked the governor to announce that the region entered an emergency so that they could get national compensation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T07-29-00Z/65787689_401.jpg" />"I don't know who will protect us"</p>
<p>They told Germany that the voice of Germany felt abandoned by the authorities. Switrana asked, "Do our government need us? ... They regard people from the border area as dispensable."</p>
<p>In an interview with the Voice of Germany, some residents were criticized for war, but they could not share this view publicly, and they explained that they were a minority in Shebiekino. A woman who was unwilling to disclose a full name said: "We should withdraw troops from the territory of other countries and return Crimea and the occupied territory to Ukraine; the authorities must take care of their own nationals first."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国情报机构普京权力未现削弱之势/a-65707629">Russian President Putin</a>It was not publicly stated that there was much worry about being attacked by the border area. On Thursday, on the day he was severely attacked by Shebiekno, he did not show abnormalities when he met some children, and one of them asked him if he was more powerful than Santa.</p>
<p>When asked about the attack on the drone, Putin's spokesman Pesovov(Dmitry Peskov)It seems to be diluting this attack, just saying: "Of course, this cannot affect the process of special military operations."</p>
<p>Political Analysts, Senior Researcher Tatianastanovaya, a senior researcher at the Carnegie International Peace Foundation, said on Wednesday that Putin's strategy is to "keep silent as much as possible, say failure as success, not entangled in the attack, so that no way You need to respond or make excuses. When dealing with domestic institutions and elites, Putin has been following the same "Don't make things bigger" for a long time. "</p>

<p>Description: The German Makato China Research Center released a study this week that in the past, Beijing has always tended to make economic coercion to other countries in an informal and uninterrupted way; in recent years The rising demand for sanctions is rising, and China is starting to improve its own sanctions policy tools.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) This research report begins, [EU] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟出台反制工具-对外来经济胁迫说不/a-65849853">EU</a><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705">Considering sanctions on Chinese companies that bypass Western sanctions on the West</a>Therefore, it is necessary to understand what countermeasures China may take in advance.</p>
<p>The author believes that compared with informal and uninterrupted economic stress, the Chinese government has not used formal sanctions in the past. China did not have recently developed policy tools for improving sanctions, and the legal framework represented by the Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law allowed the Beijing authorities to impose sanctions and anti -sanctions more frequently than in the past.</p>
<p>Studies have pointed out that in 2018, a trade war with the United States was a critical moment, although a series of countermeasures promulgated by China at that time were temporarily not "sanctions". Another important time node was in 2021: At that time, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States sanctioned a series of Chinese officials and institutions on the infringement of human rights issues in Xinjiang, and Beijing quickly sacrificed countermeasures. Foreign Sanctions "](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国出台反制裁法-在华外企考虑双循环/a-57980466)Essence A set of legal frameworks around the law allowed the Chinese government to obtain a considerable space for free tailoring, which can decide when, who targets and what sanctions are implemented.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T07-30-00Z/17595608_404.jpg" />German think tank Makato China Research Center(MERICS)It also became the anti -counterpart of the Chinese authorities in the dispute over the Xinjiang human rights issue in 2021</p>
<p>The author analyzed a number of cases, including the deputy minister of the Lithuanian traffic and communication department of 2022 in the summer of 2022, and the deputy minister of the Ministry of Communications and the Communications visited Taiwan by Chinese sanctions and US Congress McCull(Michael McCaul)Meeting with Tsai Ing -wen was sanctioned by China. The assets of the sanctions in China are frozen and prohibit Chinese citizens and institutions from conduct any transactions with the sanctions. The author pointed out that there are signs that China ’s use of such formal sanctions has become more and more frequent.</p>
<p>After analyzing 39 Chinese sanctions cases from 2012 to 2023, researchers came to a series of conclusions. The author pointed out that there are three important time nodes in building their own sanctions tools: the Sino -US trade war in 2018, the Xinjiang human rights dispute in 2021, and 2022 Russia suffered Western sanctions. Since 2018, the number of foreign sanctions implemented unilaterally in China has risen rapidly. Most of them are targeted at the American individuals and institutions, mainly for the United States' "interference in the internal affairs" on the issue of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang. The author believes that this trend will not change much in the future.</p>
<p>Studies have also invested the main means of Chinese sanctions, including: mainly for personal domestic asset freezing, visa entry bans, and prohibiting cooperation with Chinese entities; mainly for enterprises' import and export trade control. The author pointed out that the current ability to designate financial sanctions in China is still extremely limited, but the recent policy debate has shown that Beijing has at least interested interest to lay a legal foundation for financial sanctions. At present, the legal framework of Chinese sanctions is mainly based on the "Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law" and "Unreliable Entitution List". At the same time, the tools of China's foreign economic struggle are still a combination of formal sanctions and informal measures.</p>

<h3>Merics: Continue the mission and not forget the original intention</h3>
<p>There are four institutions on the Chinese sanctions list, namely the EU Council's Political and Security Council, the Human Rights Branch of the European Parliament, the Danish Democratic Alliance Foundation, and the German Makato China Research Center. Among them, the Merics Research Center (Merics), as a think tank, has attracted particular attention. Hu Xi, the editor -in -chief of the Chinese official media "Global Times", said that cutting off the connection between the agency and China, "means that the research channel of the research center is unsustainable, and the influence will be severely hit." The German think tank issued a statement responded that it was very regrettable for the Chinese decision and rejected these allegations at the same time. "As an independent research institution, we are committed to improving a better and more diverse understanding of China. We will continue to pursue this mission by providing factual analysis.

<h3>"Rongguang" origin</h3>
<p>"Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" was first released during the LIHKG online discussion area, commonly known as "Lian Deng" during the Hong Kong Democratic protest movement in August 2019. The dictionary authors were anonymous.</p>
<p>The composer signed "Thomas" (Tomas), a 20 -year -old full -time musician. The lyrics were modified by his original lyrics based on the advice of "Lian Deng" netizens under his call.</p>
<p>This four -stage song with Cantonese lyrics was described as a "military song" when the discussion area was released. The lyrics also clearly mentioned content such as "democracy and freedom" and "building freedom glorious Hong Kong".</p>
<p>Tomas, who has never been disclosed, told BBC in 2019 that he hopes that this song can "unite Hong Kong people and enhance the morale of the people."</p>

<p>Image adding text,From the end of 2022 to 2023, there have been three events in the sports competition participating in the Hong Kong team or athletes, which have been mistaken for the "National Anthem" played by Hong Kong as the "National Anthem" playback:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In November 2022, the Asian Seven Rugby Series Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Team. The Hong Kong team defeated the South Korean team to win the championship in the finals. At the ceremony, "Wish to Back to Hong Kong" was played as the Chinese National Anthem. Although the hosted direction of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments apologized afterwards, the Hong Kong police still launched on whether the incident involved the "Crossing the National Anthem Regulations" <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-63635439">Criminal Investigation</a>* December of the Asian Classic Jianli Championship, the organizer missed "Rongguang" as the national anthem player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In February 2023, when the Hong Kong Ice Hockey Team participated in the third level of the World Ice Hockey Championship, the organizer broadcast the wrong national anthem. Some teammates stopped gestures and stopped. After that, the conference apologized and corrected. The Hong Kong Bing Association submitted a report afterwards, admitting that it was not successfully inspected the national anthem with the organizer at that time, but denied that the Hong Kong Sports Association stated that its allegations were held with a avoidance attitude.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>"Open Prevale</h3>
<p>The scope of applications for the prohibition of the Hong Kong government on "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" is currently unclear, but whether it will be the same as the "Hong Kong National Security Law", it can be illegally listed as illegal Hong Kong as one of the concerns.</p>
<p>For a long time, Hong Kong has been an exception of mainland China's review system, allowing foreign companies to operate relatively freely here.</p>
<p>Use Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to search this song in mainland China.</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong media reports, the Hong Kong government's application for the ban on the court mentioned that the 32 links related to "Rongguang" were mentioned in YouTube.</p>
<p>It is believed that the efforts of the Hong Kong government to strengthen restrictions may further damage the status of Hong Kong's Asian financial and economic centers -many multinational companies have transferred personnel to Singapore and other regions. In the future, more companies may choose to stay away from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>During the 2018 World Cup qualifier, some audiences raised a piece of paper printed on the Hong Kong team competition stand</p>
<p>The New York Times quoted people from the technology industry that if the Hong Kong government's application is approved, the ban may bring review difficulties and costs to American technology companies operating in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Chen Yan, managing director of the Asian Group and the person in charge of the public policy of Public Police, Meta Greater China, described the newspaper that the Hong Kong government's decision to use the court was to "open the gate."</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong media analyzed that if Google, Facebook, etc. do not comply with the ban on the Hong Kong court, the responsibilities of execution may fall on the network suppliers in Hong Kong, resulting in the possibility of Google and other platforms to be blocked in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On Saturday (June 10), Taiwan's focus on human rights groups in Hong Kong initiated a parade, gathered in Taipei Free Plaza and sang "Wish Glory to Hong Kong". It is also reported that Hong Kong people around the world are working hard to contact the local radio and broadcast the song on Monday.</p>

The epidemic has led to the isolation and alienation between the country, and the Russian -Ukraine conflict brings the confrontation and wrestling of the relevant parties. Sino -US relations have shown the most tense situation since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. Wait, all these factors are intertwined together to make the world full of turbulence. This also brings greater challenges to global climate governance, because the trust and cooperation required to deal with climate issues is particularly difficult at the moment.</p>
<p>In the past month, China ’s activities on climate diplomacy are frequent. Not only do you have the practical content of climate cooperation between the two countries in the“ Sino -French Joint Statement ”, but also signed the“ Joint Statement of China -Pakistan Climate Change ”with Brazil. China’ s senior and UN climate climate The conversations of the Chairman of the Dubai Conference, Surdan, and the chairman of the European Commission Feng Delin, all mentioned that they strengthened dialogue and cooperation in climate change. In today's complex and turbulent geopolitical environment, China's climate diplomacy activities have significantly help enhance the positive cognition of Europe and Latin America in China. At the same time, by actively investing in climate diplomacy and multilaterally with these countries and regions, China can inject vitality and motivation into global climate governance.</p>

Since 2022, the radical interest rate hikes of major central banks around the world have caused general concerns about the market for economic recession. But unlike market expectations, the European and American economies showed toughness in the first half of 2023, and the expected recession did not happen immediately. From the perspective of theoretical analysis and historical reality, the rapidly tightening monetary policy will definitely have a reflexive effect on economic growth, but the excess savings play a periodic buffer effect and delay the time of decline.</p>
<p>Through a comprehensive judgment of the global credit environment, monetary policy transmission, and economic fundamental changes, we believe that although the trend is delayed, from the end of 2023, the pressure of global economic recession will gradually enlarge, and it will follow the United States, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, The order of emerging market economies has continued to spread, and the global economy is facing challenges, and it is a rational choice to retain prudential prediction.</p>

Economic theory and economic intuition may not always return to the same way. Local debt and real estate seem to be high -risk, but the policy is intentional. It releases financial risks through administrative Canadian markets and strengthens the constraints of local governments. The real risk comes from the failure side of the demand side. Public expenditure cannot keep up with the speed of production capacity accumulation. Rest reduction can improve the balance sheet, but it does not create new demand. To get rid of liquidity trap, you need to create inflation expectations.</p>
<p>The government report in 2023 clearly pointed out the two major risks of the Chinese economy: real estate and local government debt. The risk of real estate is individuality. It is difficult for developers with high debt strokes, but the impact of real estate companies that pay attention to quality of quality will be less. On the contrary, local debt is only systematic risk and has no individual risks. The market's belief in urban investment bonds is based on the trust of the government. Once a certain urban urban investment bond has a substantial breach of contract, then urban investment bonds in all regions will be risked by selling.</p>

<p>Since June 1, local time (the same below), the Ukrainian army has been actively actively on the battlefield. Russia and Ukraine have obvious offensive and defensive offense and defense. The trend is difficult to shake.</p>
<p><strong> 1. The Ukraine implements a comprehensive counterattack. </strong> There have been small -scale attacks from about May 22. The tactical intention is to continuously test the weakness of the Russian army's defense. Due to the incomplete progress of the war, at least two weeks will not acknowledge the counterattack for half a year. On June 9, Putin took the lead in confirming in Sochi that "the Ukrainian army launched a counterattack" and "has invested in its strategic reserve." On June 10, Zelei Sky finally acknowledged at a joint press conference held with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau that "counterattack and defense" refused to disclose any details. Objectively described that the Ukraine was local tentative in late May, and it was a comprehensive counterattack in early June. At the same time, the US and NATO intelligence and monitoring of the U.S. military and NATO were not found. This battle must be played, and there is a explanation of the huge amount of assistance in the West. The victory and defeat are directly associated with the bargaining chips and status of the two parties.</p>
<p><strong> Second, bombing the dams for the Ukraine. </strong> At about 2 am on June 6, the Khahofka dam in the Hermuson area was destroyed. This is not a mistake. The cruise missile combat department is small. If the gravity dam is blown up, it will hit the fragile flooding port in the middle of the dam. Russia and Ukraine quickly bite each other responsibilities. The author is more inclined to launch missiles without authorization and declare a comprehensive counterattack. In terms of performance, the combat style of the Russian army is rough and brutal. Attacking Moscow is consistent with the combat style of raid dams; second, the Dniebo midstream reservoir controlled by Ukraine in front of the dam of the dam suddenly puts water in the middle reservoir in the middle of the Dieber River, raised the downstream Khahofkkaku water level. Third, in the current western country, only Germany has clearly accused the Russian army. The United States and Britain, with the strongest military intelligence strength, have remained silent. There is no sufficient evidence support for the Russian army. The recruitment of the Ukrainian Army has been preparing for the active defense for half a year. After the Ukraine counterattacked, he resisted the quickly surrounding, gathered to annihilate the Ukraine, and expand the occupation zone.</p>
<p><strong> Three, Ukraine's final decisive battle. </strong> Although the United States has repeatedly promised to Ukraine many times, "How long does it take to support it." However, it is not the first time that the United States is cruel and ruthlessly abandoning the allies. South Korea's Lee Chengwan, Vietnam Wu Tingyan, Syrian Kurdish armed forces, Afghanistan Gani and other precedents have not ended. Now it is Zelegski, and it is not the last time. The Russian economic pressure is significantly better than expected. Although it has not announced the national mobilization, the time of war has been launched, which is equivalent to mobilizing about 70%of the "hematopoietic" ability and speed of restoration of combat power than Ukraine, which only rely on NATO "blood transfusion". Essence EU member states have declined, and the inventory army fire can be given basically. At all, there is no intention to fight for a long -lasting war. Next year, many national elections, a certain anti -war party victory in the wild party is normal, and will open the gap in solidarity and anti -Russia. The snowball is like growing, and the efforts of helping Wu will be attenuated rapidly.</p>
<p><strong> Fourth, the two sides of the non -symmetry war. </strong> The Russian army did not make full efforts and was afraid that the NATO ended, and it would inevitably retain the 10-15%elite general reserve team. It was also unwilling to be forced to use nuclear weapons to kill the nuclear retaliation. The Ukraine government and the military building did not do it; the western powers and the EU's heads were densely visited in Ukraine. There was no accident. Obviously, it was obviously reported to Russia to obtain security guarantees. Ukraine could not make full efforts. Without the United States and NATO, it had long been defeated, and the attack on Russia was strictly restricted. Recently, the drone attacked Moscow and the settlement of the border. At best, it was a public opinion battle. It was not safe to convey to the outside world, including the capital, including the capital, but it could not change the situation. The Ukrainian army did not dare to play a lot of fire and caused cruel revenge, so claiming that attacking Russia is the "Russian Liberty Legion" and "Russian Volunteer Army". Dare to publicly admit that even NATO aid long -range missiles dare not be used to attack Moscow or St. Petersburg. Because of the blessings behind the scenes of NATO, the Urpical information war, intelligence war, public opinion war, and cognitive war occupied an absolute advantage.</p>
<p><strong> 5. The Russian Army is undefeated. </strong> Putin launched the war that violated the "United Nations Charter" without any doubts, and there was no doubt about the strategic defeat. Pushing to the United States, the surrounding security environment is even worse. But if the author has analyzed many times, the Russian army can be undefeated. The Russian army's performance on the battlefield was indeed bad. Strategic tactics still stayed in the era of mechanization war in the 1940s and 1980s. After the lightning war was ineffective, they ate a lot of losses, but the potential of the war far exceeded Ukraine. Taking the force as an example, 300,000 troops have been recruited in the autumn of 2022, and then stabilized their feet and were in the phase of the stalemate. On December 21, 2022, the Minister of Defense Shaoyg announced that it began to expand by 350,000 in 2023. ; Deputy Chief of Staff Burkinski recently wrote a recent article confirming that this year, 2 new groups, 1 infantry army, 5 divisions, and 26 brigades were established this year. After several rounds of general mobilization and mercenaries, there were no many recruits. As the Russian army has a huge nuclear arsenal, the U.S. military and NATO have no willingness and courage to take the initiative to participate in the battle. The Ukraine is fighting against and fighting and fighting the meat grinding battle, which is conducive to the defense side, and the Russian army has better firepower, and the Ukraine will inevitably be more casualties. The longer the war was dragged, the higher the chance of the Russian army.</p>
<p><strong> Sixth, beware of the Russian army's anti -surrounding. </strong> Dozens of F16 fighters in NATO Aid Ukraine takes 4 months for the formation of combat power. Even if they are put into the front line, the fourth -generation aircraft inventory and trained pilots of the Russian army still crush the Ukraine and cannot change the battle. It is not difficult to find a map of the map. Halkov is one of the must -have strategic places for both sides. It is located in the abdomen of Russia and Ukraine. Ergo Rhode has frequently invaded. If the Ukraine's counterattack is blocked, then two or three months later, the Russian army quickly dispatched the trained and trained more than 100,000 motor groups in the direction of Halkov was a good chess. Clockwise to attack Ji Ai to force the Urpicious soldiers to retreat, or simply divided the soldiers. Now that the war of aggression against aggression, Putin simply does not do anything, and once again occupy Halkov (the ideal ending also occupies Sami and Chel Nigov) as a strategic buffer, otherwise the NATO or quasi in the future or quasi NATO (referred to as Ukraine) Tun Army here, the Russian army's defensive pressure and cost were too high.<strong> Eighth, possible options for Russia and Ukraine. </strong> It is difficult to completely defeat the Russian army. The Russian army lost the excellent window of Kiev's support for the support of the pro -Russian regime at the beginning of the war. As long as there are some common sense in politics or military, you can predict that Ukraine cannot return to Crimea, even if the U.S. military will not be able to return; Russia will not agree with Ukraine to join NATO, and can join the European Union, the United States, NATO, and Ukraine to maintain special quasi -military military affairs. Alliance relations (that is, provide security assurance); Russia will not acknowledge the illegal "referendum" of the Organization of the Sizhou last year. The four states are highly autonomous. Russia's sovereign assets cannot be taken back. As the funds of Ukraine, the steps that Russia can find is the agreed ratio (such as 70%) to invest in the Donbass region.</p>
<p><strong> Nine, weapon loss smuggling. </strong> The upper two -thirds of the US -European aid funds are used for the battlefield, and the aid of the Ukraine Fire is used up to the battlefield. Quite a lot of funds are deducted to the US, Europe, and Ukraine's military and political circles through a number of people. They are cash out after retirement, and a lot of weapons flow to the world through the black market smuggling. Russian military expenses and arms will also be cut, swallowed, and smuggled in large quantities. This is normal human nature and politics, with dirty side. As soon as the cannon sounds, the gold is two thousand, and the war is the tough politics and the dirtiest politics.</p>
<p><strong> Ten, Putin has no suspense again. </strong> "Give me 20 years, return you a powerful Russia." This sentence has been widely circulated on the Chinese network, and it is made as a rumor that the research is based on Putin, but it does meet Putin's motivation and behavior. He has been in power for 23 years, Russia is weakened, and he will be in power for 7 years. In 2024, he has no suspense until 2030. He also asked to make face and Sven. Although he was in a form, he did two presidents, and did not dare to remove the two restrictions stipulated in the Constitution directly. Essence In 2020, the Constitution Amendment has extended the presidential term from four years to six years, and still dare not remove the two -time restrictions, but only stipulates that the previous term can be cleared; it is approved by the nation's referee to test the public opinion in advance. Charter "passed. After the constitutional amendment, he can do it from two to 2036. Now it is predicted that the second session is too early. It is unknown how healthy is healthy in 2030. Er Cao is destroyed by the name, and does not abandon the rivers. However, the power of the West and the anti -Putin should not be naive. The war was in this decisive battle of the Russian National Games. Russia's mainstream politics, military, economic, and cultural elites have reached a consensus. Public opinion support is firm enough.</p>

They come from a one -year -old survey that has been confidential.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/09/us/trump-indictment-documents-news/read-the-complete-indictment-here">Page 49 Prosecution</a>Including 37 allegations and seven individual allegations against the former president, and a allegations against its assistants, it clearly presents how wide the content of the sensitive materials taken by Trump from the White House, as well as the processing documents of him and the staff handling documents How ridiculous the way -the most important thing is that the prosecutor also mentioned a model of obstruction and false statements, the purpose of which to prevent the federal investigation bureau and the jury.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most important and shocking allegations:</p>
<p><strong> Trump and Naita are charged with co -conspiracy to hinder justice. </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the evidence they collected showed that Trump deliberately ignored him in May 2022 that he asked him to return all items that belong to the National Archives -and took very measure to obstruct the federal investigation bureau and jury.</p>
<p>In order to observe the request of the subpoena, a lawyer of Trump went to his Masarra manor to search for documents in the storage room. A few hours ago, Trump instructed the co -defendant Naita to move 64 boxes out of the storage room. Because he insisted that these boxes were his property.</p>
<p>"I don't want anyone to turn my box, I really don't want to," the indictment shows that Trump told one of his lawyers.</p>
<p><strong> He put the important documents of the box in the bathroom. </strong></p>
<p>The indictment stated that in April 2021, Trump's employees needed to move from a banquet hall to dozens of boxes, and they were going to transform the banquet hall into an office. "There is another place in the washing room," a assistant sent a text message to another assistant. Soon after, these boxes were dragged to a small washing room next to the banquet hall adjacent to the Macaru Song Manor, and the piled box almost touched the small branch -shaped chandeliers next to the toilet.</p>
<p><strong> The secret documents are randomly released, even scattered on the ground. </strong></p>
<p>One of the most striking pictures in the indictment comes from 2021. A box of national security documents in the photo is scattered on the ground of a storage room in the Malaras Manor. Many employees in the estate can enter the storage room. These documents are marked with a limited "five -eye" classification mark, indicating that only officials with the highest security license issued by the United States and its closest ally can view it.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p><strong> Trump suggested his lawyer to get a folder, "If there is anything bad inside, for example, you know, just pull it out." </strong></p>
<p>For Trump, one of the most tricky evidence is that the indictment describes Trump and the lawyer how to deal with a folder equipped with 38 confidential documents. The lawyer said that Trump did a "pull -out action", suggesting, "Why don't you take them to your hotel room, if there is anything bad inside, for example, you know Pull out. "</p>
<p>This may indicate that he knows that he holds sensitive documents, that is, "bad" documents, and also authorizes those who do not have appropriate security permits to check these documents carefully instead of returning all documents to the file hall directly as the government requires.</p>
<p><strong> Trump shares secrets with tourists visiting Bedmust. There are audio proves. </strong></p>
<p>Many of the plots described in the indictment have been reported by the news media -including a revealing exposure that may be destructive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/09/us/trump-indictment-documents-news/indictment-quotes-trump-acknowledging-that-he-had-a-secret-document-he-was-not-allowed-to-declassify">recording proves, Trump shows off the secret combat plan of the United States</a>——The said that the material is "highly secret" and "secret", and it is acknowledged that it has not been decrypted.</p>
<p>"See, as president, I could have decrypted it," Trump said. He added, "I can't, you know now, but this is still secret."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p><strong> It is said that he shared a secret map with a staff member of the Political Action Commission. </strong></p>
<p>In another incident in August or September 2021, he shared a unique military map with a staff member of the Political Action Commission without security.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the former president hinted that the progress of military operations in a country without names was not smooth. According to the indictment, he showed the map to the staff, but warned the staff member to "don't be too close."</p>
<p>In these interactions, he seems to be less interested in the content of the materials. What is more interested is that these materials are "given to me", just like gifts or souvenirs.</p>
<p>"Isn't this great?" He asked a visitor after showing a document and said that this was randomly selected from the "a lot of" files, indicating that he had more documents.</p>
<p><strong> One of Trump's lawyers, Evan Crees, is a key witness. </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Kokllen made detailed notes (some of which were excerpted from the iPhone voice memo he made for himself). Protect yourself: return the document to the government.</p>
<p>The prosecutor also disclosed a even more shocking thing -Trump and Naita moved the box around, asking Kochlen, who asked the investigators to find the complete materials.</p>

<h1>Global use nuclear warheads increase Swedish think tank: China increases the most</h1>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Stockholm International Peace Research (SIPRI) pointed out on Monday (June 12) that as geopolitical tensions have intensified, some countries, especially China ’s nuclear arsenal last year, grew last year, and other nuclear support was supported by nuclear support. The country is also continuing to modernize its nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>"The nuclear warhead available global combat, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/sipri全球军备支出快速增高/a-65417632">The reduction of the cut seems to have stagnated</a>The number began to rise again. The report wrote: "At the same time, the United States and Russia spent huge sums of money to launch a comprehensive plan to replace and modernize their nuclear warheads, missiles, aircraft, and submarine carrier systems, and their nuclear weapons production facilities."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/追忆往昔三十年前的核裁军/a-64303938">Over the past 30 years, the number of nuclear weapons around the world has declined steadily</a>The main reason is that Russia and the United States are gradually demolishing nuclear warheads. Dansmith, director of Sipri, said that the process of this settlement is about to end: "Now we are getting closer and maybe it has reached the end of this period."</p>
<p>According to SIPRI's annual report, nine nuclear military countries including the United Kingdom, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, and the United States have decreased from 12,710 in the beginning of last year to 12,512 of this year. However, 9576 of them belonged to "military reserves that may come in handy", which was more than 86 more than the previous year. SIPRI's number distinguishes the total inventory from the reserves available. The former includes the old nuclear warhead that will be demolished.</p>
<p>Smith said that the number of available nuclear warheads began to rise, but it also pointed out that the total number was far below more than 70,000 in the 1980s. The increase is mainly from China, and its nuclear warhead reserve increased from 350 to 410. The nuclear warheads in India, Pakistan and North Korea have also increased. Russia has a small growth rate, from 4477 to 4,489; the size of the remaining nuclear national nuclear arsenals remains unchanged.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T02-44-00Z/5403717_7.jpg" />The picture shows Pakistan launched a missile in 2008.</p>
<p>At present, the country with the largest number of nuclear weapons is Russia and the United States, which account for about 90%of the ups and downs, and the third place is China. Sipri researcher Hans M. Kristensn pointed out that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/报告全球军工业连续7年增长-中国发展加速/a-63988259">China's nuclear arsenal is expanding sharply</a>This trend is increasingly inconsistent with China's claim, that is, it will only have the minimum nuclear weapons to maintain the national security.</p>
<p>Smith said: "What you can see is that China is rising with world power, which is the reality of our era."</p>
<h3>The Russian and Ukraine War frustrated and reduced the effort to reduce nuclear weapons</h3>
<p>Smith pointed out that the fact that the increase in global nuclear weapons inventory itself cannot be explained by the Russian and Ukraine War, because it takes a longer time to develop a new warhead, and the main increase in inventory is to occur in countries that are directly affected by the war.</p>
<p>However, the geopolitical tension brought by the Russian and Ukraine War, coupled with the deterioration of global security, makes experts feel anxious.</p>
<p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the global diplomatic efforts of nuclear weapons control and disarmament have faced frustration. For example, the United States has therefore suspended the "bilateral strategic stability dialogue" in Russia. In February of this year, Russia announced the suspension of the Newstart of the New Strategic Weapons signed with the United States in 2010; before, this was the only important restriction of nuclear military treaty between the two sides.</p>
<p>SIPRI researcher Matt Korda said that most nuclear military countries are strengthening the importance of nuclear weapons. "Some countries are even clearly imply that threatening to use nuclear weapons." "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瑞典智庫全球核武數量恐現冷戰後首次增長/a-62109307">Nuclear Martial Arts Competition Upgrade</a>The risk of nuclear weapons may be used in one goal, which is the first time since the World War II.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-12T03-31-33-08-00/10india-train-01-zkct-master1050.jpg" />Every day, a 10 million Indians are crowded with overloaded trains to chase some economic opportunities on the vast land of the world's most populated countries.</p>
<p>They can only afford a vote of $ five -almost a day's salary. To this end, they are squeezing on the middle aisle for a long time away from the so -called ordinary carriage away from the air -conditioned car. The air -conditioned carriage is located near the dining car, and the employees are there to prepare rice, barbecue and tea for passengers' journey.</p>
<p>In the evening of June 2nd, in eastern India, the Komandrt Express trains hit a row of freight trains stopped there at a speed of 128 kilometers per hour. The crowded ordinary compartments behind the train became a terrible scene of death.</p>
<p>Officials have confirmed that of the 288 deceased, almost everyone was in the three -section compartment in the front of the train -this fact has little attention in India. Unlike 1,200 people with reserved seats, the official does not know the names of ordinary compartment passengers; the railway department does not have their identity record. Their names and other details appear only when they were sent to the hospital, or their loved ones who were hundreds of kilometers away appeared when they recognized the corpse.</p>
<p>The accident was the worst train disaster in India for decades. In the government's preliminary report on the accident, the number of passengers included only passengers with reserved seats, and hundreds of people in ordinary compartments almost did not exist.</p>
<p>"They are all the poor people like me," said 28 -year -old carpenter Lahul Kumar. He took the ordinary car of the Komandel train to the south city Kimner. "Workers with a daily salary, do a bitterness, can't afford to sit next to the carriage."</p>

<p>Railway disasters have once again highlighted, and the burden of insufficient infrastructure in India is more affected by the poor.</p>
<p>The total length of the Indian railway line is about 64,000 kilometers. It is one of the largest and oldest railway networks in the world. It may also be one of the most heavy railway networks.</p>
<p>For young people who must leave their hometown to maintain their livelihood, this is a cheap lifestyle. Data from Indian Railway Corporations show that of 20 million passengers per day, six of the seventh people hold no tickets, especially suburban trains: these trains stop in small towns, and passengers are constantly entering and leaving crowded compartments.</p>
<p>According to a senior Indian official, the three verses of the Coromander Express were raised in a total of about 300 people. This number is consistent with the official capacity of the compartment; however, the records from the train show that it may be far more than this number. Railway officials said that only two of the deceaseds are currently confirmed.</p>
<p>In the past 50 years, in this 1.4 billion -population country, passenger volume has increased more than tripled, and the capacity of the railway network has only expanded by about 40%as far as the rail mileage is concerned. About 8 billion passengers transport passengers each year -about <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/03/WS5e0eada7a310cf3e355824c4.html">China ’s larger, updated railway network</a>Essence</p>

<p>Alock Kumar Verma, a retired chief engineer at the Northeast Border Railway in India, said that the biggest obstacle to improving Indian railway network security and performance is a dangerous level of congestion. Verma said data from the Indian railway company showed that the most important "main line" in the central government runs about 9,600 kilometers with 125%capabilities.</p>
<p>This not only puts pressure on the rails, but also puts pressure on the staff on the rails, but it does not have enough time to maintain.</p>

<p>Indian officials acknowledge that railway upgrades and expansion have long lag behind highway investment. But they said that compared with about ten years ago, the annual expenditure of the Indian railway system increased seven times. The railway is reconstruction and expansion at faster speeds, and security technology is also introduced.</p>
<p>Official data show that in the past ten years, the total number of major railway accidents such as collisions, derailment and fire has fallen by about two -thirds. In recent years, the number of casualties caused by such accidents has dropped to dual -digit and individual digits.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, nearly 20,000 deaths related to the railway are still starting each year, many of which are because passengers fall off from the crowded compartment or are hit by the train.</p>
<p>A few days after the Coromandr railway accident, hundreds of people were lying in the hospital, and the corpse was scattered in the peacefulness, revealing the situation of the Indian people who rely on this railway.</p>

<p>The lucky lucky people must cheer up, continue to find a living, or return to home. For most people, it is difficult to imagine letting loves spend money from hundreds of kilometers away. Another thing is also very lucky to them: Hurricane, where the place where the incident is, is frequent, and the disaster relief system has been tested for a long time. It can quickly start rescue and save many lives.</p>
<p>For those unfortunate people, their pursuit of a better life is here and ending.</p>
<p>In the next few days, the identity of some deceased was confirmed -the injured friends left the bed to search room to search; the relatives took the government -organized bus and train to confirm the deceased from hundreds of kilometers away; Photos of the disfigured dead are confirmed.</p>
<p>There are also nearly 100 corpses in the muling room, with unknown identity and no one.</p>

<p>Carpenter Kumar said that due to the loss of his mobile phone, his family learned that he was alive three days after the accident. After receiving the first round of surgery, he took a ambulance provided by a Sikh ribbon charitable institution and returned to his village in Bighabal, northern India.</p>

Kumar also started there -s, either a short job, or buying new tools, and then returning to Bigharbon.Kumar rushed into the carriage first and grabbed the seat. He said a chance to save him -a family of three sitting next to him and asked him if he was willing to exchange seats with a female relative in their back seat.</p>
<p>"When I resumed consciousness, half of the compartment was hung in the air, and the other half disappeared," he said. "When climbing to the door, I saw the red headscarf with the woman who changed my seat. They were lying on the ground, and they were dead."</p>
<p>The daily difficulties of the poor India are to a large extent. For many people in the Komandr Express, only when the disaster occurred, under the eyes of the camera and the onlookers, the rescuers could get attention when they dragged their bodies through the messy carriages.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if we die at home or die in a train accident, we are nothing," said the 24 -year -old Madu Sultan Halda. big. "A few days later, everyone will forget that so many people die."</p>

<h3>Ukraine calls the first batch of three villages that recapture Donetsk in the Russian counter -attack</h3>
<p>4:21 am on June 12, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T04-21-50.000Z/_130061235_ukraine.jpg"></a>Image source, reuters</p>
<p><strong> Ukraine said that the country's army has liberated three villages in southeastern Ukraine, which is the first victory of the long -awaited Ukraine counterattack. </strong></p>
<p>Social media films show that its army celebrates the victory near the residents' districts near Blahodatne and Neskuchne in Donetz.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine said that Makarivka nearby was also recaptured.</p>
<p>On Saturday (June 10), President Volodymyr ZELENSKY confirmed that Ukraine's counterattack against the Russian army's area has begun.</p>
<p>Although Ukraine has begun to advance at the southern front of the country last week, these three villages are the first batch of residential areas that Zelezzki confirmed to have been liberated since the beginning of the counterattack.</p>
<p>[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65875040/P0FSQRBD/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65875040/p0fsqrbd/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T04-21-50.000Z/p0fsqw02.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>The Ukrainian dam was exploded and urgently withdrew tens of thousands of people, Russia and Ukraine denied the launch of the attack</p>
<p>Moscow has not confirmed that it has lost any village, but claims that it has repelled Ukraine's offense in the region.</p>
<p>In addition, Ukraine claims that Russia bombed another dam in the Zapolo area. Last Monday, the Khahofka dam near Hermuson in southern Ukraine was destroyed, causing a wide range of floods.</p>
<p>Ukraine said the dam was bombed by the Russian army. The Russian army has been controlling the dam since February 2022.</p>
<p>Valery Shershen, a national military spokesman, said that Moscow chose to bomb the second dam near Novodarivka, which "caused the flood".</p>
<p>She Shen said that Russia deliberately bombed the dam in the area to prevent Ukraine from being advanced to the occupied area.</p>
<p>Russia denied it that it had destroyed the Khahofka dam and attributed it to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russian and Ukraine War: a counterattack that may change the war</p>
<h3>"Under the country of Ukraine again"</h3>
<p>In social media, in the video shared by Kuyeland's account, you can see the Ukrainian flag from a burned building in Blahodat in Blahodat.</p>
<p>The video released by the National Border Defense Force showed that the Ukraine army announced that the "Nesskchne in the Donetsk region belongs to Ukraine's national underworld" and then shouted the battle slogan "Glory Between Ukraine".</p>
<p>At the same time, Hanna Maliar, deputy minister of the Ministry of Defense, claimed in a film in Telegram that the Ukrainian army also occupied the Village of Macarova.</p>
<p>A military spokesman said that these victories were the first local victory in the counterattack.</p>
<p>Although these three villages marked the biggest progress in recent days, these residential areas are relatively small. The population before the Blahodat's civil war was only 1,000.</p>
<p>The village is the center of fierce fighting in recent days. It is located on the road leading to Mali Ubol. Some analysts believe that Ukraine may seek to recapture this port city in the next few months.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that Kiev hopes to cut off the occupied land connection between Crimea and Donedsk, and the Russian army on the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>To the east, the Ukrainian army is also said to have also been advanced near the destroyed city of Bachomut, where the two Russian and Ukraine troops have long -term bloody fighting.</p>
<p>Senior officials of Kiev declined to comment on the details of advancement.</p>
<p>The mysterious Ukrainian intelligence head, Kyrylo Budanov, released a film on Sunday, repeating the mantra of "planning likes to silence", intended to emphasize that the counterattack needs to be confidential.</p>
<p>Ukraine's scope of action is unclear, but the headquarters in the US think tank "Institute of War" (ISW) said on Saturday that Kiev's troops are launching offensives in at least four front lines.</p>
<p>Ukraine suffered some setbacks while launching an attack on Russia's defense. A group of Ukrainian soldiers told AFP that during a operation in southeastern Zapolo, they lost several Bradley chariots made by several American Bradley.</p>
<p>They said that six of the nine cars were destroyed and added that they were worried that someone had leaked action information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65670095">Ukraine War: BBC discloses the defense deployment of the Russian army through satellite pictures</a>Analysts emphasized that Ukraine faces difficulties when trying to break through Russia for several months.</p>
<p>However, in other regions, Kiev's troops reportedly broke through the Russian troops in the weekend operations. It is reported that the Ukraine has deployed the German Leopard-2 (Leopard-2) tank.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, the railway transportation was suspended after a row of freight trains on Saturday night. In the past few weeks, Belgore's border area has been attacked by drones and artillery.</p>
<p>Kaluga Governor Vladislavshapsha Paluga governor in the north said two drone cranes occurred in the local area, which occurred near the village of Strelkovka, and another other. Together in the forest.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-12T04-33-06-00-00/000073708_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese ambassador to South Korea, Xing Haiming, met with the largest party leader in South Korea, Li Zaiming. They caused a stir in South Korea on the current series of issues such as Sino -South Korean relations and East Asian diplomacy. Then Korean diplomacy and security officials publicly criticized the Chinese ambassador on various occasions, which has aroused great attention from East Asian public opinion.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that the Chinese ambassador did not name the Korean Yin Xiyue government. All his remarks are explaining the position of the Chinese government. It is also the normal work of any country's ambassador abroad. Therefore, the essence of the problem is that the Korean Yin Xiyue government is actually showing a posture to China, that is, South Korea has dared to provoke China.</p>
<p><strong> South Korea deliberately adopted an excessive excitement as </strong></p>
<p>Judging from the content of the Chinese ambassador to South Korea ’s largest party leader Li Zaiming, the South Korean government is really unbearable. I am afraid that the largest party leader in the country to find Chinese ambassador to China’ s major foreign policy on South Korea. The Chinese government's position is consistent with Li Zaiming's position, and then objectively formed the pressure of internal and external situations. This is probably the foundation of the problem, but the South Korean government obviously has excessive reaction and deliberately adopting an overwhelming movement.</p>
<p>Judging from the content of the conversation, the Korean government's actions were triggered by the criticism of the government leader of the opposition party, but finally chose the Chinese ambassador to crack down.</p>
<p>According to South Korea's "Central Daily": Xing Haiming invited Li in the official residence of the Chinese Embassy in the North District of Seoul City last week. Xing Haiming personally came to the courtyard to welcome Li Zaiming and said, "Li represents a great politician in South Korea", and "hopes to exchange opinions such as the relationship between China and South Korea, the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the co -Democratic Party of South Korea."</p>
<p>Li Zaiming immediately proposed to Xing Haiming, "Due to the problem of ocean emissions of nuclear sewage in Japan, the concerns of neighboring countries are getting greater and greater. I hope that the two parties can make sounds and seek common response solutions together." The Ambassador Xing Haiming in China criticized Japan on the issue of Fukushima sewage emissions: "Japan regards the Pacific as a sewer because of its economic and other interests."</p>
<p>Li Zaiming also said: "After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea, the two countries have formed a high degree of trust, but recently the public opinion and mutual trust of the two countries have been backward, which is worrying." "In order to restore trust, the South Korean government needs further efforts." This is undoubtedly criticizing Yin Xiyue's government policy to China.</p>
<p>Xing Haiming said, "China -South Korea relations are still facing external factors challenges." "The United States is trying to suppress China, and some people bet that the United States will win and lose China. This is obviously misjudgment and has not seen the general trend of history." Obviously, this sentence does not indicate the government of Yin Xiyue. South Korea's "Central Daily" believes: "Xing Haiming's remarks may be aimed at a sentence that American President Biden once said: the warning issued by Bayeng not long ago, 'Don't bet on betting The party that confronts the United States'. "And I am afraid that this is the case. Xing Haiming is criticizing the United States, but does this have to do with the Korean government?</p>
<p>While mentioning the issue of Taiwan, Xing Haiming called on the Korean government and the ruling party to "promote the situation and restart the dialogue." For South Korea, the essence of Taiwan's issue lies in: Do you recognize the "one China" principle promised by South Korea during the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea? As long as the South Korean government still maintain diplomatic relations with China, this cannot be any problem.</p>
<p>Interestingly, on the same day, the South Korean ruling party's National Power Party's first Kim Qi Xuan met with the Japanese ambassador to South Korea in Congress. Kim Qixuan emphasized the cooperation between South Korea and Japan, and said on Fukushima sewage discharge, "We will resolutely resist malicious propaganda and incitement." "" ". This is obviously publicly cleared on the issue of helping Japan's sewage discharge of Fukushima.</p>
<p>"Central Daily" introduced this that the two parties in South Korea's largest factor and the opposite party showed their position on the same day on the same day. "This is an unexpected thing." In fact, this exactly shows that Korean politics is split on its own country's major directional diplomatic issues; the people are also.</p>
<p>Judging from the above -mentioned remarks of the Chinese Ambassador, it is explaining the position of the Chinese government, which is the responsibility and daily job of any country's abroad. Yin Xiyue's government was so angry about the biggest party leader Li Zai Ming, but he dared not to have any criticism, but pointed the spearhead to the Chinese ambassador. The roots were two points: Yin Xiyue government was governed at a support rate of about 50%. The rate is still much lower than 50%, so it is guilty and highly sensitive, so he dare not criticize the strong Chinese ambassador to the Chinese party leader. Secondly, this operation also shows that South Korea has begun to dare to provoke China, of course, the result of the deterioration of the Sino -US game and the deterioration of China's diplomatic environment in Northeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong> Resist in China to please the United States and make a profit </strong></p>
<p>Therefore, South Korea provoked China this time to please the United States against China and make a profit for itself. Because it will be affirmed and encouraged by the United States in this way, and the second is to deliberately suppress China to meet the special psychological needs of China formed with China for thousands of years.</p>
<p>According to the speech of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson this time, it mainly proves the legitimacy of the ambassador's behavior from the perspective of the daily work content and work nature of the ambassador. You must not persist on your position on the Taiwan issue.</p>
<p>There is also a background here: When the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Japanese Ambassador to China in China at the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) Summit in late May, the other party rejected China's protest on the spot. Protest.</p>
<p>Therefore, these two incidents in China and South Korea have actually been related to China and South Korea. It is a sign of ominous. Of course, it is the result of the deterioration of China and the United States and the exterior environment of China in Northeast Asia. However, in the context of not resolving the United States, this time China ’s response to South Korea’ s “harmony” as the main characteristics can truly alleviate the tension of bilateral relations. The answer was made on the 10th.</p>
<p>According to the news on the 11th of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nong Rong, saw the South Korean ambassador to China Zheng Zaihao on the 10th. Recently, the Korean needle reported the improper response to the Chinese ambassador to the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea and the first meeting with the Korean party, which showed serious concern and dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: Nongrong explained the views and positions of China ’s current China -South Korean relations to Zheng Zaihao, and pointed out that the extensive contact and exchanges of Ambassador Xing Haiming and people from all walks of life in Korea are their responsibilities. The development of Korean relations. It is hoped that the Korean side will deeply reflect on the current issue of Sino -South Korean relations and take it seriously. It will effectively abide by the spirit of the joint communiqué of China and South Korea's construction of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Obviously, Nongrong's point of view is compared with the previous position of a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has further expressed dissatisfaction, but it still repeats the "explanation" of the original spokesperson.Obviously, South Korea is insisting on the original stood and behaviors of China.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if China takes another firm position to respond, things may develop in a benign direction.</p>

<p>The Institute of International Peace of Stockholm distinguishes the nuclear warhead inventory that can be used in various countries, and the total inventory, including the old warheads, including the planned demolition, has a total of 9,576 nuclear warheads. Add 86 pieces.</p>
<p>Smith said: "The number of nuclear warheads that can be used began to rise." But these numbers are still far below more than 70,000 in the 1980s; as for the increased parts from China, China has increased the number of their inventory nuclear warheads from 350 to 410 pieces from 350 to 410 pieces. Essence</p>
<p>Dan Smith, director of the Institute of International Peace (SIPRI) of Stockholm, pointed out: "We are approaching or the end of the long -term decline in the number of global nuclear weapons."</p>
<p>The United States and Russia still have nearly 90%of nuclear weapons. India, Pakistan and North Korea have also increased inventory. Russia has a small increase, the number of nuclear warheads increases from 4477 to 4489, and the remaining nuclear military countries are flat. "The overall situation is that the number of nuclear warheads has fallen for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Description: China has the world's largest and highly militarized maritime police fleet. It is aggressive in regional disputes, leading to neighboring countries to upgrade maritime police forces. The maritime police of Asian countries have become more and more like navy and become pioneers of regional competition.

<p>为了控制亚洲的战略航道，中国部署了一支配备76毫米舰炮和反舰导弹的舰队，船体比美国海军的驱逐舰还要大。但它们并不属于中国海军。船体被漆成白色，两侧用大写字母写着“中国海警”。</p>
<p>在短短十年间，中国已经建起了世界最大且独一无二的海警舰队。这支舰队军事化程度更高，在国际争端中更加咄咄逼人，走私或者搜救等海警常规任务则较少关注，这支中国武装力量颠覆了全球200年来的海警传统。</p>
<p>它还引发了一场军备竞赛。北京强势进入执法和海军力量之间的灰色地带，将目标对准那些存在对峙的国家，其舰船可以轻松击沉大多数国家的那些使用了数十年的老船。有鉴于此，担心中国侵占领土的国家争相部署更大、火力更猛的巡逻船。</p>
<p>台湾周围水域是一个可能爆发战争的地点，中国声称这个自治的岛屿是其领土。但随着该地区的海警对峙悄然升级，官方和分析人士越来越担心一个日益加剧的威胁：在中国海警出没的广阔区域内，任何局部事件或暴力冲突都可能引发更广泛的冲突，甚至大国之间的战争。</p>
<p>根据海事数据，从3月30日到4月2日，一支中国海警船编队在日本称之为尖阁列岛的争议岛屿附近巡航80小时36分钟，打破了中方最长停留记录。</p>
<p>日本后来宣布了一项 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-maritime-security-china-coast-guard-0515a3bf753147b540cfcf55e33be694"> 升级海岸警卫队 </a>And <a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2023-05-01/japan-war-coast-guard-defense-9975350.html">merged into the Ministry of Defense</a>plan of.</p>
<p>The two recent incidents also show that China's tough attitude and regional risk have reached a new level:</p>
<p>• From April 8th, China's patrol ships gathered near Taiwan.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/world/asia/china-taiwan-military-exercises.html)During the interception and search for Taiwanese ships. Taiwan is currently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-war-games-focus-combating-blockade-preserving-forces-2023-04-26/">Formation Plan</a>In order to break through the possible blockade in the future, while strengthening the construction of its coastal guards.</p>
<p>• On April 23, near a controversial island reef in the South China Sea, a large patrol ship in China cut into the channel of a much larger Philippine patrol ship, forcing the latter's captain to hang back <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/chinese-philippine-vessels-in-david-and-goliath-nearcrash/news-story/e2f251c9af5e368dc4e41f92752ebf82">to avoid collision</a>Essence A few days later, the United States promised to provide the Philippines with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/01/fact-sheet-investing-in-the-special-friendship-and-alliance-between-the-united-states-and-the-philippines/">Six New Equipment New Patrol Ship</a>Essence</p>

The coast guards, which once served as the eyes of watching and assistance, have become more and more like navys, involved in the geopolitical politics of Asia, and deployed as military forces on a waterway that is crucial to shipping and natural resources.</p>

<p>From the ports of southern China and Taiwan to the base of the United States in the United States, the white maritime police ships either become larger, heavier, or smaller and faster. They are also equipped with a larger and larger cannon, or they can use complex weapon systems. The coastal guards in the area are cooperating with the National Defense Department more closely, making it a pioneer in the widespread economic and military competition in the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p>John Bradford, a senior researcher at the Maritime Safety Project of the US Navy's retired Lieutenant Colonel and the Singapore Rajayanan International Research Institute, said: "Unlike 10 years ago, many countries in this area have begun to use the coastal guards to maintain sovereignty. "</p>
<p>"The idea behind it is," he added. "When a small amount of firepower has a small amount of firepower, it will be more effective because it is not easy to cause the situation to upgrade. What is the difference between naval ships? "</p>

The United States has become more active in the Pacific region, deployed a new generation of patrol ships, and signed a patrol agreement with many countries. Chang w. Lee/then York Times</p>
<p>Since China is committed to becoming its so -called "maritime country", the maritime police competition has now appeared in Asia.In the eyes of China, the maritime police will become the pillar of its great country's revival, because it will help Beijing to control important waters (and fishery and mineral resources there).

<p>And its ship has more and more capable of doing this. China currently has about 150 large maritime police patrol ships of more than 1,000 tons, while there are about 70 in Japan, 60 in the United States, and only a few countries in Asia.

<p>As China has become more and more controversial, many countries in Asia are forced to face this new fleet that disguised as law enforcement vessels almost every day. And it's not just in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>On May 11th, in the East China Sea, two Chinese maritime police ships are the 13th time this year <a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2023-05-11/china-coast-guard-instrusion-senkaku-10081278.html">transcended</a>12 nautical miles around the Diaoyu Islands.

<p>"Maritime police and countries in the region are mature," said General Andrew J. Tingsen, commander of the Pacific region of the US Maritime Police. "I think their maturity is necessary."</p>
<p>This situation is the most obvious in shipyards in the Taiwan Strait and southern Taiwan. Taiwan is located in the center of anxiety in the region. The Taiwan Maritime Police faces challenges from mainland China almost every day. Its expansion speed is much higher than the Taiwan Navy.</p>
<p>When visiting the industrial zone outside Kaohsiung Port, the workers were about to complete the repair of a maritime police patrol boat that was cracked.</p>
<p>"A Chinese ship hit it and broke it directly," said Hu Yanru, former Taiwanese naval officer, said that his operating Lang Enterprise Co., Ltd. specifically built and repaired the Taiwan maritime police ships.</p>
<p>He said that a few weeks ago, the patrol boat, a 36 -foot -length rigid inflatable boat, was similar to the assault boat used by the US Navy SEAC -with several other patrol boats formed a warning around Taiwan's outer island. Line, surround a suspicious speedboat. The ship had six engines, which was a common design of Chinese muntered ships. When the Taiwan Maritime Police asked their tasks, the crew increased the throttle and rushed over.</p>
<p>"That ship has no name, but we know it is Chinese," Hu Yanru told the situation that the official told him. "When you can't see your name, you know it is suspicious."</p>

<p>China threatened to check Taiwanese ships in April, representing another way to upgrade the conflict. The response to this behavior revealed that the boundaries of maritime violations were very vague.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Marine Affairs Commission stated that it has used its own maritime police ship as a cover force to respond to China's threat, in order to "prevent the freedom and security of the country in mainland China that endanger the navigation of the country in my jurisdiction." A spokesman for Taiwan's office with Beijing relations said: "If you interfere, we will fight back."</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Denver, 11th) The US professional basket NBA Denver Gold Block is currently leading the championship series with the Miami Heat, but the golden block teacher Malone is too clear to listening to the cards and the seriousness of relaxation.

<p>Golden Block 12th (8:30 am on the 13th of Taipei time) returned to the 5th game at home. The gambling disks were all optimistic about the last two games that were better than the Heat in all aspects to win the championship on the same day.</p>
<p>The home fans will look forward to celebrating the king and experts about the golden blocks to allow their opponents to pack the summer vacation early.</p>
<p>Malone told the media: "My biggest worry about listening to the series is how human nature and how to overcome it. After most teams get 3-1 listening to the card, the players will float, and then it is relaxed. Can still win. "</p>
<p>"We have had this experience, that is, during the epidemic, we played the playoffs in the closed bubble park during the epidemic. Two times were fell into 1 to 3, but finally the great reversal victory was completed. We know that nothing is impossible."</p>
<p>In the 2019-20 season, Denver's Golden Bag is promoted to the playoffs with the third seed in the west district. The first round and the 6th seed Utah Jazz played. It had been trapped by 1 to 3 absolute disadvantages, but the gold block won 3 games in a row; the second round; the second round; the second round; the second round; the second round. Los Angeles speedboat, which has been resting for many days, was 1-3 and then won 3 games in a row. It was advanced to advance to the Western District Finals. Unfortunately, the first seed Los Angeles Lakers were defeated at the time.</p>
<p>Therefore, Malone told her children to think of themselves as a thermal player, and they had to play the fifth game with the mentality of backwater war.</p>
<p>Ma Long said: "I just told the players to think that I was thinking about it 1 to 3. The other party is desperate now, but we must feel more desperate; the other party is eager to win. No celebration, there is still a game to win, it is always the hardest play to listen to cards. "</p>
<p>In the NBA history, the championship series previously appeared 11 times before the first 4 games, 3 to 1, only the Cleveland Knight in 2016 completed the three consecutive games and defeated the first gold warrior to win the championship. It is the king of the team who listens to the card first.</p>

On April 28, the China National Market Supervision and Administration Bureau issued a document, of which the drawing round -governments produced by Holy Pen Industry Co., Ltd. were identified as unqualified. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06122023073327.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-12T07-34-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Network screenshot/ancient pavilion provides <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06122023073327.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaODao/kejiaowen/gt1-0612202307327.html/@stream</a>The end of this year's college entrance examination ended last week, and more than one million candidates in Henan used the government's unified procurement and sold to candidates' ink pen. However, this unified pen is either leaking or water. Some students complained that they changed their pen four times in one test, and the quality of the pen was far less than other brands. Is this just a simple "pen" mistake?</p>

<p>Henan candidates have been required to "uniformly use pens" by the government for participating in the college entrance examination. However, the province's 1.31 million students in the college entrance examination this year have experienced serious quality problems. According to the public account "STAT Star Video" of more than two million fans, a recent news said that on June 7, the first day of the college entrance examination in 2023, Henan candidates were uncomfortable with pen. Some of them have too much water, and the roll surface is unclean when writing, and the whole article is black. Another candidate commented below. There are also pens, and there are water breaks and need to be traced several times. A female candidate also said that because of the pen, it was almost not finished. Because I have been breaking the water to change the pen, it makes myself very nervous.</p>
<p>Jia Shimin, the head teacher of Zhengzhou former middle school class, also understood the situation of Henan candidates. When she was interviewed by Radio Free Asia on Monday (12th), she was angry at the incident: "Because of a pen, the child's future may be delayed. These fake and shoddy products will change the fate of how many children, how many children have been pitted, and Henan is a major college entrance examination province in China. This college entrance examination supplies are not qualified. If you are allowed, if you purchase unified procurement, you have to be responsible. How many thousand people should be eliminated for the college entrance examination deduction!"</p>
<p>According to the "Beijing News", some students said that a test was changed four times. The next day, the Henan Admissions Office responded and had urgently delivered a new pen to each test site. In this regard, some Weibo netizens commented that last year's pens were not easy to make, and the children of official procurement department officials did not take the college entrance examination. Some netizens also question why candidates are not allowed to bring their own writing writing. Others say that the candidates in the examination room did not see a new pen. In exchange for changing, the pen was the same.</p>

<p>Description: The media recently reported that China plans to build a new spy base in Cuba to intercept US communications. After the White House denied the news, anonymous US officials confirmed on the 10th that such Chinese eavesdropping stations have been set up for many years, and Beijing has also upgraded equipment. How much does this impact on the United States? Why is the official attitude of the United States different from the anonymous message?</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国据报将在古巴建窃听基地-美称报导有误/a-65861382">The Wall Street Journal reported last week that China set up an eavesdropping station in Cuba to collect American emotion and was officially denied by the Three Kingdoms. </a>On Saturday (June 10), American officials have confirmed that China CNN has confirmed that China has established military and intelligence facilities in Cuba since 2019 to strengthen its intelligence collection capabilities.</p>
<p>The unnamed U.S. official said that the spy base existed during the period of former President Trump. At that time, China upgraded its spy equipment in Cuba to intercept the electronic signal of nearby US military and commercial facilities nearby. The relevant ministries also reported the situation of the base to the government and stated that China is considering setting up similar facilities around the world.</p>
<p>"This is a continuous problem, not a new development." The official added: "These are included in the intelligence record, which is well -founded."</p>
<p>The other two anonymous people also confirmed to CNN that China has been using Cuban base for spy activities for the United States for many years. Recently, Cuba agreed to let China build new spy facilities on the island to facilitate Beijing to eavesdrop in electronic communications in the entire southeast of the United States, but It is believed that the facility has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the report, the White House said the news was "inaccurate", and the Cuban government called it "completely wrong, unfounded message", and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also said on the 9th that he did not understand the relevant situation. It means that the United States is the world's strongest "hacker" and a veritable "monitoring country." On the 12th, Wang Wenbin responded again at the news meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China again: "I have stated the position of the Chinese side on the relevant issues last week. In just two days, the US official and the media in the so -called" China Construction of Spy Facilities in Cuba 'in Cuba' On the problem, a series of conflicts of self -conflict were scattered, and once again staged a farce of "The United States negatives in the United States'." He said: "It's really impossible to be fake, no matter how the United States is rumored to smear, it will not be destroyed. The sincere friendship between the Middle Ages cannot hide the inferiority of the United States to carry out large -scale unimalia and secrets of the world's countries in the world. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T07-50-00Z/57180908_401.jpg" />Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Latin America in 2014 to meet with former Cuban President Lalestro.</p>
<h3>Why choose Cuba?</h3>
<p>The Wall Street Journal analyzed Monday (12th) that China has been building monitoring equipment in the South China Sea and other places for a long time, and Cuba will be China's first outpost in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Michaelmazarr, an international security expert in Rand Corp., said that in the past, the United States believed that security challenges from China were limited to the Indo -Pacific region, so they could slowly eat China's position in Asia, but "This is this "The day has passed" because Beijing is also starting in Latin America.</p>
<p>According to reports, if the Cuban base is completed, its eavesdropping equipment is only about 100 miles from Florida, USA. Experts point out that this is likely to significantly increase the number and scope of China that can be obtained by China, which also includes signals sent from satellites to southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Former Australian intelligence official Michaelshoebridge told the Wall Street Journal: "Just as during the Cold War, it is useful to Russians in Cuba. This base will be useful to the Chinese."</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union built an intelligence base that can accommodate about 1,500 engineers in northern Cuba, which was closed in 2001. It is currently impossible to determine whether China will use the same place.</p>
<p>Former US Navy intelligence personnel Carlschuster said that although China may have mastered the major military targets in the United States, the tracking signal provided by the Cuban base will give China a more comprehensive understanding of other potential goals.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T07-50-00Z/64280811_401.jpg" />The United States has embarked on Cuba, and the relationship between the two countries is not harmonious. The picture shows the US Embassy in Cuban</p>
<p>Another experts believe that at this stage, it is not only the situation after the base built. It is the ability to build advanced spy devices in China, which is enough to show that the strength of China ’s collection of intelligence is increasing.</p>
<p>Drew Thompson, a senior researcher at the State University of Singapore, said: "The prospects of the China-Cuban United Base are disturbing, not only because of its meaning, but also because of their potential military and intelligence." If the two countries integrate military capabilities in the eastern waters, it will have a significant impact on US security.</p>
<h3>Mei deliberately dilute the conflict?</h3>
<p>The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the establishment of eavesdropping stations in Cuba will give China the opportunity to return teeth to the United States, but China is unlikely to bargain with the United States, asking the latter to withdraw Toughness has also made cooperation commitments to allies such as Japan, Australia.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper analysis, compared with the "spy balloon" incident in February this year, the United States' response to the Cuban base was relatively calm, and it was likely that the situation was unwilling to upgrade the situation. The trip to China is rumored to start on June 18](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688)Essence In addition, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国计划放宽对古巴的若干限制/a-61822235">Because the United States has embarked on Cuba and the relationship between the two countries is not harmonious</a>If the big movement is pressured, it is likely to cause anti -effects.</p>
<p>However, some US Congress members are not very satisfied with the Bayeon government. The New York Times reported that Republican Republican MP Mikegallagher stated in a statement on the 10th: "Why did the Bayeng government previously denied these reports on the CCP spy base? CCP spy balloon? "</p>
<p>Faced with criticism, an anonymous U.S. official told the New York Times that US diplomats have tried to contact the potential countries that intend to build a Chinese base and exchanged their opinions. The official emphasized that expert assessment has delayed the speed of Chinese stations, but he refused to disclose more details.</p>

<h3>The Russian and Ukraine War: Lieutenant Russian Air Force defeated and exposed the general morale in the army</h3>

</ul>
<p>8:54 am on June 12, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T08-54-59.000Z/_130055710_mishov2.png"></a>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Dmitry Mishaf: "I am a officer, not a crime together"</p>
<p><strong> The defective soldiers who fled to Russia rarely accepted the BBC interview, which described how heavy the Russian army was and how low the morale was. </strong></p>
<p>Dmitry Mishov, a 26 -year -old Air Force Lieutenant, surrendered to the Lithuanian authorities to seek political asylum.</p>
<p>Demitri said that with a small backpack, it was his last way to escape from Russia in such a dramatic way.</p>
<p>He is one of the few active officers who are known to escape from the country to avoid being sent to Ukraine to fight in Ukraine -also the only case of the Active Air Force personally known by the BBC.</p>
<h3>Seeking a way out</h3>
<p>Dmitry is an attack helicopter navigator stationed in the Puskov region in northwestern Russia. When seeing the plane began to prepare for the battle, Dmitry felt that the real war was coming.</p>
<p>He tried to leave the Air Force in January 2022, but the written documents he submitted until February 24 that Russia had not passed in Ukraine. He was sent to Belarus and drove helicopters to transport military supplies.</p>
<p>Dmitry said he never went to Ukraine. We cannot verify his statement, but his documents look real, and many of his claims are in line with the situation we learned from other sources.</p>
<p>In April 2022, he returned to the Russian resident, hoping to advance the retirement procedure. This long process was nearing completion at the time -but in September 2022, President Putin announced some military mobilization. Dmitry was told that he was not allowed to leave the army.</p>
<p>He knew that sooner or later he would be sent to Ukraine, so he began to find a way to get rid of this fate.</p>
<p>"I am a officer, and my responsibility is to defend the country from invasion. I don't need to be a conspiracy. No one has explained to us why this war begins, and why we must attack Ukraine and destroy their city."</p>
<p>He described the mood in the army, some people support the war, and some insisted on opposing. Few people believe that they are fighting Russia to avoid real dangers. This has long been officially said -Moscow has been forced to take "special military operations" to prevent Russia from being attacked.</p>
<p>According to Mishav, most people overwhelming in the army are generally dissatisfied with salary. **</p>
<p>He said that experienced Air Force officers still obtained up to 90,000 rubles (865 pounds, $ 1090) in pre -war contracts. As part of the official public publicity advertisement, the recruits were attracted to the army with a salary of 204,000 rubles (1960 pounds and $ 2465).</p>
<p>Dmitry said that although the attitude towards Ukraine may be different, no one in the army believes that the frontline war is good or the number of casualties is very low.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T08-54-59.000Z/_130055712_mishovdocs.png" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Mishaf's document confirms his military level and position</p>
<p>"No one in the army believes the authorities. They can see what happened. They are not civilians in front of the TV. The army does not believe in official reports because it is not true at all."</p>
<p>He said that in the early days of the war, the Russian Command claimed that there were no casualties and loss of equipment, but he himself knew some of the deaths.</p>
<p>Before the war, his troops had 40 to 50 aircraft. A few days after the invasion of Russia, six were shot down and three were destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Russian authorities rarely report military casualties. In September last year, the Minister of Defense Sergeishoigu said Russia lost about 6,000 soldiers. This number is considered underestimated by most analysts including the Kremlin bloggers.</p>
<p>In the recent update of the Russian -Russian military casualties in the Ukrainian war, Olgaivshina of the BBC Russian Ministry of Russia sorted out a list of 25,000 names, including many of them also included rank. She believes that, including those who disappear in action, the real numbers are much higher.</p>
<p>Demitri said the loss of personnel in the Air Force was extremely serious. This statement is long -term with Olga Iv Sina <a href="https://bbcrussian.substack.com/p/russia-elite-force-losses-in-ukraine">Research</a>The income is consistent. The survey found that Russia lost hundreds of high -skilled service personnel, including pilots and technicians. Their training was both time -consuming and high.</p>
<p>"Now they can replace the helicopter, but there is no enough pilot," Dmitry said. "If we compare this with the Afghan war in the 1980s, we know that the Soviet Union lost 333 helicopters. I believe We have suffered the same loss in a year. "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>In January of this year, Dmitry was told that he would be sent to "perform a task."</p>
<p>He realized that there was only one meaning -going to Ukraine. He tried to commit suicide, hoping that this would cause him to be retired based on health reasons, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>During the rehabilitation of the hospital, he read an article that a 27 -year -old police officer from the Provev area successfully escaped Latvia. Dmitry decided to imitate him.</p>
<p>"I don't refuse to serve the army. If my country is facing a real threat, I will play for the country. I just refuse to be a crime."</p>
<p>"If I board the helicopter, I will take at least dozens of people's life. I don't want to do that, Ukraine is not our enemy."</p>
<p>Dmitry asked for help on Telegram, planning a route passing through the forest to the EU border. He was as light as possible.</p>
<p>He said the process of walking through the woods was terrible because he was afraid of being intercepted by border guards.</p>
<p>"If they arrest me, I may spend a long time in prison."</p>
<p>He said that once, there was a plane flew by where he was close to him, and then there was another. He panicked for a while, fearing that it was the Border Guard to hunt him, so he started to run.</p>
<p>"I can't see the road in front, my thoughts are confusing."</p>
<p>He came to a wire mesh fence and climbed it. Soon after, he knew that he was successful.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-12T08-54-59.000Z/_130055768_mishovwoods.png" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Dmitry feels a moment when you can finally breathe freely (the simulation scene of remake)</p>
<p>"I can finally breathe freely."</p>
<p>Dimitri imagined that the Russian authorities would start criminal lawsuits against him. But he believed that many comrades in his army would understand his motivation.He didn't know what he would happen next.</p>
<p>But Dmitry said he would rather try to build a new life in the European Union, and he was unwilling to mention it in his hometown.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-12T09-32-00-04-00/000000.png" />The "Iron Chain Girl" statue in the California Free Sculpture Park is <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenguangchengboke/cgc-06122023092523.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-12T09-32-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Twitter screenshot/Xiang Li</p>
<p>On June 4, 2023, I accepted the invitation of the famous sculptor Mr. Chen Weiming to participate in the unveiling ceremony of the "Iron Chain Girl" statue in the free sculpture park on the east of the Highway 15 in northern California. Many old friends and new immigrants drove from different places to participate in this grand event for a few hours.</p>
<p>What made me unexpected was that there was a voluntary played iron chain girl who voluntarily took the hot summer day. She was locked in front of the "Iron Chain Girl" sculpture and waited until the "Iron Chain Girl" sculpture was unveiled. This kind girl plays an iron chain woman on the spot, symbolizing that the people of the occupied area of China have been locked by the communist dictatorial chain.</p>
<p>The moment the iron chain locked on her body was unlocked by Chen Weiming, more than 800 participants in the audience applauded with each other, and a cheering sounded!That is the cheers of freedom that have been experienced and feel empathy!The atmosphere at the scene was extremely enthusiastic, and the shout of "defeating the Communist Party" sounded through the sky.</p>
<p>Many people in the occupied area of the Communist Party of China know that the Yuewang Temple of Hangzhou has engraved the evil of Qin Yue, and also allowed Yue Fei's "loyalty to the country" to spread widely on the Chinese land. But in fact, Yue Fei has suppressed the peasant uprising, so it cannot be regarded as a national hero. The so -called "national hero" is only the use of dictators to incite narrow nationalism, instill the thoughts of loyalty to the people, and achieve their purpose of maintaining autocratic rule.</p>
<p>And now the Free Sculpture Park created by the artist Mr. Chen Weiming, which is created by his team, truly records a communist sin that occurs in the falling area of the Communist Party of China. Essence At the same time, he is also praising the feats of those heroes who are unwilling to be slavered and boldly standing against the Communist Party's tyranny. With universal value as the standard, he is engraved here clearly, and he will always be engraved in the hearts of the history and kind people. It can be said that this is a merit. The historical status of Liberty Sculpture Park, both in terms of scope, influence or human value, will far exceed the Yue Wang Temple, becoming a holy place for the inscriptions and reminding future generations to be alert to the evil of communism.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the warriors' righteousness makes the CCP dictators cold. Shortly after the "CCP Virus" statue of the Free Sculpture Park was produced, the CCP was difficult to sleep on sleep and food, and eagerly ordered to set fire in the Liberty Park in the United States to fire. At the same time, the sculptor Chen Weiming issued various threats, and installed eavesdroppers, cameras, etc. in his car and studio, etc., trying to prevent him from continuing to expose the CCP's sins. However, Chen Weiming was not afraid, and quickly made the "CCP virus" II with steel, making it difficult for the CCP to destroy. At the same time, the Federal Investigation Agency has also been rapidly involved. Now all the CCP's Light Caliba, which participates in the sculpture of the Liberty Park, has been rope.</p>
<p>As long as you follow the right path and continue to act in your heart, your work will eventually be recognized by the world and get your due results. How could the enemy defeat him like Chen Weiming's groundlessness and barefoot into the mud? Intersection</p>
<p>Free Sculpture Park is a place to engrav the communist sin. Special reminders: If you have the opportunity, you must visit the Free Sculpture Park. There are not only "iron chain girls", "tanks", and "CCP virus", but also "June 4th '" martyrs' "and" Hong Kong era Revolution "and" umbrella movement ", and the story of" whistle "that strives to avoid disasters ...</p>
<p>After the visit, you will definitely realize that Tianwang is restored, good and evil have reported. It turned out that every moment happened to us, but it was not sensitive before.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-12T09-45-00-04-00/000000.png" />Chinese leader Xi Jinping said at the first meeting of the 20th National Security Council on May 30, 2023 that "it is a major test of being prepared to suffer from rush and even stormy waves." <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/fushenqi/fsq-06122023093818.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-12T09-45-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Associated Press picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/fushenqi/fsq-06122023093818.html/@@stream">Audio-LLINK: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/fushenqi/fsq 06122023093818.html/@stream</a>On May 30, Emperor Xi said at the first meeting of the National Security Commission after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China that the Chinese Communist Party's "the complexity and arduousness of the national security issues were significantly increased", "the major test of being prepared to suffer from high waves and even stormy waves" Essence In the past five years, Emperor Xi has not issued such a warning. This seems to show that Emperor Xi felt that the CCP had the danger of turning the ship at any time.</p>
<p>The party power autocracy will definitely die, but the crisis is so urgent, and it is really due to Emperor Xi.</p>
<p>Some netizens concluded that in the past ten years of Xi Deng, the chip industry has been abolished, the education industry has been abolished, the financial industry has been abolished, ZTE has been abolished, Huawei has been abolished, Ali has been abolished, foreign capital has been scared away, private enterprises have been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been broken, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated, foreign exchange has been defeated. Samped out, all diplomacy was messed up, the stock market was tragic, the currency was depreciated, the treasury was defeated, the people's hearts were disrupted, the official mind was scattered, the land was sold out, the credit was being sold, the credit was being sold, the credit was being sold, the credit of the credit was being sold, the credit of the credit was, The bankruptcy, the national image has been broken, and the people are not talking about it today ...</p>
<p>However, Emperor Xi would not worry about "the people do not talk about life". He not only had to be the emperor of China, but also dreaming about building a "community of human destiny" and becoming the world's emperor.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 7, Xi stated in Inner Mongolia, "... Now, we must rely on high -level technology to independence and strengthen and build a new development pattern to overcome science and technology difficulties. The construction of a large domestic cycle is to ensure that the national economy can run normally under extreme circumstances that can run normally Previously, Xi shame answered "Double Rounds" now saying "build a large -scale domestic cycle" to respond to the occurrence of "extreme situations". The so -called "extreme situation" is to say that it is a comprehensive ban in the international community. There is only one case that will happen, that is, Emperor Xi tied the 1.3 billion Chinese to a chariot, used the Taiwan Strait War as an introduction, defeated "capitalism" with the war, and established the "community of human destiny". The Dream of the Emperor!Herodo said: "God wants to destroy it first, it must be crazy first." Now, Xi Emperor who has completely eliminated all domestic forces restricted, has forgotten why, and has prepared to come to the world at all costs.</p>
<p>On May 26, the CCP fighter aircraft provoked obviously near the US military aircraft in the South China Sea International. On June 3rd, the US Navy's missile destroyer "Zhong Yun" was routinely routinely rolled with the Canadian missile destroyer "Montreal" in the Taiwan Strait. The CCP's destroyer suddenly crossed the head of the "Zhong Yun" in a unsafe way. The Zhongyun Active deceleration to 10 knots avoided the collision. The distance between the two sides was only 137 meters recently.</p>
<p>The United States said: We will continue our freedom of navigation. The CCP will prevent any attempts in our attempts through some dangerous actions, which will have a great reaction. The United States' risk -risk strategy for the CCP in the supply chain will accelerate. Emperor Xi has no choice but to "build a large domestic cycle". For Emperor Xi, the "stormy waves" are inevitable, but Emperor Xi will continue to crazy, which will cause war at any time until it is destroyed, but the Chinese people and the world will suffer huge trauma!</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-12T09-55-00-04-00/000000.png" />Chinese flag and Taiwan flag Reuters picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-06122023094758.html/@@stream">ADIO-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-06122023094758.html/@@stream</a>Several Taiwan and the United States believe that there are no signs of the Taiwan Strait War. In this regard, I have different views.</p>
<p>First of all, the launch of the military operation of the Taiwan Strait is a very risky thing for the Communist Party of China; the delay in war or fully preparing the other party may lead to the timely assistance of the Western coalition forces, which is extremely detrimental to the CCP. Therefore, logical analysis, the Chinese Communist Party will try to avoid doing too obvious military deployment and actions before mobilizing military operations, and will not give the outside world too much warning. Therefore, it will not want to release too much. Symptoms of early warning.</p>
<p>Secondly, even so, we can still see some of the less obvious signs, such as setting up a national defense mobilization office in various places. In this regard, some experts said, "China's military expenses have increased or the establishment of a national defense mobilization office is to respond to the needs of military transformation and the unity of power. Although the defense mobilization is related to the war at first glance, it is not completely for war. Because of the major disaster situations such as typhoons, earthquakes, and epidemic in the country, there will be a need for mobilization. "I think I think it is too wishful. China has a major disaster, and it is not only recently or in the future. There have been serious disasters in the past few decades, but they have never established a national defense mobilization office for this. When the COVID epidemic was the worst, it did not improve to the level of defense. The word "national defense" has never been connected to the content of disaster prevention in the CCP's discourse system.</p>
<p>Third, we have to see that even those who seem to be less obvious, now there are a phenomenon of increasing and growth. For example, Xi Jinping made it clear that when he inspected the Central Industrial Zone on June 7, it was clearly stated that the construction of a large domestic cycle was to ensure that the national economy could run normally under extreme circumstances, which was not contradictory to participate in the international economic cycle. Such a statement rarely appeared before, and what is the "extreme situation" here. I think the possibility of "war" or "the color revolution is forced to be forced" is far greater than the possibility of natural disasters. Because from Xi Jinping's past remarks, we rarely see how much attention is for serious natural disasters. Therefore, Xi Jinping's latest speech is itself a sign worthy of vigilance.</p>
<p>There is also a sign: According to the report of General Paparo, commander of the Pacific Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy, China has deployed a "huge wave-3" intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 10,000 kilometers on the six nuclear submarines, so that China can from South China from South China The sea base is attacked throughout the United States. China's preparation of such military deployment indicates that they already have the ideological preparations with the US military conflict. Of course, the purpose of military operations that can attack Taiwan can be more smooth. Is this sign of signs to prevent natural disasters or show off force? In my opinion, the sign of the CCP's martial arts not only exists, but also increasing. Not long ago, Chinese military aircraft and warships provoked U.S. military aircraft and warships at close range, which led to a rare warning of the White House, saying that "there will be casualties in the next step." Is this sign of signs clear enough?</p>
<p>Of course, we do not have enough evidence to confirm that the CCP will soon launch a military attack on Taiwan, but the wishful neglecting or fading the CCP's war mobilization and war preparations are not conducive to all preparations for the international community for war in the international community. It will also scatter the collective will of the Taiwanese nationals to resist invasion. The latter, in my opinion, is the most critical factor that determines the victory once the war broke out. In the end, I also need to point out that letting the whole world relax, in my opinion, it is part of the war, it is a cognitive battle, a psychological war. This argument itself is worthy of vigilance.</p>

<p>According to the Stock Groquat Institute of International Peace, Sweden(Sipri)In terms of saying, nine countries in the world with nuclear weapons are continuing to modernize its nuclear arsenal. China's nuclear warhead reserves will increase by 17%by 2022.</p>
<p>The Stockholm Institute of International Peace, which was released on Monday 2023, said that it is estimated that China's nuclear arsenal has increased from 350 warheads in January 2022 to 410 in January 2023, and "it is expected to continue to grow." It was decided to build its troops in China. In the report, if it wants to build its power, by 2030, China may have at least the same intercontinental ballistic missile as the United States or Russia(ICBM)Essence</p>
<p>SIPRI large -scale killing weapon project deputy senior researcher and American scientist federation(FAS)The director of the nuclear information project Hans Kristensen said, "China has begun to expand its nuclear arsenal."</p>
<p>"It is increasingly difficult to combine this trend with the goal of maintaining only the minimum nuclear force required for national security."</p>
<p>The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the world's largest combat force, but China is also trying to achieve the modernization of its military equipment and weapons.</p>
<p>Globally, SIPRI is estimated to have 12512 nuclear warheads in January 2023, with about 9,576 military reserves for potential use -86 more than January 2022.</p>
<p>Among them, it is estimated that 3844 warheads are deployed with missiles and aircraft, about 2,000 -almost all from Russia or the United States -maintaining a highly combat alert state, which means that they are installed on the missile or stored on the Air Force with nuclear bombers. base.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-12T09-56-00/1-1686563437.png" />Global nuclear weapons reserve growth of nuclear weapons According to data from the Stockholm International Institute of International Peace, as of the beginning of 2023, nine countries held approximately 12512 warheads. Since last year, China has increased the largest amount of inventory in its arsenal, with about 60 new warheads. Essence</p>
<p>SIPRI pointed out that despite China's nuclear reserves increasing, the United States and Russia have nearly 90% of the world's nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Although the tension in Russia had exacerbated the tension after Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, their arsenal seemed to remain stable in 2022. SIPRI pointed out that the transparency of the nuclear forces of the two countries has declined due to continuous war.</p>
<p>In February of this year, Russia said it would suspend participation in the "New Treatment of Strategic Weapons", which is an important pillar of the US -Russian nuclear military reserve control.</p>
<p>Washington said earlier this month that it will stop providing the latest information about Moscow related problems such as missiles and launch positions. Washington said it was a revenge "countermeasure" against the Moscow "violation" agreement. In February 2022, in February 2022 Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine on the 24th, the United States has suspended the stable dialogue with Russia's bilateral strategy.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus earlier in July. Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war, Western allies including the United States have jointly helped Ukraine to self -defense, while Russia often threatened to conduct Nuclear retaliation.</p>
<p>SIPRI Director Dan Smith stated in a statement, "We are entering one of the most dangerous times in human history," he also added. "The urgent priority is that the governments in the world find a cooperation method to calm the geopolitical tension and slow down to slow down and slow down. The consequences of the increasing worsening of the environmental collapse and the worsening of the world's hunger cope with the military reserve competition. "</p>
<p>SIPRI pointed out that in other nuclear countries in the world, India and Pakistan seem to be expanding its nuclear arsenal to develop a new nuclear carrier system.</p>
<p>The report said, "Although Pakistan is still the main focus of the Indian nuclear deterrent power, India seems to pay more and more attention to remote weapons, including those weapons that can hit the targets across China."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-12T09-56-00/1-1686563488.jpg" />Does Russia's suspension of nuclear treaty trigger arms race?</p>
<p>SIPRI observed that North Korea also listed its nuclear plan as a priority for 2022.</p>
<p>The think tank is estimated to be assembled about 30 warheads and has a fission material with sufficient manufacturing 50 to 70 warheads, all of which are greatly higher than in January 2022. The last test nuclear weapon in Pyongyang was in 2017.</p>
<p>In January of this year, North Korean leader Kim Jong -un called on its nuclear arsenal to "exponentially" growth.</p>
<p>Other places, SIPRI Nian Jian said that after the government announced in 2021 that the upper limit of the number of nuclear warheads was increased from 225 to 260, the British warhead reserve is expected to increase.</p>
<p>Sipri said that France is still planning to develop the third -generation nuclear power ballistic missile submarine(SSBN)And the new air -ray cruise missile, as well as renovation and upgrading the existing system.</p>
<p>Israel -did not publicly acknowledge the ownership of nuclear weapons -it is also considered to modernize its nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>"SIPRI large -scale killing weapon projects and senior research associate researchers Matt Corda said," Most countries with nuclear weapons are strengthening their statement on the importance of nuclear weapons. Threat, "he also added," this upgraded nuclear competition has greatly increased the risk of nuclear weapons for the first time since World War II. "</p>
<p>This year's yearbook is an annual assessment of SIPRI on global arms, disarmament and security status.</p>

<h3>Eternal youth</h3>
<p>Berluskini first won the Prime Minister's throne for the first time under the banner of "forward Italy" in 1994. At that time, his hair was obviously less than now, and his wrinkles were obviously more than now. Now he has not only transplanted his hair, but also performed a leather surgery. At the age of 76, he cares about his appearance.</p>

<h1>U.S. officials said that China has set up a years at the Cuban spy base</h1>

<p>Description: Cuba has intelligence strategic value because of its neighboring the United States. U.S. officials said that China and Cuba have reached an agreement to strengthen their existing spy capabilities, and the two countries have denied it. It is unclear whether the trip to China planned to China will affect it. Yander Zamora/EPA, Via Shutterstock's intelligence committee at the US Senate is uneasy about reports on cooperation between Beijing and Havana.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-12T10-39-46-08-00/10dc-spybase-wlqk-master1050.jpg" />According to a Biden government official, since the upgrade in 2019 (or before it), a spy base in Cuba has been able to intercept the electronic signals of nearby US military and commercial facilities nearby.</p>
<p>The official who demanded unknown because of the discussion of sensitive information said that the spy base was an issue inherited by the Bayeng government's former President Trump. The official said that after Biden took office, the relevant departments reported to his government the situation of the Cuban base and China was considering the plan to set up similar facilities around the world.</p>
<p>"Wall Street Journal" first reported on Thursday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/politics/china-spy-cuba-station.html">China Agreement on Establishing Spy Facilities in Cuba</a>The New York Times and other news media also followed up. This caused a strong response in Congress. Democratic Senator from Virginia, Mark Waya, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republicans, the highest status in the committee, and Senator Malcow Rubio from Florida, said in a joint statement, "There are reports saying that it is reported to say that , Havana and Beijing are working with the people of the United States and our people, we are deeply disturbed. "</p>
<p>The National Security Council spokesman John Cerby had denied when the report just appeared, saying that the report was "inaccurate." He also said, "We do have worried about the relationship between China and Cuba. From the first day of the government, we have always worried that China's activities in our hemisphere and around the world."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>However, according to an intelligence mentioned in the relevant reports on Thursday's relevant reports, the United States official insisted that in the Middle Ages, it has reached an agreement to strengthen the existing espionage ability.</p>
<p>Cuban Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Carlos Fernandez Dekosio, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the latest report on spy facilities was "slander speculation."</p>
<p>Some critics of the Biden government in Congress questioned the motivation of the government's response to the report.</p>
<p>"Why did the Biden government previously denied these reports on the CCP spy bases in Cuba? Why did they dilute the CCP spy balloon of the" stupid "?" He is the chairman of the House of Representatives of the United States and the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said that the Bayeng government has been working hard to fight against China to continue to gain foothold in North America and other regions, mainly to conduct foreign contacts with China that is seeking to become a potential host of such bases. The official also said that the US government's approach has slowed the speed of China's relevant plans, but refused to disclose specific details.</p>
<p>Although there have been reports of the Chinese government's efforts to set up military bases and monitoring whistle stations around the world, recent reports have explained in detail that China is establishing intelligence collection facilities closer to the United States. Cuba's coastal line is less than 160 kilometers from its nearest Florida. This distance is enough to enhance China's technical capabilities for signal intelligence to monitor electronic communications in Southeast of the United States, where several military bases are located.</p>
<p>China and the United States are conventional to listen to each other's activities, and the distance between Cuba and the United States has made it a long -term foothold that has been a strategic value of the United States. The most famous may be the Cuban missile crisis during the Cold War. He has tried to deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in response to these reports last Friday that the United States "is the world's strongest 'hacker empire' and a veritable" monitoring great country ".</p>
<p>The emergence of these reports is not time for the Biden government. After the United States and China have been in a state of intensive tension for a long time, the Bayeng government has been working hard to improve its relations with China. Last year, Perosi, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States, ignored the Chinese government's opposition and visited Taiwan, which was regarded by China as a territorial island, China frozen some of the two countries' contact in diplomacy, military, and climate.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Americans saw a Chinese spy balloon appearing near sensitive military facilities from the ground and tracking the balloon flying over the United States. Formal access.</p>
<p>Blindken's current arrangement is to visit Beijing on June 18. It is unclear whether Chinese spy facilities are so close to the US territory, whether these plans will increase the variables. Other issues that may affect this trip include, and China is required to release <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230425/china-journalist-dong-yuyu/">Dong Yuyu</a><a href="https://twitter.com/wppressfreedom/status/1667506636007546884">Voice is getting higher and higher</a>He is a famous reporter who has been detained since February last year. The government has accused him of engaging in spy activities, and his family calls it a false analogy. The case is currently waiting for court trial. Dong Yuyu has been a researcher at Harvard University. For many years, he has met with the US -Japanese diplomats and reporters in Beijing in a transparent way.</p>

<p>The Chinese ambassador to France, which has repeatedly issued diplomatic storms due to the "War Wolf" attitude, will be degraded to return to China. According to the Hong Kong media "Sing Tao Daily" exclusively on Monday (12th), Lu Shaye will return to China to take over as the president of the Chinese People's Friendship Association to engage in civil diplomacy.</p>
<p>The report emphasized that Lu Shaye has been the ambassador to France for 4 years and is about to be 59 years old. It is also "accustomed to arrangements and things are normal."</p>
<p>However, the news has not been confirmed. At present, on the official website of the Chinese Embassy in France, Lushayo's position has not changed.</p>
<p>As early as the Ambassador to Canada, Lushaye had shown his "wolf's true colors". After Huawei's rotating chairman Meng Wanzhou was arrested, he wrote an article and publicly criticized Canada's "white supremacy". During his stay in France, he also scolded a French scholar as a "little hooligan", which caused controversy.</p>
<p>In April of this year, he said in an interview with a French television station that the former Soviet Union joined the Republic of the France had no effective sovereign state status, triggering criticism from the three Baltic countries, Ukraine, France and the European Union. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs later stated that this was just the "personal perspective" of Lushaye, and China's position on related sovereignty unchanged.</p>
<p>Earlier, there were also rumors that Lushayo was recalled on May 15. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said it was "fake news" at the time. In an interview with a French independent media later, Lushayo emphasized that his remarks were not conflicting with Chinese official foreign policies, and said that "some people have done a lot of questions."</p>
<p>The report also pointed out that Deng Li, the current deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, may take over Lushaye as the ambassador to France.</p>

<p>In a restaurant in Nanchang universities in Jiangxi, some students ate foreign bodies suspected of "mice". However, the results of the school and government officials that the result was "duck neck". In this regard, public opinion was uproar. According to Xinhua News Agency on Saturday (10th), in response to the "6 · 1" food safety incident of Jiangxi Institute of Industry Vocational and Technical College, Jiangxi Province has established a provincial education department, the Provincial Public Security Department, the Provincial SASAC, the Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, etc. The joint investigation team composed of the department conducted an investigation. In the next step, the joint investigation team will promptly announce the relevant investigation and handling situation to the society.</p>
<p>In an interview with Radio Asian Radio on Monday on Monday, the Chinese objections said that he did not have much hope for the official "joint investigation". He said that the official resentment in order to calm the people: "The results of the investigation will definitely deal with several grass -roots managers or companies in contracted cafeteria. They must be a scapegoat, otherwise no one will take the responsibility. A profitable person, because a considerable part of the money earned is taken away. "</p>
<p>Students from Jiangxi Institute of Technology in the cafeteria on June 1, when they ate in the cafeteria, they found foreign bodies suspected of mouse heads in the meal. The school responded that it was a duck neck, which detonated a dispute between mouse and ducks that lasted for several days. After that, on the 8th, the same cafeteria was exposed to a student of a large cyan large software bugs about 6 cm in a piece of vegetables.</p>
<p>Ji Feng said that a cafeteria frequently appeared in food safety incidents in about a week. I believe that there are no fear in the cafeteria: "Many things they do so unscrupulously, indicating that there are umbrellas and benefits. Now the cafeteria of the university is basically contracted. , I have a friend who contracts more than ten universities. "</p>

In the two years, the sanitary inspection records of the cafeteria of Jiangxi Institute of Technology Vocational and Technical College improved the publicity records of food safety awareness and food safety management capabilities of schools and related enterprises, and publicly involved the publicity records of catering companies in the school's cafeteria.</p>
<p>Sun Yanru, a former teacher of a school in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, told this station that the final result of the official joint investigation team was at least to calm the people's dissatisfaction with the government: "This investigation team will first have any substantial results. Of course, they may have one one An excuse to calm this matter, and it is possible to find a few sinful sheep, such as the incident of the Xuzhou iron chain women in Jiangsu, and they have also found a few sinful sheep. This investigation team, its credibility has been bankrupt in the hearts of the citizens. "</p>

<p>Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager. Some workers sent a confrontation scene in Douyin <a href="https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA1p7MwZLcIxN-nQUiu8yogLIDKf2PS7Cxw7e6pYJABIY?modal_id=7228898852244376847&amp;relation=0&amp;vid=7228898852244376847">Video</a>Essence</p>
<p>Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.</p>
<p>Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to Wuli Industrial Zone was also the same. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?</p>
<p>It should be asked why!</p>
<p>Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?</p>
<p>As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. <a href="http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm">Company Branch Committee</a>". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.</p>
<p>In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?</p>
<p>With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.</p>
<p>It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor <a href="https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html">Xi Jinping once scolded</a>Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".</p>
<p>What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?</p>
<p>On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.</p>
<p>However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.</p>
<p>According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.</p>
<p>So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?It seems that the people who may be responsible for the release of China Industry.com are precisely some people who are "mediocre and peaceful stalls, peaceful peace, and mixed days." These people only care about publication, and do not care about the lack of missing missions in the living incidents such as Jiaxinguan Plant. They do not care whether the exaggerated achievements have happened in the reports issued.</p>
<p>Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[<a href="http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html">Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality</a>"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.</p>
<p>In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".</p>
<p>In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.</p>
<p>The good situation of enterprises ".</p>
<p>The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".</p>
<p>For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.</p>
<p>The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.</p>

The British government has proposed four major demands, including the British government's public support to support the one -media group founder Li Zhiying and other Hong Kong political prisoners, the Confucius Institute to close the Confucius Institute, ensure the principles of insisting on freedom of speech, and accelerate the approval of political asylum applicants.</p>
<p>These four demands are also aimed at the British government's recent attitude towards China to soften and refuse to close the Confucius Institute; some Hong Kong people organized the "Yangcun" education daily camp to be canceled by the local church, and some Hong Kong political asylum applicants have not been approved by refugees. For identity, some people have turned to apply for BNO (British National Overseas Passport) visa.</p>

<p>The Chen couple participated in the 612 rally in London with a pair of children for the third consecutive year. Chen Tai pays special attention to young Hong Kong people who apply for political asylum in the UK. Some people have no application for years.

<p>Taiwan ’s President Tsai Ing -wen said when he attended the“ 2023 Global Economic and Trade Forum ”on Monday that Taiwan also prepared early in the face of the challenge of the slowdown of global economic growth. She emphasized that Taiwan's continued expansion of cooperative relations in foreign economic and trade, and the first batch of agreements on the "US Taiwan 21st Century Trade initiative" have been signed. This is the most comprehensive trade agreement signed by Taiwan and the United States since 1979: "Not only not only not only It is an important milestone for Taiwan -US economic and trade relations, and it also takes a key step for Taiwan and major trade countries. "</p>
<p>Tsai Ing -wen pointed out that next to Taiwan and the United States will start 7 topics such as labor, environment, agriculture, and digital trade, which will almost cover the relevant content of trade agreements such as the "Cross Pacific Partnership" (CPTPP).</p>
<p>"In the future, Taiwan and the United States can gradually expand the content of the agreement based on the consensus of cooperation and lay a more stable foundation for the signing of the Taiwan -US Free Trade Agreement (FTA)." She said.</p>
<p>After the United States and Taiwan announced the launch of the "US -Taiwan 21st Century Trade initiative" in June last year, after many video conferences and two rounds of physical negotiations in November last year and January this year, the two parties completed the first on June 1st.

Among them, the two parties reached an agreement on five issues such as customs management and convenient trade, good legal operations, domestic rules and regulations for service industry, anti -corruption and SMEs.</p>
<p>Qiu Junrong, a professor at the Department of Economics of Central University, once served as the vice chairman of the National Development Commission (National Development Council) of Taiwan. (ECFA), Taiwan -made products enter the Chinese market for tariff -free, and Taiwanese enterprises concentrate resources in China to produce. In the early days, the main force of Taiwan's traditional industries, such as petrochemicals, textiles, and upstream industries, automotive components, etc., and other terminal products such as automobiles and laptops were followed up. Taiwan has formed the so -called "foundry economy". Taiwan's low -paying structural problem.</p>
<p>However, today China's economic situation has deteriorated, not just Taiwanese companies, but even Chinese companies moved out. He said that the Taiwan government has assisted Taiwanese businessmen to return to Taiwan in recent years.</p>

He believes that in May last year, the United States and the 13th Indo -Pacific countries launched the Indo -Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), and Taiwan was not included in the first round of participating countries. In order not to let Taiwan feel "orphan", the United States and Taiwan soon announced on June 1 last year that the "US Taiwan 21st Century Trade Initiative" negotiation was launched.</p>
<p>Qiu Yihong said that this was similar to Taiwan's encounter in 1954. At that time, Taiwan was unable to participate in the Southeast Asian Security Agreement. Therefore, the US President Eisenhower government signed a common defense agreement with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Qiu Yihong: "I think this is the same practice. In the overall strategy of the United States, Taiwan cannot join the IPEF, but it must make Taiwan feel that Taiwan is particularly important in the United States, so it must be done."</p>

<p>Fu Zemin, an associate researcher at the Institute of Political Science, Taiwan in Taiwan, said in the forum that the signing of economic initiatives between the United States and Taiwan has deepened the economic initiative. China's response is also a verbal attack, which will have a demonstration effect on other countries: "Demonstration effect effect It will be reflected that some countries that do not want to choose border stations in the United States, including ASEAN, especially Singapore and Malaysia clearly, and do not want to make them into a big choice because of the relationship with the United States or China.

<p>Wang Guochen, the first associate researcher at the Chinese Institute of Economics in Taiwan, pointed out that in the future, Taiwan can "Taiwan+N" model with other national alliances with the "US -Taiwan 21st Century Trade Initiative" model. The first is the "Chip4" chip Quartet Alliance, including the United States, Japan and South Korea; in addition, Vietnam, which is "Cross -Pacific Partnership" (CPTPP), is an indispensable main force in Vietnam because Taiwanese businessmen are indispensable.

The interest rate reduction shows that the expenditure of consumers with the main driving force of economic growth is still sluggish, and people are increasingly worried that China has not rebounded as strong as expected after the cancellation of "clearing".

This is the second interest rate cut since last year, reflecting that people are increasingly worried that the world's second largest economy has not rebounded as expected after canceling the "clear zero" restrictions.</p>
<p>Six commercial banks have announced that the interest rate of current deposits has been reduced from 0.25%to 0.2%. They also reduce the time deposit interest rate.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the largest bank in China, <a href="https://www.icbc.com.cn/ICBC/EN/FinancialInformation/RMBDepositLoanRate/RMBDepositRate/">according to the bank's website</a>It reduced the five -year deposit interest rate from 2.65%to 2.5%, and reduced the three -year deposit interest rate from 2.6%to 2.45%.</p>

<p>Reducing deposit interest rates is a leverage that policy makers can use to stimulate expenditure. Hope that lower interest rates can inspire consumers to consume or invest, rather than deposit saving savings into banks.</p>
<p>This shows that consumers spending as the main driving force for economic growth are still sluggish. After China canceled the restrictions on the new crown epidemic at the end of last year, and re -open the economy, people's expected demand for suppressed will promote consumers to start a lot of consumption -but this has not been realized in many areas of the economy.</p>
<p>Hu Weijun, chief Chinese economist of McGonal Group, said that the change in deposit interest rates "paved the way for more loose measures." He also said that the People's Bank of China of the People's Bank of China may reduce the benchmark loan interest rate or take other measures to stimulate the economy in the next few months. He said that reducing bank deposit withdrawal can offset some financial pressures of the People's Bank of China when reducing loan interest rates.</p>

<p>The day before the Fed announced on the day when the interest rate decision was announced, the United States will release the data rising data of consumer prices in May. This result may play an important role in the process of thinking about the resolution of central bank officials.</p>
<p>The current forecast of market sources is that the Fed will temporarily stop this month, and it will be announced to raise interest rates until July. The central bank of Japan, China, and the EUR region will be announced this week that it will announce monetary policy decisions.</p>

<p>Recently, a "anti -war" post from Chinese netizens has received a strong response, saying that "if war occurs, I won't go, and I won't let my children go." The post also said that no one remembered when people living at the bottom of society were remembered when they were in trouble.</p>
<p>According to the "Contemporary Chinese Journal" in mid -May, according to the survey, only 55%of the Chinese people supported the launch of a comprehensive war against Taiwan for unification. 33%of them opposed Wu Tong Taiwan, and 22%accepted "not necessarily not that it is not necessarily not that it is not must "Unified" options.</p>

Whether this shows that the official "patriotism" has gradually lost to the livelihood considerations and dissatisfaction with the status quo, it is worth further observing.</p>

According to the British "The Sundaytimes" (The Sundaytimes), before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, scientists in the Wuhan Laboratory cooperated with the Chinese PLA to create virus mutants that can be used for biological weapons, but the virus leaked from the laboratory.</p>

<p>"Sunday Times" checked hundreds of documents, confidential reports, internal memorandums, scientific papers and email communications, and interviewed investigators from the US State Department and epidemic experts, to relieve the possible origin process of new crown viruses.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute was originally conducting a study of the origin of the origin of SARS (syndrome of severe acute respiratory tract), and obtained the US government's funds through a charity in New York, USA. In addition, the top Coronary virus scientist in the United States It also shared the advanced virus manipulation technology.</p>
<p>However, in 2016, a team of scientists led by Shi Zhengli, director of the new infectious disease research center of Wuhan Virus Research Institute, found a new type of coronary virus in Mojiang, Yunnan Province, but the Chinese authorities did not warn the world or notified related deaths. event. Today, this virus is considered to be the only new crown virus that is known before the outbreak of the epidemic.</p>
<p>The virus discovered by Mojiang was sent to the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, and the research results of scientists in the institute became confidential. The report quoted a U.S. investigator and said: "The report of the report began to become opaque, and the confidential plan started from now on."</p>

<p><strong> US investigators: China plans to make the virus more infectious to humans </strong></p>
<p>The "Sunday Times" quoted the US State Department investigator report that although the Wuhan Virus Research Institute had set self -employed institutions, the United States has determined that the institute has cooperated with the Chinese military in publications and secret projects. At least from 2017, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute on behalf of the Chinese military has engaged in confidential research, including laboratory animal experiments. "</p>
<p>US investigators believe that this plan has led to the emergence of the new crown virus and flowed out of Wuhan after a laboratory accident. A investigator believes that the situation is becoming more and more clear that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute involves manufacturing, dissemination and concealment of the new crown epidemic. The report disclosed that evidence discovered by the US personnel proved that in November 2019, Chinese researchers engaged in related experiments had symptoms similar to new crowns and were sent to the hospital. One of the researchers' families died. One month later, there was a new crown case in Wuhan.</p>
<p><strong> The epidemic is derived from the laboratory rather than the South China market </strong></p>
<p>Another analysis disclosed by the newspaper showed that the initial source center of the epidemic was close to the laboratory of Wuhan Virus Research Institute, not the South China Seafood Market that everyone had always considered. According to a report from the U.S. Senate, Chinese military personnel were awarded the positions of in charge in the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. In a book published by the Wuhan Institute of Virus in 2015, it discussed how the SARS virus represents a "new era of gene weapons", which can "manually manipulate it into a new human disease virus, and then weapons and release them. come out".</p>
<p>Investigators also noticed that Wuhan Laboratory cultivated three mutant viruses and tested it to create a highly contagious super -coronary virus, which is only a research part of cooperation on the table with Western. Investigators believe that the PLA was also conducting a virus research plan at the same time. The report pointed out that relevant researchers tried to find solid evidence but were hindered because of the lack of transparency in the Chinese government. After the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, the Chinese government had to disclose the results of the coronary virus research discovered by Mojiang, and it has also caused experts from other countries to question that the Chinese government may have changed relevant data to avoid the outside world from discovering more truths to Mojiang.</p>
<p>The reporter of this station made a letter to the US State Department and the Chinese Embassy in the United States to seek comment on Monday, but did not receive a reply before the deadline.</p>
<p>The report also disclosed that the Chinese PLA vaccine expert Zhou Yussen (transliteration) had cooperated with Wuhan scientists to study the Coronatte Virus of the Middle East (MERS), and also cooperated with Wuhan scientists during the epidemic. Zhou Yusen was suspected that he applied for a new crown pneumonia vaccine patent in February 2020, and it took more than a month before China acknowledged the outbreak of the epidemic.</p>
<p>The Times of the Sunday pointed out that if a country can allow citizens to vaccinates the secret virus they developed by their own vaccines, they may have weapons that can reverse the balance of world power.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Civil Affairs of China announced the "Civil Affairs Statistics in the Fourth quarter of 2022" on June 9. However, in the statistical bulletin issued by this delay for several months, it did not publish data related to cremating remains as usual. Commentary believes that this may be because from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, the number of deaths reached a new high, so that the official has not yet decided how to release it, so he has been reluctant to disclose death data.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs usually released civil affairs data such as marriage, divorce, and the cremation of the body within three months, but the data in the last quarter of last year was delayed, causing external doubts. At the same time, in the "Civil Affairs Statistics of the Fourth Speaking of 2022" released a few days ago, the cremated remains that have always been released have disappeared. The Ministry of Civil Affairs did not explain the delayed release of data and the lack of funeral data.</p>
<p>In this regard, Cai Shenkun, a commentator from the United States, said: "This means that the result of virus infections that swept across the country in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year was serious. It has reached a new high, so that the Chinese official has not yet decided how to let the outside world know, so it has been reluctant to disclose death data, including the cremation data of the remains of urban residents that have been disclosed for a long time.

<p>(Voice of Germany in China) The Ministry of Commerce of China issued a statement on Monday (June 12) that the United States incorporated some Chinese enterprises and individuals in the "Special Specific National List" on the grounds of so -called Iran.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that the United States lacks the factual basis, lacks legitimate procedures, and harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and individuals. The United States should stop the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies and individuals. The spokesman said that China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and individuals.</p>
<p>Last week, the US Department of Finance sanctions on six entities and seven individuals of mainland China, Hong Kong and Iran, on the grounds that they were suspected of helping Iran to obtain parts and technologies for developing ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>The sanctioned companies include Beijing Shiny Nights Technology Development Co., Ltd. (LTD), Qingdao Zhongrong Trade Development (Qingdao Zhongron Trade Development), and Hong Kong KE.DO International Trade Corporation ( Hong kong Ke.Do International Trade Co.)And Hong Kong Lingoe Processing Engineering (Lingoe PROCESSSENGINEERING LIMITED) and Zhejiang Qingji IND.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said that these Chinese companies transported a centrifugal metal, electronic devices and gyroscopes to the Iranian government agencies and private companies that have been working closely and involved in the construction of missiles to produce nuclear fuels. Washington is worried that Iran plans to develop nuclear weapons and loads it on the ballistic missile to threaten Israel and other countries.</p>
<h3>Tehran will create the Iranian version of the "Fire Great Wall"?</h3>
<p>The Foreign Asset Control Office of the U.S. Finance also to the Iranian military officer Da Ud Damgini(Davoddamghani)Sanctions, saying that the military officer coordinated the military -related procurement of Iranian end users, including Iranian defense and armed forces Logistics Department.</p>
<p>Sanctions are prohibited from US companies and individuals, as well as companies such as multinational banks with branches in the United States to trade with companies listed on the blacklist.</p>
<h3>sanction list is getting longer and longer</h3>
<p>The U.S. Treasury announced in March this year that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美制裁五中企-指其助伊朗獲無人機零件/a-64940191">five Chinese companies and one person on the sanctions list</a>Called it to provide components to Iranian drone manufacturers. The five Chinese companies are: Hangzhou Fuyang KOTO Machinery Co., Ltd., and its company Raven International Trade Co., Ltd., which is famous in Hong Kong; Guilin Alpha Plastic Technology Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Kas Polo Technology Co., Ltd., S &amp; Ctrade Pty Co., LTD.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury said that these headquarters in China "sold and transport thousands of aviation components to the Iranian Aviation Manufacturing Industry Corporation (HESA), including components that can be used for drones", and said that these companies are against Russia. There is an indirect relationship between Ukraine's attack and Iranian attack in the Gulf area, because in the incident, both Russia and Iran use the Shahed-136 drone manufactured by HESA, and the Iranian company is indirectly controlled by the Iranian Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported in February this year that the U.S. authorities are considering <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美媒美国考虑制裁中国监控设备公司/a-64611654">sanctions on Chinese monitoring equipment companies selling products to Iran's security forces</a>Essence At that time, the target was Tiandy Technologies, an electronic equipment manufacturer headquartered in Tianjin. It is reported that Tiandi Weiye sold products to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards.</p>
<p>Tiandi Weiye has been included in the trade blacklist by the US Department of Commerce in December last year because the company uses facial recognition technology to assist the Chinese government to persecute the Uighurs in the Xinjiang region and sell them to the security department, police and troops in Iran. Monitoring equipment.</p>

Since entering the second quarter, there have been more and more signs of economic weakness.

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65893596/64417642"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T14-20-00Z/64417642_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "South Germany will" commented that at the end of last year, it may be based on the dual pressure of people's protests and economic difficulties. The leaders of Chinese party and state leaders finally abandoned the strict "clearing policy". However, although there is no trouble in the control management, the Chinese economy does not recover vitality as scheduled. The comments entitled "The German Economy Insteady to China" wrote:</p>
<p>"The Chinese Communist Party's dominance is highly dependent on economic growth. Xi Jinping's power is not obtained through elections. Therefore, he must improve people's livelihood to curb the spread of people's dissatisfaction. For example, compared with Western countries, the consequences of climate change are more obvious in China. In many parts of China, there have been record high -temperature weather. This is absolutely for China's power supply and industrial production. It is not a good thing. In addition, China's aging problem is becoming more and more serious, and the social welfare system seems to be weaker. For many Chinese people, the elderly can only rely on themselves. Money will become more cautious](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消费疲软-中国经济面临通缩风险/a-65868466)Essence The surge in the unemployment rate of youth has also made many families worry about their children's future.</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese savings are used to buy real estate. However, after Xi Jinping launched a rectification operation of the real estate group built by the debt, the entire real estate market was stagnant. Real estate prices have not only worried many ordinary families, but local governments are no exception, because only real estate prices continue to rise can local governments continue to raise funds. However, the old road to returning to the soaring real estate that year was hidden in the huge bubble risk. After all, there were millions of sets of idle apartments.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T14-20-00Z/59518373_401.jpg" />After a series of renovation operations in the government, the Chinese real estate economy also lost the prosperity of the past.</p>
<p>It may be a feasible way to realize a widespread private economy. How much contribution to the private economy can make the national economy that is dominated by state -owned enterprises, Alibaba, founded by Ma Yun, is a clear example. However, Xi Jinping's unstoppable management and control desire to drive such companies out of the country. In order to prepare for the war with Taiwan, the goal set by Xi Jinping is that from food production to high -tech industries, various economic fields should be self -sufficient, and this move has reduced the attraction of the Chinese market to Western companies. Due to the surge in risks, rising salary capital, and the decline in growth prospects, many Western companies in China have begun to find other investment locations. "</p>
<p>Comments say that the various problems currently faced by the Chinese economy are not good for the West. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为什么说中国不太可能再次拯救全球经济/a-65613569">After all, the growth rate of China's economic growth has fallen by one percentage point, which means that the global economy has fallen by 0.3%. </a>"In view of this, for the German government, the German -Chinese government's consultation starting on June 20 will be extremely difficult: on the one hand, the German government hopes that the Chinese economy will remain strong, but on the other hand, they oppose Xi Jinping's political route. The weak economy may make this political leader more compromised politically. But the problem is that Xi Jinping will give up his personal political goals for the long -term economic benefits of the Chinese people. "</p>
<p>"Daily News" also reports the current weak situation of China's economy. The report said:</p>
<p>"At present, the situation of state -owned enterprises is obviously much better than private enterprises. But economist Wang Dan said: 'This is a worrying signal. Because it is well known that these companies are very low efficiency, the efficiency of these companies is very low, and the efficiency of these enterprises is very low, and the efficiency of these enterprises is very low. It can not bring jobs. After 2010, all jobs in large cities are generated by private companies. Therefore, if you want to recover the economy, you must let private enterprises play a more important role. '</p>
<p>So far, the highest level of China's party and government has not issued any signals to boost the economy. One of the reasons is that many high -level people still firmly believe that this year can achieve a 5%set goal of economic growth. Observer generally believes that the People's Bank of China will reduce some types of loan interest rates next week. "</p>

<p>Before stopping funds in 2011, the United States provided 22%of the UNESCO budget, namely $ 75 million.</p>
<p>DemocraticParty, a Democratic Party, who belongs to the US President Joe Biden last December, has paved the way for the United States to provide UNESCO funds with a budget of US $ 150 million.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in March this year that UNESCO's absence of UNESCO is an opportunity to formulate artificial intelligence (AI) rules for China.</p>
<p>Blingken told the Federal Senate to a committee during the budget: "I think that we should return to UNESCO again, not as a gift for UNESCO, but because UNESCO is really important."</p>
<p>Brinken pointed out: "They are developing the rules, specifications and standards of artificial intelligence. We hope to participate."</p>
<p>The United States withdrew from UNESCO in 1984 and re -joined the organization in October 2003 after nearly 20 years of absence.</p>
<p>The plan that the United States has joined this year needs to be submitted to the UNESCO member state conference for final approval.</p>

<p>UNESCO announced on Monday (12th) that the United States plans to re -join the organization and pay more than $ 600 million in off -ownership fees. According to the Associated Press, US officials said that the decision is because of concerns that China is filling the gaps left by the United States in the decision -making of the United States, especially in the formulation of standards for global artificial intelligence and technical education.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, the member states of the UNESCO will vote for this, but the approval seems to be just a form. No country opposes that the United States, which was once the largest capital, returned to the institution.</p>
<p>After the UNESCO voted to accept Palestine as a member state in 2011, the United States and Israel stopped funding the UNESCO. In 2017, the Trump administration decided to completely withdraw from the agency the following year, on the grounds that long -term anti -Israeli prejudice and management issues were existed.</p>
<p>Although Palestine's joining UNESCO is the fuse of conflict with the United States with the agency, its return is more due to China's growth. US Deputy Secretary of State John Bas said in March this year that the United States withdrew from UNESCO to strengthen China's strength and "weaken our ability to effectively promote the vision of the free world."</p>

<p>According to the official data released last weekend, China was severely damaged by the new crown epidemic in May. The positive test rate was close to the peak of the epidemic tsunami at the end of 2022, which is the level in early January. Experts have previously predicted that China's second wave of epidemic will reach its peak in late June.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the data released by the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday shows that since April, the proportion of patients with new coronal viruses across the country has increased by more than 5 times, and more than 40%of the detectors were reached at the end of May. Since early January this year, this level of infection has appeared.</p>
<p>China also reported that in 2,777 cases of severe infection, 164 cases died in the new crown virus infection in May -this number rose steadily within a month. At the same time, Omeck Rong's XBB Asian series completely surpassed the early iteration of the virus and promoted the rise in China's Fuyang.</p>
<p>A recent estimation of Airfinity, a predicted health analysis company headquarters in London, shows that China's second wave of infection will reach 112 million, less than one -tenth of the virus infected during the initial outbreak.</p>
<p>At present, there are still questions about the virus recovery trajectory in June. Zhong Nanshan, one of the chief consultants of China's new crown virus, has predicted that the second wave of epidemic will reach its peak at the end of June, and there may be more than 65 million cases per week.</p>
<p>However, the data of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control has shown preliminary signs, indicating that the phenomenon of Fuyang began to lose momentum at the end of May, and the increase in positive ratio is much lower than the previous weeks.</p>

Not only is it just a crime, but the total amount of money and things that have been announced is rarely expected.</p>
<p>On the 11th of last month, the Xinhua News Agency of the Communist Party of China announced the news of the former executive vice president of the Supreme Court, and the first -level judge Shen Deyong's bribery case in the first instance of the Ningbo Intermediate People's Court in Zhejiang Province. It is said that from 1995 to March 2022, the defendant Shen Deyong successively used a member of the party group and deputy dean of the Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court, a member of the Party Group and Deputy Dean of the Supreme People's Court, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, deputy secretary of the party group of the Supreme People's Court, Deputy Dean, the convenience conditions of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the director of the Social and Social and Legal Committee, and the convenient conditions for the formation of authority or status for formation to help relevant units and individuals provide assistance in case handling, engineering contracting, position promotion and other matters, directly or pass or pass His spouse and daughter received the property given by the above individuals and units, a total of more than 64.56 million yuan. The procuratorial organs requested that Shen Deyong's criminal responsibility for bribery.</p>
<p>One year ago, the author issued the "Lifetime Prison on Lifetime, the French Open of the First Class Judge Shen Deyong" in this column, and introduced it during the tenure of the vice president and executive deputy dean of the Supreme Court who had 18 years in the total of 18 years in Shen Deyong. One of the most important contributions to the establishment of the Criminal Law of the Communist Party of China is to recommend the introduction of "life imprisonment" and pass and implement.</p>
<p>In 2015, the newly revised "Criminal Law Amendment (9)" hosted by Shen Deyong added a provision: For the criminal plot of the crime, the people's court can also decide to perform the second year in the case of the death penalty of the crime. After being reduced to life imprisonment according to law, life imprisonment shall not be reduced or parole. The law was implemented from November 1, 2015.</p>
<p>The 11 months of this regulation, Bai Enpei, the former secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, became the first corrupt official in the history of the Chinese Communist Party to be sentenced to unsuitable life imprisonment. More than 100 million yuan;</p>
<p>At the time of the Bai Enpei case at that time, the Chinese official media immediately issued a post to explain: If the death sentence is sentenced to two years of execution, the two -year test period can be converted to life imprisonment. The general execution period is 20 years. Applying to be reduced, and in accordance with the requirements of relevant regulations, the shortest sentence can be come out after the sentence is slow. The "lifelong prison" sentenced to death means to "sit through the bottom".</p>
<p>Prior to this, Chen Tonghai, the former general manager of Sinopec, set up the highest amount involved in the case of corruption case of 1957.3 million yuan. Chen Tonghai was finally sentenced to death. In the future, he was repeatedly reduced. Even if he did not apply for medical treatment, it was not far from the days of "release of punishment".</p>
<p>Compared with Chen Tonghai and Bai Enpei's different life, in the words of Shen Deyong at the time, the French Open resumed, sparse but not leaking!Justice will be late, but will not be absent!The basic starting point of "Lifetime Promotion" is to effectively solve the problem of connection between the death penalty and free punishment, and change the phenomenon of the long -term imprisonment of life imprisonment and poor implementation, which is conducive to the formation of legal deterrent effects on severe corruption elements and maintaining severe punishment according to law according to law. High -pressure situation of corruption crime.</p>
<p>At that time, Bai Enpei's involved amount refreshed the record of corrupt cases in the provincial and ministerial officials at the provincial and ministerial levels. After Bai Enpei, there have been many CCP greedy who have been sentenced to life imprisonment. The most well -known is Zhao Zhengyong, the former secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, and the former Ministry of Justice Fu Zhenghua and the former deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security Sun Lijun.</p>
<p>One detail needs to be reminded, that is, when the three of them were sentenced to a life imprisonment, they all stated in court that "obeying the judgment and not appealing."</p>
<p>The most excessive is Sun Lijun. The judgment of the judge has not finished reading. He rushed out and shouted "I fully obey the judgment."</p>
<p>After Bai Enpei was sentenced to life imprisonment, the CCP's judicial community had a saying that "200 million corruption is the standard for lifelong prison". Although it is not absolute, for example, Zhu Mingguo was not sentenced to life imprisonment. But the number of 200 million is indeed a "Kaner". Jun did not see the amount of corrupt officials in the Communist Party of China in recent years, and the amount involved in the case involved in less than 200 million, then the sentence was slowly killed or even attached to the life imprisonment. Only Fu Zhenghua was alone. The concentration and unity, so it is said that Xi Jinping ordered to "never show". For detailed content, please refer to the author why Xi Jinping hated Fu Zhenghua most in this column "Sun Lijun" political gang in this column last September? "One article.</p>
<p>A year ago, the author also published in this column "The Giant Giant in the Party who was sentenced to life -long imprisonment, I hope Xi Jinping said to Shen Deyong" "Please Jun Entering" ". The "lifelong imprisonment" clause that Xi Jinping praised the "deterrence" may be implemented by his colleagues on his head. At that time, Shen Deyong was politically warm up for the promotion of President and Chief Justice. At that time, the day before the amendment to the Criminal Law of the National People's Congress drafted by Shen Deyong, which was drafted by Shen Deyong, the theme of Shen Deyong, who was full of contempt, was full of the theme All the police officers of the Supreme Law and members of the leadership team of various criminal trial trial took a party lesson, asking all the bailiffs and judges to be like his Shen Deyong: "Positive for the people, the officials are clear and frank"; Do it according to the rules, do not engage in group guys, sectarianism "...Thinking back to that year, Zhang Jun was the Deputy Court of the Supreme Court of the same period as Shen Deyong, and was also appointed as the deputy secretary of the Supreme Court in April 2008 by the party in April 2008. At that time, they were all optimistic about the "scholar -type bureaucrats" who were promoted by hundreds of percent of the promotion of national levels. Now they are prominent officials and the other is sad. It's really sighing!</p>
<p>On the 11th of last month, the Xinhua News Agency of the Communist Party of China announced that after Shen Deyong's hearing of the first trial, the online media of Mainland China immediately used the title of blogger's eyeball "The former Central Committee member was tried!" He has been greedy for 27 years "," Shen Deyong was charged with 64.56 million bribes: through spouse and daughter to receive property, it seemed to be implying that the reader was accused of 60 million bribery after 27 years of greed for 27 years, and it was only passed through the passage, and it was only passed by passing through. Spouses and daughters receive property.</p>
<p>Indeed, Shen Deyong, who has already been waiting for his body, has a long time of manuscript fees and taxes in the past years. 10 million yuan of "property"? What is the picture?</p>
<p>Here, the author deliberately put the word "property" on the quotation marks because all corrupt officials were calculated at the time when they were calculated the amount involved in the case. The most typical example was that when Jiang Zemin ordered the name of the Central Political Bureau and the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Chen Xitong in the name of economic crime, Wei Jianxing, who presided over the case, had emotioned, "What should I do if I can't find out a penny cash and corruption? "However, Jiang Zemin Leng personally ordered the gifts given by the foreign guests that Chen Xitong had received, such as Pa Kejin's pen, and gave him a" discount "to more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a "corrupt official" relative told the author that his relatives who were charged with bribery were sentenced to 15 years in prison for bribery. Now he is still serving in prison. At first, the "crime amount" was transferred to the procuratorate by the Discipline Inspection Commission's task force. However, after arriving at the procuratorate, the property he had received over the years, including the tea gift box, was calculated as a bribery amount at the market price, and it passed thousands of centers. What's more, for example, a tea gift box was received more than 10 years ago, but the market price was calculated as "bribery" at the time of the time when the gift box was found to be found. What's more is that the expenses of air tickets, hotels, and other expenses during the tourism vacation that this person have arranged by businessmen in society will be included in the amount of bribery.</p>
<p>Specific to Shen Deyong, one of the charges that the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued him was "the spirit of violations of the eight regulations of the Central Committee, receiving gifts and gifts in violation of regulations, and a banquet and tourism that may affect fair execution of official duties in violation of regulations." Imagine that in mainland China today, many gifts that can be taken, and many of them say how much it is worth it and how much it is worth it. And the expenses of banquets and tourism, even if they are only in the territory, dozens of to millions of one -time expenses are not the highest. It can be seen that when Zhang Jun's prosecutor's prosecution materials were sorted out with the supreme prosecutor last year, he should have no stones in the well. Otherwise, under the premise of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission that he has announced that Shen Deyong's "receiving huge property" will only be "implemented" in the end of the 60 million.</p>
<p>I noticed that a detail is Zhou Yongkang and Zhao Zhengyong who had been convicted with relatives in the past. Essence Shen Deyong is an exception. Check all, no one knows who Shen Deyong's wife's surname is very famous.</p>
<p>Checking the website of the China Disabled Personal Welfare Foundation, you can find one of the project title of "Public Welfare Project Promotion". Specifically: On November 6, 2013, the 4th China Soft Science Awards Awards Ceremony was held in Beijing. Comrade Shen Deyong, Executive Deputy Dean of the Supreme People's Court, published the "How to Prevent Unjust Follower and Following Cases" published in the People's Court on May 6 this year and won the 4th China Soft Science Excellent Scientific Research Achievement Award. After the awards ceremony, Comrade Shen Deyong commissioned his daughter Shen Yan to donate the 200,000 yuan bonus donation foundation to support the hearing rehabilitation cause. Rescue 4 poverty -stricken hearing -impaired children into the country to produce cochlear implants.</p>
<p>This was the only time Shen Deyong's daughter was exposed on the Internet, but only the names, and the specific information of the specific unit was not mentioned.</p>
<p>I specifically mentioned this detail. I want to focus on explaining that an article can win 200,000 yuan, Shen Deyong, which was introduced by Mainland law scholars' website many years ago. , Judgment Supervision and other more than a dozen discussions, collections, and legal reference books. Among them, the "Research on the Research on the Death System" published in 1992 is the first monograph in China to study the death penalty.</p>
<p>There are also articles on the website of Mainland China that when Shen Deyong actually presided over the executive work of the Supreme Court, judges, judges, and even each clerk's desk of courts and courts at all levels were placed on the judicial references written or edited by Shen Deyong's writing or editor -in -chief. Essence This detail alone is enough to prove that if this Shen Deyong is not intended, the manuscript fee and the taxation life alone are enough to live well. And if it is a desire to smoke and be greedy, why is it only 27 years long, using such a large hand to receive more than 60 million wealth and things? And I believe most of them are also accepted by the "acquiescence" wife and daughter.</p>
<p>To be sympathetic, why is this bitter?</p>
<p>I can't know whether the income of all the manuscripts and taxes of Shen Deyong's 27 years has reached 60 million or even higher, nor can they know how much cash in the property that he and his wife and daughter received. But only logically judged that the amount of cash received in total (illegal) in a total of 27 years of his wife and daughter and daughter was likely to be less than his 27 years of manuscript fees and tax income.</p>
<p>Next, analyze Shen Deyong's upcoming sentence and sentence of sentencing.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the prison, which is nothing more than a gentleness, a lifetime imprisonment, life imprisonment, and a life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Because Shen Deyong is the highest level of judges and first -class judges in the history of the Chinese Communist Party, of course, and of course Xi Jinping's anti -corruption history. Because there is no second -level Dato Court for the time being, it has been announced that it is corrupted, so we can only compare with a batch of secondary Dato Courts that have been dealt with one after another. Among them, the most comparison of nature is the second -level judge of the vice president of the Supreme Court, Wu Xiaoming.</p>
<p>This person was "young and promising" like Shen Deyong in the Supreme Court. The criminal facts that were found in the future also received property with his family like Shen Deyong. In 2017, Xia Xiaoming was sentenced to life imprisonment for "direct or through his family's illegal acceptance of the property illegally received by the relevant personnel."</p>
<p>In this comparison, even if the inflation factors are not considered, the standard of sentencing of Shen Deyong after six years should be under the life imprisonment of Xia Xiaoming.</p>
<p>Compare several members of the more typical "Sun Lijun Political Gang" in the last year or two. Gong Daoan, the former deputy mayor and director of the public security, received more than 73.43 million yuan, and was sentenced to 15 years. Former Chongqing Deputy Mayor and Director of Public Security Deng Huilin received more than 42.67 million yuan for bribes, and were sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>In comparison, it can be speculated that Shen Deyong's announcement will be announced in the short time after 15 years, and the possibility of 15 years is not without. After all, he was previously a ministerial official, a member of the central government, and a first -level judge, so his former colleagues Zhang Jun gave it to the restriction of "opening the law" for more than 10 years. exclude.</p>

<p>The Swiss Ministry of Finance said that the Swiss Federal Administrative Department's website was attacked by hackers on Monday (June 12), resulting in the official website of the government government agencies and government -related enterprises.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that the Swiss Ministry of Finance issued a statement saying that some federal administrative websites were unavailable due to a distributed refusal service attack (DDOS). The authorities believe that the hacker attack and the network attacks encountered by the Swiss Parliament last week came from a "unknown" hacker organization.</p>
<p>Network experts are taking measures to restore the operation of the website and applications as soon as possible. The Swiss National Network Security Center (NCSC) is analyzing the attack with the affected administrative units and strives to determine appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>NCSC emphasized that relevant departments did not lose important data in DDOS attacks.</p>
<p>The "Anonymous" hacker organization subsequently expressed his responsibility for the hacker attack.</p>
<p>DDOS is a more common hacker attack method. It is characterized by sending a communication request to occupy network resources by planting a large number of Trojan's "puppet machines" (also known as "meat chicken"), which eventually paralyzes the network overload and server.</p>

<p>(Nasdaq Stock Exchange code: TSLA)</p>
<p>The stock price of electric vehicle giants Tesla has risen for 11 consecutive trading days last Friday. Following Fordmotor in May announced that its electric vehicle will use Tesla's charging network in May, General Motor Corporation also announced a similar charging agreement on Friday to allow Tesla to win many investors' praise again. Essence</p>
<p>Many market participants have publicly stated that Tesla allows competitors to enter its network and use its charging facilities. This open attitude shows that Tesla has the ability to lead the electric vehicle market. In addition, Tesla, a business pattern that can "see the overall situation" and "play chess", is also highly optimistic. Among them, Wedbush analyst Danielives, the target price of Tesla's stock was adjusted from the original $ 215 to $ 300, and added the stock to the "best stock" of Wedbush.</p>
<p>In the analysis report to customers: "We think these agreements are a huge opportunity to make money for Tesla. It increases Tesla's overall valuation. We now will have the energy in Tesla's development. The business, and the good charging network it established is linked to its electric vehicle business, and sets Tesla's stock price to $ 300 per share.</p>
<p>According to his calculations, in the next few years, Ford and GM can contribute $ 3 billion to Tesla's charging business turnover. In other words, Tesla's 10,000 2000 charger in North America suddenly becomes a tool for making money, and it is also expected to become the standard for electric vehicle charging in the United States.</p>
<p>This compartment is happy, and the other is sad. The agreement signed by General Motors and Ford and Tesla has caused the stock price of many tram charging stations to plummet. For example: Evgoinc fell more than 11 % last Friday; ChargePoint Holdings also fell 13 %; BlinkCharging also fell as of 10 %. The BEAM Global stock price of clean energy system for electric vehicles was not spared, and it fell 6 %.</p>
<p>However, if Tesla's stock price continues to stabilize, it must also achieve the delivery target of 1.8 million electric vehicles this year, while improving profit margins. In addition, what "strategic advantages" will Tesla's battery production activities in Nevada, and what its upcoming Cyber Truck will cause the market to react, these are important factor affecting the stock.</p>
<p>Although Tesla's stock price went positively, the average target price of the one -year period of the 29 analysts in Tipranks was only $ 203.83. Judging from Tesla's $ 244.40 last Friday, analysts even believe that Tesla's current stock price will have an average of 16.60 % of the downward possibility.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65889684/65847980"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T5-00-00Z/65847980_303.jpeg" /></a>The military exercise held in Germany this week is the highest in the history of NATO</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) after 4 years of preparation, NATO Air Military Performance, which is called "Air Defender 23" (Air Defender 23), started this Monday (June 12). This is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約將舉行史上最大空軍演習-看點有哪些/a-65855730">this kind of exercise in NATO in history</a>Essence From June 12th to 23rd, Germany will be the logistics dispatch hub of this exercise. Six military bases in Quande will be stopped at 250 aircraft, and 25 countries will participate. Among them, the United States will send 100 planes to fly over the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The exercise is performed in three airspaces: over a few areas in northern Germany, North Sea, East, and Southern. Relevant areas will take turns to implement non -flying flights within a few hours a day.</p>
<h3>All will obey NATO military exercise</h3>
<h3>Flight mistakes, but not canceled</h3>
<p>Europe is the most densely spaced airspace in global aviation activities, while Germany is located in the center of Europe. Therefore, at the same time as the exercise, it is a major challenge to maintain the daily operation of civil aviation.</p>
<p>During the 10 -day exercise period, the German airport will extend the operation time until the night to ensure that there is no flight cancellation. However, the German Air Force Director Ingogerhartz said that the possibility of the delay of aircraft takes off and landing is not ruled out.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T5-00-00Z/65440036_401.jpg" />Exercise may cause delays for civil aviation flights</p>
<p>The European Airlines Association also estimates that no flight will be canceled, and even if there is a delay, it will not be very serious. However, because military exercises are held without interruption of civil aviation passenger transportation, the possibility of temporary adjustment is not excluded, and passengers should be prepared for psychological preparations.</p>
<p>Aviation expert Clemensbollinger explained to Germany that due to the busy aviation activities over Germany, the civil and military navigation safety systems in Germany have been integrated for 30 years. Different from the French Air Force in daily training, the civil aviation flights will be prohibited, and German military and civilian flights generally do not interfere with each other. "But we all know that there are many factors that can cause mistakes such as accidental weather, or too dense flights such as thunderstorms." At present, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/行业预测2023年航空业将复苏-亚非拉航司继续亏损/a-65829653">civil aviation passenger transportation is basically returned to the level before the epidemic</a>Essence</p>
<h3>, ground, underwater</h3>
<p>Torbenarnold, an expert in the Berlin Think Tank Science and Political Foundation (SWP), pointed out that NATO holding a military exercise while maintaining the normal operation of civil aviation is also a signal of a political deterrence: "If you are willing to show that we will defend every NATO alliance every country of NATO allies One inch of territory, even in such a busy airspace (holding military exercises). "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-12T5-00-00Z/65847964_401.jpg" />Germany is the logistics hub of NATO military exercise</p>
<p>German Air Force Director Gelhaz said that more than 10,000 NATO national soldiers participating in the exercise will exercise various scenarios, including ground operations, such as "evacuation from an airport". Obviously, the chaotic scenes of the US and Allied Army's retreat from Kabul Airport in the summer of 2021 are still in memory, and this content has been included in the exercise. Other projects also include: air combat support for ground forces, air combat against enemy fighters, and intercepting medium -range missiles in NATO bomber. To this end, the United States dispatched the most advanced F-35 stealth bomber to participate.</p>
<p>According to Arnold, NATO will also practice to block local submarines or ships over the North Sea.</p>
<p>Speaking of "enemies", many people now think of Russia, which is invading Ukraine. However, when the Air Force Director Gelhaz introduced the "Air Guard 23" military exercise in Berlin before, he tried to notice the name of "Enemies from the East" as much as possible.</p>
<p>AmyGutmann, Germany, is more frank. "It (exercise) will undoubtedly prove the agility and rapidness of NATO Allied forces as the first reactor." The female diplomat said: "If any world leader not noticed the alliance's The spirit, that is, the power of this alliance, I will be very surprised. "She added:" This also includes Mr. Putin. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-12T6-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />Beruskoni served as the Italian Prime Minister 3 times from 1994 to 2011. He faced many legal cases in his life and could even go back to the 1980s, most of which were fraud cases suspected of accepting bribes or involving his commercial interests.</p>
<p>Almost all the cases were either appeal to the Supreme Court to be convicted or exceeded the period of legal prosecution.</p>
<p>Baruskoni often aimed at the judicial organs, alleging that the left -wing judge had trouble looking for him based on political goals and believed that he was an innocent victim. However, in 2013, Barruskoni was convicted for corporate tax fraud, and the Supreme Court of the Yi Kingdom maintained the original judgment. His parliamentary status was canceled. He escaped the disaster of prison, was easy to serve social labor, and was sent to the home of Alzheimer'sDisease for one year.</p>
<p>● Suspected sex with minor girls</p>
<p>In June 2013, Beruskoni was suspected of buying a sexual behavior in spring and 17-year-old girl Karima El-Mahroup and was sentenced to 7 years in prison.</p>
<p>The judgment was overturned by the Court of Appeal in 2014. The judge determined whether Baruskoni knew that Malo's underage was in a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>● Is it related to the Mafia (MAFIA)?</p>
<p>Beluskoni has long been suspected of having something to do with the Black Party. He was investigated by the authorities, but never tried it.</p>
<p>Baruskoni has repeatedly denied any relationship with organizational crimes.</p>
