(Voice of Germany), Lloyd Austin, USA, hopes that in June, at the "The Shangri-Ladialogue" in Singapore, he met with the new Chinese defense minister Li Shangfu.

It's almost impossible.

The White House did not respond to the review request of the Financial Times.

The high -level visit plans are also forced to cancel or postpone. Biden has repeatedly called on Sino -US relations to ease, and it has also been refuted by China as "no sincerity."

In this regard, the Pentagon stated that the United States hopes that "the Chinese military leaders such as the Chinese Defense Minister will maintain an open communication channel", but "it is China to decide to ignore, refuse or cancel a number of high -level communication requests in the United States."

The Chinese Embassy in the United States stated that the two countries are conducting "necessary communication." The embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu added that China and the United States "should not communicate for communication" and called on "the United States to take out sincerity ... to create the conditions and atmosphere required for communication with actual actions" can help Sino -US relations "return to the right track."

However, whether the talks that can be promoted to be studied have become an embarrassing situation for both China and the United States.

### China refusal talks to cause surrounding countries to disturb

"Financial Times" reported that Bonnieglaser, a Chinese expert in German Marshall Fund, said that the fierce competition in the United States and China, coupled with the lack of dialogue between the two countries, became more and more. Unhappy, if Austin and Li Shangfu each attended the "Shangri -La Dialogue" and the two had not held talks, these countries would be very "shocked".

Ge Laiyi said: "The question is, would they blame the United States or China? My feeling is that most countries in the region have understood that the United States has been seeking contact with China, but it is blocked."

Judeblanchette, an expert in CSIS Think Tank, believes that the dispute shows whether the relationship between Washington and Beijing can stabilize depends on "political interaction between the two sides." He said: "The longer Beijing does not meet with the United States, more European Asia will feel that China is stubborn."

After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.

###  The United States looks too anxious?

Bloomberg reported on the 11th that although the Bayeng government continued to be rejected by the Chinese side to restart communication, it continued to try to promote the positive attitude of China and the United States regardless of the grassroots and senior dialogues, in order to appease "worrying that the United States did not do enough tensions in the tension" " Eurasian allies. However, some public opinion is also worried that such a strategy may make the United States look weak and nose in China.

"Obama National Security Council" (EvanMedeiros), a former Asian senior director, believes that although this "smart and adventurous" strategy can help the United States receive trust in Eurasian countries, it may also strengthen China. The argument that the "Western world needs China more" and the China -US agenda is at the helm of China.

Denniswilder, former deputy assistant director of the East Asia and Pacific Region, also said that this move may make Chinese leaders think that "the strategy of the frozen relationship between them after investigating the balloon is shot down." In the wrestling, the tactical advantage was achieved.

The chairman of the "China Issue Special Committee" of the US House of Representatives Mikegallagher criticized on the 10th: "I just don't understand why the Bayeng government held a meeting (with China) to make such an eager and diligent suitor Performance. "Garrat believes that this move shows the intention of the Biden government to compete in other regional status and participation in regional affairs, but the overall strategy of the United States appears chaotic and clueless.

(Voice of Germany) COSCO Group's original plan to acquire 35%of the shares of the Tollerort container terminal in Hamburg Port. In October last year, the acquisition was first rejected by the German government. On October 26, the federal government approved [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中资入股汉堡港争议双方或可接受妥协方案/a-63554802)The proportion of acquisition shares dropped to 24.9%.

The government has continued to argue internally whether it should allow Chinese companies to invest in German ports.

German Chancellor Savz is agreed with the acquisition, but the Green Party and Liberal Democratic Party, the joint ruling, holds objections.

In April this year, the German Information Technology Security Agency (BSI) put the Tollerort terminal of Hamburg Port [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉堡港福地码头被列入关键基础设施-中远入股还有戏吗/a-65293775)Essence The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the ministry is studying related influences due to changes in the prerequisites. According to a survey by North Germany's Will Radio and West Germany, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has advocated starting a new investment procedure to re -evaluate the investment scope of key infrastructure. But this requires consistency within the federal government.

At that time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the German government to objectively and rationally view pragmatic cooperation between the two states and provide non -discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.

The federal government now stated in a statement that "the revised acquisition agreement meets the conditions for partial ban." At the same time, it is emphasized that the Hamburg Port container terminal is classified as a key infrastructure in Germany.

Tollerort container pier operator [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉堡港为何急盼中资入股/a-63519175)(HHLA) announced that the TOLLERORT terminal can now be expanded as a transit point for COSCO Group. Logistics between Asia and Europe will concentrate here.

HHLA also said that the shares acquisition transaction "soon" can be completed.

The Hamburg Port said that a few equity of Chinese companies will ensure the employment of the port, and strengthen the importance of burgers as a logistics intersection at home and abroad, and the importance of Germany as an industrial country.

Tanjagönner, the director of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said that the German government finally approved the Hamburg Port acquisition case slightly lower than 25%of the Hamburg Port, which is a good thing for Germany as an investment place. She said: "The economic competitiveness and technical sovereignty of Germany and the European Union need to maintain basic openness on our local foreign investment, which also includes investment from China." She added: "Expanding the economic relationship with China is reasonable, it is reasonable. Even if it is increasingly tense in the geopolitical situation today. "

** 1. "Evaporation on the World" reproduces China **

Recently, some knowledgeable journalists have evaporated in mainland China. Mainland China has become more and more like a magical horror world.

What goals. Finally, let's take a look at the response of overseas Chinese students to China's internal political situation.

** 1) Li Yanhe (Fucha) case **

Li Yanhe, chief editor of Taiwan's "Eight Banners Culture" Publishing House, was detained in mainland China.

The Beijing authorities confirmed on April 26 that a Taiwanese publisher who was missing in China had been detained for suspected violation of the National Security Law. This has triggered the cold effect of Taiwanese cultural people. The increasingly popular publishing industry in Taiwan suddenly, a large unprecedented unknown cloud was spreading, and the black clouds crowded the city to destroy.

What people immediately remembered was the "Causeway Bay Bookstore" incident in Hong Kong in 2015. The five important bookstores in the bookstore suddenly disappeared. Later, the news revealed that they were abducted by the Chinese authorities to abduct the border to the mainland.

** Li Yan congratulated people **

Li Yanhe, a pseudonym, Fucha, is a publisher in Taiwan and a Chinese citizen. He has been living in Taiwan as a Taiwanese son -in -law since 2009. The Eight Banners Culture Press he operated in Taiwan is famous for publishing criticism of the CCP in Taiwan. Li Yanhe returned to China to visit relatives in early March this year. Soon after that, he evaporated, and suddenly lost contact.

In the recent tension between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China, Li Yanhe's detention may become a new crisis point. Beijing claims that Democratic Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and must be unified with the CCP. However, most people in Taiwan refuse to reunification in Beijing. They hate Xi Jinping's totalitarian rule, including his overlord's hard bow, abandoned Sino -British joint statement, canceled the two systems and two systems in Hong Kong, and destroyed Hong Kong's freedom and rule of law with the Hong Kong version of the country's security law. Hong Kong, an international financial center and a free port. This is a tragedy of the rare brutal destruction of civilization in human history.

Zhu Fenglian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese Government, told reporters in Beijing on April 25 that Li Yanhe was under investigation for "suspected activities that endanger national security". She did not specify the allegations against Li Yanhe, but said that China would protect his legitimate rights.

In China, spy activities are not strictly distinguished from criticizing the CCP, and they are all crimes that violate the National Security Law. People who have been charged with such crimes may be detained for several months when they are not allowed to get in touch with their family or lawyers.

For Li Yanhe's supporters, the case is similar to the disappearance of five Hong Kong book vendors in the mainland in 2015. Chinese investigators secretly detained those Hong Kong people. They all involved a publishing house that strictly criticized Xi Jinping and other CCP leaders, and the described books described by them. One of the bookmakers Gui Minhai is still serving his sentence in China. He was sentenced to ten years in prison because he was accused of providing intelligence abroad. Other book vendors were released after public confession on Chinese official television stations.

Publisher Li Yanhe was born in Northeast China in 1971. Before moving to Taiwan, he worked in Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House.

He was proud of his descendants of the Manchu. The Qing Dynasty established by the Manchu ethnic group ruled China from 1644 to 1912. Li Yanhe established the Eight Banners Cultural Press in Taiwan in 2009.

There are many types of books published by the Eight Banner Culture hosted by Li Yanhe, including many translation works, mainly based on mainstream non -fiction works, such as Wang Feiling, a professor of George Ya Institute of Technology, "Chinese Record: Evaluate the People's Republic of China" and Du Rusong(SH Doshi)The Chinese translation of "Long -term game: China weakens the Great Strategy of the United States and Establishs Global hegemony".

The Taiwan authorities may be difficult to contact him during the detention of Li Yanhe by the mainland, because the current cross -strait relations are tight and he is still the citizen of the People's Republic of China.

"Born in mainland China itself, it is also possible to prevent him from leaving mainland China." Lin Rongji, one of the Hong Kong scholars detained by mainland China in 2015, said that since 2019, he has lived in Taiwan. Essence He said: "Publishers in Taiwan should be careful, because you can't change China's thoughts."

Li Yanhe's wife is Taiwanese, and she refuses to discuss her husband's case publicly.

The Mainland Commission of Taiwan, which handles cross -strait relations, stated in a written statement that it is keeping close contact with Li Yanhe's family.

"For the handling of this case," the committee said, "the government will use all methods and channels to provide the most appropriate care and assistance on the premise of respecting their families."

** 2) Yang Zhiyuan case **

Similar to the above -mentioned Li Yanhe case, this is also a case of political colors. Chinese prosecutors said on April 25 that Taiwanese man Yang Zhiyuan was officially arrested by the mainland authorities, and he was accused of "sin the country." Yang Zhiyuan is the vice chairman of the Taiwan National Party. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said that the Yang Zhiyuan case "further sounds the alarm clock of severe punishment of the" Taiwan independence "split forces."

Yang Zhiyuan (January 21, 1990) is a politician and social movement from Taiwan, and founded the Taiwan National Party. On August 3, 2022, it was arrested and detained by public security during the business residence in Fujian, mainland China.

On August 3, 2022, Yang Zhiyuan was criminally arrested by the National Security Bureau of Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province of the People's Republic of China on the grounds of "suspected split national crimes and inciting split state crimes". The State Council spokesman Ma Xiaoguang responded that night that "the national security organs took measures on Taiwan independence elements who were suspected of endangering national security crimes in accordance with the law, which fully illustrates all the" Taiwan independence "stubborn stubborn elements that are tried on the law and cannot escape the severe punishment of national laws, but the Republic of China The Executive Yuan stated that the Ministry of Justice and the MAC have not yet received a Chinese notification.

Former Taoyuan City Councilor Wang Haoyu said in social media that Yang Zhiyuan had developed in China before his arrest. Wang Haoyu said that about one or two years ago, he settled there with "White Wolf" (referring to Zhang Anle) to visit China, and he settled there, thinking that he had been separated from the Taiwan independence camp and joined the CCP.

Yang Zhiyuan's friend Wu Baiwei said that according to his understanding, Yang went to mainland China this time "should be participating in Go competitions, and some business activities, political beliefs are not Taiwan independence."Yang Zhiyuan is another Taiwanese who lived by China after Li Mingzhe.

On September 16, 2022, the mainland committee of the Republic of China support Yang Zhiyuan, saying that it should be innocent and called on the CCP authorities to release its return to Taiwan.

On April 25, 2023, the case of Yang Zhiyuan was investigated by the National Security Bureau of Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and was transferred to the Wenzhou Procuratorate for review and prosecution. The procuratorial organs of Zhejiang Province approved the arrest of Yang Zhiyuan.

Yang Zhiyuan Zheng Juan

Yang Zhiyuan joined the Democratic Progressive Party in 2008. One year later, he realized that there was a huge gap in the national consciousness of the pan -green camp and the pan -blue camp. He has also exchanged with the unified independence parties; he believes that the two sides of the strait should maintain friendly relations and promote democratization in mainland China. He believes that the population on both sides of the strait belongs to Chinese society, and do not fight against China because of anti -communist. His friend Wu Baiwei said that "Yang should be the same in theory"; many blue camps said that Yang was arrested "incredible".

In 2016, the slogan of "national supremacy, third position, resolute anti -communist and resistance".

In November 2019, as a nomination of the party's non -district legislators on one side, Yang Zhiyuan said that he could not recognize Hong Xiuzhu's "one middle and same table", and also believed that Cai Yingwen's cross -strait policy "did not have his own opinion". The president implements a country on both sides of the strait. " In addition, Yang Zhiyuan rebuked the Democratic Progressive Party to "have no small roads" and called on the party to vote to the small party to allow the small party to enter the Legislative Yuan. "Don't let the DPP continue arrogant."

Zhou Chongde, president of the 908 Taiwan National Movement, said that Yang did not develop in Taiwan, and it was likely that he was seduced to mainland China. He happened to be arrested for foreign propaganda when he met Perosi to visit Taiwan. Perlus left Taiwan in the afternoon, and the authorities in the evening of China announced that the authorities arrested a Taiwanese. (RFA report)

** 3) Dong Yuyu case **

Dong Yuyu, deputy director of the comment department of the CPC Central Committee, was taken away by the police more than a year ago by the police more than a year ago. The recent defendant of his family will be sued for spy. Although Dong Yuyu has served the official media in the system for many years, it is known for its liberal tendencies and support for reform and opening up, and frequently contacts foreign journalists and diplomats in China. Dong's supporters firmly believe that what he does is normal communication. The so -called spy crime is another heavy attack that the CCP has tightened the space of speech and suppress the disagreement in recent years.

Dong Yuyu, deputy director of the comment department of Guangming Daily, one of the most influential official media in China, was taken away by the police with a police officer with a Japanese diplomat with a Japanese diplomat on February 21, 2022. The Japanese diplomat was also taken away and released a few hours later. The Japanese government protested this incident, and the Chinese government responded to this diplomat engaged in a "inconsistent" activity with him.

On March 23, 2023, Dong Yuyu's family was told that he would face the crime of spy. The silent family has always decided to disclose the matter recently. Dong Yuyu has not been allowed to meet his family for more than a year, and only met with a lawyer once.

** Active Liberal Reporter -Dong Yuyu **

61 -year -old Dong Yuyu was originally born in Fushun, Liaoning. After graduating from the Law Department of Peking University in 1987, he joined the Guangming Daily. In 1989, Dong was decentralized for one year for participating in the June 4th protest, and then returned to the Guangming Daily. He wrote an article for the historical magazine "Yan Huang Chunqiu" and wrote a comment on the New York Times Chinese website. In 2006, Dong Yuyu won the Niman News Scholarship at Harvard University in the United States and visited Harvard for one year. He also served as a visiting scholar at Kyoto University and Hokkaido University in Japan.

As a liberal reporter, Dong Yuyu often wrote a comment article on liberal tendencies, and has often maintained close connection with foreign media and diplomats for many years.

** International Sound in China

More than 60 scholars, journalists and intellectuals from all over the world signed an open letter to treat Dong Yuyu fairly. Sign signs include Bob Woodword, a senior reporter of the Washington Post in the Washington Post(BobWoodward)Former "Wall Street Journal", former Vice National Security Counselor of the White House(Matthew Pottinger), Orville Schell, an expert in China who went to China in the 1970s.

The open letter said: "Just like all reporters around the world, Dong Yuyu often meets other countries, journalists, and scholars, including some of us. Our meeting plans are often agreed on WeChat, and it has always been always. Public, the place of meeting is all public places. "

"Some of us are Dong Yuyu's classmates when studying abroad, such as Harvard Niman scholars in 2007. We appreciate Dong Yuyu's open humorous character and insight into world issues. Chinese cultural messenger. "

"All of us can prove that Dong Yuyu has a high degree of academic ethics and standards. We have conducted frank and open exchanges on each other's country and the world situation. This communication is part of the normal 'civil diplomacy'. Support. "

The open letter calls on the Chinese government to re -consider the severe punishment that Dong Yuyu may face: "The contact with foreign diplomats, journalists, and scholars should not be the reason for constituting a spy. Scholars and diplomats meet? "

Founded in 1908, the "American National News Club" in Washington(American PressClub)A statement on this matter was issued on April 24. The statement said: "Through his work, Dong Yuyu allows the world to better understand China and let China understand the life of the United States and Japan. Dong Yuyu is a reporter with outstanding results. . We call on the Chinese government to revoke the complaint and release Dong Yuyu. "

** Silent game in the system **

Dong Yuyu often wrote comments on economic affairs in the Guangming Daily, and the article often revealed his reform and liberal ideological tendency.

In 2012, Dong Yuyu expressed China's claim in the article "Why the Republic becomes the Great of History" written by the historical magazine "Yan Huang Chunqiu", which expresses the claim that China needs to establish constitutional government. He said in the text: "Freedom, security, order, efficiency and other values provided by the constitutional and democratic system, freedom is undoubtedly the most important value"; In the beginning, it is the system design of its depression and distorted humanity. "

In July 2012, Dong Yuyu wrote an article entitled "I want to send my son to the United States to study university" for the New York Times Chinese website. In the text, Dong Yuyu quoted the observation of the New Year columnist Thomas Friedman: More and more foreign immigrants chose to go to the United States for education. The United States is still the biggest magnet in the world. Dong Yuyu himself is one of the many parents who sent their children to the United States. His son's elite middle school Beijing No. 4 Middle School. One -third of students hope that after graduating from high school, they will abandon Chinese universities after graduating from high school and go directly to the United States to study university.

Wu Yanlai, a scholar who lives overseas, said that some "different voices" can occasionally see "different voices" on Chinese official media because some people like Dong Yuyu are working hard. "Although the Central Propaganda Department has his extremely left -left thinking or the set of language expression used by the leftist, the right to writing and the right to publish in the editor of the front line. Some people like Mr. Dong are there, and he has some measurement. There are some enlightenedness, or there will be more things that are in line with universal values. It is not the wind above, the upper level is open, not the editor and director of the bottom line, their representative and position decision decide of."Dong Yuyu's family said in a statement that Dong was neither spy nor as a foreign agent. The exchanges between scholars, journalists and diplomats in Japan, the United States and other countries can be traced back to more than 20 years ago. It is open and bright, and it is part of normal knowledge and cultural exchanges that China has encouraged for many years.

Wu Yilai did not think that Dong Yuyu had any "spy" behavior. He said: "As a media person and a commentator, Mr. Dong cannot contact deep secrets, but only exchanged some of his own views. But that's such a thing, they can go online. Many of them have a lot of places to eat. The monitoring device, or the phone monitor. He can characterize you as leaked by the content of the content you communicated. "

Dong Yuyu's family said in a statement that it is unclear about specific trial time. According to the current criminal law of China, if a spy is convicted, the plot is milder may be in prison for less than three years or less; those who endanger national security will be sentenced to more than ten years in prison or life imprisonment.

** 2. The basic characteristics of the case **

** 1. Beijing cross -border long -arm suppression(The detainees include the Taiwan citizens of the Republic of China, the Taiwanese son -in -law who lived in Taiwan for a long time, and the citizen of the People's Republic of China ...)**

** 2. The Chinese Communist Party focuses on the extinguishing heresy thought and free knowledge.

** 3. Xi Jin's plane facing isolation, China is moving towards martial arts, seeking to regulate during quasi -war. **

** 4. "Spy Law" has made China enter the era of martial arts in quasi -war. The crime of spy has become a crime of pocket- "No need" charges **

On April 24, the draft of the Anti -Spy Law was requested to the third session of the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress. According to Chinese official news reports, the three draft draft drafts further improved the regulations on cyber spies and clarified the behavior of cyber spy.

In fact, it has greatly expanded the boundary between the "spy" definition, blurred "confidential intelligence," and "and" and "objections". The spiritual environment of the quasi -Cultural Revolution: the knowledge elite and the entrepreneur group are cold. The silent China appeared in anti -intellectualism. The anxiety of the security of the regime has made Beijing increasingly lock the country. This will strengthen the barriers and hostility between mainland China and the mainstream international community, creating an increasingly unsafe and isolation international environment for the CCP.

** Three, the overseas effect of suppressing the intellectual industry **

** The East is not bright and West Light: overseas Chinese students began to organize their sounds. Similar to the situation of overseas students who came forward after Hu Yaobang's death in 1989. **

* *George Washington University Independence Chinese Student Organization Declaration: Light our torch!(Student union supported by the embassy to resist gifts) ** **

(... In our campus, the demands on citizens' rights and academic freedom are higher than that of the waves. With the beginning of the White Paper Revolution at the end of November last year, many of them and hundreds of other Chinese students from the University of George Washington participated. The night guarding and protests elsewhere elsewhere in Kogan Plaza and other parts of Washington. Expression and behavior, but lacks space that allows free expression.

With this understanding, we announced the establishment of the George Washington University Independent Chinese Student Union -Toronto Potomak. In general, we hope to provide Chinese students and scholars at the University of George Washington University and Chinese youths scattered in a larger scale, and provide a organizational platform, social support and community independent of the Communist Party of China and its puppets. In addition, we also welcome students who are interested in Chinese culture, politics and identity from various backgrounds.

Our priority is still to protect the students of George Washington University from being influenced by the Federation of Federation and the CCP, and to promote the comprehensive withdrawal of companies from companies participating in the Uyghur racial extinction and the company that supports the CCP. Part of ethical reconstruction. For a long time, the Federation and similar organizations have maintained the monopoly of the culture and political representatives of Chinese students. As we all know, Xuelian cooperates with the Communist Party of China and its puppets and accepts its leadership. It has announced this in its promotional video. More widely known among Chinese students at the University of George Washington University that they are led by the Third Generation and the rich two generations. Their moral deficit burst, and the transparency is zero. For example, in the past few years, they even misappropriated their membership of their members who should be used in the Internet and employment -related activities. The leaders of the Leadership Federation bragged their activities to participate in the Chinese Embassy and had dinner with the ambassador. These people's monopoly power is not because they provide an attractive vision or a respectable administrative ability. The academic federation protects its monopoly position by intimidation, surveillance, extortion, and other forms of suppression and threats of violence-especially through fear.

Lu Xun once wrote: "There is a point of heat, and a point of light will make the fireflies average. You can also send a little light in the dark without waiting for the torch fire. If there is no torch, I am the only light." In view of the CCP, The oppression of the Xuelian and the cold blood of school management, we no longer wait for the torch, but decided to ignite Mars on the bank of the Poto Mark. ...)

Roryo'Connor, chairman of the American Student Organization "Athenai Institute", told VOA in the United States that the destruction of the "democratic wall" "is equivalent to letting those almost no other ways can safely express their opinions safely Students whispered. "

The "Athens Society" is committed to promoting the interests of American universities to get rid of the interests with China and protecting the academic and speech freedom of the school. The "Athens Society" supports the establishment of the George Washington University Independent Chinese Student Union.

"Our time and resources are rarely used than supporting Chinese democratic students. They are now facing the agent of the fascist party state because they try to truly express themselves."

In addition to the "Athens Society", some student organizations at the University of George Washington have also expressed support for the Independent Student Union, including the Campus Democratic Party and Republican Organizations, GW Chinese Feminist (GW UyGhur Human Rights Initiative) and Uyghur Human Rights Initiative. GW Russianspeaking Association.

In the statement, the independent student union stated that the school's Chinese Student and Scholars Federation (CSSA) is the main force that suppress them to express political appeals: "Our priority is still the students who protect George Washington University are not affected by the Federation of Federation and the CCP ... For a long time, the Xuelian and similar organizations have maintained the monopoly of the culture and political representatives of Chinese students. "

** 2) Established "Citizenship" in May 2022, Toronto, Canada.

A wave of protests caused by 1987 and 1989 when Hu Yaobang was reinforced and died, and the wave of protests in overseas Chinese students overseas gradually began to rise from 2022-2023, which can be regarded as the spiritual trend of Chinese intellectual circles. We believe that this righteousness of overseas Chinese students will soon be popular to form a fire of Liaoyuan.

It is beneficial and in line with the interests of exporters and manufacturers in Australia. "

Farrell said to reporters before flying to Beijing that both Australia and China have the willingness to improve the relationship, but they still need to pay more efforts. He said: "The establishment of a strong trade relationship between Australia and China is the greatest contribution to the realization of peace and stability in the region."

China is the largest trading partner in Australia. In 2022, the total bilateral trade was 287 billion AUD 287 billion (equivalent to $ 195 billion), including the irreplaceable Australian iron ore in the Chinese market. Nevertheless, the Australian Minister of Trade has not visited China since 2019.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Farrell will stay in China to Saturday. China said that it was hoped that Farrell's visit will "further consolidate the" important consensus' "that the leaders of the two sides have achieved during the Bali G20 summit last November last year.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T12-04-00Z/63763964_401.jpg)During the Bali G20 summit last year, China -Australia's leaders met and reached a series of "important consensus'".

Spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said: "China expects that China and Australia can exchange opinions on the development of bilateral economic and trade and promote the exchange of relations between the two countries." The Minister of Trade, China and Australia, will also co -host the 16th China -Australian Minister of Economic Union. Meeting. The meeting of the Economic Joint Committee of China and Australia was held in 1986 for the first time. With the intensification of diplomatic friction between the two parties, the meeting has been interrupted since 2017.

Since 2020, China has begun import restrictions on wine, beef, barley, coal, seafood and wood from Australia. Australia's request to launch a new crown traceability survey has caused strong dissatisfaction in Beijing. Soon after that, Australian reporter Cheng Lei was arrested for harmful national security. In addition, Canberra also excludes the products of Huawei, a Chinese network equipment manufacturer, from the national security considerations.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T12-04-00Z/56492674_401.jpg)Australian Chinese reporter Cheng Lei has been detained by China for more than a thousand days.

Last week, Australian Prime Minister Albanis said in an interview with British television that his government would not participate in the "statement against China". [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/关系改善-中澳将谈判解决大麦争端/a-65277773)Farrell said: "What makes the Australian government happy is that the trade of coal, cotton, and copper ore has begun to recover, and China has also agreed to review the tariffs on Australian barley."

Australian customs data shows that in the first few months of this year, Australia had exported copper ore and copper concentrate worth $ 40 million to China, which was the first time since 2020 resumed exports to China.

Farrell said that during his visit to China, he also talked about other "important topics for Australia to the main". It is generally believed that the above topic may involve cases related to human rights.

Albanis said that Australia will continue to pay attention to the fate of Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who has been detained for more than a thousand days.

The picture shows the US -made Patriot air defense missile deployed in Poland. [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05112023135551.html/@@images/image)Associated Press Information Picture [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05112023135551.html/@@stream)Audience friends, hello everyone. What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Russia described the high supersonic weapons developed in recent years. It is an indestructible and is a big killer to check the US anti -missile system. This statement has been broken recently.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces Air Force Commander Mykolaoleshchuk pointed out that over May 4th in the surrounding areas of Kiev, the Ukraine uses Patriot Air Defense missiles to shoot down a "unprincipated" Kinzhal missile, which is history Sexual events. The missile was launched from Russia by the MiG-31 fighter. The National News Agency of Ukraine confirmed the news on May 6. Russia has not responded so far.

** Sprinkle 破 mythology is broken **

The dagger is called a hypersonic missile. The flight speed is 10 Mach (10 times the speed). It can be mobilized. It can be equipped with nuclear and conventional warheads according to the task. The range is 2,000 kilometers and the accuracy is better than 10 meters. Russian President VladimirPutin publicly stated in the National Information Counseling in 2018 that the air -fired dagger hypersonic missiles will conduct a combat duty mission in the Southern Military Region since December 2017. At the Putin report, the big screen demonstrated the crackdown of the launch of the missile missile, which caused warm applause in the audience.

The Russian simulation experience shows that a dagger missile can break through the intensive interception firepower network composed of more than 20 NATO standard and patriots' air defense missiles, which is a "Sprinkle" weapon tailored by the anti -missile system. Russia's Air Heavenly Army Commander Sergeysurovikin said confidently that dagger missiles can effectively break through the current and future air defense and anti -missile systems of Western countries.

In February last year, Russia invaded Ukraine. Six months later, Russian Defense Minister Sergeishoigu announced that he used a dagger hypersonic missile with a dagger at 3 degrees during the combat to successfully hit high -value targets and performance. In April this year, Ukraine obtained the first batch of patriot missile systems, and the air defense capacity was enhanced. It was unexpected to break the myth that Russia could not intercept.

The United States did not respond as soon as possible. Until May 9th, Patrickry, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed at a press conference that Ukraine's use of Patriot missile defense systems to shoot down a Russian dagger missile. He said that the Patriot system is part of the US and the international community to provide wider air defense capabilities to Ukraine. In the future, we will continue to step up the provision of land -based air defense capabilities and ammunition to help Ukraine control their sovereign sky and protect Ukraine from attacks from Russian cruise missiles and Iranian drones.

Please note that Lede confirmed that the dagger missile was shot down, but it did not emphasize that it was a "hypersonic missile," which said that Ukraine shot down "a Russian missile." Does this imply that the United States has not regarded the dagger as a real high supersonic speed speed Weapons, but an air -fired ballistic missile, not a new weapon.

** Guide -type air -firing ballistic missile **

US defense technology experts, including Alexhollings, pointed out that the dagger missile is a modified version of the Russian short-range ballistic missile Iskander. The new guidance system designed for air -to -ground combat is a guide -type air -firing ballistic missile, not a new technology; it may reach the supersonic speed, but it is not a hypersonic weapon.

Holinus believes that Russia uses the public's misunderstanding of the term "hypersonic speed" term. By improving the original weapon system, it promotes military sales as an advanced cutting -edge technology, so as to obtain funding to develop the next generation of weapons and equipment. In order to attract foreign buyers, Russia must show the ability to develop the same, even stronger weapons as the United States and China, and create a 21 -century military power image at a smaller cost. The dagger missile is a representative work.

However, it cannot be denied that the advantages of air -fired ballistic missiles are obvious compared with the trajectory missile launched by land -based and sea -based types. The first is that the launch costs are low and cost -effective. The air -ray type can save the ballistic missile launch device used by land and Haitu, and does not need to build preset positions or arrays, and no first -class engine can reduce the launch fuel.

The second is high mobility and strong survivability. The aircraft is equipped with ballistic missiles is much faster than land -based and sea -based types, and the range of activities is much larger. Flying outside the country's leading or defense zone is difficult to be investigated, positioned and attacked by enemy. This dagger missile was launched by the MiG-31 fighter aircraft from Russia. It did not need to attack before, and it was not necessary to attack to ensure safety. Due to the high mobility, the enemy's early warning time is compressed, and the ability to stop.

Based on these characteristics, the air -fired ballistic missile is indeed unusual, but after all, it is not a hypersonic weapon.

What is a hypersonic weapon?

** Inside the atmosphere ** ** 5 ** ** Machi Flying **

The term "hypersonic weapon" is often misuse. Strictly speaking, it refers to a missile in the earth atmosphere that is higher than Mach 5 (Mach is about 1.7 kilometers per second and about 6,120 kilometers per hour). Most of the time it is flying inside the atmosphere of the earth (instead of outside space and outside the atmosphere). It is necessary to stop extreme high temperature tests, and use the design characteristics of air dynamics to maneuverate.

On the other hand, most of the flight missiles are outside the atmosphere, and there is no effect on interaction with air for a long time. When returning to the atmosphere, the air resistance will also face extreme high temperature, but the time is short. The difference between the hypersonic missile is that they must respond to the test of the internal thermal effects in the atmosphere during most flights. Therefore, it is essentially different from the ballistic missile.

Another decisive feature of the hypersonic missile is that they rely on air dynamic control surfaces (such as missile wings or rear wings) for taxiing and maneuverability, flying with irregular trajectories, and hypersonic speeds, it is difficult for the enemy to find interception. The ballistic missiles fly with a relatively fixed parabolic trajectory, which is also a hypersonic speed, but it has a higher probability that it is intercepted than the hypersonic weapon.

There are two types of high supersonic weapons that are in line with the above -mentioned definitions: hypersonic speed booster glide missiles (HGV) and hypersonic cruise missiles (HCM). At present, the Russian land-based pioneer (Avangard) missile and the Chinese land-based Dongfeng-17 missile belong to the former; the latter is serving the Tsirkon sea-based hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile. The Russia claims that The ultra -combustion stamping engine is the power, and the flight speed is 9 Mach.** Multiple technical difficulties need to be overcome **

In January of the US Congress Budget Office (CBO), at the request of the Military Commission of the Senate of the Senate this January, a research and analysis report of the "U.S. Hyders and Alternatives" was completed. The content pointed out that the development of hypersonic weapons has many technical difficulties to be overcome, including designing strong insulation devices, so that the structure materials of the missile can bear the high temperature of more than 2,000 ° degrees Celsius during the air. The warhead can emit and receive communication and positioning signals.

When the flying speed exceeds 5 Mach, the transition from stable to turbulence around the missiles will destroy its stability and cause a sudden local temperature to rise. When the missile turns, in addition to increasing the thermal burden of the missile, it will also significantly reduce the speed of missile flight and reduce the range. These factors often limit the maneuverability of hypersonic missiles.

The development of hypersonic cruise missiles requires excellent super -combustion stamping technology and engine components. Its difficulty is metaphorical how to keep matches ignited and immortal in hurricanes. Prior to 2022, the United States only successfully run for a few minutes of ultra -burning stamping engines. Several successful demonstrations were successfully demonstrated to overcome some design difficulties, but there were still engineering barriers. It must meet the missile size, range and speed requirements, and it needs to overcome the challenges of extreme high temperature and aerodynamics.

It is unknown whether Russia and China have served in the United States' development standards. However, it is certain that the United States has no active hypersonic missiles so far, which does not represent technical backwardness, but is considered more aspects, shortening the running time of missiles from to fine. The development ideas of Russia and China are to first seek and then refine. The running -in time may be longer, and the performance requirements may not be higher than that of the United States.

The research and analysis report of the US Congress Budget Office pointed out that the United States' development of hypersonic weapons mainly considers 4 aspects. First of all, it is necessary to overcome technical challenges to deploy hypersonic missiles, including to withstand extreme high temperatures, and a large number of flight tests are required to determine the case.

** Overall technology United States leads **

Second, the hypersonic weapon is mainly used to respond to the strict defense of missiles and is extremely sensitive to time. The so -called time sensitivity requires a blow to the target within 15 to 30 minutes. Based on cost considerations, if time is not sensitive, you can use cheap cruise missile attacks. If the time is urgent and the opponent lacks an effective anti -missile system, it can use a low cost of a motor warhead. Many tasks do not need to hit high -speed weapons quickly.

Third, in the conflict, hypersonic missiles may not have more survivability than ballistic missiles with motorized warheads, unless the opponent has an efficient and long -range missile defense system. So far, potential opponents in the United States have not deployed such an efficient defense system.

Fourth, compared with ballistic missiles with the same range and the same range, the procurement and deployment cost of hypersonic missiles may be one third higher. The United States does not deploy hypersonic missiles, but related technologies are developing well. The U.S. Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have developed their respective high supersonic weapons, and there are also cooperative research and development projects. It is expected to be deployed in place from 2025 to 2028, respectively.

Chinese missile technology expert Yang Chengjun once said. "The U.S. hypersonic technology is generally the world's most advanced, but it is not used in the field of the Missile Battle Department." Once the United States invested, it can quickly live in the world's leading position, so "cannot Blind Yelang is arrogant. "You can see the blood.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T18-49-35-04-00/000000.png)President of Peking University National Development Academy: China's unemployment rate may be as high as 20 % Photo: RFA

On the eve of the May 4th Youth Festival, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a letter to college students as a stone that stirred a lot of waves. In this letter, the phrase "Chinese youth in the new era should enter the country and have the spirit of" finding hard to eat '", and it is widely circulated, and once again, nearly 20%of the young people in the urban and towns of 16-24 years old in China Bring a hidden danger into the public vision. There are even many people who think that the CCP issued this signal before the May 4th, that is, the Beijing authorities have hinted that "the upper mountain and the countryside of the new era".

This article will adopt the method of peeling bamboo shoots to analyze how China's youth unemployment rate is high.

** Rural lack of job opportunities to undertake urban youth **

The 20%unemployment rate at the beginning of this article is the unemployment rate of urban youth, excluding rural areas, and the rural population has never entered the scope of unemployment statistics. In May 2021, China's seventh national census main data was announced. The population living in cities and towns was 902 million, accounting for 63.89%; the population living in the countryside was 510 million, accounting for 36.11%. Compared with 2010, the urban population increased by 240 million, the rural population decreased by 160 million, and the proportion of urban population increased by 14.21% -basically achieved the urbanization rate set by the Chinese government more than 20 years ago. The media often quoted the following data to prove the effectiveness of China's urbanization: At the beginning of the industrial revolution, farmers also exceeded 22 million among the 100 million people in the United States. Relying on continuous scientific and technological progress, the United States has reduced farmers by 85%in a century. China is a post -developing country, and has experienced experience. Relying on industrialization and urbanization. In the past 40 years, contemporary China has reduced 900 million farmers to 500 million today.

The above results are almost the limit of the industrialization era. China and the United States were different at that time: after many rural people lived in new towns, they still did not work. It is reflected in the consequences of social consequences, it is just the hidden unemployment rate of rural youth that has not entered the statistics to the urban youth unemployment rate.

** Rural population employment is a structural problem **

After Xi Jinping took office, in view of the lessons of rural decline during the Hu Jintao period, "building a new socialist countryside" has always regarded "building a new socialist countryside" as an important political task, emphasizing that talents returned to their hometown. The reason for making this decision is to consider the population structure of rural China. According to the seventh national census, the threat of aging to rural areas far exceeds the town. Among the permanent population in the countryside, the population over 65 years old accounts for more than 18%, which is much higher than the average level of 12.6%in the country. In 2019, the population of 15-59 years in rural China was 313 million, accounting for 56.8%of the permanent population in the countryside. Among them, young people 15 to 39 were young people who lived in rural are less than 30%. The ages of 60, 65, and above account for 23.8%and 17.7%of the rural population. Data from the age structure of the above population show that the lack of rural talents, especially young talents, is obvious.

Is this strategy valid for talent returning to hometown? According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Ministry of Agriculture and Rural, in the past four years, the new scale of newly -returned entrepreneurs in the country every year is 1 million, 8.5 million in 2019, 10.1 million in 2020, 11 million in 2021, as of 2022, as of 2022, and 2022 At the end of the year, a total of 12.2 million entrepreneurs returned to the countryside. People go high, rising from rural areas to cities -the population is flowing forward; from the city to the countryside, it is reverse flowing. In the case of only promoting and people's own living pressure to promote talents to return to their hometowns, these 12.2 million People are large -scale -in the Mao era, the Chinese government went up and down the countryside through strong political propaganda and various political high -voltage knowledge. After 25 years, the total number of educated youths in the countryside was only about 20 million. However, if considering that in 2019, the number of migrant workers has reached 290 million, then 12.2 million people returning home are not much.

In January of this year, Xi emphasized at the Central Rural Working Conference, "It is necessary to guide college graduates in an orderly manner to go to the countryside, return to the countryside, return to the countryside, and enter the countryside." In a letter, many social media called this "going to the countryside" in the new era. After experiencing the older generation of going up the mountains and the countryside, may wish to put the two -time urban and rural social population structure, government policies (especially deep breadth and government resettlement methods), mobilization objects, related account changes, returned home and rural people's employment methods in the countryside in the countryside To compare, naturally the difference between the two will be compared.

** The intelligent production of agriculture is constrained by geographical conditions **

Of course, the Chinese government also knows that in order to allow rural youths who have experienced urban life to return to their hometown to continue the kind of "facing the loess and facing the sky", it is impossible to rely on a hoe. Technical, intelligent robots, big data and smart decision -making methods to promote the change of agricultural production methods. For example, Alibaba launched the "Agricultural Scientist Base Direct Selection" a few years ago, and cultivating "new farmers" to serve rural revitalization strategies.

In 2019, Alibaba also established a large agricultural office to gather more than 20 businesses around the entire chain of agriculture to improve digital agricultural infrastructure from technology, finance, logistics, and sales. According to the latest research results of the Nanjing University Space Planning Research Center and the Ali Research Institute, the number of "Taobao Village" in 2022 reached 7,780; the number of "Taobao Town" reached 2,429. Local products, collected orders for screening and packaging, and also entered the category of primary processing and modern service industries. These people are called "new farmers" and "new rural businessmen". The media praised these new farmers to use digitalization to open up the full link of "research-production-supply-sales-service" to build infrastructure for future agricultural construction.

Here, we do not discuss the exaggeration and moisture of the above numbers (this is the inevitable propaganda of Chinese political propaganda). Only one cold reality is discussed: digitalization is used in agricultural production and is limited by geographical conditions: many provinces and regions in China are hills and hills. Large -scale machine (intelligent) production cannot be promoted. In terms of terrain, the proportion of China's plains and pots accounted for 11.98%and 18.75%of the total land area, and hilly and mountainous areas accounted for about 43.23%of the total land area, close to half of the total land area; the plateau accounted for 26.04%.

This special topography has always limited the modern development of Chinese agriculture and is still the same in the future. Rural China will have long -term coexistence of modern agriculture and traditional farming.

** The era of global profit in China has ended **The above data reflects from the side that foreign -funded enterprises are evacuating the Chinese market one after another, which is a great blow to China's employment, especially considering that foreign investors have absorbed employment. Taking 2017 data as an example, 267,000 foreign -invested enterprises in total absorbing 25.81 million people in urban employment, with an average of 96.6 employment in the absorption of employment in each foreign -invested enterprise; 18.098 million nationwide companies absorbed 42.462 million urban employees, with an average number of people. For 24 people. The number of foreign -invested enterprises to attract employment is 4.1 times that of the number of households in the country.

It is no longer possible for China to return to the employment status of the world factory. Because of the past two years, the world has entered the stage of reorganization of the international supply chain. China has faced several major competition: China has faced several major competition:

The first is that the US manufacturing industry is "reappearing." According to data from the US Population Agency (Censusbureau), in 2022, building expenditures related to manufacturing reached US $ 108 billion, which was the highest value of the year in the history -the expenditure of the construction school, medical center or office building. This shows that the US manufacturing industry is reunited from local. In the past 20 years, China and the United States have almost been the first investment country. The United States' manufacturing industry has reached the local area, which will inevitably reduce investment in China. This is not good news for China.

The second is that the world is dividing the big cake in the manufacturing industry. As the Sino -US tariff war, the new crown epidemic, and the continuous deterioration of US -China relations have prompted enterprises to re -deploy the global supply chain, countries are striving to attract manufacturing activities transferred from China. These countries include India, Mexico, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines.

Everything has the cause and effect, watching the fruit, and tracing its cause, knowing that the solution of this youth employment problem involved in the overall society is related to the national conditions of China. It is gradually replacing various factors such as manpower. The current economic state of rural China is difficult to undertake the excess labor for urban surplus; most of the 12.2 million returnees are born in the countryside. They are not urban educated youths in line and settled in the country. The rural population is responsible for fields, even if they return home "employment." In a word, when China gradually lost its status in the world's factory, tens of millions of rural families helped the government "digestion" these unemployed people, otherwise China's urban youth unemployment rate would be more than 20%.(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-12T-13-02-10-00-00/000000.png)Leila de Lima, who was former Senator and Minister of Justice, was one of the main critics of Rodriduterete's "drug sweeping war". She has been detained since February 2017. She and the human rights organization claimed that her allegations were fabricated to retaliate against her to criticize Duteti and the anti -drug war that caused thousands of people to die.

According to the announcement of Manila's preliminary trial court, ABRAHAM Alcantara, the 63 -year -old Delima and another defendant were sentenced to innocence.

After the case was pronounced, when the police escorted Delima to a waiting bus, she told the media with relief: "This is a glorious day. This is the beginning of my rehabilitation."

"Please allow me to say to those who oppressed me: You can never nail the truth on the cross."

Although the judgment was not guilty, she would still stay in prison because of the trial of another criminal case. She has applied for bail and is waiting for the judge to decide.

If there is only one of the leasing prosecution, Delima will face a lifelong imprisonment. She was charged with the judicial minister of President Benigno Aquinoiii from 2010 to 2015, and received bribes from drug lords in the largest prison in the Philippines in exchange for allowing them to traffick at drug trafficking.

However, due to the death of the two witnesses and the prosecution of Delima's third prosecution, the case of the prosecution had been disintegrated. Another witnesses withdrew the testimony, claiming to be forced to be charged. (Translator: Lin Yifeng/Draft: Dai Yazhen)

# In response to the climate crisis, the new plan to curb the carbon row of the power plant

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Washington, 11th) U.S. President Biden announced a comprehensive plan today that will curb the gas of US power plant emissions that lead to global warming as a part of the United States dedicated to climate crisis.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-12T-24-02-09-00-00/000000.png)Since 2030, this plan will implement increasingly stringent carbon emissions restrictions on power plants that use fossil fuel power generation, including compulsory some coal -fired power plants to recover pollutants directly in the chimney of exhaust.

Michael Regan, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, stated at the announcement of the draft: "In all corners of our country, the American people can see and feel the destructive impact of climate change."

"Obviously, we have come to a critical moment of human history, and all of us must take action immediately to protect our future."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that its measures for coal and natural gas will prevent 617 million metric tons of carbon dioxide discharge to the atmosphere by 2042, which is equivalent to reducing half of the annual carbon displacement of American auto.

However, related proposals will inevitably face legal challenges from the Republican ruling states, which may allow the proposal to be submitted to the Supreme Court of Conservatives. Relevant proposals of controlling power plants were previously rejected by the US Supreme Court.

These proposals were condemned by the US Federal Senate Republican leader MitchmcConnell, and said that the proposal would pose a threat to survival for "providing (American people) affordable energy, and reliable US energy suppliers."

Due to the decline in the cost of renewable energy, the emissions of US power plants have declined, but 1/4 of the greenhouse gas generated by the world's largest economy in the world still comes from power plants, which makes power plants the primary goal of Biden.

Danlashof, director of the World Resources Institute Institute Institute, told AFP that "I think such standards are very important, which announced that the era when power plants can restrict discharge carbon pollution have ended."

Juliemcnamara, a US "Union of Concerned Scientist", said the standard "symbolizes a key turning point" in this research. Coal -fired and gas power plants are responsible for its continuous carbon pollution. "

Recently, Zibo's barbecue culture has attracted great attention across the country. The degree of hotness is not the same, it can be said that it is red throughout the network, and the whole city is hot!The secretaries and mayor of various places have organized a group to "go to Zi Bake Chasa" to learn the city's management and management. Many places, such as Shenzhen and other places, have begun to imitate Zibo's lifting of the stall economy. What are the factors behind Zibo barbecue? Why can Zibo City successfully become a new hot spot in cultural tourism? Zibo barbecue has become a trend or a flash? How much help can it help to unblock the stall economy in many places? This program will discuss the above topics. The guests who participated in the discussion were Qin Weiping, an economist in the United States.

** Zibo barbecue overnight red **

In the past May Day Golden Week, people at the country were overcrowded, and the most popular was the number of people in Zibo, Shandong, and it was estimated that 120,000 people were going. It is said that the local government has even issued open faith "dismissal" tourists.

The city is so hot, mainly because Zibo barbecue became popular overnight, and tourists swarmed to make fun. Some netizens said that a barbecue restaurant could not come, and the boss kneeling to forgive me. Another Duan Zi said that the local deputy director served as a waiter to help beer. These information reflect a signal, that is, Zibo is too hot.

The cause behind this phenomenon is complicated, the dissemination effect of the "Douyin era", and some retaliatory consumption caused by the three -year blocker of the epidemic, as well as the display of local governments to survive and change.

So, how did Zibo barbecue get angry? It is understood that the Zibo Municipal Government held the "Famous School Talents Express" in Beijing in March. Ma Xiaolei, secretary of the municipal party committee, went to Tsinghua and Peking University to preach, inviting students to develop in Zibo.

To this end, he proposed to visit the two universities for free to visit the tour during the May 1st period and eat it. Some Tsinghua and Bei University students began to search for Zibo scenic spots and found that Zibo barbecue was interesting. Therefore, discussions on platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu. Based on the algorithm effect, Zibo barbecue became more popular and out of control.

** Zibo government performance is remarkable and available **

In order to allow foreign tourists to "bake in Zibo", leaders at all levels of Zibo have also ushered in a Great Leap Forward for ideological liberation, urban management capabilities and informatization levels.

It is understood that Zibo made a set of combined fists, "overall planning, upper and lower linkage, and the city's heart", and released two open letters to all citizens and tourists. In order to do a good job of daily management, no leaks are not leaked, and various meetings such as mobilization, coordination, and promotion meeting every day will open until 3 or four in the morning.

Multiple Zibo barbecue stalls temporarily build welcoming tourists, and have unlicensed operations, but local urban management no longer crack down. Under the call of the municipal government, they roll up their sleeves with other civil servants and guests.

In order to create Zibo barbecue, the city will pick up and deliver tourists for free, and provide free accommodation without lack of two less. There are also 21 "barbecue" bus lines and opened a special line for barbecue. The phenomenon of taxis slaughter.

The barbecue feast of Zibo also brought people's changes in Zibo and Shandong.

In fact, Zibo used to be a cities with heavy industries. For a long time, Zibo's traditional industry proportion reached 70%, and the heavy chemical industry accounted for 70%of the traditional industries. This is a typical traditional industry. Traditional industries such as chemical industry, building pottery, medicine, and textile were once the foundation of the city.

In recent years, Zibo has seized the historical opportunities of Shandong's green and low -carbon high -quality development pioneer, and promoted the transformation of old industrial cities and the conversion of new and old kinetic energy. Old trees have developed new branches, new materials, intelligent equipment, new medicine, electronic information, etc. "Strong" industry is rejuvenating.

Walking in Zibo City, when you look at it, you will find that the traditional labels that have been posted by people over the years have long been torn off. This ancient city has a lot of net red temperament, because this time the barbecue is famous, although there are accidental components, it is not completely surprising.

** The stall economy has become the driving force for domestic demand? **

Recently, it has been reported that Shenzhen has announced that it will no longer prohibit roadside stalls from September. Previously, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Hangzhou and other places have announced the relaxation of stalls. According to the Huaxia Times, there are 28 cities in the open -stall economy in China.

The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone reported that Shenzhen recently amended the regulations on the management of city and environmental sanitation, allowing street offices to be based on "facilitating the masses", "reasonable layout", "orderly supervision" and other principles. Under the circumstances, the venue of stalls is delineated. The stipulated shops can also place the goods outside the store's entrance to solicit customers.

Professor Zhu Lijia of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China told the media that liberalizing the "roadside stall" policy is worthy of recognition, which is good for the development of the economy and satisfying the daily life and exchanges of the people. The "roadside stall" itself does not have fundamental contradictions with urban management. As long as it is well managed, it can develop benign. Of course, this also tests the wisdom and level of urban managers.

When the former Prime Minister of the State Council of the State Council went to Yantai, Shandong in June 2020, he had described the stall economy as "fireworks of the world" and "Chinese vitality". However, at that time, official media such as Beijing Daily were not suitable for Beijing and other comments. Therefore, the open stall economy can be said to be a "concession" of the government's living space at the bottom of the people. Similar to poverty alleviation to alleviate the social conflicts and crises that may cause high unemployment rates.

As the Bank of the United States, the Federal Statistics of the United States has quickly raised interest rates at 10 degrees in order to deal with inflation, but the inflation rate is still much higher than the 2%level of the Fed's long -term target.

In addition to the other duties of the Fed, the Federal Mandarin is targeted at the US labor market. The latter has remained active so far. The unemployment rate is hovering at a historical low, and it has not been affected by the recent weakening of US economic growth.

###  upgrade

After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) US Financial Secretary Janetyellen said on Thursday (May 11) that the United States is worried that China will use "economic coercion" for other countries. Worry, thinking about how to deal with this action.

Yellen said at a press conference that for a long time, Washington has been considering further and targeted restrictions on "overseas investment in China" and has been discussing this possibility with the G7 allies. She said that although the U.S. government has no conclusion, the Bayeng government believes that like -minded countries must act together in order to maximize their effectiveness.

The G7 Treasury Minister meeting held in Niigata from the 11th to 13th in Japan has become the focus of attention from all parties. G7's current rotating chairman of Japan discusses with the participating countries, how to make the supply chain of various countries more diverse and reduce the serious dependence on China.

Based on concerns about national security and supply chain issues, members of the United States Congress have been urging its government to strengthen the supervision of investing in US companies and individuals in other countries -especially China -and urging Biden to issue administrative orders. Yellen said that the United States has been discussing related discussions with other G7 member states. She expects such discussions to continue in this conference, "at least in a form of informal way."

Yellen said in a speech last month that in order to gain a dominant position among foreign competitors, Washington will counter Chinese economic coercion. She continued the statement that the member states of the G7 will also join the counterattack and continue to work hard to reduce the risk of geographical strategy. She told reporters that China has made economic coercion on Australia and Lithuania. "This is a question that all of us should pay attention to."

She said that the United States has begun to review domestic investment and export control. Extracting restrictions on overseas investment will make this layer of protection more complete: "I personally think that this matter should focus on national security, rather than deliberately destroying the economic competitiveness or the ability to develop the economy of China and other countries." She added to add. If the United States takes any action, "the scope of the goal will be very focused and the technology that has impact on Guoan," she does not say that it takes the relevant action time.

China has recently pushed the "Anti -Spy Law". The authorities pointed out that it was operating in the country.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國加強反間諜-諮詢公司涉危害國安遭查/a-65557271)And assault it. Yellen said she was not sure if this move could be attributed to the actions that the United States had adopted.

### G7 will take action

According to the documents obtained by the Financial Times, the G7 plans to issue an independent economic security statement for the first time when the main communique of the summit is released, which will promise to "jointly resist, deal with and counter economic stress."

Yellen said that many G7 members are quite jealous of such actions in China, so they have developed measures to jointly resist this behavior.

The European Commission Chairman Ursula Von Derleyen said in March that Brussels is studying its own review mechanism to review the overseas investment of EU companies in a specific and sensitive technical level that may enhance the military capabilities of the opponent. She added that the European Union needs to ensure the company's capital, professional technology and knowledge, and will not be used to enhance the military and intelligence capabilities of "systemic competitors" such as China.

A senior EU official who participated in the Drafting G7 summit told the Financial Times that they had the confidence to reach a consensus on the review of foreign investment and would not share the same review mechanism with the United States.

In late March this year, Japan also announced the export of 23 technologies under the agreement with the United States and the Netherlands. Although Tokyo emphasizes that this measure is not aimed at a specific country, the Japanese authorities will be able to monitor the equipment sold in Japan. Whether it is used by the buyer country for the production of high -end chips and exported to China and other places for military use.

International Relations Analyst Dr. Elainetolentino said: "The Philippines hopes to enjoy fishing rights in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but since China began to occupy some military deployment in the South China Sea, Beijing has denied this right . Before China's actions became so aggressive, fishermen in many countries in the region could fish freely in these sea areas. "

She added: "The Philippines expects all walks of life to pay attention to the problem of fishing rights in the South China Sea and ensure the safety of the country's waters."

In 2016, the International Court of Hague had arbitrarily arranged the sovereignty dispute between the Philippines and sovereignty, and ruled the Philippines to win the lawsuit with an overwhelming advantage. China refused to recognize this ruling.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) reported that the Financial Times reported on Thursday (May 11) that the Italian plan held talks with China to negotiate with the "Belt and Road" initiative to withdraw from Beijing. Stable business connection.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国人带着钱来我们非常欢迎/a-48449562), Is the only member of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7), who joined this initiative, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/加入一带一路收获投资-意大利招致盟友批评/a-48043098)Essence In 2022, the current Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for the first time at the campaign, it publicly stated that the decision was "a big mistake."

However, the report pointed out that Melonini said on Wednesday (10th) that she has not yet determined to be terminated [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/一带一路扩版图-习访欧后有暗涌/a-48015677)The "discussion is still open."

Several unnamed Italian officials told the Financial Times that the Melony government should find a way to let Italy's release from the "Belt and Road" initiative, but not to anger Beijing and be punished. Essence One of the officials emphasized that Italy would "work hard to avoid the upgrade of the problem."

"Politics is to make a choice. She (Melonini) cannot have China and the United States at the same time," "The former Italian Ambassador to NATO Ambassador Stefanostefanini told the Financial Times that when the US -China relations were tight, the Italian University Li is a clear signal to the international community.

"We cannot continue to participate in the" Belt and Road "cooperation as an American allies," said Standani: "We must try to negotiate a peace or the least destructive way to exit with China."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-12T06-28-00Z/64736928_401.jpg)On February 16th, Wang Yi (left) of the CPC Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee visited Europe and met Antonio Tajani (right) at the Italian Foreign Minister in Rome.

### Different opinion of internal opinion in Italy

At the end of last month, Bloomberg quoted anonymous insiders that Melonney plans to announce its position on the "Belt and Road" at the Seven Kingdoms Group (G7) summit held in Japan in May, but the current opinions of the co -government of the government are different. Most members of the Italian Brothers' Brothers leading the leader of Lomite are mostly in favor of withdrawal, and other party factions are not.

The original Roman and Beijing initiative was promoted by then Italian Prime Minister GiuseputConte. At that time, Italy was influenced by the debt crisis, and Conte hoped that it could boost the country's sluggish economy. But to this day, several Italy's proposed traffic infrastructure plans proposed in BRI have almost no progress.

"Italia Viva) member and Senator Enricoborghi said," In these 5 years, people's awareness of risk of BRI has risen sharply. "He pointed out that almost all political parties" abandon China in China The idea of the Italian (economic) problem can be solved. "

Melonyne's successor and former Prime Minister Mariodraghi's confrontation is more cautious in economic and trade exchanges with China. Melonini reviewed the Chinese state -owned chemical giant Sinochem Group because the group had a stake in the Italian well -known tire company, Beirely, as much as 37%. The Financial Times stated that Pirelli refused to comment on this.

Bloomberg also quoted unknown people on April 20 that Italy intends to abandon China's "Belt and Road" initiative and strengthen cooperation with Taiwan to strengthen semiconductor production and exports.

However, some analysts in Italy believed that Melony's best solution was to maintain the status quo and automatically renew the contract. "Stopping a vague cooperation" said, "StriceGallelli), a Chinese researcher at the Roman Think Tank International Institute (IAI), said it will have greater noise than let it automatically renew its contract."

### "Belt and Road"

### Exit the two dilemma

The Melony administration's discussion of the initiative is facing urgent time pressure. The Financial Times pointed out that the BRI agreement involved in Italy is included in a 4 -year cooperation, but its stipulated contract will automatically renew the contract at the time of March next year (2024). To cancel, Italy must be 3 months in advance -before the end of this year -officially notified the Chinese government.

However, some officials stated that the United States has slowed down Italy on the withdrawal of the initiative because Melonini has clearly expressed its support for Ukraine in the Russia -Ukraine War. They also pointed out that if Italy maintains communication channels with Beijing, it may help put pressure on China and promote the end of the Ukrainian war.

However, after the Russian and Ukraine War, in order to respond to the government's sanctions to Russia, the Italian business community has shifted its attention to China after the epidemic. In the first quarter of 2023, Italy's exports to China increased by 92.5%compared with the same period last year, mainly because the source was that the exports of drugs grew significantly in the short term.

"When companies and business people are eager to return to the Chinese market, the behavior that may withdraw (initiative) will cause bilateral relations to cool down," the Chairman of the Italian China Director Foundation MarioBoselli told the Financial Times Essence

### Joining the "Belt and Road" is not good?

According to the Taiwan Central News Agency on the 10th, according to statistics released by Shanghai Fudan University International Finance College, the amount of investment related to the "Belt and Road" in Italy has fallen sharply in one year, from more than 2.5 billion US dollars in 2019, It was only about $ 800 million to the following year.

### As long as China has money Italy, you don't worry

According to data from the US think tank Rhodiumgroup, China ’s FDI (FDI) implemented by China’ s implementation of Italy also dropped from 650 million US dollars in 2019 to US $ 20 million; 2021 is also slight Increased to $ 33 million. At the same time, China ’s FDI in Germany in 2020 reached 1.9 billion and 1.8 billion US dollars, respectively.

People familiar with the matter said that the debt limit of US $ 3.14 trillion (approximately S $ 41.8 trillion) of the US government is to avoid negotiations on disaster debt defaults. The assistant leaders of the White House and the Republican and Democratic parties have begun to discuss methods to restrict federal expenditure.

The White House said earlier that the assistants of Biden, McCarthy, Senate's leader Shumo, Senate's minority party leader McConal and the Democratic Party leader Jeffris were in a meeting on Wednesday and Thursday.

According to two sources, the White House officials admit that to reach an agreement with the Republican Party to increase the upper limit of debt, the White House must agree to reduce some expenditures or implement strict restrictions on future expenditure. However, they also emphasized that they must retain the iconic climate legislation passed by the party line last year.

At the White House briefing on Thursday, Mariokas emphasized that "we have no open border" and warn that those who try to cross the American border will face more severe consequences.

Mexican President Lopez said on the same day that Mexico is working with the United States to avoid "confusion" and "violence" in the common border between the two countries before the 42nd Volume 42 immigration restrictions.

The bill aims to prevent immigrants and illegal drugs from crossing the border of the United States and Mexiong, and the Senate tries to pass a broader cross -party immigration bill.

The bill will set strict restrictions on the seekers who seeks asylum, ask them to apply for the United States outside the United States, and will restore the construction of a barrier wall along the border and expand the law enforcement efforts of the federal authorities.

The House of Representatives passed the bill 219 votes against 213 votes, and all Democrats and a Republican voted against the vote. The Democratic Party stated that the bill would be blocked in the Senate.

In addition, the National Defense Minister of Venezuela and Columbia said on Thursday that Venezuela and Columbia will increase the number of garrisons who have informal in the common border, and armed criminal groups related to drug trafficking often move in these locations.

The US Code Volume 42 (Title 42) immigration restrictions began to take effect in March 2020, allowing authorities to expel immigrants back to Mexico according to public health measures and do not have the opportunity to seek US asylum.

(Voice of Germany) Musk announced on Thursday (May 11) that he had found alternative candidates for Twitter's new CEO (CEO).

"I am glad to announce that I hire a new CEO for Twitter. She will take office about 6 weeks later!" Musk published a tweet, "My role will be transformed into executive chairman and chief technician, Responsible for supervising products, software and system operations. "

Musk became the owner and CEO of Twitter in late October last year. In December last year, he stated on Twitter, "Once I find that someone is stupid enough to accept the job," he will resign from the position of CEO.

Due to Musk's announcement, Twitter's stock price rose on Thursday.

Another new policy launched by Musk is "Twitter Blue". Users need to pay $ 8 (7.3 euros) a monthly verification account.

After introducing "Twitter Blue", the Twitter users who have passed the check -ups verified by the early system have lost their authentication and induced the monthly fee. This means that verification is meaningless, and accounts that are impersonated by celebrities, enterprises and government organizations will be filled with this platform.

Musk, who claims to be "free and absolutely absoluteist", also released a tweet that hinted that conspiracy theory. For example, the fatal shooting incident that recently claimed to have recently occurred in Allen, Texas came from "psychological problems".

The picture is subsequently presented in a member of the Kurds Workers (PKK) who has been banned by Turkey, and applauded with Kirida Ouru's campaign. The message that El section tries to convey is very clear: the secular opposition leader Kiridauru is the "alliance of terrorists."

However, it is one of the latest movies and the latest disinformation. It pollutes the most important and most important election of Turkey's generations.

Dunja Mijatovic, a member of the European Commission Human Rights Affairs, warned this month that the law of the law was "widely applicable" to the "cold effect of reporters and criticisms of criticism."

KOC University, an expert at KOC University, said the expert of malicious fraud messages, said that in the past Turkish elections, such allegations and anti -allegations never reached such a level.

Kohel said, "Everyone is trying to define what malicious fraud information is." "It has become a new phenomenon that has a weapon to convict hostile candidates or political parties."

Since his last time he was arrested in August 2013, he was sentenced to six years on November 27, 2015. He was released from prison on August 7, 2019. By this time he was arrested by the Communist Party of China, Guo Feixiong has always lived under the follow -up and monitoring of the Communist Party of China.

In early January 2021, when he learned that his wife Zhang Qing was seriously ill, he continued to ask the CCP to allow him to accompany his wife and children to the United States. However, the CCP has been procrastinating. At the end of January, he was blocked and wondered. By November 2021, Zhang Qing's condition would be more serious. Cancer cells were transferred from the large intestine to the liver, lungs, etc., and large intestine obstruction occurred. Under the anxiety, when Guo Feixiong was about to leave the United States again on December 5, the CCP abducted it at Shanghai Airport ... On January 9, 2022, a month later, his wife Ms. Zhang Qing suddenly deteriorated her condition and worsen her condition. Due to the hospital on January 10th!After more than ten years of separation, due to the persecution of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Qinglin failed to meet her husband Yang Maodong's last side at the end.

Instead of refusing Yang Maodong's funeral, the evil CCP not only refused Yang Maodong to come to Meimei's wife's wife, but announced a day later that he was detained in the detention center. Immediately in prison, he began a long -term hunger strike, and the international community also condemned the CCP's extinction of human nature.

Regardless of whether citizens write and publish articles about democratic constitutional government, or organization of democratic forums and news interviews with any media, they are exercising the basic rights of citizens rather than crimes. According to international law and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, deprive citizens' freedom of remarks, it is limited to what can be said and cannot be said to be illegal. The government that blatantly deprives civil rights at citizens is the tyranny of anti -democratic freedom and constitutional rule of law, which should be overturned.

"People's Democracy" and "Freedom of speech" are clearly stipulated in the "Constitution" written in China's "Constitution". The crime of governance is destroying the Constitution. The Communist Party of China should be sentenced.

Looking back at history, the CCP has always regarded people's lives like grass and mustard. In order to maintain its autocratic regime, they never consider the people's life and death. Yang Maodong has been on a hunger strike since he was arrested. He has dropped from about 150 pounds to only 90 pounds from the previous 150 pounds to today. Not only is he weak, but according to prison doctors, he also has serious malnutrition such as blurred vision and muscle atrophy. The phenomenon……

According to the CCP system, this time the judgment on Guo Feixiong will not be an independent judgment of the local court, but the decision made by the CCP's senior management. I think it is difficult for appeals to have a chance to change. According to his current physical condition, it is worthy of everyone's concern for eight years.

With the awakening of citizens, the crisis of the CCP's tyranny regime has made the rulers sleepy. Through violence and sentenced to severe punishment, the people's demands for democratic legal systems have become the primary tasks of the CCP. Whether it is to re -sentence Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, or the human rights lawyers and rights protection people who drive away in Beijing have proved this.

When the unjust being written into the law becomes a tool for tyranny, resistance becomes the obligation to the people. Therefore, in the face of the thorough rogue underworld of the Chinese Communist regime, national machines have become a tool for the Communist Party to persecute the people. The people must completely abandon any hope for the CCP. We must think about how to fundamentally end the CCP's raging area in China and establish a constitutional rule of law system for democratic republics.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The former American NBA star "Warcraft" Dwighthoward recently co -produced with Taiwan Vice President Lai Qingde's advertisement for "Come to the Presidential Palace for one night". In this short film launched on May 10, Howard said that since he came to Taiwan, he had a new understanding of the "country". Lai Qingde called "Taiwan is a free country" and caused dissatisfaction with Chinese netizens.

After the short film was broadcast, "#Howard Taiwan Independence" quickly appeared on Weibo hot search. Chinese netizens criticized Howard and the "Taiwan independence element Lai Qingde" co -produced short film and Taiwan's "country". Howard apologized, and some people threatened to block.

Under Howard's Weibo account @DWIGHTHOWARD's recent birthday dynamics, a large number of Chinese netizens rushed to a message on Thursday (May 11), saying that "Taiwan is an inseparable part of China" and "Taiwan Province is a province in China. "," Principles are unforgivable "and so on.

### Howard: "Country" does not necessarily refer to the country

Howard apologized for Chinese netizens on Friday. Howard said that the harm is not his original intention. The word "Country" does not necessarily be "national". Sometimes from one place to another, it will also call "country". This is how they speak and may cause communication misunderstandings. Essence

Howard said: "I am not a politician, and I have no intention of being involved in any politics." But he also said that he had freedom of speech and didn't want to hurt people. He had been to China, respecting the Chinese, and respecting Taiwanese.

The Central News Agency quoted Howard that everyone lives on this planet. He treats everyone equally, loves everyone, respects everyone, and will continue to adhere to this concept.

But Chinese netizens' explanation of Howard obviously did not buy it. Some netizens pointed out that Howard and Lai Qingde "sing one harmony", the script must have been written, "say it is a mistake, some people believe it?"; Some people criticize him "to pretend to be confused." However, some netizens said slowly that "Country" that Howard said did refer to the country, but "extending to‘ Taiwan independence ’is still ambiguous.”

Howard is a well -known NBA player in the United States. He once played for the Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets, Atlanta Eagles and other teams. At the end of 2022, he joined Taoyuan Yongfeng Cloud Leopard, Taiwan.

### Lai Qingde: Taiwan is already a sovereign independent country

Taiwan Vice President and Chairman of the DPP Lai Qingde, who was regarded by China as "Taiwan independence", officially won the DPP nominated for the 2024 presidential election on April 12. He once stated at a press conference that Taiwan has land, the people, and regularly re -elected governments at all levels. In fact, it is already a sovereign independent country, and it is not necessary to declare independence. He also emphasized that the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not affiliated with each other, and the future of Taiwan's Taiwan must be determined by 23 million people.

In this regard, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, responded at a routine press conference on April 26 that "Taiwan is part of China. Although the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to China have never changed. It is impossible to change. Taiwan is not nor can it be a 'sovereign independent country'. "

Zhu Fenglian also criticized the Democratic Party of Taiwan's ruling parties to "stubbornly adhere to the" Taiwan independence "position and continue to linked to external forces to provoke 'independence' provocations, which is the root cause of the tension and turbulence of the current Taiwan Strait."

Trump said at the CNN citizen meeting: "I don't know her. I have never seen her. I don't know who she is."

Trump also refuted whether the CNN host Collins asked the ruling of the case would affect his status in the minds of female voters.

Capland, Capland, said Carpram is now measuring whether it wants to file a new defamation lawsuit against Trump. In addition to the case that the jury made a ruling last week, Corol had previously been tried by another defamation lawsuit filed by Trump.

Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" announced on Thursday that it ended the 40 -year cooperative relationship with the political cartoonist Zunzi.

"Thank you for witnessing the change of the times with us in the past 40 years."

The "Ming Pao Workers' Association" issued a statement, regret and helplessness in the suspension of "Zunzi Comic", and grateful to the hard work that Zunzi had paid for the Ming Pao for many years, calling on all circles to respect the freedom of speech, and to protect the core value of Ming Pao.

** Zunzi: Freedom of free newspapers and magazines, but not necessarily silent **

Zunzi responded to the station in writing that the comics suspension of the Ming Pao was the result of the "agreement".

Zunzi: "Comics are just expression tools. As long as there is a platform space and social needs, it will appear naturally. Seeing fewer and fewer and fewer and fewer and fewer and less silent. Long road at the end. "

Will it publish works on other platforms in the future? He said, "If you can, the righteousness is incompetent", and said, "freedom is coming from yourself."

In the record record, Zunzi's comics have been criticized 6 times by senior officials in the Hong Kong Government. The Ming Pao is a platform published by the mainstream media after the comic pillar. It ended because the platform was accused of violating the "National Security Law of Hong Kong".

** President of the former Records Association: All the diverse spaces in Hong Kong in the past are narrowing **

Yang Jianxing, chairman and senior journalist, said that the incident reflected that the diverse speech space in Hong Kong had compressed a lot.

Yang Jianxing said: "For some events, use comics, expressing in a way of laughing and scolding, is part of the freedom of speech. Is it the change of Zunzi, or the degree of tolerance of our society and the government? Yes, you can scold and paint everything. The diverse speech is very broad. Now it has narrowed a lot. It may have been over the line for no reason. "

** After Zunzi Comics was suspended, his books and "June 4th" books were removed from the shelves **

In addition, the Hong Kong self -media "Ji Zhishe" reported on Friday that Zunzi's books and materials were removed from the Hong Kong Public Library. From the 149th in 2009, it was reduced to only 3 English books. The "People will not forget: the" of the 89th Democratic Games ", including the 64 Hong Kong journalists, and the Hong Kong Records Association, the Association, Wang Dan, Cheng Xiang, Cheng Xiang, and Cheng Xiang. Liu Xiaobo, Zhongda, and Dagong's books.

Tao Jie, a well -known Hong Kong writer and current affairs commentator, may be the beginning of the Hong Kong Cultural Revolution.

Tao Jie: "Because the Cultural Revolution is the gene of the Chinese, Mao Zedong said that every 7 or 8 years has been cyclically. The Hong Kong Public Library preserves a large number of" Dagong "and" Wen Wei Po "about the old newspaper and electronic archives around 1989" Do you want to cancel it? The frontline bureaucratic bureaucrats in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region trained in the colonial era and did not understand the entire political situation in China. They just joined the Chinese political family. They did not know that many things could be handled flexibly by local governments. "

Tao Jie said that Hong Kong people are still in the process of learning to be Chinese. They do not understand China's hidden rules, and they are far less politically touching and cunning in handling.

I emphasize that this is the cold cicada effect, and it wants us to review ourselves. "

Yan Jiya believes that Fucha is an important part of Taiwan's publishing and cultural circles. It is the first case in China to suppress Taiwan's publishing industry. It is deeply indicated. This has also attracted considerable attention in the overseas Chinese writing circle. Regardless of the pro -China or anti -China position, freedom of speech, freedom of publishing, human rights, and rule of law are Taiwan's largest conventions.

Li Jinlian, the editor -in -chief of the "Open Volume" version of the "Open Volume", also mentioned that Taiwan has 100 % freedom of speech, freedom of creation, and publishing freedom in the Chinese world. This is the most important meaning of supporting Fucha.

Li Jinlian said: "For example, Zhang Ailing's" Yangge ", my love novelist Harin's" Light Sky ", and" Mao Zedong Private Doctor Memoirs "in the 1990s.

The Philippine Court of Court of Court was not established on Friday (May 12) that the former senators Delima accepted the bribery of drug dealers.

Reuters reports that Leila de Lima is one of the strongest critics of the former President Duterte's bloody anti -drug operation. Duterte accused Delima's bribe by drug dealers when he accused Delima.

Delima, 63, has been detained before trial in the past six years. Since she has another case waiting for trial, she will not be released immediately.

In 2017, Delima launched an investigation of the Drug Drug War in the Senate, and she was sued in a few months.

Human rights organizations generally believe that Delima is a political prisoner.

Delima said in court's webcast: "Thank you. Please continue to pray. My other case requires your prayer. Today is a day of glory, and I am the beginning of my rehabilitation."

Duterte has accused Delima from participating in drug transactions in TV speeches. Delima, who has won many human rights awards many times, said that these allegations were not a charges that designed to let her shut up.

In August 2018, the UN arbitrarily detention work group concluded in the opinion of No. 61/2018, and lacks legal basis for Delima's detention. A group of UN human rights experts once again called on the Philippines to release Delima immediately.

U.S. Government AccountabilityOffice (GAO) issued a report on May 10th that in the past 10 years, the United States as a World Bank of World Bank, in the past 10 years, nearly one -third of the nearly one -thirds It is obtained by Chinese companies.

From 2013 to 2022, China received a total of 29.2%of funds, equivalent to about $ 21 billion. In contrast, the proportion of the United States is 2.4%, and France is 4.4%. As far as the number of contracts is concerned, France has obtained 4.3%, the United States has obtained 3.3%, and China obtains 2.9%.

The U.S. Government Accountability Agency is the highest audit and supervision agency in the US federal government. The office stated that one of the reasons for the above differences is that American companies are less participating in bidding. Judging from the data abstracts since 2017, the success rate of the bidding of American companies is 70%.

The report also pointed out that from 2017 to 2021, 28 contracts worth about $ 76 million in total, flowing to entities that may face other restrictions on the US sanctions list or face other restrictions.

A spokesman for the World Bank responded that the bank's universal and open qualification principles ensure that bidders from all 189 member states can participate in contract bidding. The only exception is to be sanctioned by the UN Security Council, or according to the multilateral development banks, or between multilateral development banks Anti -corruption agreement was suspended or forbidden.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-12T11-56-14-00-00/000000.png)Although astronomers have proposed the most likely cause of the explosion, they also emphasized that more research is needed to understand this phenomenon.

This explosion called AT2021LWX is not the brightest flash of the universe in the history. This record is maintained by the Gamma-Ray explosion in October last year. The meaning of Brightest of all time.

Philipwiseman, a astronomical physicist at the University of Southampton, the United Kingdom, is the first author of a new study. He said that AT2021LWX was considered the biggest explosion because the energy it released in the past three years far exceeds the energy generated by Boat's brief light.

It is estimated that the energy released in these three years is about 100 times the total energy conjunction released by the sun in the life cycle of the sun.

Wesman told AFP that AT2021LWX was a "accidental harvest". The "Zwicky TransitionFacility" of California's "Zwicky TransitionFacility" was first discovered in the process of automatically scanning the sky.

However, Wesman said that at the moment of AT2021LWX, "basically it was only in the database", and it was not noticed until the second year.

The astronomers, including Wesmann observed through the more powerful telescope, realized what they found. By analyzing the light of different wavelengths, they calculated that the explosion occurred in the 8 billion light years.

This is farther than any other new flash of the sky, which means that the scale of that explosion must be much larger. Wesman said that it is estimated that the brightness of AT2021LWX is about 2 trillion times that of the sun.

Astronomers have studied several possible explanations. One of them is that AT2021LWX is an explosive star, but the brightness of the flash is 10 times that of other supernova.

Another possibility is the so -called "Tidal Disruption Event", which refers to the phenomenon of being torn when the star is sucked into the "large quality black hole". But AT2021LWX was three times brighter than those tidal tiles, and Weisman said that their research did not point to this direction.

The only cosmic incident that can be compared with a slightly comparable is the phenomenon of "Quasar", which appeared in the "large quality black hole" when swallowing a large amount of gas in the center of the galaxy.

Wesman said, but their light often flickered, and AT2021LWX has been burning since it suddenly burned from scratch three years ago, and it is still burning.

Weisman said, "This is what we have never seen in the past, and it suddenly emerges."

(Voice of German in China) According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on Thursday, the consumer price index (CPI) in April rose 0.1%year -on -year, which was further slowed down from 0.7%in March. This means the lowest level since February 2021.

The Wall Street Journal reported analysis that China ’s low inflation in April was to a certain extent due to the high comparison base of the same period last year, and it is expected that the inflation rate will rise again later this year. Economists say that China's low consumption inflation level shows the vulnerability of domestic demand recovery. The high unemployment rate, uncertainty in the housing market, and weakening corporate profits have hit consumer confidence.

Ding Shuang, chief Chinese economist of Standard Chartered Bank, said that the inflation data announced on Thursday shows that China's [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济显复苏-就此走出阴霾/a-65346516)Still uneven, the growth rate of service demand exceeds product demand.

At the same time, the producer price index announced in April(PPI)The year -on -year decrease of 3.6%, a consecutive seven months, the decline expanded by 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, which expanded for the fourth consecutive month, and the decline was higher than expected. The National Bureau of Statistics explained that the PPI in April was decreased year -on -year, which was mainly affected by factors such as the fluctuation of the price of international commodities, the overall demand of domestic and foreign markets, and the higher comparison base of the previous year. Earlier in March, PPIs fell 2.5%year -on -year, and dropped six months in a row.

The Wall Street Journal pointed(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界苦于通胀中国要担心通缩吗/a-65359964)A closer step, but economists generally expect that the Chinese economy will maintain a recovery momentum, so the core inflation rate that eliminates the fluctuating food and energy prices will show a rise in the rest of this year.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-12T12-13-00Z/65143584_401.jpg)China's trade surplus continues to expand

### Foreign Trade: Increase exports, decline in imports

According to the National Bureau of Statistics this week [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国进口萎缩出口放缓意味着什么/a-65560557)In April, China's exports increased by 8.5%year -on -year, and imports fell significantly by 7.9%, which made China's trade surplus in April reaching 90.21 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 82.3%.

China's exports rose 14.8%in March this year. Although in April, although it fell to 8.5%, the growth was still considerable. Experts analyze that the positive growth of exports is mainly due to the low bases under the blocker of the epidemic last year. Zhou Junzhi, an economist of Zhejiang University, wrote an analysis that if the low base effect was excluded, referring to the calculation of the data of previous years, then the export amount in April this year was almost the same as the same period last year. Zhou Junzhi believes that global trade frictions and epidemic conditions have accelerated the wave of China's industries, and industrial transfer brings exports of production machinery, components and other production materials, becoming the source of China's export toughness this year.

Since the beginning of this year, China's exports to undeveloped countries have increased sharply. Exports to Russia in April increased by 153%year -on -year, and exports to Africa increased by 50%. Exports to the United States decreased by 6.5%year -on -year. In addition, the exports of new energy vehicles in April rose sharply, but the imports of semiconductors fell by 15.3%.

Xu Tianchen, an analyst of the Economist Think Tank (EIU), pointed out that "at the beginning of this year, it was believed that the import will easily be more than 2022, but the situation is not the case." Quick and fierce, but it is largely inside, and it is not felt elsewhere in the world.

Recently announced in April China's official manufacturing purchase manager index showing that the new export orders have shrunk sharply. "In view of the bleak external demand prospects, we believe that the export of (China) will further decline, and then to bottom out later this year," Huang Zichun, an economist of Capitaleconomics, said in his report.

On April 26, Zelei Sky said that the call with Xi Jinping was "long and meaningful." Earlier, Beijing issued a 12 -point peace plan about Ukraine in February, calling for dialogue and respect for sovereignty over the country.

The peace plan was criticized by Western countries because of vague wording, although it prompted Zerrenzki to explain to talk to Xi Jinping. The first name: "The sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of various countries should be effectively guaranteed." But China has always refused to explain in detail what it has to do with the Ukrainian war.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-12T12-38-00Z/64956697_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65604781/64956697)(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) "Daily" commented that the Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping gave a clear answer to the current situation of poor economic development: " The curbing, blocking, and suppression of the orientation brings unprecedented challenges to the development of our country. " But is the question so simple? The comments entitled "Xi Jinping's Care of China's Development" wrote:

"The truth of the matter is obviously much more complicated, but China's propaganda machine refuses to reflect on any reflection: the primary reason for the paralysis of China's ambitious development plan is not to sanctions with Huagao technology exports to Hua Gao, but Xi Jinping has formulated itself. Policies of politics. As Ryan Hass, who had worked in the National Security Council, said at the appointment of President Obama: 'The only country that can prevent China's rise is China itself, and now China seems to be doing this. '

From the perspective of Xi Jinping, which has a strong desire for control, ideology is much more important than economic development, which is fully reflected in its almost crazy 'clearing policy'. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国站在了侵略者一边/a-64833755)In addition, Xi Jinping's technological management and control policies that repeatedly changed the impermanence of the impermanence also made the most successful companies in the local area weakened permanently. "

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-12T12-38-00Z/65143584_401.jpg)China's official April economic data is lower than expected.

The comments pointed out that in the past few years, the power of the Communist Party of China has been greatly consolidated and expanded, and all this is at the cost of blocking economic development.

"Beijing seems to have forgotten that the Western system that they are challenging now is exactly the system that has brought great benefits to China in the past few decades. At least the same important reform and opening up in the late 1970s is that in 2001, China officially. Joining the World Trade Organization. Although the negotiations at that time were quite arduous, the European Union and the United States welcomed China in the end. The process of intervention in the economy, and the process of opening the market for Western enterprises has also fallen into stagnation. "

The German Economic Minister of Economic Minister Habeck made a suggestion that the government should control the investment of German companies in China in the future, and it is necessary to introduce a company's investment in China for investment in China. It is recommended to just introduce it, which has caused fierce debate in the business community. The "South Germany will" published a comment and wrote:

"From a political perspective, related suggestions are also logical. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德企在华投资创新高/a-65179218)The chemical giant BASF continued to invest hundreds of millions of funds in China, and the automotive industry did not consider the options to withdraw from the Chinese market.

The decision of the company may be unspeakable, but Russia fully illustrates the war of aggression launched by Ukraine, which is how dangerous it is to depend on a single country. And Germany's dependence on China far exceeds its original dependence on Russia. In addition, risks are also hidden in China's technical output. All in all, it is completely necessary to adopt cautious attitude. In view of this, Habeck's suggestion is actually a threat that is worth the serious treatment of corporate executives. When making investment decisions, the geopolitical risk is considered and the risks are scattered to different countries. In 2023, all this should be a matter of course. I hope Habeck's suggestion is just a threat. "

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin shouted at a regular press conference on the 12th and gave the United States for the "developed countries" of China. China could not wear it. He also accused the United States of accusing the United States through the status of developing countries curbing China's development space and provoking friendly relations between China and developing countries.

Wang Wenbin said: "China and the majority of Asian -Africa -Rathered developing countries fight side by side in the national liberation movement ... The two sides have already become the community of fate of the Communist Party." He also emphasized that China will not join the West "rich club" "As President Xi Jinping pointed out, China is always a member of the family of developing countries."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-12T14-00-00-04-00/000001.png)On May 12, 2023, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Wenbin at a press conference. (Screenshot of Reuters Video) [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05122023094956.html/capture.jpg)Hu Ping, editor -in -chief of the honor of the overseas political journal "The Spring of Beijing", believes that Xi Jinping emphasized that China's "forever" is a very ridiculous theory of developing countries: "On the one hand, Xi Jinping) has vigorously boasted how great the Chinese economy has made, saying that China is rich in rich, saying that China becomes rich. It ’s strong, how is the Chinese model; but when it comes to Chinese developing countries, it has denied (economic development), which is funny itself."

He said that China's developing countries are determined by objective indicators, not depending on China's own policy: "Should China develop the economy? Do you want to improve the per capita GDP? If China wants to become a rich country, how can it be 'forever forever? 'Is it a developing country? "

As early as 2021, Xi Jinping announced that China's "fighting poverty alleviation" has achieved a comprehensive victory and completed the arduous task of eliminating absolute poverty. As the world's second largest economy, China has also exceeded RMB 121 trillion in 2022.

However, Wang Wenbin argued that although China's economy is large, the per capita GDP is 1/5 of the developed economies, which is equivalent to only 1/6 of the United States, and it is also ranked among developing countries.

The station previously reported that at the end of March this year, the Federal House of Representatives passed the PRC is not a developing countryact, which aims to deprive China's developing countries. The bill requires the U.S. State Department to impose influence on international organizations and attribute China to the ranks of developed countries to ensure that China cannot enjoy preferential treatment in the name of developing countries internationally. In addition, the latest resolution of the US Congress also proposed to oppose China's position in developing countries in the WTO.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-12T14-00-00-04-00/000002.png)On the 3rd and 27th of 2023, the US Congress House of Representatives passed the bill with zero votes and 415 votes in favor of the bill, and no longer attributed China to developing countries. (Video screenshot of the House official website) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05122023094956.html/image.jpg)Li Hengqing, an economist in the "Institute of Information and Strategy" in American civil institutions, said in an interview with this station that China has enjoyed decades of international benefits in the name of developing countries, including economic assistance and preferential policies. The resources should be obtained by real developing countries.

"The reason why the United States has to redefine China as a developed country is because the per capita GDP is at least the per capita GDP of China is so high." He said, "Developing countries have less obligations internationally, and they have received support or support or support or obtained. There are many benefits of subsidies and policy tilt. This is why China has got a lot of financial support from the United Nations or other funds. "

Li Hengqing analyzed that thanks to the support of China at the beginning of this century, the WTO opened the door to China to China. However, China not only seizes the benefits in international organizations, but also takes advantage of the United States with permanent and most favorable national treatment status. It can enjoy special treatment including tariff reduction and exemption. However, it is unable to improve its human rights status like earlier promises, which naturally triggers American dissatisfaction.

Li Hengqing believes that once China loses all preferential treatment enjoyed by developing countries, it will have a negative impact on China's foreign trade, thereby dragging economic recovery.

Since the outbreak of the Russian -Ukraine conflict, the international community has been holding a high degree of doubt about the so -called "neutral stance" of Beijing and whether it can play the "mediation person". On the eve of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China had announced a "unlimited" cooperation with Russia. After the outbreak of the war, Beijing has always rejected condemnation of Russia's aggression, but has accused the United States and NATO from provoking conflicts. On the first anniversary of the Russian -Ukraine conflict, China also released a 12 -point peace plan to resolve the Russian -Ukraine conflict. Among them, only the words were not required to withdraw troops from Ukraine, which caused criticism from Ukraine and the international community.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has phone calls with the President of Ukraine in April. This is also the first time that China -Ukraine leaders have been talked about since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal of the United States pointed out that this shows that Beijing is trying to shape itself as a "potential peaceful founder" that has been shaped itself as a conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Global diplomatic influence.

After the United States and its allies cut off most of Russia's procurement trade, the relationship between China and Moscow was closer. As the largest buyer of Russia's oil and natural gas, Beijing has a strong economic influence on Moscow. At the same time, Beijing also regards Moscow as a diplomatic partner against the United States leading global affairs, and uses the status of the UN Security Council to transfer the international community's diplomatic attack on Russia.

At the same time as Sino -Russian relations are increasingly close, US -China relations have continued to deteriorate, and with the Chinese spy balloon incident in February this year, it has fallen into the bottom. U.S. Secretary of State Brosky was forced to cancel its original visit to China, and the relevant plans have not yet re -arranged.

However, China's highest diplomat Wang Yi and US national security adviser Jack Jack Sakali text held talks in Vienna, Austria on Wednesday and Thursday. According to the Chinese press release, the two sides conducted a discussion of "frank, deep, substantial, and constructive" on promoting Sino -US relations to "eliminate obstacles and stop falling stability".

Scholars of the participants focused on how regional allies should cooperate to maintain peace and stability in the Indo -Pacific region.

** Taiwan scholars: The United States should abandon the strategy blur **

At the meeting, Wang Hongren, Deputy CEO of the National Policy Research Institute of the Taiwan Think Tank, believes that the US strategic fuzzy policy should be changed because the purpose of strategic fuzzy is to obstacle China not to change the status quo of the Taiwan Straits one -sided, but according to China ’s recent cultural attacks against Taiwan Looking at it, the strategic blur does not seem to have the effect: "(Strategic fuzzy) goal has obviously failed."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-12T15-06-00-04-00/000002.png)Wang Hongren, Deputy CEO of the National Policy Research Institute of Taiwan Think Tank spoke at the meeting.(Video screenshot/CSIS)  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-05122023093625.html/screenshot-2023-05-12-145422.jpg)Wang Hongren believes that the Bayeng government also realized that the strategy was blurred and could not effectively stop the Chinese martial arts Taiwan, so Biden would openly stated four times that if China invaded Taiwan, the United States would conduct cooperative defense: "I think the United States leaders realize the strategy. Vagueness will lead to appeasement or disaster. Strategic blurring will pass the error message to Chinese leaders, so that Chinese leaders will mistakenly believe that in any circumstances, the United States will not intervene in the Taiwan Strait War. "

Wang Hongren suggested that the United States should establish a military alliance similar to the North Atlantic Convention in Asia, and cover Taiwan to effectively scare Chinese forces to invade Taiwan: "Such an alliance can make Chinese leaders think again and again, whether to be right? Taiwan or neighboring country moves martial arts? "

** Scholars: Strategic blurring makes American allies more willing to be on the same front as Taiwan **

In response to the issue of strategic fuzzy, Bonnylin, director of the China Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) China Power Project, expressed different views. Lin Yang believes that maintaining a strategy of Taiwan will encourage American allies to support Taiwan on Taiwan issues: "From the perspective of the United States, if you want to give Taiwan the most support, the best way is that the American allies also join Taiwan. Assistance; and if there are more vague space for American allies, they will be more willing to join. On the contrary, if we clearly propose a solution to assist Taiwan, I think this will make it difficult for many countries to join the ranks of helping Taiwan. "

** Aesthetic scholars: greater threats than North Korea China to the world **

At the meeting, Korean scholars questioned why the United States actively encouraged allies to have a clearer position on Taiwan's issue, but did not respond to the security issues brought by North Korea with the same positive attitude. In this regard, Lin Yang pointed out that the United States has not ignored the North Korean issue, but the US government has recently had more ink on the Taiwan issue because China is a great threat to the world.

Lin Yang said: "For the United States, China is a more threatened opponent. It is a global security concern. China also brings huge economic threats. From a global perspective, compared with North Korea, China has brought the United States to the United States. More challenges. Another thing to notice is that South Korea is quite prepared in the North Korean crisis, but Taiwan still needs to make more preparations. "

In the decades of competition on both sides of the strait, the development of the economy and the bitterness of the people's days have always been the focus of cross -strait comparison. The confrontation during the Cold War often promoted the other party to live a bitter life. After the reform and opening up, mainland China knew that Taiwan had already integrated into the global modern economic system and lived a wealthy life. However, with the opening of China in the past thirty years, Deng Xiaoping encouraged some people to get rich first. Taiwan seems to have an envious psychology for China. The advantages and disadvantages of the two sides of the strait system have continued to become a debate.

Until Xi Jinping came to power, many left -leaning actions were taken, and it seemed that it was possible to go back to the Mao Zedong route. He claimed that he wanted to reverse many of the disadvantages of the market economy, but including strict clearing, digital RMB, cracking down on private enterprises, strict management industries, agriculture, many practices, but the economy went downhill. However, China's powerful foreign propaganda still promotes that the Chinese people live a good life, and the wolf diplomatic diplomacy is still. The concept of "east -rising and west" has penetrated into the hearts of Chinese people. Writers from Sichuan are currently in Taiwan's "Internet celebrity"#来自 来自, in depth in the show, explaining the life experience on both sides of the strait, and how to understand the context of cross -strait competition for words.

After a Chinese diplomat attempt to threaten a Canadian politician and his family in Ottawa, and then decided to list him as an unpopular person, Beijing returned to his teeth, and China and Canada had a storm of mutual diplomats. The Chinese Canadian member became a nail in Beijing because he proposed a motion in Congress to condemn China for the rude treatment of his ethnic minorities.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-12T17-13-56-04-00/000000.png)Liu Ya's "Golden Gate Battle Review" old text segment [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05122023155241.html/@@images/image)Web image  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05122023155241.html/@@stream)Articles such as "High -level Cultivation", "Talent in the Army", and "Chinese Eagle" by the CCP's official media articles, etc. a feeling of. It even felt that not only did it damn itself, but the entire Chinese nation damned; the Communist Party, which is not democracy, is not free, and autocracy, and of course, the Communist Party, who has not done anything beneficial to the people;

The previous article in this column "Is Liu Asia really opposed to force attack?" "It has been introduced if he carefully discussed the article" Golden Gate Campaign "of Liu Asia, and it should not be concluded that Liu Asia opposed the conclusion of" force attack Taiwan "or" martial arts ". On the contrary, the masterpiece of Liu Asia 22 years ago was not precisely to promote "defeat in Taiwan". The purpose of the writing was to remind the entire party and the army, but also reminded that in the internal speech that "Taiwan must have a battle in Taiwan". Jiang Zemin, then general secretary of the Communist Party of China: "Only by seriously absorbing the blood of the battle of Kinmen can we stabilize the left coupon in the future battle of the Taiwan Strait."

However, in the critical article, Mao Zuo, Mao Zuo, Mainland China, rebuked the article "The entire" Golden Gate Battle Review ". "Fighting spirit", appreciated, fortunately.

The authors who wrote such a batch of Liu articles based on Liu Yaia have visited Golden Gate and "visited the memorial hall of others" as proof. Conclusion "The Golden Gate Battle of Liu Asia was cheering for the Jiang Bandit Army, cracking down on the morale of the PLA, and attempting to scare the pace of liberating Taiwan. After reading Liu's Golden Gate Campaign review, it feels like that the PLA can no longer be able to fight against the bandits and liberate Taiwan with force. Of course, you don't have to think about it. "

In fact, objective evaluation, Liu Ya's "Golden Gate Campaign Review" can expose some of the "dark sides" of the Chinese Communist Party's history and can be regarded as "anti -thief" as follows. More than 4,000 people, of which 3,000 were repatriated to the mainland by fishing boats in batches in 1952. These 3,000 people were expelled from the party and military, and returned to their hometown to plant land. Some people were designated as traitors and sentenced to prison. The Cultural Revolution. Among them, all three thousand people were criticized, and even farmers could not be spared. In their own words, they said: "Three days of suffering and suffering for thirty years. "After 1983, the restoration policy for this group of suffering soldiers was nothing but a little money, restoring the party, and dealing with military issues according to re -employment. Many of them were no longer in the world due to hungry, illness, criticism, and age. . The living people are over seventy years old, and Huafa flutter. This is the same life. The assistant of the assists Chen Zhiwen was unyielding after being captured. Review, for the restoration of the party, for more than 30 years of grievances, he was grown up. Due to excessive excitement, sudden heart disease, sudden death. Blessing has never enjoyed. Life is thin ... '. "

that is it!

Due to space limited, the author cannot analyze Liu Asia's "Golden Gate Campaign" in detail, but based on this, "can the left coupon in the future in Taiwan" It is a comment article "Military News Network" saying "Based on History as a lesson and frustration in the past." The

I have read all the Liu Zuo's articles in mainland China that can be searched online, and found that many of them are discussing the "argument" of the U.S. military in the "Golden Gate Battle Review" in Liu Asia. The aspirations of the enemy, destroy your own Will. "

In his "Kinmen Battle Review", Liu Yaa specifically reminded that "history is textbook. Historical experience is worth noting. In the future, I must do a good job in the third force in Taiwan."

Liu Yaia said: "This third force may be Japan, mainly the United States."

Please note that this sentence was written 22 years ago.

Nowadays, since the slogan of Japan's "something happened in Taiwan", the increasing deterioration of Sino -Japanese relations and the actual formation of the Asian "Little NATO" have made the world firmly believe that once the Taiwan Strait started war, Japan has nothing to be indifferent. However, the Sino -Japanese relations 22 years ago were just "honeymoons". At that time, Liu Asia had listed Japan as "the third force" of the CCP's fight against Taiwan in Taiwan, which was indeed foresight.

In addition, as early as 7 years ago, in October 2015, Liu Asia also published an article entitled "Seeing and Japanese Relations from the Diaoyu Islands". He wrote: The continuous confrontation between China and Japan will make China and Japan go further and further, and get closer and closer to the direction of war. Once China and Japan fall into a military conflict, there is only one choice for China, and it must be won without retreat.

When published this article, Liu Asia was practicing his strong army dream on the throne of his National Defense University Political Commissar. A few months after this article was published, Xi Jinping led all members of the Central Military Commission to the National Defense University. At that time, the CCP official media at that time also specially used the "How strong is the general Liu Asia?" "Published a special report on the title, specially distributed photos of Liu Yaia explained to Xi Jinping, in detail the published articles published by Liu Asia, known as" high -level gall "," talents in the army ", and" Chinese eagle ". Japanese relations, Sino -US relations, military reforms, etc., are more tough. At the same time, he will also make remarks about anti -corruption of the army, and the words are sharp. "

And just as the CCP media called Liu Asia and his important theoretical assistant at the then National Defense University, while calling the "Chinese Eagle", in the eyes of a group of Mao Zuo, he was completely opposite.

In our previous article, Liu Asia has introduced in his "Golden Gate Battle Review" and said: "I can assert that once the Taiwan Strait War broke out, the United States will inevitably participate in the war. There are four reasons: ① The 21st century that the United States has curbed China in the 21st century. The rise as the preferred goal. ② Taiwan has geopolitical conditions that the United States and Japan must value. ③ The United States' commitment to the security of Taiwan. ④ The value concept of Americans. It is not the United States if it does not interfere with the sovereignty of other countries. Yesterday, we learned the principle of "the power out of the gun in the gun" from Chiang Kai -shek. Today, we should learn the principle of "sovereignty in the gun" from the Americans. Prepare to fight against the U.S. military ... "However, it was obviously that Liu Yaia wrote here 22 years ago, and then joined the following paragraph: "In fact, in the several sets of the U.S. military that have formulated me to fight me, the third set of schemes are very similar to 'Kamika Fengfeng ', The original text is as follows: "Let China complete more than 200,000 people, and then suddenly intervene in regaining the production of air, sea right, and blocking the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese army was marching the Taiwan Army Siege. This solution can give China a great political blow, which is shocking and destroying the fighting will to fight the Chinese army in the mainland. "

22 years ago, did the United States have a few sets of "combat plans" to prevent the Chinese commitment and how Liu Yaia knew, but it was obviously what Liu Yaia said here. Strikes, the fighting will of the Chinese army that is shocked and destroyed in the mainland of the mainland, "made Mao Zuo and patriotic thieves unable to use it. It is believed that Liu Asia is "the ambition of growing enemies and destroying his own prestige." With the objective introduction and analysis of the strength of the U.S. military in other works of Liu Asia, the "upper limit of the outline", he has become the "fifth column" hidden in the army, the drum player with universal values, the Chinese army of the Chinese army, the Chinese army. The number one traitor, the leader of the lead party, and so on.

Since the news of Hong Kong's "might be sentenced to death" in Hong Kong earlier this year's Ming Dynasty, Mao Zuo immediately set off a climax of Liu again, a article published in "Hometown of Black", signed "Old Man Comment" " Looking back at Liu Asia ", at the beginning of this century, 20 years ago, Liu Asia's reputation rose, such as the middle and heaven, known as a thinker, strategist, and theorist. Although Liu's book is not officially published, there are printed products sold at several bookstores near the National University and Military Sciences. Some colleges and universities of the army are also "stolen" Liu's book for sale. You can also see.

The author of Liu, who claimed to be a "youth soldier" 20 years ago, recalled: I also read Liu Asia's article at that time, such as "Jiashen Re -Festival" and "Golden Gate Campaign Review". At that time, I was also young and impatient. Liu Asia's article is indeed smooth, abrupt, fascinating, and make people have an urge to read it. However, Liu Asia's remarks and the education we have previously received were not only in content, but also emotionally, positioning, and thinking methods, completely opposed and incompatible. After reading Liu Asia's article, I felt that the party history, military history, Maoxuan, and Marxist -Leninist philosophy I have learned before are completely wrong, outdated, and useless. At that time, I was still a young soldier. After reading Liu's article, I felt very desperate and felt like I was dying: not only did I feel damn, but I also felt that the entire Chinese nation was damn. There is no future and no meaning; the Communist Party is damn, a party that is not democratic, unwilling, or an autocracy, and a party that has not done anything to the people, of course, damn; Unable to stand up, there is no qualification to compare with the US military.

An article that makes people so frustrating, I think, it is not a good article. Jiashen re -sacrifice, wiping our ancestors whatever black and dark, there was nothing to do. The Kinmen Battle review, and the PLA was wiped out, and it was useless. At that time, the U.S. military was so "powerful". In Liu Ya's words, it would fight who he wanted to fight, and there were no opponents. The PLA is so small that no matter what aspect of it, is there any need for the U.S. military?

The "young soldiers" more than 20 years ago continued to criticize: In the Jiashen Re -Festival, Liu Yaia regarded Manqing as the savior of the Han and Chinese culture, and even the three slaughter of Yangzhou and Jiading, which became the reborn of Chinese culture. The necessary costs are not only criticized. On the contrary, we must also be grateful and grateful for the pavilion of the Qing people. Shocking -How can the senior general of the PLA have such ridiculous remarks? Moreover, it is still sought after, and hardly hear the sound of criticism.

In particular, when Liu Asia launched several aggressive wars such as Iraq, Afghanistan war, and Kosovo war in the United States, not only did not criticize the United States hegemony, but also said that such a great nation in the United States does not rule the world. A tone with the then Phoenix Satellite TV ... Although Chongyang Meiwai and the nation were self -prolonged at the time, it was rare to be as humble as Liu Asia, praising hegemonism, and praising Chinese enemies.

Based on this, the author of Liu strongly questioned: "If Liu (Asia), like a character of the Land Revolution, will he participate in the Land Revolution in the face of the powerful Kuomintang reactionary forces? Will he retire the party? Will he not rebel? If he was a senior general of the Kuomintang during the War of Resistance Against Japan, can he insist on the War of Resistance? Will he not surrender? Will he actively fight against Communist and negatively fight against Japan? If he is a senior general at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, he dares to Will he participate in the United States and Aid the DPRK? Will he support the United States and Aid the DPRK? I wonder. "

Not only was a large number of special batch of Liu Asia, but the "young soldiers" 20 years ago also put some "eagle factions" in the Chinese army and recognized by the CCP of Mainland China and the Chinese Army. He said: After Liu Ren's school's political commissar, a number of experts and scholars in the military had been known to the military. A major general is called the "Eagle School", but it also proposed that "saving the United States is to save China", from the National University of China; during the Russian and Ukraine War, it was said that Russia adopted a form of "abandoned by human civilization". The surname of the surname also came from the National University of China; the Americans had the help of aliens, and made China believe that it was favorable. This ridiculous style of Liu is not only not criticized, but also considered "eclectic use of talents."

The "Gongwen School" here undoubtedly refers to Gong Bin, his "cross -border" and "extraordinary" and which "Major General" once referred to "North Korea is a disaster in China", and the author will be under the column. The article is involved. The "patent owner" that "saving the United States is to save China" above should be Qiao Liang, a Professor of the Air Force of the PLA and a professor of the Air Force Command School.

On June 23, 2009, "Global Times" published the famous "Super Limited War" author Qiao Liang's theory "Save the United States is to save China." According to Qiao Liang: The increasingly strong national strength of China will inevitably promote the rise of domestic confidence. However, at this time, when talking about China's independent national and international strategy, it is actually a bit arrogant, because almost all domestic or foreign policies in China are deeply affected by the United States. Basically all policies must consider the US response. This is A stealth clue in my country's decision -making. China is still tied to the US economic circle. As the main product processing plant and product provider in the United States, China talks about the thinking of great powers. The strategy of the great country must consider the US factors. This is a kind of helplessness in China today.

For the above reasons, Qiao Liang believes that China now has to help the United States anyway, and the United States cannot collapse. In fact, saving the United States is to save China. This is a topic that we must face even if we hate itching. The reason why the United States crash is that the sinking of the American ship will drag the ships next to the sea. However, except for the United States, there is no big country today that can maintain or create a brand new international order. Only the United States still has this power and appeal now. Although the power of the United States has obviously weakened, it is still not alternative. No country can replace the United States today, and the US dollar is still the most valued currency in the world.The last sentence of Qiao Liang's article is: I can't be optimistic about the United States, but China still needs to be patient with the United States!(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

According to local residents and police, in many places in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Chinese authorities ban up most Uighurs pray in mosques and even homes during the Eid. The elderly in some areas are allowed to go to the local mosque during the police observation. The end of the end of the Islamic Ramadan. The recent death of Uighurs in the Thai refugee detention center has caused alertness of human rights groups. They call for better medical services and asylum procedures for Uighur refugees. The activists also demanded that the Uighurs were being held in the Thai immigration detention center. In this episode, we will learn more about the situation together.

According to sources, during the Eid of Eid on April 20th to 21st this year, people aged 60 and over were allowed to pray in the local mosque under the police closely monitoring.

Since 2017, China has restricted or prohibited the national customs and religious rituals of Uighurs, mainly Muslims, to eliminate "religious extremism".

Sources also said that during this year's most important Muslim festival, the Xinjiang authorities patrolled the streets of the city and searched their houses to prevent people from praying secretly at home.

An administrator at Yarkowruk, Aksu area, said a mosque there was open for prayer for Eid. The employee said,

"Our police go to the mosque to observe. I don't know if people need to obtain a permission to go to the mosque because I have never been there."

Similarly, an official of the local police station said that there was only one mosque in Bloom Township, Bon City, Bon City, but only when residents over 60 years old were willing to pray.

He added that the government issued a notice that people under the age of 60 cannot pray in Eid.

Police at the township police station said that there were only a dozen Uyghur elders who participated in the Eid of Eid in the mosque to the mosque. Three policemen and several auxiliary policemen observed and recorded the names of the Uighurs. The policeman said,

"Mosque was open yesterday, we went there to monitor the people there," he also added, he told residents under the age of 60 not to go to the mosque.

A local residents who required anonymous for safety reasons to tell Liberty Radio, the authorities destroyed almost all the mosques in Nilka and Kunes, so even if the government allowed people to pray during Eid, they I can't go to the mosque.

A staff member of the Aktope Police Station in TOKKUZTARA County told Radio Free Asia that residents, including the elderly, must not hold a festive prayer party at home, without exception.

A resident of Peyziwa, Kashgar area, told Radio Free Asia that she did not visit anyone to celebrate the Eid, nor was she prepared a special fried dough that the Uighurs had eaten during Eid.

A woman in the residential area of Belixi County, Malli County, Kashgar said that her neighbors or relatives did not hold Eid Prayer or Celebrate. She told Liberty Asia

"Mosque is not open. My husband is a police officer who works at Eid. There is no prayer here, very quiet."

In addition, after a Uyghur being detained in the Thai refugee detention center died, the human rights organization further called on the Thai authorities to provide better living conditions and medical services to Uighur prisoners and allow them to apply for shelter.

Mettohti MetQurban, 40 years old, is a Uighur refugee from Xinjiang, China. Recently, he died in Bangkok's detention center for suspected liver failure. This is the fifth place in Thailand since 2018. The Uyghur who died in the detention center was also the second -place Uighurs this year. According to reports, Abdul Ai Zizi Abu Dura(Abdul'ziz abdulla)Nearly 9 years after being detained in Thailand, he died of pneumonia at the same refugee camp in February this year.

While the Human Rights Organization requires the Thai government, while improving the conditions of the detention center, it will be held in a country with nearly 50 Uighur refugees in Bangkok's Suan PHLU immigration detention center.

Chalida Tajaroensuk, director of the Human Rights Organization of the Thai People's Power Foundation, said that the life and health of Uyghur refugees in the Thai detention center should attract attention because many people are sick but they are refused to give treatment.

Maritan died immediately after being discharged from the hospital. Although his death and the details of the disease were still unknown, the authorities knew these. Tagarian Suk recently told Liberty Asia.

"Because the local Muslim organization requires them to send doctors to treat patients and check their health, the detention center does not allow them to do so."

** Tagarian Suk ** ** said that the status of Uighur refugees is a subtle issue in Thailand, supervised by the National Security Council. **

** She pointed out, "They regard the Uyghur problem as a problem of excellent secrets and high sensitivity." By controlling the information of the detainees and deciding who can visit them, **** "Therefore, we can't know what happened in the detention center in the detention center. "**

** Radio Free Asia contacted the Thai Embassy in Washington, DC to obtain information about Matin's death, but did not receive a reply. **

Human rights observe that Chinese senior researcher Wang Songlian has called on the Thai authorities to abide by international law, release the detained Uighur refugees, and create conditions for them to easily apply for political asylum. Wang Songlian said,

"Unfortunately, they are now being held in a crowded detention center. The conditions there are fearful and inhumane. Therefore, they must have a way to apply for political asylum."

Like many other countries in Southeast Asia, Thailand has not yet approved the United Nations Refugee Convention. Uighurs are considered a special group that is managed by national security agencies and is prevented from registering to participate in the procedure of refugee identity.

World Uyghur Congress(WUC)And Uyghur Human Rights Project(Uhrp)In a statement issued on April 26th, it is reported that it has been reported that Maritan has suffered severe stomach pain and vomiting in the past few weeks. His condition deteriorated and jaundice symptoms.Uymel Konat, Executive Director of Uyghur Human Rights Project, said in a statement, "How many people will there be deaths before the Thai authorities have released humanitarian operations to release these are just innocent people who seeks the airport? These have been waiting for nine years in suffering, but the world has not extended a finger to save them. The refugees are very painful. "

According to the World and Uyghur Human Rights Project, Martarban is one of the 350 Uighurs who fled from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in 2011. They are worried that the Chinese government will persecutes the minority of Muslims and is arrested and detained by the Thai authorities. Essence They have been detained at the refugee detention center. Since March 2014, Martarban has been detained there.

These two organizations stated that in 2015, the authorities transferred about 170 Uighurs to Turkey, including the wife and three children of Martarban, and more than 100 men and women were expelled back to China. The move caused the United Nations Senior commissioner's condemnation.

The Human Rights Organization had previously called on the Thai authorities to take action against Uighur refugees. In 2022, more than 50 Uighurs called for long -term detention to Uighurs in Thailand.

According to reports, recent activists have requested the release of Uighurs being detained at the Thai immigration detention center, and related protests were held outside Thailand in Germany and American embassies and consulates.

On a quiet small street outside the Thai Consulate in Munich, Germany, Zum Reiki Zumretay Arkin raised his fist and shouted at the microphone.

"The freedom of the Uyghur!We want freedom!We want justice!We want freedom!Release the detained Uighurs!" Canadian Uyghur Alken shouted, about 20 demonstrators -some of them held East Turkistan Stan The blue and white crescent star flag -repeatedly responding to Elken's shout.

The protest was caused by the 40 -year -old Uyghur refugees Mettohti Metqurban died in April for suspected liver failure in the immigration center of the Suanphlu. He is the Fifth Uyghur that has been killed in the facility since 2018, and the second Uyghur this year.

On May 5th, Uyghur activities in four cities in Germany and the United States gathered outside the Thai consulate and embassy, asking this Southeast Asian government to improve the conditions for Uighur refugees detained in Thailand.

The protesters also required the Thai authorities to allow UN human rights officials to contact them and release them. At the same time, they cooperated with the third countries to reorganize refugees and let them reunite with their families.

About 30 Uighurs held the East Turkestan banner and slogan, gathered outside the Thailand's capital Washington Embassy, and asked Uighur refugees.

The US Uyghur Association Chairman Elfidal Ilt Bayer said in a letter sending to the Thai ambassador to the United States: "Detention Uighurs refugees, especially their homes, are racial extinction, infringing the core values of international human rights and Thailand. , Especially the values of morality, generosity, integrity, and serving public interests.

The Chinese government has strengthened video surveillance and inspections of the Tibetan capital Lhasa and its surrounding street hawkers to work hard to clean up the city. Although sources inside the autonomous region said that these measures were designed to let the Tibetan vendors leave the streets, and pointed out that the Chinese government is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng is Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng is in Try to deprive many of these hawkers' only sources of income. It is understood that the police continued to harass the teachers of the former Tibetan school in Qinghai Province. Although the school was closed in July 2021, the police were still paying attention to their actions. In addition, overseas Tibetans have recently rally supported the Dalai Lama, and the protesters asked the media to apologize to slandering the Tibetan Buddhist spirit leader. In this episode, let's take a closer look at the relevant situation together.

Sources who refused to disclose their names for security reasons said that the Tibetan hawkers on the Lhasa street became the goal in the "cleaning" street movement. Local authorities started the "cleaning up Lhasa" campaign in this city with about 560,000 people on March 20. They It is checking all street vendors around Jokhang Temple and its surrounding them.

The Tibetans believe that the four -story Buddhist temple in Batta Plaza in Lhasa is the most sacred and most important temple in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

A Tibetan in the area said that the Chinese authorities also prohibit the sale of ravioli (a Tibetan food made from green crickets, sand -dried cloths or dried yaks and mutton) and other Tibetan vendors who claim that they do not have the appropriate food badge , The person told Liberty Asia,

"Although the Chinese government hinted that the movement aims to keep the cleaning of Lhasa, it can be seen that in this movement, only Tibetan vendors are the goals of the authorities."

The sources also added that the authorities also asked the Tibetan street hawkers to stop selling Tibetan song discs and interrogated them for no reason. He said, he said,

"This has caused a lot of trouble for Tibetans who lived on streets."

Before the commemorative anniversary of the political sensitivity, Lhasa and other major towns have strengthened safety measures. During this period, the police randomly checked whether individuals were contacted with their mobile phones.

Tibetan scholar and Gyal Lo, author of "The Community Structure of Tibet Society: Education, Society and Spirituality" published in 2021, said

"In the end, in all these movements, the Chinese government wants to eradicate or eliminate any local or enterprises that unite the friendship between Tibet brothers,", ",

According to the information on the Lhasa Police website, so far, the authorities have interrogated nearly 30 street hawkers during the "Cleaning Lhasa" campaign and will continue to check

Essence Another Tibetan insider said,

"Some street hawkers continue to sell things because this is their livelihood."

He said that other people who tried to fight against the Chinese authorities had been detained, but there was no information about the arrested or their detention.

People familiar with the matter also said: "The Chinese government tries to take the only sources of the only revenue of these Tibetan hawkers in the guise of the Chinese government."

Xiang Xiaoji, a Chinese lawyer in New York, said that a possible motivation for the movement is that, in view of Lhasa is a tourism center, the Chinese government hopes to maintain its statement of promoting Tibet's economic development. Xiang Xiaoji told Liberty Asia,

"They don't want tourists to see Tibetans on the street as hawkers. They want to depict Tibetans to live a beautiful and financially satisfied life."

In addition, Tibetan sources said that the Chinese authorities have always harassed co -founders and teachers who worked in private schools in Tibetan courses in Qinghai Province. The school was closed in July 2021.

The authorities closed the Sengdruk Taktse in Dari County, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai. This is a wider range of banning the promotion of Tibetan culture and providing Tibetan teaching schools.

According to Radio Free Asia, the students there at that time were told that the Chinese government school affiliated to the area of the Chinese course was told.

The two sources who refused to disclose their names for security reasons said that the authorities have been monitoring and hunting the school's co -founder Khenpo Jigmey Kunga Gyaltsen and the teachers who taught there. A Tibetan from Tibet said,

"Since the Chinese government has closed the Lion Dragon Palace Temple Civil Affairs Middle School in 2021, the location has not been used. All teachers and affiliated staff of the school have been summoned to the police station for interrogation and strictly reviewed. Who will meet. "

An exile Tibetan who understands the situation says that most of the students of the school have attended the school run by the Chinese government. The person familiar with the matter said,

"Initially, when the government forcibly closed the Shilong Palace School, they said that they would still use school buildings for education purposes under the supervision of the Chinese government, but it was almost two years, and the school was still idle."

The Chinese government closed many private schools in Tibet from 2020 to 2021, and banned students from paying the cost of foreign Tibetan language and Buddhist courses.

About three weeks after the authorities closed the Shilong Palace school, they detained Rinchenqin, who had taught the second and third grades on the grounds of mental illness, and sent her to the hospital. According to Radio Free Asia earlier, she was later accused of inciting divisionism and was arrested at home, but was finally released in August 2022.

Faced with the rule of the Chinese population in most China, the Chinese authorities often put forward allegations of divisionism on Tibetans who advocate the protection of Tibetan language and culture.

The forced closure of the Tibetan private school has exacerbated the concern of the free space for Tibetans to exercise their language and religious beliefs for decades.

Sources said that in recent years, language rights have become a special concern for Tibet's efforts to maintain national identity. Informal language courses held in temples and towns are regarded as "illegal associations", and teachers have been detained and arrested.

In addition, Tibetan demonstrators have recently held a rally in Europe, the United States, India, and Australia to protest the negative reports of the media's video of the Dalai Lama asking a Indian boy to suck tongue.

On February 28, a video of a Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader hugged and kissed the little boy's videos in the student activities in northern India, and caused criticism and accusations on the Internet on social media.

The 87 -year -old Dalai Lama later apologized to the boy's family. The Tibetans quickly came forward to defend him, explaining that it was a manifestation of greetings or respect in their culture.

More than 2,000 Tibetans and their supporters rally in Switzerland asked local media to misunderstand videos to apologize to the Dalai Lama. The activist contacted a news agency that agreed to investigate the matter.More than 300 Tibetans and Indian supporters gathered in Bangalore, India, asking news agencies to apologize. On April 15, about 15,000 people gathered in Radaka. The region was managed by India and was part of the Kashmir region. For decades, it has been the theme of disputes between India, Pakistan and China.

On April 14, the Youth Department of the Radak Buddhist Association issued a statement in Kagil, Dalai Lama, the leader of the Tibetan Buddhist spirit, and said, "We are loyal followers of the 14th Dalai Lama, and for many, many of them are many, and many of them are many. News and media portal websites deliberately disseminated the promotional video editing, and the impeccable character and status of the 14th Dalai Lama's impeccable character and status are deeply felt sad and shocked with defamation and slander. "

One of the four major inheritance of Tibetan Buddhism Karma Karko's highest religious leader Karmapa Great Pharaoh Kingskinki said that when the Dalai Lama meets with people, "he speaks with them without any reservation or alertness, so he will be alert, so he will be alert. It seems that they are friends for many years and treat them kindly. "

In a statement issued by the king of Karmapa on April 12: "Sometimes the Dalai Lama can drag others' beard, or scratch their itch, or pat their cheeks or nose gently. This is What he usually looks like is nothing more than the sincere joy and love of the Dalai Lama for others. "

Tibetans who live in the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China and Tibetan regions in China, as well as Tibetans who live abroad believe that the Chinese authorities have used this video to make the Dalai Lama a shadow. A Tibetan Tibetan who refused to disclose the name for security reasons in the area said,

"Tibetans in Tibet have already seen and heard these video clips on various social media. It is gratifying to see photos of the Dalai Lama His Holiness, but at the same time, see how the Chinese government uses this And manipulating the playful video interaction between the Dalai Lama and the Indian boy, it is heartbreaking.

Radio Free Asia cannot independently verify the statement of promoting video editing on social media.

Another Tibetans who did not want to disclose their names for the same reason said that many Tibetans in Tibet did not publicly comment on the video. Due to the close surveillance and suppression of the Chinese authorities in the region, they knew that it would be dangerous. The news was the news. People say,

"The Chinese government will trace individuals and punish them. They will be sentenced to three to four years in prison."

In addition, the Australian parliamentarians met with the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama in northern India. They discussed the threat of the Chinese Communist Party government to Tibet.

The Australian Parliament Cross -Party Parliament, which has recently met with the Dalai Lama, supports the four -person delegation of the Tibetan group that the Chinese government will continue to support the protection of Tibet's language and culture in the case of Tibetan language and cultural rights.

At a press conference, "(this visit) is taken on the road to stabilize the relationship between China and Australia. One step ... I came here to create a way to make the trade and economic relations between Australia and China normally. "

With the gradual stability of China -Australia's diplomatic relations, Beijing allowed four Chinese companies to be transported into Australian coal in January, and the two countries have now fully restored coal trade.

Earlier on Friday, Farrell told Wang Wentao in the opening speech of the 16th Ministerial Economic Joint Conference: "We can see the benefits of the" China -Australia Free Trade Agreement "to Australian Chinese enterprises and consumers in 2015 ","

After the meeting with Wang Wentao, Farrell said: "I am very happy to confirm that we agree to strengthen dialogue under the free trade agreement and other platforms to solve the problem that has not been resolved."

Farrer also revealed that he had issued an invitation to Australia to Wang Wentao, and Wang Wentao accepted the proposal.

China will restrict the losses of Australian coal, red wine, barley, lobster and other products. However, since the Labor government came to power in May 2022, Australia -China relations have been gradually repaired.

This is the first face -to -face meeting since the Minister of Trade of China and Australia since 2019.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-12T7-02-07-00-00/000000.png)Agence France -Presse reported that Agent's theme action film "Pathaan) was sold in India in January this year, which not only broke the local box office record, but also attracted the world's One fan.

However, since Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971, the authorities have been lobbying by domestic producers. As a result, Indian films are prohibited from being released in China, although India's position in the Bangladesh's independence war is to support Bennes.

18 -year -old Sazzad Hossain interviewed outside the cinema in Daka, "I am so excited because Bangladesh has finally been released for the first time."

He also said: "We are all fans of Sharuchan. I can watch his movie through the big screen for the first time."

Because of its low quality, Bangladesh's national films cannot attract fans to watch it, and the number of well -known movie stars that are only younger than Shakib Khan.

Some movie theaters must even secretly play illegal pornographic films to maintain operations, but in the past 20 years, more than 1,000 cinemas are closed, some are converted into shopping malls, and some are changed to apartments.

It was the most luxurious movie theater "Modhumita Cinema Hall", which was posted on the door with the latest Bangladesh movie poster, but a group of heroin addicts was sitting in front.

A cinema employee said, "I haven't seen such a poor number for many years. There are only a few rows. These national films are too bad, and no one wants to watch."

The Bangladesh authorities tried to relieve the Indian film ban in 2015, allowing the cinema to show two popular Bollywood movies "WANTED" and "three fools" (3idiots ", but after being protested by domestic movie stars, the theater was being protested. Forced to stop screening.

The Bangladesh government finally issued a decree last month, allowing 10 movies in India or South Asian countries each year to be released in China.

"The Jedi Agent of Bollywood" was released in 41 cinemas in Bangladesh. The filmmaker revealed that many movie tickets in Daka have been sold out for a long time.
