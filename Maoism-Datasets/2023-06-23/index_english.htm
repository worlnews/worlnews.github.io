<p>Ireland's "public opinion consultation" starts from the southern city of Cork today. Tomorrow will be held on Galway on the West Coast, and then ended in the capital Dublin on the 26th and 27th.</p>
<p>The debate about whether Ireland joined the Northern Atlantic Organization (NATO) not only stimulates people's emotions, but also changes the routes that have followed by previous governments since World War II.</p>
<p>Irish President Michael D. Higgins condemned the government last week to ask this issue. Presidential President's position is politically belonging to the role of etiquette.</p>
<p>Higgins recently said in an interview with the Irish newspaper "Sunday Businesspost" that Ireland was at a "most dangerous moment" in foreign policy, and said that Ireland's current position "follow the waves."</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister Leovaradkar faded the impact of this forum on the discussion on neutral issues. He told the Irish House on the 20th that the public opinion was "no hidden agenda" and will have a wide range of national defense issues.</p>
<p>Varadka told the House of Representatives: "We know what our policy is. We will not join NATO or any other military alliance. We will invest in my country's defense forces."</p>
<p>At present, about 1,200 people have registered to participate in the debate and put forward more than 300 opinions. At that time, the opinions of international security experts, civic society and non -governmental organizations will be heard.</p>

<h3>Brinton Hui Jinping: China and the United States resumed the "lip, gun tongue sword" before and after the recovery of high -level visits after five years</h3>

<p>Xi Jinping (middle) meeting with Brinden (left) in the Fujian Hall in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing attracted widespread discussion.</p>
<p><strong> U.S. Secretary of State AntonyBlinken ended the first visit to China for the first five years in China after meeting Xi Jinping, the Chinese President Xi Jinping, and transferred to the UK to visit, but the discussion about China was not over. </strong></p>
<p>The last time the US Secretary of State visited China and met Xi Jinping dates back to June 2018, Pompeo visited China twice in June and October of that year, but the second visit did not see Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>In the two -day visits of Brinken, both China and the United States proposed to have a stable relationship, but the United States seemed to be able to restart military communication channels. China emphasizes that the United States should "reflect" for the stalemate of the current bilateral relations, and there are nothing more important among the issues of Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>After Brinken left China, US President Joebiden first described US -China relations on the "correct track", and then publicly criticized Xi Jinping as a "dictator" after one day, which once again attracted strong criticism in Beijing.</p>
<p>Although it is generally commented that Brinken's visit to China has taken an important step in restoring the healthy development of bilateral relations, many observers pointed out to the BBC that whether it can truly return to normal is still to be carefully observed.</p>

<p>The meeting between Blintken and Xi Jinping was announced about an hour before the held.</p>
<p>From the moment Brinton launched the plane at the Beijing Capital Airport on June 18, both Chinese netizens and overseas observer are paying attention to what he is treated -there is no red carpet on the apron, only the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chang Yang Tao's pick -up; Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on the "strict stance and clear requirements" on the Taiwan issue "clarifying a strict position and making clear requirements"; Wang Yi, director of the Foreign Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "asked the United States to stop the hype of the" Chinese threat "and cancel illegal unilateral sides of China. Sanctions, abandoning the development of Chinese science and technology, and not allowing China to interfere with China's internal affairs. "</p>
<p>By the afternoon of the 19th, the outside world learned that Xi Jinping was determined to meet Brinkeit. In the 35 minutes of the Fujian Hall in the Great Hall of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping sat alone in the center of the long table, and the left and right officials were officials. Observer and even netizens have retrieved photos of the former US Secretary of State, such as Mikepompeo, Rex Tillerson, and John Kerry, and found that this move has never been seen. Former Minister of the Interior, current affairs commentator Xu Guoyong <a href="https://www.ftvnews.com.tw/news/detail/2023620W0346">even described it as "dynasty -style faces"</a>Essence</p>
<p>Former US State Department East Asia and Pacific Affairs Assistant Secretary of State State Steve, Brid Gen Davidstilwell, said to BBC: "Both sides are still saying those notch and itchy statements, saying that they seek balanced relationships, but when he got off the plane, he only got lower -level than him to get off the plane. Many people receive, this visual effect is a strong information for the purpose of humiliation. "</p>
<p>"The heavier is Xi Jinping's setting at the top of the table. The Chinese sitting on one side, the United States sitting on the other side, basically like a subordinate, Xi Jinping is like meeting with these people. Go down. "</p>
<p>Steve said: "No one has seen diplomatic arrangements like this. This is completely non -standard."</p>
<p>Professor Prof Shirleyyu, a senior visit researcher at the London School of Political Economics (LSE) and the director of China -Africa Project, described in an interview with the BBC connection. This time, Xi Jinping appeared in the center of the conference hall to look at the transcendent status of foreign officials between China and the United States.</p>

<p>Netease's self -media article described that the meeting between Xi Jinping and Brinken was held in the Fujian Hall, and the background oil painting of the Fujian Hall is "Wuyi Spring". "This hint should be very clear. The core interests, there is no room to talk about. "</p>
<p>According to the official website of the National People's Congress of China, since the era of Deng Xiaoping's main administration, the Fujian Hall is the place where the CCP's top leaders have met with foreign guests.</p>
<p>On Weibo, a Heilongjiang user believes that the layout in the Fujian Hall "must give him a psychological impact, which not only makes him feel flattered and strongly suppressed." A Guangdong netizen said: "Our leaders sitting in the sites sitting in In the middle of the table, Brinken is sitting like our minister's work. I hope it can be a bit memorable. "</p>
<p>A Zhejiang netizen believes that there is no red carpet on the airport's apron, but there is a red line.</p>
<p>Chinese official media clicked the lotus in the center of the conference table. Xinhua News Agency's Weibo post: "At present, it is the season of lotus in full bloom. The harmonic sound of 'lotus' and 'harmony' and 'co -founding'. We look forward to the peaceful coexistence of China and the United States to coexist and win -win cooperation."</p>

<p>China sent Yang Tao (middle) to welcome Brinken (right) at the airport at the airport, and the gap between the two official steps was obvious.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Jialuo, an associate professor at the Department of Political and International Relations at the Hong Kong Baptist University, believes that Beijing will minimize the expectations of the world this time, and China receives Brinken as "doing for doing".</p>
<p>Chen Jialuo said to BBC in Chinese: "I don't think I need to use some feudal expressions -like 'emperor' or 'high -end' -I believe this is very simple. In China’ s face culture, this time in Beijing, Beijing Obviously, do n’t give the Foot American face. Through these large or small actions, you want to pass such information to the United States: if you come, it does n’t mean that we are smooth sailing. Its line, 'walking and looking at' depends on how far everyone wants to repair the relationship. "</p>
<h3>"dictator" theory with the military contact in place</h3>
<p>After the meeting with Xi Jinping on the 19th, Bayen, who attended the campaign in California, was asked if he was asked if he was talking to Bollingken](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/19/remarks-by-president-biden-in-press-gaggle-13/)Essence Biden said that he only learned about the situation through the White House national security consultant, Jake Sullivan, praised Brinken's performance, and said, "We have been on the right way."</p>

This has attracted a strong response from Beijing.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference on the 21st: "The United States is extremely ridiculous about his speech, is extremely irresponsible, seriously violates basic facts, seriously violates diplomatic etiquette, and seriously violates Chinese political dignity. Strong dissatisfaction, resolute opposition. "</p>

<p>Biden said Xi Jinping was a "dictator", and also said that he didn't know the earlier spy balloon.</p>
<p>On Twitter (Twitter), some US netizens questioned that Biden "changed his mouth" to criticize Xi Jinping, in fact, it was because of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtvdmGENnOh/">Son Hunter Biden "</a>The news of the crime of charges such as tax illegal and drug abuse and the holding of guns holding a gun, so we must transfer the attention of public opinion. But this action still attracted questions about Biden's ability.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted Professor Wu Xinbo, the dean of the International Institute of International Issues and the Director of the American Research Center of Shanghai Fudan University, said: "Biden's big mouth likes nonsense." But he did not think that this would make Brinken's efforts to the east.</p>
<p>Sun Yun, the director of the Chinese project of the Washington Think Tank Stimsoncenter, also said to Reuters: "I bet Washington wants to make it quietly dilute, and China does not want a small question to do it, which will cause the bilateral summit in November and Biden in November."</p>
<p>The United States will host the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leader summit in San Francisco in November. Before Brinton set off to Beijing, Biden publicly stated that "I hope I will meet Xi Jinping again in the next few months."</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Jialuo of the Hong Kong Baptist University does not think that Biden, who is seeking re -election, described Xi Jinping as a "dictator".</p>
<p>Chen Jialuo said to BBC in Chinese: "Once Bayeng talked about the Chinese issue during the campaign, it is easy to return to its dual world thinking, that is, different regimes have its essential differences. China and Russia will be regarded as For this so -called democratic camp led by the United States, or the main competitive object, "</p>
<p>"This will affect the future Sino -US relations, so that the US foreign policy."</p>

<p>The Chinese official was published in the order of the conversation between China and Bronken's dialogue, and its tone seemed to have been changing repeatedly.After Biden made a "dictator" speech, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/wjdt_674879/sjxw_674887/202306/t20230621_11101653.shtml">morning on the 21st</a>Yang Tao also criticized the United States on the evening of the 19th to criticize the United States on Taiwan's position, saying that the United States "tampered with its political commitment."</p>
<p>Official China Central Television <a href="https://news.cctv.com/2023/06/19/ARTIEg4RT2y1FSMWCAGOVjip230619.shtml">early night on the 19th</a>It has been reported that Yang Tao blowing the content, but in addition to mentioning "the two sides have reached some positive consensus and achievements", it is the five "key explanations" that China criticized the United States:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The root cause of Sino -US relations falling into the trough is that the United States has a wrong recognition of China. This situation does not meet the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, nor does it meet the common expectations of the international community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sino -US relations have gone through twists and turns. It is necessary for the United States to reflect deeply, maintain the political foundation of Sino -US relations, and deal with accidental occasional incidents in calmness, professional, and rational treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The priority is to truly implement the consensus of the head of state in Bali of the two countries, reverse the spiral decline of Sino -US relations, and promote the return of health and stable tracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urges the United States not to use the template of the "National Qiang Bit" to mirror China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue of Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk. It urges the United States to clearly oppose "Taiwan independence", stop hype "Chinese threat theory", cancel "illegal unilateral sanctions against China ", Abandon the development of China's science and technology, must not interfere with China's internal affairs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Professor Wang Yong, a professor at the School of International Relations of Peking University, said in an interview with BBC that Brinken held a long meeting with China, "it should still have achieved certain results."</p>
<p>Professor Wang Yong said: "I think for both parties, to improve their understanding of each other and increase mutual trust, there are many benefits. From this perspective, the highest diplomats between the two countries sit down and talk about it. ","</p>

<p>While Bollingin visited China, the USS Ronald Reagan passed the South China Sea.</p>
<p>However, the five consensus reached by Brinken still did not include restarting communication between the Chinese and American military. Former Deputy Assistant Minister of Strategy and Military Development of the Ministry of Defense, Elbridge Colry, founder of the Marathoninitiative, commented on the BBC.</p>
<p>After Brinken left Beijing, <a href="http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0621/c1001-40018273.html">CCTV</a>And <a href="https://tv.cctv.com/2023/06/20/VIDEOEe99aEJ7NWKrxULoKfU230620.shtml">the Communist Party of the People's Daily</a>Two days a long time reported "The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to publicize the advanced deeds of the Air Force Air Force's two flights to the two teams of the Air Force and award them.

At present, it is impossible to confirm whether the activities of the H-6K fighter fleet and the Liden battle group are intersecting.</p>
<p>As Brinken left Beijing, Sarahberan, senior director of the White House National Security Conference, said publicly that resumed dialogue between the two armies was the "absolutely critical way to manage the competition between the two countries and conduct crisis communication.</p>
<p>"We are still willing to meet at various levels (with the Chinese military) and urge China to give appropriate responses at various levels (with the Chinese military)."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blinken-xi-china-talks-military-communication/">Brinken said before leaving Beijing to the United States Colombia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS)</a>: "This is a matter of doing things. This is what we need to do for the interests of the two countries. Not only the establishment, rebuilding and strengthening the communication line between our government ... But one of the important parts is the military's pair Military (Communication). "</p>
<p>"We all agree that each other hopes that at least it can ensure that they will not make conflicts inadvertently because of misunderstandings."</p>

<p>China and the United States have recently accused each other due to the "Cuban Spy Station" dispute.</p>
<p>In 2018, the United States issued a sanctions order to the current Chinese Defense Minister, the current Minister of Defense, the current Minister of Defense in Russia, which seemed to be [early June] <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65788097">early June</a>US Secretary of Defense Llaydaustin sought the main obstacles to meeting Li Shangfu during the Shangri -La dialogue. So, can the sanction of Li Shangfu create conditions for breaking through the deadlock?</p>
<p>Kobberg, who participated in the Shangri -La dialogue in Singapore, said to BBC: "This is possible. I personally don't think that the Minister of Defense, which sanction in China, is a good idea. China is a powerful country and naturally needs to be treated appropriately."</p>
<p>"But I think a bigger problem is that based on unknown reasons, in fact, I want to use the attempt to alleviate the relationship between the Biden government ... so I think this is a very dangerous situation for the United States."</p>
<p>Former American Assistant Secretary of State State believes that the reason why Brinken failed to make progress in the dialogue between the two armies, "because China does not want to (communicate with the U.S. military), and we have not allowed them to talk to us.""We didn't chase them. They felt that they were ready and came to the door. They could only be like this with this group of people (China). They were not as much as we value these dialogues."</p>

SpalDing <a href="https://twitter.com/robert_spalding/status/1670744193281449985">Questions on Twitter</a>: "Xi Jinping is willing to see Brinton only two reasons: one is that he is eager to recover his economic recovery, and the other is what he wants to give by the Bayeng government."</p>

<p>The United States has adopted additional tariffs on imported goods from China during its administration to protect the US employment market, but experts and scholars have questioned their results.</p>
<p>Professor Wang Yong said to BBC: "What is the final result of the trade war with China? More than 90%of extra tariffs are borne by Americans, and American people are unlucky ... The inflation rate in the United States is high, this It is also harmful to the economic interests of the United States, which is very clear. "</p>
<p>Professor Yu Ze believes that trade protectionism such as tariffs may continue to be the mainstream of Washington.

<p>Dr Sarahsu, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Tennesi, Dr. Xu Sarahsu, commented to the BBC international desk that Brinton's visit to China still explained that the Bayeng government's position has softened to some extent. " However, I think there are still a lot of eagle factions in the government, and they do not want to soften their positions in China. Therefore, the Bayeng government has more coordination between representatives of Eagle and his desire to improve China. "</p>
<h3>Taiwan problem re -express</h3>
<p>After meeting with Xi Jinping, Blingken said that he reiterated from the Chinese government to the "one China" policy of Washington, and did not support Taiwan's independence. He did not want to change the status quo on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>

<p>"The United States has a trend now, which will solve the peace of Taiwan with the" Policies of the One China "as the core content of the" One China Policy ". This is not the reiteration and persistence of the US political commitment to the United States, but tampering with tampering."</p>
<p>Prior to this, Xinhua News Agency said that Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang stated to Brinken that "Taiwan's issue is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue of Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk."</p>

<p>In April, a few hours after Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen returned from the United States, the Chinese People's Liberation Army carried out three days of military exercises.Wang Yong, a professor at Peking University, compare Taiwan's issue with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He believes that the Taiwan issue is the "red line in the red line" in Beijing, and the war of Russia and Ukraine has brought "catastrophic impact" to Europe and the world.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we cannot let the Sino -US battle out of control. In the Asia -Pacific region, such a tragedy, especially in the United States, should give up the Taiwan issue as a piece of chess to curb China's development. One of the legal rights and interests of China's core interests. "</p>
<p>"I don't think it is an excessive requirement for the United States. In fact, it is a very reasonable requirement. To deal with the Taiwan issue, it is also very good for the status and influence of the United States in the Asia -Pacific region."</p>

<p>Taiwan Foreign Minister Wu Zhaozheng said in an exclusive interview with the BBC recently that the tensions on both sides of the strait "may affect other parts of the world."</p>
<p>Taipei welcomed Brinken's statement to China. <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=95&amp;sms=73&amp;s=114947">Taiwan Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 20th</a>: "The peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is the core of the security and prosperity of the Indo -Pacific region. The Chinese government will continue to deepen the relationship with the United States and security, jointly defend the international order based on rules, and promote the peace, stability and prosperity of the Taiwan Strait and Indo -Pacific regions. "</p>
<p>Zheng Wencan, deputy dean of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, also said that the relationship between Taiwan and the United States will not be affected by Blint's visit to China, and all cooperation will be on the track.</p>
<p>Kobeji, the founder of the "Marathon initiative", believes that Brinken's statement on Taiwan's issue is appropriate; Professor Bai Jiexi of the University of Cornell University in the United States said: "I expect the United States to represent the risk of risks of military hostility worldwide. If China takes the initiative, it will not only endanger the global economy, but also endanger China's own sustainable growth and modernization. "</p>
<p>Both Taiwan and the United States have entered the election ticket period. How will this affect the development of Sino -US relations centered on the situation of the Taiwan Strait? Dr. Chen Jialuo of the Hong Kong Baptist University pointed out that from the perspective of the United States, polls show that whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican supporters, whether it is the issue of Taiwan or other Chinese human rights issues, their attitude towards China is negative. No matter who entering the White House, mutual suspicion between China and the United States will make the wrestling of the two countries the main axis of bilateral relations in the next few years.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) Chinese e -commerce leader Alibaba announced this week that Taiwanese Cai Chongxin, a Taiwanese, who is also the owner of the New York Net Team, will take over its huge career territory and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/阿里巴巴将换帅-马云再有高论/a-65980411">and serve as the director of Alibaba Long position</a>This is considered to be an important measure of Alibaba who managed to save the situation to reverse the slow growth and reorganization of business.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Cai Chongxin, the current executive vice chairman of Alibaba, will take over the chairman of the chairman in September. The current chairman and chief executive officer Zhang Yong will step down and lead the cloud intelligent department that the group spin -off. Cai Chongxin is one of Alibaba's largest personal shareholders and owns 1.4%of the issued shares of the company.</p>
<p>In addition, Cai Chongxin is a supporter and investor in blockchain technology. Therefore, his new role will push cryptocurrencies to the top of Alibaba's e -commerce business and may pave the way for payment innovation.</p>
<p>After the reorganization is completed, Cai Chongxin will take charge of Alibaba's diversified interest holding companies, as well as retaining e -commerce business control to the company's core business entities, including Taobao and Tmall.</p>
<h3>Unique Taiwan and American background</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T07-20-00Z/65663018_401.jpg" />The Chinese e -commerce market is facing fierce competition. The picture shows a female consumer in Zhejiang in 2019 using Alipay's face recognition technology (data photo)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Cai Chongxin was born in Taiwan and graduated from Yale University in the United States. He has served as a lawyer and private equity investor. He co -founded Alibaba with Ma Yun in 1999, served as the chief financial officer, and was promoted to the executive vice chairman in 2013.</p>
<p>In addition to Taiwan's background, Cai Chongxin has a passport in Hong Kong and Canada at the same time. Although he was criticized in the United States for some controversial issues because of supporting Beijing's position, Cai Chongxin's close connection with the United States was not common among Chinese business leaders today.</p>
<p>In 2018, he purchased the equity of the US NBA Nets. In addition, he also controlled the American Professional Hockey Team: San Diego SEA, and the American professional women's basketball team: New York Liberal Team.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" reported that Zhang Yi, chief executive officer of Guangzhou Ai Media Consulting, said, "Alibaba is likely to transform into a financial holding company, just like the direction adopted by many large consortia in the past."</p>
<p>"Cai Chongxin's main career is related to finance and strategic investment, so his ability and experience are very suitable for the new stage," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<h3>Alibaba grows slowly</h3>
<p>"Wall Street Journal" reported, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/避免中國監管打壓-螞蟻金服脫鉤阿里巴巴/a-62214059">Alibaba's reorganization and coach</a>It has made the company more flexible for many years. As China's economic growth has slowed down, and competition from e -commerce platforms such as Pinduoduo and Douyin has intensified, Alibaba is now developing slowly.</p>
<p>Alibaba's market value reached its peak at the end of 2020, exceeding $ 850 billion, but before the leadership was announced, the market value had dropped to about $ 238 billion. In addition, Alibaba's income growth rate has grown slowly in the first quarter of this year, which is one of the lowest levels since the company was listed in 2014.</p>
<p>Alibaba's diversified business will be divided into 6 major doors, namely: cloud computing, Chinese e -commerce, global e -commerce, digital maps and take -out, logistics, and media and entertainment departments.</p>
<p>This reorganization can also keep Alibaba founder Ma Yun's actual influence on the company. Because most of the year before the plan was announced, Ma Yun personally planned the reorganization of the e -commerce empire abroad.</p>
<p>According to people familiar with the matter, last month, Ma Yun met with the executives of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce of Alibaba to discuss the increasingly fierce competition of the company. People familiar with the matter said that he urged the department to revise its business strategy and governance and said that Alibaba's successful strategy may not be applicable.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T07-20-00Z/64312741_401.jpeg" />Alibaba founder Ma Yun attended an event in Hong Kong in 2016 (data photo)</p>
<h3>Analysts look at the reorganization: the correct approach is correct</h3>
<p>Tim Culpan, a Bloomberg columnist, believes that investors will face a choice in any department of the 6 departments under Alibaba Group: to pursue profit or growth rate. As far as the current situation is concerned, none of these six departments have a way to provide these two goals at the same time.</p>
<p>Karpan believes that Cai Chongxin's helm should help stabilize the ship of Alibaba Group. With each of Alibaba's split departments operating independently, the parent company will do much less than in the past.</p>
<p>"Wall Street Journal" reported that Chinese investment institutions "86Research" (86research) focused on Charliechai, an analyst of the technology industry, believes that this reorganization shows that Ma Yun is returning to Alibaba and "exercise more directly to control more direct control. right".</p>
<p>Ling Weisen, a senior consultant to Asian Technology Stocks, said that Cai Chongxin's appointment should be favored by investors, but it is unlikely to improve Alibaba's stock price. Because Alibaba's recent stock price is mainly due to geopolitical influence and concerns about the Chinese economy, not the management of Alibaba's management.</p>

<p>The sightseeing submersible "Titan" lost contact for many days that caused people's concerns about their safety. A famous saying of the founder of the shipowner company: "Said safety is pure time" and then triggers people's discussion.</p>
<p>Titan (Titan), a submersible for adventure traveling with five people to Titanic Shipbuilding site for adventure tourism, [June 18) <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230620-1406292">Missing in the waters of eastern Canada</a>Essence "Titan" can dive 4,000 meters underwater. It is owned by the US private submarine exploration company Oceangateexpenditions and can carry up to five people. The oxygen of the submersible is expected to be exhausted on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>"Titan" is 22 feet long (6.7 meters). According to the company's website, it dived to 4,000 meters in December 2018 and sneaked to the Titani shipwreck site with a depth of about 3800 meters in 2021. This year plans to carry out 18 such diving this year.</p>
<h4>Former employee had expressed concern about the submersible design</h4>
<p>Reuters reports that some experts are worried about their safety. A former employee and a member of a trading group have expressed concern about the design of the submersible. On January 18, 2018, DavidLochridge, the employee of the Marine Gate, forwarded a project report to the company's leaders to criticize the "Titan" research and development process. He was particularly worried about the design of the hull and his strong pressure on deep water. Ability.</p>
<p>Rockridge and the gate of the Ocean filed a lawsuit. According to the lawsuit documents, the company held a meeting the next day to discuss Rockridge's concerns. At the end of the meeting, Rockridge said that he could not accept the company's design decision and would not authorize any manned sailing without further testing. Subsequently, the company fired him.</p>
<p>Stocktonrush, founder and executive officer headquartered in Everdon, Washington, Washington, also on the Titan. Bloomberg quoted his famous saying, "Saying safety is purely a waste of time" reported that Lash said in a podcast show last year to the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation reporter Davidpogue: "I mean, if you just want safety, Then don't get out of bed, don't get in the car, don't do anything. At some time, you will always bear some risks. This is really a risk return issue. "</p>
<p>Sakers such as the Titan are mainly used to explore some of the rare places on the planet. They are almost free of supervision, so they will clearly inform passengers that the fatal risks may be faced after boarding the ship.</p>
<p>Born in the UK, Robmccallum, who visited the Titanic shipwreck, was visited. According to Bloomberg 2017, McCarem had served as a consultant to the gate of the ocean in the early years, but later worried that Rush was worried about Rush. Different reasons are separated from the company.</p>
<h4>Passengers need to sign a security exemption statement before boarding the submersible</h4>
<p>According to passengers of the submersible, they need to sign a security exemption statement before the submersible. Last summer, Mikereiss, the producer of the TV show "Titan", told the New York Post: "The first page of" Death "mentioned three times."</p>
<p>Some people question why the representatives of the marine gate have notified the United States Coast Guard for a long time after losing contact with the Titan. The submersible at 9:45 am in New York (9:45 pm in Singapore time), that is, after one hour and 45 minutes of diving, they lost contact with the mother ship, but the company told the Coast Guard until 5:40 pm to inform the Coast Guard. Essence</p>
<p>A possible explanation is that the "Titan" is not for the first time to lose contact with the water surface after sneaking into the sea for a long time. Pogg said in a tweet this week that he had lost contact with the water surface for five hours when he was sitting in the submarine last time.</p>

<p><strong> Pay carrier tourists who go to the Titanic (TMSTITANIC, Titanic) wreckage disappear soon after departure on Sunday (June 18). The amount of oxygen will be exhausted on Thursday; the US Coast Guard claims to detect the sound of underwater knocks twice, but the trace of the submersible is not yet there are clues. In this article, we will discuss how dangerous is the sea area around the Titanic wreckage that has been sinking for more than 100 years. </strong></p>
<p>At some time in the autumn of 1911, a huge ice cubes on the vast glacier in the southwest of Greenland broke off. In the next few months, it slowly drifted south, and gradually melted under the driving of foreign flow and wind.</p>
<p>Then, on April 14, 1912, the cold night that could not be seen in the moonlight, a 125 -meter -long iceberg -is the remaining part of the 500 -meter ice cubes from the Greenland fjord a year ago -hit the south The Titanic, the passenger ship of Andle to New York, USA. In less than three hours, the ships on the way of the Virgin Airlines sank, and more than 1,500 passengers and ship groups were killed. The wreckage of the boat is now located at nearly 3.8 kilometers deep under the sea about 640 kilometers southeast of Newfoundland's coast.</p>
<p>Until now, the iceberg is still a threat to the ship's transportation -in 2019, 1515 icebergs floated south from March to August to the shipping routes across the Greater Ocean. However, the final restaurant of Titanic also has danger in itself, which makes it a huge challenge to visit the wreckage of the most famous crash in the world in this world.</p>
<p>As a five -person submersible carrying a paid passenger disappeared on the way to the Titanic wreckage, the BBC also discussed the situation of the underwater area.</p>
<h3>Sneak in Deep Sea</h3>
<p>(https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/science-65982371/p0fwcwbv/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/p0fwcwlq.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Tourism submersible goes to visit the Titanic shipwreck wreckage on the way to the wreckage of the shipwreck</p>
<p>The depths of the ocean are dark. The sun was quickly absorbed by the water. After about 1,000 meters below the water, it was difficult to penetrate how far. Under this, the ocean is a permanent darkness. The area of Titanic's resting interest is also known as the "midnight area", which is also the reason.</p>
<p>In the past, it was also talked about in the exploration of this wreckage. It continued to decrease more than two hours in the completely dark, and then the sea bed suddenly appeared under the light of the submersible.</p>
<p>Views are limited to a few meters long that can be shown on the tank -sized submersible. Stepping on this depth is a very difficult task, so that it is easy to lose the direction on the sea bed.</p>
<p>However, after decades of high -precision scanning combination, the Titanic wreckage map can provide a reference point when an object enters the sight. Son also allows crew to detect small terrain and objects other than a small range of submersible lighting.</p>
<p>The divers of the submersible also rely on a technology called inertial navigation, using a set of acceleration meters and gyroscopes to determine their position and direction at the known starting point and speed. The Titan submersible of Oceangate is equipped with the most advanced self -inertial navigation system, which is combined with an acoustic sensor called Doppler tester to estimate the submersible and the sea bed The relative depth and speed between the between.</p>
<p>Even so, the passengers who participated in the Titanic Journey of the Ocean Corporation in the past still mentioned how difficult it was to find the direction after arriving at the bottom of the sea. Mikereiss is a TV comedy screenwriter who participated in the Titanic trip to the gate of the Ocean last year. He told BBC: "When you reach the bottom of the sea, you don't know where you are. We have to go blindly on the bottom of the sea. We only know that the Titanic is in the nearby area, but there is a dark one there, and the largest object sinking on the bottom of the sea will be Except for 500 yards, and we spent 90 minutes to find it. "</p>
<h3>Deep sea high pressure</h3>
<p>The deeper a object dives on the bottom, the larger the surrounding water pressure. On the bottom of the 3800 -meter underwater, everything around the Titanic and its surroundings bears the pressure of about 40 MPa, which is 390 times the pressure on the ground.</p>
<p>"From another perspective, it is about 200 times the air pressure in the car tire," "The marine researcher at Stockholm ResillenceCentre of Stockholm Resillence Stockholm Resilles, Sweden, and Robert Blasiak, Radio4 (Radio4),") " In an interview with the TODAY column, "This is why you need a very thick submersible in the outer wall."</p>
<p>The carbon fiber and titanium outer wall design of the Titan submersible to make its maximum operation depth of 4,000 meters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/_130167120_908abe8b-f47b-4f2d-9e8c-9d933975673c.jpg" />Image source, PA Media</p>

<p>The thick outer wall of the submersible can undergo the person in the protective cabin under the superwater pressure.</p>
<h3>Underwater flow</h3>
<p>We may be more familiar with the powerful sea flow that can be able to bring the vessels and swimmers, but there are fierce underwater flow in the deep sea. Although it is usually not as strong as the ocean flow on the sea, it is still a large amount of water flowing. They may drive the water layer below from the wind on the sea, which may be the different tide of the deep sea or the water density difference caused by temperature and salinity. The rare phenomenon called "underwater storm" -usually related to the vortex of the sea surface -may also cause strong intermittent water flow to sweep the material on the sea bed.</p>
<p>When the Titanic sinks, the head of the ship and the stern broke, forming two main parts. The well -known information about its surrounding water comes from the study of the texture of the seabed texture and the squid around the wreckage.The sand wave pattern formed on the east side of the wreckage of the Titanic — the parts of the items, accessories, fixed pieces, coal and ships itself spread after the ship sink -indicate that there is a kind of ocean flow from east to west, but in the Lord in the Lord In the location of the wreckage, scientists said that the current flows from northwest to southwest, which may be because most of the wreckage changes the direction of the water flow.</p>
<p>Around the south side of the ship's head, the flow of water seems to be changing, from northeast to northwest to southwest.</p>
<p>Many experts predict that the precipitation brought by the current water eventually buried the wreckage of the Titanic under the sediment.</p>
<p>The deep -sea examination scientist Gerhardseiffrt recently led a sailing to conduct a high -precision scan on the Titanic wreckage. He told the BBC that he did not believe that the water flow in the area would be threatened to threaten the submersible -as long as the submersible was electric.</p>
<p>"I don't know if there is water that will be enough to pose a threat to any normal deep -sea vehicles at the Titanic wreckage scene," he said. Threat security. "</p>
<h3>The wreck itself</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/_130167116_918b6c27-cb1d-4801-9846-979d86da7cbc.jpg" />Image source, PA Media</p>

<p>Due to the water pressure, sediments movement, and microorganisms that eaten iron as the bottom of the sea, the Titanic is actually slowly disintegrating</p>
<p>After more than 100 years of sinking on the sea, the Titanic has gradually degraded. The impact caused by the two main parts of the hull in the initial collision with the sea, which caused the large wreckage to be distorted. Over time, the microorganisms with iron as the eclipse formed an ice -column -like "rust column", which accelerated the erosion of the wreckage. In fact, scientists estimate that higher bacterial activities on the stern -are mainly due to the greater damage it suffered — resulting in its erosion speed faster than the bow of the bow.</p>
<p>"The wreckage is constantly collapsed, mainly due to corrosion," Safeter said, "a little bit every year. But as long as you keep a safe distance -without direct contact, without opening from the opening -there will be no damage. "</p>
<h3>Drifting deposits</h3>
<p>Although the possibility of occurring is extremely low, the sedimentation of the sediment in the sea bed suddenly surged, and it has been proven to be damaged or even flushed away from the bottom of the sea in the past.</p>
<p>The biggest similar event -such as an incident that was broken by the cross -Gatai Ocean cable near the coast of Newfoundland in 1929 -it was caused by a strong shock such as earthquakes. People are increasingly aware of the risks of this phenomenon, but there is no sign that the disappearance of the Titan submersible is related to this kind of situation.</p>
<p>Over the years, researchers have discovered signs that the surrounding sea bed at the Titanic shipwreck has suffered a huge underwater and landslide shocks a long time ago. The huge amount of sediment seems to be sliding down along the mainland of New Finland, forming the "unstable corridor" called by scientists. They estimate that the last "deconstruction" incident occurred tens of thousands of years ago and formed a sediment layer of up to 100 meters (328 feet). However, many years of research on the Canadian Geological Survey (GeologicalSurvey of Canada) marine geological scientist DavidPiper, the sea bed, said such an incident is extremely rare. He compared this kind of incident to the outbreak of Vesuwei's volcano or Mount Fuji, and the frequency of occurrence may be every tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a phenomenon called Turbidity Current -sea water carrying a large amount of sediments flowing along the land -slope -this event will be more common and can be caused by storms. "We have a duplicate interval for about 500 years," Paper said. However, the terrain of the sea bed in the area is likely to lead any deposition logistics to a "Titanic Valley", which means that it will not reach the wreckage of the shipwreck at all.</p>
<p>Both Severt and Pipper said that this type of incident is unlikely to be a factor in the missing of Titan submersibles.</p>
<p>There are other terrain around the wreckage of shipwrecks to be explored. In the previous expeditions of Ocean Gate and the Titan submersible, Paul-Henrynargeolet, a former French navy diver and a submersible driver, detected a mysterious Sennar signal in 1996. In the end, it was discovered that it was a rock reef covered by marine life. During the recent exist, he hoped to reach another signal not far from the Titanic shipwreck.</p>
<p>Although the action of looking for a missing submersible is still continuing, it is still clueless for Titan and its crew members. In such a difficult and harsh environment, considering the risk of going to the Titanic shipwreck, it is still the same as when the first group of people arrived in the deep sea in 1986 to see the shipwreck.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66001425/65863520"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T11-04-00Z/65863520_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany) EU member states formulated the 11th round of sanctions on Russia. Among them, it is not only for individuals and organizations that support Russia's invasion of the Ukraine War, but also for the behavior of bypassing sanctions so far. The EU Council's rotating chairman of Sweden announced the news in Brussels on Wednesday (June 21).</p>
<p>The permanent representatives of the EU's 27 member states reached an agreement. The written procedures will be officially completed before Friday.</p>
<p>Sanctions include that they are prohibited from exporting specific products to some third countries due to the suspected bypassing sanctions. EU member states have banned many products from being transported to Russia for several months.</p>
<p>The country that bypass the sanctions against Russia is considered to be Kazakhstan, Armenia, the UAE and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国对俄罗斯银行实施限制/a-65991127">China</a>wait. EU experts assessed that Turkey was relatively resolutely responding to clues that bypassed sanctions.</p>
<p>In addition, according to EU diplomats, the existing transit ban was strengthened in the new sanctions. The specific high -tech products or aircraft parts used in the national defense field will prohibit from being transported from third countries to Russia.</p>
<p>Similar to previous sanctions, this time also increased the personal list of profits from the Russian aggression war. They were banned from entering the European Union and they would be frozen in the EU property. According to EU diplomats, 71 individuals and 33 organizations are included in the sanctions list. It is said that the initiative also aims to combat illegal hijacking of Ukrainian children to Russia.</p>
<p>Feng Delin, the chairman of the European Commission, welcomed the sanctions. She said that strengthening export restrictions will further crack down on Russian President Putin's war machines. Not long ago, Feng Delin said that in the so far sanctions against Russia, the EU export ban involving about 50 billion euros of goods before the war. This is equivalent to the proportion of 55%. The EU's import ban on Russian products involves about 60%of the imports of the pre -war, worth about 90 billion euros.</p>
<h3>Western sanctions on Russia are useful?</h3>
<h3>Some countries have worried about China countermeasures</h3>
<p>According to Germany, when introducing the suggestions of the sanctions in early May, it has caused a long discussion to criticize individual countries around whether it should be named or not, and Russia bypasses the sanctions through these countries. In particular, some countries express their concerns that if they take action on China, they may trigger countermeasures and have a negative impact on trade relations. Therefore, the final agreement was very cautious.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that the European Commission initially wanted to include Chinese enterprises who wanted to provide military -civilian dual -use products to Russia on the sanctions list. According to diplomats, after Beijing proposed a strong protest, only three Russian companies in Hong Kong were listed in the list.</p>
<p>In late May, Fu Cong, the head of the Chinese EU, said that China did not provide any military equipment to Russia, and exported dual -purpose items were extremely cautious. "Regarding the sanctions related to Chinese companies, I have to emphasize that if the European party cannot get relevant companies to avoid EU sanctions on Russia, we will resolutely countermeasures."</p>
<p>Reuters quoted diplomat news that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705">The draft of the sanctions included eight Chinese companies</a>The EU believes that they sell products to Russia that helps war. The names of these companies were leaked in early May. After the European Commission conducted high -level contact with China, Beijing promised to stop their activities to these companies. As a result, five of them withdrew from the list. The remaining three companies registered in Hong Kong are very small, which may be owned by Russia.</p>
<p>The new sanctions were not obviously launched earlier, first of all due to the objections proposed by Hungary and Greece. According to diplomats, these two EU countries are prevented because Ukraine includes the two countries in the [list of supporting the Russian aggression war] in Ukraine.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国厂商小米被乌克兰列入战争资助者名单/a-65318453)Essence Hungary criticized that the OTP banks involved did not violate any regulations.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia said that the counterattack of Ukraine's military forces has weakened and is re -adjusted at the front line. Russian Defense Minister Sho Gulu said that the Ukraine still has the potential to continue its offensive. In the daily video speech of Ukraine President Zeelianzki on Wednesday evening, he said that the Ukrainian army made progress and advanced forward in the south. However, in an interview with Zessic, a BBC broadcast on Wednesday, he acknowledged that the counterattack offensive was slower than expected. One of the reasons also includes a large area of the Russian army buried landmines.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) The theme of this new Global Financing Contract Summit is "Establishing a New Agreement between the Global Northern and Southern" to seek the way to help low -income countries deal with debt burden and release climate financing funds.</p>
<p>As the world's largest bilateral debt claim country, China plays a core role in Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia, and Ghana through the "common framework" led by the Group 20.</p>
<h3>What is "Common Framework"?</h3>
<p>The so -called "Common Framework" is an initiative launched by the 2020s during the epidemic at the end of 2020, which aims to help high -liabilities re -stable finances faster and easier to help high -liabilities.</p>
<p>This framework gathers the main debt countries, including China and the old-fashioned industrial countries-the so-called Paris Club, which is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新債務圓桌會議將登場-g7中國是絆腳石/a-64692972">debt restructuring plan</a>Negotiations with the debt party.</p>
<p>However, nearly 3 years have passed, and the mechanism has not yet led to any debt reduction agreement, partly because there are differences between wealthy industrial countries and China. In the past ten years, China has rapidly jumped into a major international credit party in the world.</p>
<h3>China Loan for Africa: There are praises and bombs</h3>
<h3>What is the position of China on the issue of debt restructuring?</h3>
<p>China hopes that multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and WorldBank can bear part of the losses, but these international institutions and many developed countries, especially the United States, oppose this plan. The reason why the United States and European countries oppose are that if they agree to the requests in Beijing, it is equivalent to providing assistance to China in disguise.</p>
<p>Among them <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/债务难题如何解美财长和imf总裁访问赞比亚/a-64491558">Zambia</a>It is a typical case. The country owed $ 6 billion in China's debt, which has fallen into a debt default nearly three years ago. This inland country located in southeastern Africa can no longer get more loans from the IMF, because Beijing insists on adhering to the multilateral borrowing party to participate in debt reduction and exemption-and this is an uncommon approach in the past.</p>
<p>The "common framework" requires the country to obtain a reorganization permit from the bilateral lenders, and then the commercial creditors and multilateral financial institutions-this makes Beijing displeased.</p>
<p>China continues to negotiate with the debt country on the basis of bilateral bilateral, and calls on debt management to be based on the "specific analysis of specific cases", although the main purpose of the "common framework" is to provide a standardized process of debt deduction.</p>
<p>At the G20 Treasury Secretary and the Central Bank President's meeting held in April this year, Yi Gang, President of the People's Bank of China, emphasized that "China is willing to cooperate with all parties to implement the common framework of debt reduction and exemption."</p>
<p>At a press conference in March, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked whether Beijing would agree to reorganize the implementation of Ghana's $ 1.9 billion debt, and told reporters: "The official bilateral debt with China only occupies only the official bilateral debt occupies only to the China. Ghana's total foreign debt is less than 5%. "She called on multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors to participate in the debt reduction and exemption process of developing countries, because these subjects are the main credists in developing countries.</p>
<h3>Controversial Chinese investor in Ethiopia</h3>
<h3>Why are some debt China willing to reduce and exempt, and some do not want?</h3>
<p>In January of this year, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang announced that he was partially exempted from the country's $ 13.7 billion in debt from China since 2000 to the present.</p>
<p>In August last year, China was exempted from 23 interest -free loans owed to 17 African countries. The debt had expired at the end of 2021. These interest -free funds come from the budget funds for foreign aid in China, so the procedures for deductibles are relatively simple.</p>
<p>According to the data provided by the Aiddata platform, from 2000 to 2017, the total interest -free loan issued by China's total US $ 843 billion of a total of $ 843 billion in the 165 countries government accounted for less than 5%.</p>
<h3>What support does China provide?</h3>
<p>In early May, China participated in the first meeting of the Sri Lanka Council as an observer. Japan, India, and France initiated this talk, although <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国延长还债期-斯里兰卡则希望中国能做更多/a-64499122">China is the largest bilateral debt party in Sri Lanka</a>Essence As of the end of 2021, this South Asian island country owed $ 7.4 billion in debt in China.</p>
<p>In the subsequent discussion of Ghana in May, China strengthened participation and agreed to co -ly the co -chair of the Ghana's official creditors committee with France.</p>
<p>Regarding Zambia's case, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said that "China has always attached importance to Zabia's debt issues and will also actively cooperate and strive to find better solutions."</p>
<h3>What should I do next?</h3>
<p>Analysts speculate that at this Paris conference, China will continue to explain the support of the "common framework", but it still advocates debt reduction on the basis of "specific cases specific analysis".</p>
<p>When the "common framework" held a meeting in Washington, China suggested that IMF accelerate the speed and improve quality in sharing debt sustainable analysis information.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that in order to allow China to agree to reduce more debt, countries may need a lot of persuasion.</p>

<p>How to strengthen cooperation in the United States and India, how will it affect the problems of India's strategic pattern and US -China relations, which will become the focus of the press conference on that day. U.S. President Biden previously referred to the CCP leader Xi Jinping as a "dictator" and caused strong dissatisfaction with the Beijing authorities. Intersection Biden responded to this: "I think what I say is a fact, which will not affect the existing US -China relations ...(Spy balloon event)It brings puzzles to the US -China relations, but the Secretary of State Brillin has a good China trip, and I also hope to meet Xi Jinping in the near future.

<p>Although the Strategic Communication Coordinator of the White House National Security Council, Johnkirby, said at a press conference on Tuesday that Modi was not targeted at China.

At the same time, India has become the country with the most population in the world and is a very potential economy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T16-52-00-04-00/000002.png" />On June 22, 2023, US President Biden met with the visiting Indian Prime Minister Modi.

<p>In response to the bilateral relations between India and China, Pan De believes that the border conflict between the two countries in 2020 is a watershed incident: "In the past three years, China and India have no normal diplomatic interaction. , Return to the position of March 2020, but China refuses to retreat. China and India have conducted eighteen round negotiations on this, but there are no specific results. "</p>
<p>Zackcooper, a senior researcher at the Washington Think Tank American Institute (AEI), told the reporter that Modi will not have a direct impact on China on the surface, but senior American and Indian officials will inevitably conduct Chinese issues on China. Discussion: "The United States and India will not become a formal ally, but I believe they have great concerns about China, so they will discuss the Chinese issue in private and jointly show that China makes them worry."</p>
<p><strong> Scholar: Chinese ambitions push India to the United States </strong>Slakld also pointed out that with China's ambition to expand the world's influence, the future cooperation between the United States and India in the future will become more: "Although we have not heard of the United States and India in public, Defense allies, but you can still see signs that the partnership of the United States and India in national defense is increasing.

Former "Apple Daily" reporter Liang Jiali chose to continue writing the story of Hong Kong overseas. Another reporter Chen Yiming decided to take root in Hong Kong and walk with young reporters to record the trial under the National Security Law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/al-06222023125946.html"><strong> China Human Rights Statue Global The Global Hong Kong people in the "National Security Law" will be cicadas in the "National Security Law" </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-06172023120612.html">Girls in the world for "Hong Kong independence" for the precedent for guilty of overseas Hong Kong people for speech</a></strong></p>
<p>After the closure of the Apple Daily, former reporter Liang Jiali took the lead in setting up a Facebook personal page as an independent journalist, mainly writing the story of the resistance. Summarizing her experience, Liang Jiali said that the National Security Law on the social impact of Hong Kong has increased expectations. Under risks and pressure, fewer and fewer people who are willing to interviews are increasingly and acknowledged that in Hong Kong, full of red lines, they continue to interview and report, and they are a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Liang Jiali: "Even if I want to record this history, but the space is getting less and less, I feel a little risk. This pressure is about the National Security Law. When I write, many red lines cannot be written, or it is getting more and more difficult to find. The respondent, in 2020 and 2021, everyone still wants to say, or want to write down my own history, but after two or three years, everyone is more silent and no longer want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say or want to say it or Speaking of what happened in 2019. The respondent may also feel dangerous. As a reporter, when I left, I was regarded as a way to understand what I wanted to go in the future. "</p>
<p><strong> Former "Apple Daily" reporter moved Taiwan to build a news platform to hold the risk in exchange for freedom across the red line </strong></p>
<p>After leaving Hong Kong, Liang Jiali retained his personal page. At the same time, he and Hong Kong media who were also overseas took Taiwan as the base to form the online news platform "Optical Media" to continue writing Hong Kong -Hong Kong affairs. Although it is difficult to build a news platform overseas, it can find the freedom of "I write my heart".</p>
<p>Liang Jiali: "There are more problems facing overseas, and it is difficult to find the respondent, because they may worry about whether there is a problem of colluding foreign forces and feel unsafe. There is a problem of funds. Legislative. But one thing is better than Hong Kong, that is, freedom of news and speech, and many can also be written. For example, sanctions can be written. Some exile people or continue to do civil society initiatives overseas. The sounds of all flowers are blooming, not just the official says one is one, and the other is two. "</p>
<p>Liang Jiali used a metaphor for "Be Water" and "Brothers Climbing Mountain", and believed that reporting in Hong Kong overseas was also a way to continue the beliefs of Hong Kong people in 2019. But she acknowledged that she was mentally prepared and it was difficult to return to Hong Kong in the future.</p>
<p>Liang Jiali: "In this era, you want to choose, right. After leaving, there is a great consciousness, that is, if you continue to do the media, you must know that you may not be able to go back to Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is now a free place. It is not a place to pay attention to human rights. The current situation is that when I flew from the United States, the cheapest air ticket was to transfer to Hong Kong, but I dare not buy it. I may give up a lot. "</p>
<p>She described that she now runs the media with the mentality of "crossing the river with the stones", and she can continue to write the channels of Hong Kong stories. Chen Yiming, a former "Apple" reporter who set up a personal page of Liang Jiali, also cooperated with several Hong Kong journalists to set up the online media of the main writing of court news in Hong Kong <a href="https://hkcourtnews.com/%e8%aa%8d%e8%ad%98%e6%88%91%e5%80%91/">"Piston"</a>Essence</p>
<p><strong> Hong Kong Jianjian Platform reports that major cases such as the National Security Law in the "National Security Law" and other major cases are the record of Hong Kong people. </strong></p>
<p>He said that the court news can only be done by reporters, and also said that in the past, "Apple Daily" was the media that invests in many resources. After the "Apple" disappears, the court news has many "blank" to be filled. The large cases of the "National Security Law" in the "National Security Law" of 47 people have successively opened. It is believed that the content of the report can not only record the content of Hong Kong, but also allow Hong Kong people to better understand the operation of the National Security Law.</p>
<p>Chen Yiming: "The National Security Law is a new law, and judges and judicial officers are also exploring, understanding and learning. Take the 47 -person preliminary case of recent trials as an example. After hearing and understanding, they do not understand why participating in the preliminary election. We will commit the statement and disputes of the two parties in the court, as well as the judge's response to make records as much as possible so that the public can better understand this law. This is also the public knowledge. The practice process of power. The court news has the meaning and function of existence, and someone must enter the court to listen to a detailed report. "Chen Yiming said that the current environment of Hong Kong is difficult to have the freedom of interviews from fear. In terms of court news, risks and pressure are relatively low.</p>
<p>Chen Yiming: "In terms of security considerations, the relative risk of court news is relatively low. Because we do not need to have personal opinions, opinions, and reports of orientation, we just record the records in court. That's another thing, not the current situation in Hong Kong. This is why everyone can try to do court news. We can also find some positions and give full play to the major as a media worker. "</p>
<p>Chen Yiming said that the platform's operation is less than a year, and it is necessary to deal with problems such as funds and insufficient manpower. The pressure and workload are greater than an independent journalist, but they are touched by young journalists and encouraged him to continue trying.</p>
<p>Chen Yiming: "I want to walk with young journalists, but I feel that there is something to do with them because there is no guarantee. For many young reporters, work on a platform that I do not know if I can go on, I will definitely worry about their livelihoods and their livelihoods and The future, etc., but these young reporters only hope to do more day for one day. They only expect the company to support the case that the company is responsible for. , Make the company go further. "</p>
<p>He said that the media ecology and operation model of the later "National Security Law" era was a new experience for every Hong Kong person and reporters. It is difficult to go before the road. I believe that persistence and professionalism, there is still room for people who guard the truth to play the director.</p>

<h3>Ukrainian war: From the discussion of Russia to discuss Putin's nuclear military round gambling game</h3>
<ul>
<li>Steve Rosenberg * BBC Russian affairs editor from Moscow</li>
</ul>
<p>1:44 am on June 23, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-23T01-44-18.000Z/_130175301_213701-shutterstock_editorial_russian_president_vladimir_putin_13964453n.jpg"></a>Image source, EPA</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>At the beginning of Putin's offensive, Russian nuclear weapons had been in a "high alert" state.</p>
<p><strong> Since the Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the full invasion of Ukraine, this issue will always be mentioned: Will the Kremlin choose nuclear weapons in this war? </strong></p>
<p>US President Joe Biden has never ruled out this possibility.</p>
<p>He said this week, "I am worried that Putin will use strategic nuclear weapons." He believed that this was a "real" crisis.</p>
<p>I don't know if President Biden has read the Russian "Profile; профиль). If he reads, you can understand why he is worried.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64779290">How does Putin's fate closely connected to the Ukrainian War</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65291814">Russia invaded Ukraine: Russian artists either support Putin or face review</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65831170">Ukrainian dam was blown up: thousands of civilians escaped Russia and Ukraine to deny the launch of attacks</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-63025996">Will Russia use tactical nuclear weapons? </a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-60765354">Evaluate the risk of nuclear war: how to measure the possibility and severity of the nuclear war</a>Last week, "Overview" published an article by well -known Russian diplomatic and national defense policy experts <a href="https://profile.ru/politics/primenenie-yadernogo-oruzhiya-mozhet-uberech-chelovechestvo-ot-globalnoj-katastrofy-1338893/">Sergey Karaganov (Sergey Karaganov)</a>Essence Eagle's Karaganov is the honorary chairman of the Presidium of the CouncilFor Foreign and Defense Policy. In short, he is familiar with the wealth here.</p>
<p>He is theory: In order to "defeat the west", Russia "has to make nuclear deterrence a convincing argument again by reducing the threshold of the use of nuclear weapons."</p>
<p>"The enemy must realize that we are ready to develop a pre -to -make, retaliate against the current and past aggression, thereby preventing the globalized thermal nuclear war."</p>
<p>"But what if they refuse to yield? Then we have to attack a bunch of goals of many countries and let those stupid people restore their sense."</p>

<p>President Putin confirmed that Russia has deployed its first strategic nuclear weapons to Belarus (White Ross). The Russian leader said that the move aims to drink all the people who "want to cause our strategic failure".</p>
<p>However, the benefits of discussing the nuclear blow to the Western premium? This topic has been upgraded to a new level.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all Russians agree with this idea.</p>
<p>The "Kommersant; коммерсантъ) published today (June 21) published an article entitled <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6055340">" Nuclear War is a bad way to solve problems "</a>Article.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Should the debate of Ukraine's use of nuclear weapons have entered the public domain of Russia.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is an unprecedented light description, but this article is fascinating, it is that it shows that Russia's discussion about when and whether the nuclear weapons should be used in the Ukrainian war have entered the public domain, and the hawks are not good.</p>
<p>The article of "Industry and Commerce Daily" came from another group of diplomatic and national defense policy experts in Moscow. It explained why they believed that Karaginov was wrong and was dangerous."There are many examples of military operations that lead to unexpected consequences in contemporary history, but these do not involve the use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear strikes will raise the unpredictable conflict to a new level and increase the risk of confrontation at multiple."</p>
<p>"The radioactive consequences caused by the" nuclear wheel disk "are probably to lay the worst foundation for the bright future. Those people who have sensational thoughts and dangerous gambling are best to keep this in mind."</p>
<p>[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65985991/P0FWKQFL/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65985991/p0fwkqfl/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-23T01-44-18.000Z/p0fwkqjc.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Ukraine began to counterattack the Russian occupation area, BBC reporter Queentin Sommerville and photographer Darrenconway visited the 68th hunter brigade.</p>
<p>This has brought us on another question that we have repeatedly raised since the Kai -war of Russia: What happened?</p>
<p>Perhaps Karaganov's proposal for the first -fledged nuclear strike was too shocking, making Russian scholars feel unable to sit still.</p>
<p>If this is the case, this shows that even if Russia's media landscape is more and more controlled by the country, even under the limit of existing existing, there are still some platforms to have space to accommodate the limited discussion of certain questions, especially like like like like like The topic of life and death in nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>It may also be that the entire debate was carefully designed in order to attract Western attention and make President Putin a white face under the black face of Karaginov.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the chief of the Kremlin himself has not asked to take a nuclear blow to the West. Therefore, as it proposes this debate -it is best to sit down and try to talk to him, so as not to scramble for the length of a day and press the nuclear button.</p>
<p>There is one thing that is clear: As the Russian internal anti -Western argument rises, as the Ukrainian army began to counterattack, the nuclear military issue may not linger.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The United States Coast Guard said on Thursday (June 22) that rescue workers responsible for searching for the "Titan" submarine believe that the five people on board have died; "Oceangate" also said that the company believes that all personnel on board "have died unfortunately."</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, the US Maritime police claimed that a "wreckage area" was found in the search area, and rescuers subsequently salvaged 5 pieces of wreckage fragments belonging to the Titan. The maritime police have therefore reported to the families of all passengers that the possibility of surviving is very small.</p>
<p>John Mauger, a US Marine Police Navy, said at a press conference held at Boston, USA that the foundation of submarine wreckage showed that "the boat has a catastrophic internal explosion."</p>
<p>An anonymous U.S. Navy senior official told the Associated Press and the Wall Street Journal that shortly after the submarine lost contact on the 18th, the US Navy detected "disagreement" and analyzed the acoustic data. Near the Titan submarine communication interrupted, there was an internal explosion or explosion (sound pattern). The US Navy has conveyed this information to the US Maritime Police Team, and the latter's search work has continued until the 22nd.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the United States Coast Guard and the entire headquarters, I said the deepest condolences to the family members of the victims."</p>
<p>Mog also said that the Titan wreckage is located about 488 meters from the Titanic shipbone head. The search team will continue to investigate the wreckage area, but now it is too early to judge when the submarine occurs in internal explosion.</p>
<p>Titan is a 6.5 -meter -long tourist submersible. It lost contact with the mother ship less than two hours on the 18th.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T02-01-00Z/66008861_401.jpg" />At a press conference in Boston in the United States, Mog made a conversation with the lost Titan.</p>
<h3>Director of Titanic: Revolon in Tragedy</h3>
<p>Three of the victims on the boat are British citizens. The British government mourned to the family members of the victims.</p>
<p>British Foreign Minister James Cleverly wrote on Twitter: "The British government is providing close support to the affected families and the deepest mourning."</p>
<p>The family of Pakistan's famous merchant Shahzadadawood stated in a statement that Daurd and his son were on the boat. The Pakistani government praised the rescue of submarines, and the relatives of the victims expressed condolences.</p>
<p>The director of the movie "Titanic" Jamescameron has a wealth of deep -sea adventure experience. In addition to sneaking 33 times in the Titanic shipwreck, he also drove his submarine designed in 2012 to go deep into the Mariana Trench.</p>
<p>Regarding the accident of the Titan submarine, Cameron said in an interview with the US ABC news on the 22nd that deep -sea diving is an art that must pass through the chain. In the past; many senior players in the industry in the past also believed in the Titan's operator "the door of the ocean", warning that the diving of the boat was still too experimental and should be carried out after certification. Now that this is a regret, it is similar to the warning related to the iceberg -related warnings and the tragedy of the shipwreck that year, which makes him feel shocked and "surreal."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T02-01-00Z/61313469_401.jpg" />Cameron drove his own deep -sea boat in 2012 to go deep into the Mariana Trench.</p>

This is a humiliation of a country that kills and harm a large number of children in the armed forces (Reuters)</p>
<p>The United Nations has included the Russian and Allied Army forces on the "shame list" because Moscow killed and killed hundreds of children in the war against Ukraine. Although the Israeli army killed more than 40 Palestinian children last year, it was still being killed. Exclude it outside the list.</p>
<p>Human Rights Organization has repeatedly requested Israel in the United Nations blacklist because Israel kills and harm Palestinian children in the west bank of the occupied Jordan River.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations Riad Manusur said on Thursday that the decision of the UN Secretary -General Antonio Gutres that eliminated Israel from the shame list was a "big mistake".</p>
<p>Gutres' annual report on children's treatment in conflict areas, a member of the United Nations Security Council, said that he was shocked by "a large number of severe violations of children in Ukraine in 2022" in 2022.</p>
<p>According to the report of the report of the report, last year, 477 children in Ukraine were killed, of which 136 were directly attributed to the Russian army and its affiliated organizations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-23T04-41-38/1-1687493754.jpg" />"Do you know where she is?" Helson's mother sought her daughter</p>
<p>According to the United Nations report, the Ukrainian armed forces killed 80 children. Among the remaining children, both the battle between the war could not be accused, and most of the children died in an air strike.</p>
<p>The United Nations has also confirmed that the Russian army and its affiliated organizations have harmed 518 children in Ukraine and launched 480 attacks on schools and hospitals. It is reported that Russian armed forces also used 91 children as human shields. 175 children launched 212 attacks on the school and hospital, and the Ukrainian army was not included in the list.</p>
<p>The Secretary -General of the United Nations stated in the report that he was "deeply concerned" about the number of Palestinian children killed by the Israeli army in 2022.</p>
<p>It is reported that in 2022, the Israeli army killed 42 Palestinian children and 933 injuries. In 2021, the Israeli army killed 78 Palestinian children.</p>
<p>Israel has never appeared on the national list of shame that the United Nations is shameful for killing children.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-23T04-41-38/2-1687493785.jpg" />Hundreds of Palestinians buried children killed by the Israeli army</p>
<p>Getres said that compared with the previous report, the number of children killed by the Israeli army (including air strikes) was significantly reduced last year.</p>
<p>Human rights observations are welcome to decide the Russian army named the Russian army, but criticized the UN Secretary -General's decision to remove Israel from the list of shame, saying that he "disappointed the Palestinian children again."</p>
<p>Joe Berkel, the director of children's rights, said, said, "By included the Russian army on the List of shame in the United Nations, the secretary -general is investigating their responsibility for children's terrible violations."</p>
<p>Berber said, "He (Gutres) is unwilling to investigate the responsibility of the Israeli army's serious violations of children. This is counterproductive and will only help the Israeli army illegally and fatal force with Palestinian children."</p>
<p>Baker wrote in the tweet, "From 2015 to 2020, the United Nations attributed more than 6,700 children's casualties to the Israeli army and verified the death of 975 children in 2022. 'I miss it. "</p>
<p>The Palestinian Ambassador Mansur said that Israel was excluded from the UN list "to let the Palestinian people and Palestinian children very disappointed."</p>
<p>Manusur said, "The Secretary -General did not list the list of the Israeli government and made a big mistake. This is the most extreme government and is full of fascists. If this government is not listed now, then when will the Israeli government list the Israeli government? What? "He also added," Unfortunately, he chose not to list them. "</p>
<p>The United Nations report has been controversial for a long time. Diplomats said that Saudi Arabia and Israel have put pressure in recent years to try to avoid being included in the list of shame. A few years later was deleted from the list in 2020.</p>
<p>Peninsula TV's diplomatic editor James Beste said that Russia's joining marks that "the Period of the Security Council is first listed on the blacklist."</p>
<p>"The report once again caused controversy, partly due to Israel, the report said that Israel killed 42 children in 2022. Now the secretary -general said that this is a meaningful decline. "But he also pointed out that Israel's war in Gaza in 2021 lasted for 11 days, while the war in August 2022 lasted only three days.</p>
<p>In the tweet, Bass wrote, "The reality is#Israel is still killing many children."</p>
<p>The United Nations report also condemned the violence of children such as the Democratic Republic of Democratic Republic, Somalia, Syria, and Haiti.</p>

<p>He said that since entering the field of deep -sea exploration, "this is the nightmare of all of us." The security records in this field for decades are very good, but "many people in the circle are very worried about this submersible."</p>
<p>"Some high -level participants in the deep -sea diving engineering circle even wrote to the company, saying that what they did is too experimental, it cannot be used to carry passengers, and it needs to be certified."</p>
<p>James Kumaron also said that he knew one of the victims, Paul-Henrinargeolet, the French marine explorer. "This circle is very small. I have known Naro for 25 years. He died tragic in this way, and I could hardly accept it."</p>
<p>He said, "I know the place of the shipwreck very much ... I actually calculated that I spent more time on the boat than the captain at that time."</p>

<h3>Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line</h3>
<p>The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

<p>According to usual, the US Secretary of State visits China, and Chinese leaders will meet with it.

Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-23T07-32-09-00-00/000000.png" />According to the documents seen by the reporter today, UN Secretary -General Antonio Guterres said in an annual report that he was shocked by a large number of serious violations of children in Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>In the report, Getris said: "The Russian and its affiliated armed organizations attacked schools, hospitals, and protected people, causing a large number of children to be killed and disabled. I was particularly shocked by this." This report was distributed to the United Nations today Members of the Security Council will be made public next week.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that 477 children were killed in Ukraine last year, of which 136 were caused by the Russian and affiliated organizations, and 80 were caused by the Ukrainian armed forces.</p>
<p>The report also mentioned that another 909 children were disabled, of which 518 were injured by the Russian army and puppet organizations, and 175 were injured by the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>Although the human rights organization has repeatedly required, Israel has not been included in the "shame list" for the way of treating children in the Palestinian armed element conflict.</p>
<p>Getris said that compared with the previous report, the number of children killed by the Israeli army (including air strikes) was significantly reduced last year.</p>
<p>However, he added that, despite this, he still cares very much about the number of deaths and disabled children caused by the Israeli army in the conflict, and also care about the use of real bombs in the process of law enforcement, and has never been able to account for liability for infringement of rights.</p>

President Biden concluded: It was very successful and achieved the goal. General Secretary Xi Jinping concluded that Sino -US relations depend on civil exchanges. In other words, diplomacy is unsuccessful and the official relationship fails. This process is very interesting, let's briefly analyze it.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, there was a balloon incident. The CCP's reconnaissance balloons flew over the United States. The United States was angry, and the White House ordered it to shoot it down. In order to restore the anger of public opinion, the planned U.S. Secretary of State visited Beijing. This is a warning of the CCP's provocative behavior, and it is also a punishment for provocative behavior. This is in line with the norms of international diplomatic behavior.</p>
<p>Of course, this caused Xi Jinping to be embarrassed. Are you a stumbling of Xi in the Communist Party of China, or did the Chinese Communist Party out of control? We cannot conclude without further news. In short, President Xi was very faceless and was beaten. If you can't find the secret, you have to vent your anger with the Americans. So he rejected the further arrangement of the United States after the postponement of the United States. The hope of eased Sino -US relations seems to be shattered.</p>
<p>The breakdown of diplomatic relations is a very dangerous situation for both parties. The United States is a responsible country, and it must recover the dangerous situation caused by this accident. China is a rogue country, so I will give you a muddy one, break the jar and break it, see if you are afraid. So it seemed that the United States begged to visit Beijing, but Xi Jinping said with a frame and said: I don't care if you come or not, the emperor does not wait. It seems that you can find your face.</p>
<p>In fact, Xiao Xi really didn't care. He frequently met the big capitalist in the United States, just forcing the White House to ask him. This is what he said in the people. Traditionally hooligan against gentlemen, what you caught is that you must be responsible. Considering the situation of maintaining peace, considering the maintenance of the economy of the two countries, etc., the United States has to put down the shelf to repeatedly contact and give Xi Jinping a large face. The task was completed.</p>
<p>What did Xiao Xi ’s operation? I didn't see anything. A lot of conditions are mentioned, and the old war Wolf King Yi also threatened what choices or harmony. Secretary of State Blingken still did not make any compromises, just repeated the American policy, which ended the trip to China. This is because the United States knows the confidence of the wolves, and there is nothing substantial except for the mouth guns that can threaten the United States.</p>
<p>The wolves did not get something, so the Propaganda Department had to find their face. The rumor -making machine played a full set of functions, fabricated a lot of rumors, and proved to the people how the CCP defeated the US imperialism, how the American guys scratched Emperor Xi. And now there is no pure inner announcement, the news quickly spread all over the world, which directly hit the White House.</p>
<p>This time, the United States lowered its body to resume Sino -US relations, and also faced criticism of public opinion in the United States. It is impossible for the opposition to let go of such a good opportunity, and the White House also has to face. The negative publicity of the CCP allows the White House's face? There must be a counterattack to find the face. Under the premise of not destroying diplomatic relations, President Biden sent Xi Jinping to a crown, and in the public lecture, he respected Xi Jinping as a dictator. Poor Xiao Xi, in the end, the face was gone, and lost a clean.</p>
<p>Large companies in China and politicians they funded by them are nervous, fearing that this may destroy Sino -US relations that has just eased. Therefore, President Biden explained this, saying that the CCP's economy is bad. Where they have time, they have time to destroy Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>Further interpretation is the situation of the CCP's internal and external difficulties, facing the situation of collapse. It is Xi Jinping who wants to be in the United States rather than the United States. At this critical juncture, the CCP dare not risk to continue to destroy Sino -US relations. At the same time, it is also warned that Xi Jinping should not continue to do things on his face. Otherwise, if the United States is forced to take revenge measures, the CCP's fragile situation may not bear it.</p>

<p>Australian intelligence officials have previously alert that Russia may use a land about 400 meters away from Congress Building as a base for monitoring Australian Congress. Therefore, Australia decided to prevent Russia from building embassies here. The bill of things.</p>
<p>Later, a Russian official wearing sports pants, down jackets, and glasses began to obstruct the Australian government from recovering the land. He stayed in a small combination house, surrounded by weeds and abandoned building materials.</p>
<p>This afternoon, while the diplomat was stationed in the planned place, the Russian embassy also launched legal operations to prevent him from being driven away.</p>
<p>A Australian government spokesman said that Russia tried to apply for a forced order to the Australian Supreme Court that "Russia's challenge to the effectiveness of law is not surprising. This is part of their teaching manual."</p>
<p>Australian government sources have confirmed that men stationed in that land enjoy diplomatic protection, but AFP cannot find this person in Russian officials in Australia.</p>
<p>The Australian police have been watching the land, but the government is reluctant to arrest the diplomat, so as to prevent the two countries from complex diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Someone smoked the Russian diplomat outside the combination house. Australian Prime Minister Anthonyalbanese said today: "Australia will adhere to our own value and we will maintain national security. A guy stands in a grass in the severe cold of Canberra, threatening the security of our country." Peira's night temperature has dropped below the freezing point this week.</p>
<p>Russia obtained the lease of this land from the Australian government in 2008, and obtained the permission to build a new embassy in 2011.</p>
<p>The Australian government announced the abolition of the lease last week, and Angonis told reporters: "The government has received very clear security suggestions that Russia's risk for building a new ambassador to the construction of a new embassy near the parliamentary building ... We are quickly taking action to come to act quickly Make sure the lease location will not become a formal embassy. "</p>
<p>The Australian and opposite laws have unanimously adopted the new law. The new law does not prevent Russia from building embassies in Australia, but it is not allowed to be too close to Congress.</p>

<p>Li Qiang's foreign debut show visiting Germany and France to lobby Europe and China as "friends" rather than "opponents"</p>
<p><strong> While US Secretary of State Brills came to Beijing to meet with Chinese leaders Xi Jinping, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang started his first foreign visit after taking office, and successively arrived in Germany and France in major EU economies. </strong></p>
<p>This is after the visit of the head of Germany and France at the end of last year and early this year, the Chinese leader was invited to return to the visit. Earlier, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee, and Qin Gang, both of which were visited in Europe.</p>
<p>"After the outbreak, the Qing zero policy is relieved, and Beijing will be good to Europe. After all, Europe is far from China, and the direct interest conflicts are relatively small." Chongja Ian, associate professor of political science in Singapore National University, explain.</p>
<p>He believes that Beijing hopes to ease the intense relationship between the Central and European war after the Russia and Ukraine War. In the face of the restrictions of the United States in terms of technology and semiconductors, China wants to draw the EU countries to break through the siege. shake.</p>

<p>Li Qiang met with German political and business people.</p>
<p>One week before Li Qiang's visit to Europe, Germany published the first national security strategy (Die NATIONALESICHERTSSTRATEGIE), defining China as "partners, competitors, and systemic opponents". Order, threatening global security and ignoring human rights.</p>
<p>The document believes that Germany needs to reduce its dependence on goods to other countries, but it means that China is still "partners" and "solving many international challenges and crisis are indispensable."</p>
<p>After the release of this contradictory document accused, Li Qiang emphasized that when he met with German Chancellor Shulz, China and Germany were the credible and reliable partners on the road of modernization, and Schildez was "opposed to decoupling" and "de -riskization". (DE-RISK) response is not de-China. French President Macron also said that he attaches great importance to French -China relations and adheres to a Chinese policy. The law should adhere to effective polymerization.</p>
<p>"This is a very important diplomacy process throughout the first half of the year." Dr. Chen Weixin, an international relations scholar of European politics, and Dr. ORientis Research Director Chen Weixin said to BBC Chinese. "In the first half of the year, China -Europe and Sino -US relations were a bit cold and warm. Western Songkou no longer talks about decontle, but is risky. Therefore, Beijing also tried to understand the actual meaning of this word."</p>
<p>The term "de -risk" was first proposed by the EU Commission Chairman Feng Delin in March. After that, German diplomats adopted this statement, and Washington also followed. The strategy of China to China is written into a joint bulletin.</p>
<p>"Completely decoupled does not conform to everyone's interests. For the United States, the Democratic Party must please Wall Street and corporate interests before the 2024 election. In Europe, Chinese funds and markets are still very important, especially Germany and France have great interests in China. "Chen Weixin said.</p>

<p>Li Qiang's second stop was France. Here he was warmly received by President Macron, and the latter just visited China in April this year.</p>
<p>Li Qiang shouted to the business community during his visit. When he met in Germany, he met the heads of Siemens, Volkswagen, Pingzhi, BMW and other companies that there were me and me among the world economy. "Dependence", even the simplicity of interdependence and unsafe, "not cooperation is the biggest risk, and not development is the biggest insecurity."</p>
<p>Li Qiang mentioned at the dinner of the China -French business community in Paris that the good political mutual trusts of China and France saw stability, certainty and common development opportunities in mutual dependence, not risks. He praised the French government's opposition to camp confrontation and the "decaptering chain", calling on Sino -French entrepreneurs to firmly support economic globalization and jointly maintain the stability and toughness of the China -French and China -Europe industry chain.</p>
<p>"Li Qiang was forced to respond to the risk -because everyone knows that this vague concept can be used for China." Chen Jialuo, an associate professor of the Department of Political and International Relations at the Hong Kong Baptist University, told BBC.</p>
<p>He explained that in the past three decades, Beijing successfully "decoupled" human rights and trade, allowing the West to share technology and technical secrets (Know-How) for the West, and put human rights issues aside. The two are re -connected, this is the most dissatisfied place in China. "</p>
<p>The EU published a document of the "European Economic SecurityStrategy" on June 20, and proposed a number of actions, including the establishment , Review foreign direct investment screening regulations, and jointly study the safety risks that may generate export investment with member states. The document does not name China, but emphasizes that "cooperation with the country on the road to risk" is emphasized."When it involves trade, Brussels has great influence because it has legal and regulatory power to 27 EU member states. The business world knows this, so they must be careful when they cooperate with China It is punished by legal sanctions and may be punished. "</p>

<p>Russia invaded Ukraine, and China refused to condemn Putin, becoming a watershed in China -Europe relations.</p>
<p>Two months ago, French President Macron and the Chairman of the European Commission via Beijing. The former was received by Xi Jinping's ultra -high specifications, but the latter was called "disappearing access" by the media. Two months later, Li Qiang's trip to Europe only reached Germany and France, and did not visit Brussels, reflecting the thinking of Beijing's diplomatic traditions "focusing on Germany and light EU".</p>
<p>Former European Parliament political consultant Zsuzsa Annaferenczy pointed out to BBC in Chinese that Beijing has always been "laid a faction" and adopted the strategy of differentiation of the European Union and attracting some countries.</p>
<p>"Europe has entered the new situation, and 27 member states have become more united. Xi Jinping supports Putin and refuses to condemn Russia to invade Ukraine, becoming a watershed in China -Europe relations, which exacerbates the doubts of EU countries. Therefore, China and China and China and China and China and China Whether German and French economic and trade cooperation can fundamentally cultivate the relationship with Europe, I am afraid it is still doubtful. "</p>
<p>Chen Weixin, a scholar of international relations, also pointed out that after experiencing the epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War, Beijing must be aware that Europe is not Europe three years ago, and China -Europe relations are no longer only Germany and France.</p>
<p>"Nordic, which attaches importance to human rights equivalent, and Central and Eastern European countries that borders Russia and Ukraine, have now become the biggest resistance to China. Beijing does not take the European Union as one thing. Sino -European relations return to the previous set. This old thinking cannot be realized under the new system and geopolitics. "</p>

<p>23 legislations that have set off a huge controversy in Hong Kong have been attracted again. The Chief Executive Li Jiachao recently accepted an interview with the Hong Kong News Agency that he would legislate on Article 23 of the Basic Law during his tenure, and he must be legislative this year or the last year and next. In an interview with the Hong Kong media, Ye Liu Shuyi, the convener of the Executive Council, stated that 23 legislation did not have the best time to say. At present, the legislative situation will be "easily controlled" in 2003. Citizens also understand that "constitutional responsibility".</p>
<p>Ye Liu Shuyi was responsible for 23 legislation during his tenure as director of the Security Bureau in 2003. According to an exclusive interview issued on the 23rd of Hong Kong's "Letter", Ye Liu Shuyi said that if the legislation was successful 20 years ago, at least there were laws that could deal with the issues of division and subverting countries. It is believed that legislation is good as soon as possible. She also believes that although the current "Official Confidential Regulations" have covered the crime of spy, the regulations are very primitive and outdated. When the authorities have legislation on 23 legislation, they should once again define the criteria for spy.</p>
<p>Under the intention of Beijing, the Hong Kong Government promoted legislation on the 23rds of the Basic Law in 2003, but was forced to abandon by Hong Kong people. In 2020, the National Security Law of the Hong Kong Edition formulated by the National People's Congress of the country was included in the 23 parts of the State Law of Hong Kong. When the Hong Kong Government submitted the 2022 Legislative agenda to the Legislative Council, including Article 23 of the Basic Law.</p>

<p>According to the press release of the committee, the special committee opened a preliminary investigation of four brands of Nike, Adidas, Shein and TEMU on May 3.</p>
<p>The chairman of the committee and Republican member Mikegallagher commented: "These results are shocking: Temu has rarely taken any measures to prevent the supply chain from being affected by slavery workers. At the same time, TEMU and Shein" It is establishing its own empire around the trace clause vulnerabilities in our import rules -evading import tax and avoiding the censorship of millions of products they sell to Americans.

Essence The report also revealed that TEMU did not ensure that the Uyghur forced Labor Prevention Law (UFLPA) regulations (UFLPA) almost ensured that the Uighurs forced labor manufacturing into American families.</p>
<p>The two members finally said: The results of these preliminary and medium -term investigations revealed the facade of the TEMU that could not maintain a meaningful compliance plan, and the real scale of the use of trace clause vulnerabilities by SHEIN and TEMU, which caused people to continue to exist for forced labor products. And pollute the serious concerns of imported products in the United States.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to the news obtained by many Chinese media from authoritative people, the young fans who rushed into the center of the court with Messi and Martinez and other big -name stars on June 15 were released on June 21 Essence</p>
<p>At that time, Argentina was getting corner kicks in a friendly match against Australia, and Messi was not far from the corner area. Suddenly, a young fans who were not far away looked at the railing of the stands, jumped off from 3 meters, and went straight to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/梅西兩度進球-阿根廷奪世界杯冠軍/a-64144486">Messi</a>And embrace. At this time, the court security guards that only reacted from the reaction rushed forward. Unexpectedly, the fans got rid of it quickly, running dozens of meters to the other end of the court, and the Argentine goalkeeper Martinez. At this point, many security guards still chased behind him. The fans repeatedly snaked and ran back to halftime in Australia. They were finally lying down because of their physical strength and lying on the ground. According to the mobile phone short video shot by the audience, after the fans were escorted to the stands, many viewers took a photo with him to sign.</p>
<p>Although in an interview with the media after the game, the fan had expressed his apology for Messi, and Messi himself publicly expressed his hope that the police would not punish him too seriously, but the Beijing Chaoyang police still reported on June 16th that He is administrative detention in accordance with the law and will not enter the stadium to watch the same category competition in the next 12 months.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T11-11-00Z/66012206_401.jpg" />His erratic running position shook down a security officer</p>
<h3><strong> Chinese public opinion believes that the sentencing is too heavy </strong></h3>
<p>In Chinese social media, many netizens believe that the five -day punishment for administrative detention is too severe to this young fan who has not caused serious consequences. According to the current regulations, those who have recorded administrative detention records will not be allowed to join the army and enter the national security organs, and they are likely to be unable to pass political trials when applying for civil servants.</p>
<p>Police's punishment for the fans is Article 24 of the Public Security Management Punishment Law: "One of the following behaviors, disturbing the order of large mass activities such as culture and sports, a warning or a fine of less than 200 yuan; the serious circumstances of the circumstances; If you are detained for more than five days and less than ten days, you can pay a fine of less than 500 yuan: (1) Forcibly entering the field ...(six)Other behaviors that disrupt the order of large mass activities. Those who are detained for disrupting the order of sports competitions can be ordered to order them to not enter the stadium to watch similar competitions within twelve months; those who violate the regulations to enter the stadium, forcibly take the scene. "</p>
<p>The Beijing police also stated in the report that "the competition has the rules of the game. Violation of the rules will be punished by the referee or even the warning of the red and yellow cards. The fans also have the rules of watching the game.</p>
<p>However, the professor of Chinese University of Political Science and Law Zhao Hong wrote in the "Surging News" that according to the "Penalty Management Penalty Law", the situation of "serious circumstances, detained for more than five days and ten days" should be achieved. Fireworks and firecrackers, display insult slogans, banners, or personnel in the siege, and throw debris on the field. Now the Beijing Police "The heaviest punishment for a teenager who rushed into the stadium was the heaviest punishment for the juvenile of the idol. Facts, nature, plot, and social harm are quite principled. "Zhao Hong believes that even if the police considers this case to prevent similar events in the future, but in view of the fans, the fans are right as soon as possible after the game. The organizer and the public apologized and Messi himself also expressed understanding, so the police could have adopted a lighter penalty method such as warning and fines. And "If the public can generally tolerate this free and unrestrained teenager, there is no reason to think that it can be warned by punishment to warn other potential 'illegal people' to follow its behavior."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T11-11-00Z/66012234_401.jpg" />Hug 5 seconds detention and 5 days</p>
<h3><strong> How to deal with similar incidents in Germany? </strong></h3>
<p>In Germany, fans <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/温布利球场-无票球迷硬闯入场/a-58238154">Breakthrough Stadium</a>However, there is no obvious financial loss and personal injury, usually torture according to Article 123 of the German Criminal Code "illegal destroying the tranquility of the territory". Although the maximum sentencing of the law is one year's imprisonment, fans who have run into the stadium in recent years usually only face the fines of "several days of income", which is equivalent to hundreds of euros.</p>
<p>However, fans who are running into the stadium are not good at paying hundreds of euros. The team's team, especially the home team, will also be fined by the German Football Association, the German League Committee, the European Football, and the FIFA. Work caused fans to break through the stadium incident. The teams who have been fined huge are usually compensated for fans and other amounts according to the Civil Code. In the 2006 Bundesliga, a run -down event was often recognized as a classic jurisprudence in the judicial community: After the fans' running out of the court incident, the German Football Association fined 20,000 euros on the Hanshalostok team and believed that its security was weak. Subsequently, the Hanshalostok team went to the court to file a civil lawsuit against the fans. The court finally supported the plaintiff's request, and the defendant claimed to compensate 20,000 euros because the latter did cause economic losses to the team.</p>
<p>In addition, if the fans cannot pay hundreds of euros of "illegal damage to the tranquility of the territory", they will be punished by "fine replacement". According to Article 43 of the German Criminal Code, it is equivalent to a fine of the parties' one -day income, which is equivalent to a day's sentence. The German Federal Parliament has just passed a bill on June 22, and the "fine replacement imprisonment" in the future will be halved.</p>

Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd., located in Changzhen Community, Yutang Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen, a labor conflict broke out because the factory was relocated by the local community within a time limit. The workers were dissatisfied with the compensation plan given by the factory, and <a href="https://maps.clb.org.hk/?i18n_language=zh_CN&amp;map=1&amp;startDate=2023-05&amp;endDate=2023-05&amp;eventId=2023051616495788361&amp;addressId=440300&amp;address=%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E5%B8%82&amp;industry=10202&amp;industryName=%E7%94%B5%E5%AD%90"> Gathering the Changzhen Community Party Mass Service Center for help</a>Essence</p>
<p>Some workers sent out from the scene <a href="https://www.douyin.com/video/7232096082895981824">video</a>From the "Party Mass Service Center" and "New Era Civilization Practice Station" brand, the camera slowly moved to the five -star red flag on the top of the building. Intersection</p>
<p><a href="http://www.szsuccess.com.cn/yxwl/index_13.aspx">Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd.</a>Established in 2004 and listed in 2009.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">In 2019, Yushun Plant received a written notice from the Changzhen Community</a>, Make a relocation within 3 years. Three years later, in February last year, the company received a written notice from the Changzhen community, requiring the lease relationship before May 31 last year, and August 10th. The lease of Yushun Factory's plant did not expire until July 2024.</p>
<p>So, for the first time in 2019, the company has received the community relocation notice for almost 4 years. Has the Yushun Factory Trade Union conducted negotiations on the compensation plan on behalf of the employee?</p>
<p>In addition, the factories were relocated to the Changzhen community, and the Changzhen Community Trade Union Service Center worked with the Community Party and Mass Service Center. So, is the Changzhen Community Trade Union on the relocation plan that may affect the rights and interests of the workers, and negotiate with the community service center to ensure that the interests of employees can be guaranteed during the relocation process?</p>
<p>In particular, the Changzhen community requires the Yushun plant to relocate before the lease expires, which will inevitably affect the factory's operation, thereby affecting the company's ability to make reasonable compensation for workers. Does the Changzhen Community Trade Union participate in the negotiation of the company's participation in the enterprise and the Changzhen community on behalf of Yushun Factory. It is suggested that the Changzhen Community suspend the lease early to make additional compensation to the enterprise to ensure that the company has the ability to make reasonable compensation for workers?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the workers have gathered in the Changzhen Community Party and Mass Service Center (office with the Changzhen Community Trade Union) for help, do the community unions come forward to represent the workers and negotiate with the community and the factory?</p>
<p>Half a year ago, on December 13, 2022, Yushun Co., Ltd. issued the relocation <a href="https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H2_AN202212121581022248_1.pdf?1670882016000.pdf">Announcement</a>It is mentioned that employees will follow the factory area to relocate and fail to follow the factory area relocation personnel. The company will legally terminate labor relations in accordance with the relevant provisions of the labor law.</p>
<p>So, in the next half of the year, the Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Trade Unions, Guangming District Trade Unions, and the Shenzhen Federation of Trade Unions, each to avoid the intensification of the situation?</p>
<p>According to the data, the Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions announced a legal service that cost 170,000 yuan last year <a href="http://www.szgm.gov.cn/xxgk/xqgwhxxgkml/gzgg/content/post_10136621.html">work plan</a>Essence This plan was announced in September, and in October, the goal was that by the end of 2022, the coverage rate of legal consultants in the first and secondary community trade unions in the street reached 100%. Level -level labor communication and negotiation mechanism.</p>
<p>So, did Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions assist Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd. to negotiate the relocation compensation plan in accordance with the work plan that he formulated and announced?</p>
<p>There is another thing. In June last year, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">more than 50 workers in Yushun plant have complained</a>At the Shenzhen Housing Provident Fund Management Center, the factory said that the factory had not paid the housing provident fund for front -line production workers. Before that worker went to the Provident Fund Management Center to complain, did he come to the union for help and ask the union representative workers and the enterprise to complete the supplementary payment through negotiation?</p>
<p>The Yushun Factory was established for 19 years and was listed for 14 years. It did not pay the housing provident fund for front -line workers. Are the corporate unions, Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Unions, and Guangming unions knowing this?</p>
<p>Please listen to these questions and talk to the Changzhen community staff.</p>

<p>It has been nearly 16 months since Russia's full invasion. Houses, hospitals and important infrastructure have become ruins, and Kiev has faced rebuilding for several years or even decades.</p>
<p>The World Bank estimates that the reconstruction cost of more than 400 billion US dollars is increasing with the casualties caused by the war.</p>
<p>The diplomats and political leaders at the London conference emphasized the huge scale of this task and urged private enterprises to invest. Cleverly said that nearly 500 companies from 42 countries have promised to play their role.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Prime Minister Jennis Shimagal, who attended the meeting, thanked the representatives for their financial support and added that Ukraine would not wait until the end of the war before rebuilding.</p>
<p>Ukraine's initial focus will be its energy department, which will be continuously attacked in Russia's continuous attacks, which leads to many families in darkness and cannot warm in the cold winter.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Anthony Blint also emphasizes the importance of Ukraine's anti -corruption efforts that have been troubled by corruption for a long time.

<p>Description: Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang's visit to Berlin this time, the high reception specifications of the German side are unusual: the presidential meeting, the Prime Minister set up a banquet, review the honor guards of the three armed forces, meet the elites of the industrial and commercial circles, especially the Prime Minister of the two countries after the German and Chinese government consultation, but the reporter is not allowed to be a reporter. The press conference in question has attracted special attention from the German media.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66014213/65975159"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T13-05-00Z/65975159_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The "Daily News" website commented that it is a good thing to communicate with China, but it is a mistake to carry out government consultations with China. Because German partners who have carried out government -level consultations have always been other democratic countries, and the diplomatic courtesy to Beijing is very uncomfortable. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与中国压力山大的伙伴关系/a-65941273">This consultation in 2011 is a mistake, and it is wrong to continue government consultations. </a>This article entitled "Not to Give China":</p>
<p>"First of all, compared with 12 years ago, China has changed greatly. Whether it is internal affairs, diplomacy, or the economic field, the CCP's leadership has become more and more aggressive and more and more nationalism. The Chinese government will promote the process of liberalization or opening to the outside world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Chinese leadership provides at least indirectly supporting Putin and its invasive Ukraine War. During his visit to Germany, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang closed his mouth and did not mention the word of aggression, and he did not make any condemnation. In his statement, he only brought it through the "complicated international situation". "</p>
<p>The comments pointed out that in the face of preaching nationalism, the Beijing authorities, which continuously issued force on Taiwan's force and promoted unfair economic policy, the European Union is trying to make common responses to the above challenges, but Germany has the "institutional opponent" in China to carry out the government. Consultation, this is undoubtedly a very wrong signal.</p>
<p>"Berlin paved a red carpet for the Chinese Prime Minister and its government delegation. These seemingly harmonious pictures sent a signal to AIA in Germany: China plays a special role in Germany. Wrong, this error should not continue. "</p>
<p>The "Business Daily" also commented that the German -Chinese government consultation that had just ended in Berlin was an inconsistent government consultation for Germany, but for China, it was a major victory of diplomacy and publicity.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T13-05-00Z/65975012_401.jpg" />"Business Daily": The German -China government's consultation did not even issue a joint statement. After all, the differences between Beijing and Berlin have been too large.</p>
<p>"For China, this time government consultation is obviously very successful. The picture from Berlin is unmatched by Beijing: German Prime Minister led eight ministers to hold talks with Chinese representatives and laugh everywhere. Chinese media conducted negotiations on the German and Chinese government consultations. It has been reported in a row to prove that Germany and China relations have developed very well. This is also in line with Beijing's anti -American speech: the United States has made turbulence everywhere, while China is a defender of cooperation and free trade.</p>
<p>For the German government, the results of government consultation are not so ideal. From the perspective of Germany, the essential content of consultation is more important, and as expected beforehand, the German -China government's consultation involves very few substances. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567">German Prime Minister Shulz actually obeyed the wishes of Chinese leadership and canceled the questioning link of reporters at a joint press conference on Tuesday. During Merkel's while serving as the Prime Minister, although he encountered China's resistance, the reporter asked the link that always had to be retained. </a>The German -China government's consultation has not even issued a joint statement, after all, the differences between Beijing and Berlin are too large. Dialogue with Beijing is crucial, but the increasingly imbalance between Germany and China also shows that it is out of time to carry out government consultations with a country like China. "</p>

<h3>Sade: Defense on the Golf field</h3>
<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) The Ministry of National Defense said on June 21 that South Korea's deployment of the United States in the country <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/韩国站队美国萨德问题难解/a-62942430">Sad System</a>(THAAD, terminal high -altitude regional defense system) The environmental impact assessment found that the electromagnetic radiation is "insignificant" according to safety standards. The evaluation was paved with the permanent deployment of the system.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense of South Korea said that the maximum level of electromagnetic radiation generated by the Sade System (THAAD, terminal high -altitude area defense system) installed in 2017 was less than 0.2%of the safety standards. Some local residents were dissatisfied with placing it in the Singzhou County Air Force Base in the southeast of South Korea.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense in South Korea stated in a statement: "The latest environmental impact assessment is the first step in the normalization of the Star Base."</p>
<p>The results of this research are expected to clear the road for more infrastructure construction of the system. Officials said that the Sade system could not run at full load because nearby residents protesting the system's impact on their health.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T13-07-00Z/38662501_401.jpg" />The deployment of the Sad system has always been opposed by some Korean people (information picture)</p>
<p>The NATIONAL CIVIL Society Network and Sosungrivillage, which are opposed to setting up the Sad anti -missile system, condemned the government's statement, saying that the evaluation was rushing to complete and hinted that it would continue to protest.</p>
<p>China also responded to this device angry, thinking that the powerful radar of the system could peek at its lead.</p>
<p>The United States and South Korea said the Sad system is to self -defense, aiming to deal with the threat of North Korea's continuous changes.</p>
<p>North Korea with nuclear weapons has been testing various weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, which has exacerbated the tension with South Korea and its major allies in the United States.</p>

<h4>China -Korea Relations: Do business first, then talk about strategic interests?</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>On August 24, 1992, the People's Republic of China officially established a ambassador -level diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea, ending the long -term non -recognition and isolating history of the two countries. The picture shows the South Korean Foreign Minister Li Xiangyu (front left) and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen signed and exchanged the joint communiqué in Beijing. The day before, South Korea announced that it had broken diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, causing Taiwan to lose its last diplomatic relations in Asia.</p>

<h3>South Korea President's first visit</h3>
<p>In September 1992, then South Korean President Lu Taiyu (1995 data picture) visited China for a few weeks of diplomatic relations between the two countries. He met with Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Yang Shangkun, President of the State Council, and Li Peng, Prime Minister of the State Council. The two parties signed a series of cooperation agreements such as the China -Korea Trade Agreement and the China -Korea Investment Protection Agreement.</p>

<h3>From comprehensive cooperation to strategic partners</h3>
<p>During the end of the 1990s to the early 2000s, during the term of the South Korean President Kim Daoic, Sino -South Korean relations were promoted to "a comprehensive partnership for the 21st century." In May 2008, when the then President of South Korea, Li Mingbo visited China, the relationship between the two countries was once again promoted to "strategic partnership." The picture shows the popularity of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao when he visited South Korea in May 2010 and was welcomed by Lee Mingbo.</p>

<h4>China -Korea Relations: Do business first, then talk about strategic interests?</h4>
<h3>Mutual exchange</h3>
<p>Since the end of the last century, the trade, culture, and personnel exchanges between South Korea and China have become increasingly closer. According to data in 2021, South Korea's students in China are more than 50,000, and more than 20,000 international students in South Korea are ranked first among foreign students in the other country. China has become a popular choice for Korean enterprises. Korean popular culture has a large number of enthusiasts in China. South Korea has also become a tourist destination that Chinese people are favored. The picture shows the Chinese tourists in front of Jingfu Palace (2014).</p>

<h3>Sad incident</h3>
<p>In view of the security threat of North Korea's ability to develop nuclear weapons to South Korea, in 2016, the South Korean government decided to deploy the US Sad anti -missile system (Thaad). Because its radar has the potential ability of China, it is considered by China to affect its land security. After opposing invalidation, Beijing has taken multiple countermeasures against South Korea, including the prohibited Korean media and artist performances, tourism blockade, etc. These measures also caused Sino -South Korean relations to cool down rapidly.</p>

<h4>China -Korea Relations: Do business first, then talk about strategic interests?</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>Because the land that deployed the Sad system was replaced by the Seoul government to South Korea's Lotte Group, the retail giant became the goal of China's official and civil retaliation. For a while, consumers resist Lotte, demonstration protests, and even suppliers to interrupt the supply. Dozens of Lotian supermarkets were "ordered to suspend business." In addition, sales of Korean brands such as Samsung Mobile, Qia Automobile also plummeted. Chinese travel agencies have removed from South Korea to make the South Korean tourism industry impact.</p>

<h3>"Three Never One Limited" consensus</h3>
<p>In November 2017, China and South Korea reached a consensus, and the Korean side stated that it would not consider the addition of the new Sad system; the necessary restrictions on the existing Sad system; Military alliances and unintentional damage to China 'security interests. After the then President Wen Zaiyin's visit to China in 2017, relations between the two countries began to ease.</p>

<h3>Opportunity or threat</h3>
<p>China is South Korea's largest trading partner, export market and import source country, and South Korea is China's third largest trading partner country. In South Korea's largest single -income source sources of semiconductor exports, more than 40 % of China exports. A questionnaire survey in South Korea's "Central Daily" in August 2022 showed that 19.3%of the respondents believed that the rise of China was a "opportunity", and 75.4%of the respondents believed that this was a "threat". The picture shows the anti -Chinese people who protest against the Wen Zaiyin government and the North Korean policies of the North Korea (April 2018, Seoul).</p>

<h3>Where to go</h3>
<p>The current South Korean President Yin Xiyue (right) showed a more active route to the United States after taking office in May 2022, saying that it will accelerate the deployment and construction of the Sade system. South Korea officially joined the "Indo -Pacific Economic Framework" led by the United States in May 2022(IPEF)And in August, it was announced to join the United States, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan's "Chip Quartet Alliance". Its goals also include strengthening the supply chain, including export control of China.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-23T13-25-00/1-1687525564.png" />Last year, Kazakhstan President Casim Jooma Malt Takayev and Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) said on the same stage that his country would not recognize the pro -Russian small country of the Eastern Ukraine or other former Soviet Republics Independence (Reuters)</p>
<p>According to Russia's Tasis, the Russian Federal Security Commission has accused Western countries of trying to leave the relationship between Russia and Kazakhstan by interfere with the affairs of sovereignty countries.</p>
<p>At the time of the above comments on Friday, the Russian Security Council secretary Nicholas Patrushev was visiting Kazakhstan and met with his peers from the former Soviet Union to join the Republic of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Tas Sisplays quoted Patrueshov's deputy Aliushan Dafzov in Alamutto that "the United States and its allies are trying to support nationalist emotions, spread lies, and manipulate public opinion, including through the Internet and social networks."</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, which is rich in oil resources, is Russia's long -term allies and close economic partners. Since the Moscow army invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the country has been cautiously acting.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan officials often call for the end of the war through diplomatic means, and said that the country will comply with (but will not join) West sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan citizens provided a assistance to the Ukraine. When President Vladimir Putin ordered some military mobilization in 2022, many young Russian people who did not want to serve fled to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>However, observers said that on the surface, Kazakhstan was trying to get rid of Russia's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The Kazakhs government said this month that President Toccyev will not attend the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia. On the contrary, Alamu said that lower -level officials will participate in it, but no explanation will be given.</p>
<p>At last year's forum, Tocaev and Putin said on the same stage that Kazakhstan would not recognize the independence of pro -Russian small nations in eastern Ukraine or other former Soviet Union to join the Republic.</p>
<p>His remarks have attracted people's attention, because Kazakhstan and Russia have the longest continuous land boundary in the world. For decades, they have been members of the security and trading group led by Moscow, and Russia is a strategic partner.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the long -term host country of the Syrian peace talks that Kazakhstan -Russia, Turkey, and Iran participated in unexpected proposals to end the process.</p>
<p>This Central Asian country has hosted such meetings since 2017.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Kanat Timish called for the end of the three -party talks and stated that their goals had achieved.</p>
<p>He told reporters, "Syria's isolation that is gradually getting rid of the region can be regarded as a sign that the Astana process has completed its task."</p>
<p>"Considering that Syria returns to the Arabic family, we recommend that the 20th meeting of the Astana process is the last meeting."</p>
<p>On Monday, Kazakhstan canceled the Russian singer Grigori Leips(Grigory Leps)A concert was because Russian singer Grigori Lapus was strongly opposed to invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the United Nations, Kazakhstan basically chose to abstain from the vote on the Ukrainian war rather than supporting Moscow.</p>

I will tell you that you will destroy the collapse. If I am, In the case of parents, this child must not report to the journalism, and I will do one thing, just stun him. "</p>
<p>In an interview with the Chinese media "China News Weekly", Zhang Xuefeng said: "I have to admit that 80%of the students who learn news communication are not engaged in the industry. News communication is a very good professional ... Now? Everyone is self -media. "</p>
<p>Zhang Xuefeng issued the above time, in the annual Chinese college entrance examination season. His remarks caused Zhang Xiaoqiang, a professor at the School of Journalism of Chongqing University. On June 15th, Zhang Xiaoqiang posted on the Internet: "Friends!Don't be fooled by Internet celebrities like Zhang Xuefeng. He is not linked and misleads the public."

Zhang Xuefeng said that it is now a self -media, that's too much, that's too much. Narrow, mainstream media is still an industry that can absorb employment. "</p>

The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee made a big question mark on the clearing of Bo Xilai's poison.</p>
<p>In this column's previous article, "Cai Qi accidentally ranked up, did Chen Minle still play in five years? In ", we have introduced readers and audiences. While Cai Qi, at the top of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping was" the Secret of the National State ". The secret that the secret was also relegated and unable to "enter the common", Chen Minda, became the first member of the Political Bureau of the Politburo of the Politburo of the CCP's ruling history. However, when some media reproduced or transmitted the content of this article, the reason why Chen Mindele's 20 "abnormalities" were concentrated on his secret Yan Wei. In fact, only logically judged that while he was a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, he was not completely out of the event. One of these two was a member of the Central Central Committee at the time, the deputy secretary of the party affairs of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, and Ren Xuefeng, who was five years younger than Chen Minle, was born in Beijing during the Central Plenary. A successor was originally optimistic about becoming Chen Miner's Chongqing Municipal Party Secretary. It is said that the deputy secretary and mayor of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee of Xi Jinping's family. Essence</p>
<p>In addition, Bo Xilai's secrets have been announced by the CCP authorities to be sentenced to fifteen years in prison and Xu Ming, who retired from the fifteen years, and can still return to the Chongqing crime. It should also become the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee hosted by Chen Miner. One of the "serious work errors" content of incompetence.</p>
<p>We have been introduced in the past related programs. On April 7 this year, after the CCP's Supreme Procuratorate announced that the former members of the National Grain Bureau's party group and deputy director Xu Ming were filed for public prosecution, many online media in Mainland China immediately used the "Tiger" Xu Ming. Prosecution: The Director of the Director started to collect money.</p>
<p>Born in 1958, Xu Ming was an educated youth with Li Keqiang in Fengyang County, Anhui Province. After resumption of the college entrance examination, Li Keqiang entered Peking University with his strong college entrance examination; Xu Ming became a "backdoor soldier" with his father's influence in the county armed department. However, after Xu Ming, who was very good at drilling camps, he found himself a chance to "study" in the military college, and therefore had a "academic degree".</p>
<p>After the transfer of the army, Xu Ming worked at the former State Economic Commission of the Communist Party of China, the former State Family Planning Commission, the former State Council Economic and Trade Office, the former State Council Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Commerce. When he met Bo Xilai and became his political confidant, in February 2004, Bo Xilai was transferred to the Minister of Commerce of the State Council.</p>
<p>At that time, Xu Ming was only the deputy director of the Department of Market System Construction. After half a year, Bo Xi was about to be promoted to the Chief Director in place; more than a year later, he arranged for him to be the director of the Ministry of Policy Research Office in addition to his director's position. In March 2006, Xu Ming was arranged by Bo Xilai to be transferred to the Ministry of Commerce General Director of the Ministry of Commerce.</p>
<p>Bo Xilai entered the Central Political Bureau and was appointed secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee at the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 2007. After half a year, Xu Ming went, and was first appointed as the deputy secretary -general and director of the research office of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee. The specific role of the specific role was actually a secret around Bo Xilai.</p>
<p>In the relevant articles published in April this year, the author cited the insider. At the beginning, Xu Ming still happily accepted Bo Xilai's "suggestion" on the premise that his family was unwilling to leave Beijing. The way to serve in Chongqing is because Bo Xilai's original plan from the Vice Premier of the State Council to the promotion of the successor of the successor has been cut off. After 5 years of Chongqing, he returned to Beijing and will not go to the State Council. It means that if Xu Ming continues to stay in the State Council system, Bo Xilai is already in love. However, if Xu Ming is willing to go to Chongqing, his political prospects can be said by Bo Xilai alone.</p>
<p>That is to say, since Xu Ming's determination to move from Beijing to Chongqing, his relationship with his wife began to crack. Later, he was married, and he continued a divorce lawsuit for 3 years.</p>
<p>As we all know, Bo Xilai had covered the sky in one hand in Chongqing, saying one Fuji. In June 2010, Bo Xilai ordered Fan Zhaobing, the member of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Secretary -General, renamed the Minister of United Front Work of the Municipal Party Committee, promoted Xu Ming to the Secretary -General of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, and continued to serve as the director of the Municipal Party Committee and the secretary of the Party Working Committee of the municipal agency. Essence At the end of the year, the Central Organization Department approved the promotion of Xu Ming's Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, and official to the deputy provincial ministry level. In December 2011 before Bo Xilai fell, Bo Xilai made Weng Jieming, the secretary of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and the secretary of the Party Working Committee of the Liangjiang New District, and Xu Ming, and Xu Ming replaced him. The resume adds color to make political warm -ups for promoting provincial and ministerial levels. However, after Bo Gukai came to kill the foreigner's east window, Xu Ming's great future ended with Bo Xilai's prison.</p>
<p>On June 22, 2012, 13 leaders of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee appeared in the new Chongqing Municipal Party Committee. Xu Ming did not enter the list of new standing committee members, but he still stayed in the position of the Party Committee of the Party Working Committee and the director of the Management Committee of the Liangjiang New District for a while.</p>
<p>At the National Two Sessions in 2013, a reporter asked Huang Qifan, then Chongqing, who asked Xu Ming's new job. Huang Qifan replied: "He has been transferred to work in Beijing."</p>
<p>In March 2013, Xu Ming returned to Beijing as the deputy director of the State Food Bureau to retain the deputy ministerial treatment.</p>
<p>In March 2018, in accordance with the reform plan of the State Council of the 13th National People's Congress, the responsibilities of the State Food Bureau were integrated, and the State Food and Materials Reserve will no longer retain the State Food Bureau, and Xu Ming retired.</p>
<p>After retirement, Xu Ming still participated in social activities normally. On the eve of the Spring Festival in 2021, the main leaders of the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau condolences to the old leaders by phone and other methods. Xu Ming was also among the condolences. But a few months later, he was announced to "investigate". At this point, his divorce lawsuit has just ended for two months.In January last year, Xu Ming was announced to expel the Communist Party of China and cancel the retirement benefits of deputy ministries. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Xu Ming deliberately discussed the Party's Central Political Policy and kept keening on superstition; illegally accepted the owner of private enterprises, went in and out of private clubs in violation of regulations, and accepted banquets; did not report personal matters in accordance with regulations; ; In order to chase the personal fame and fortune, the public power is used as a tool for seizing private interest, making great power to find rent, and uses the convenience and influence of positions for others in business operations, project contracting, and promotion of positions. property.</p>
<p>One month later, Xu Ming was arrested by the Supreme Procuratorate.</p>
<p>On January 5 this year, the first instance of the Xiamen Intermediate Court in Fujian Province opened the trial of Xu Ming's bribery and the use of influence and bribery.</p>
<p>The Xiamen Procuratorate sued accusations: From 1995 to 2021, the defendant Xu Ming used the director of the Foreign Investment Division of the Foreign Economic and Trade Department of the Foreign Economic and Trade Commission of the former National Economic and Trade Commission, the director of the foreign economic coordination department of the foreign economy, and the deputy director of the foreign economy coordination department. Deputy Director of the Marketing Department of the Ministry of Commerce, Director, Director of the Department of Comprehensive, Deputy Secretary -General of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, Standing Committee Member and Secretary -General of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, former member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the State Food Bureau, etc. The convenient conditions for the relevant units and individuals will help the project contract, business approval, case processing and personnel adjustment, and illegally accept the property of more than 51.2 million yuan; The convenience and status of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, Secretary -General, etc., promised to help others in case handling through the acts of staff of other countries, and illegally collected RMB 1.2 million.</p>
<p>At that time, the official media report emphasized that Xu Ming expressed his confession and regret. More than 20 people including the People's Congress, members of the CPPCC, media reporters and the masses listened to the trial.</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Xiamen Intermediate Court of Fujian Province publicly announced that it was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for the defendant Xu Ming for bribery and fined RMB 4 million. And fined RMB 100,000, decided to implement a period of fifteen years in prison, and fined 41 million yuan; Interest, recovered according to law, and paid the state treasury.</p>
<p>The Xiamen court believes that the defendant Xu Ming's behavior constitutes the crime of bribery and the use of influence and bribery. The amount of bribery is particularly huge, and the amount of bribery is huge. In view of the attempted attempted departments of Xu Ming's bribery, the use of influence and bribery is surrendered. After the case, the fact that most of the facts that the supervisory organs have not yet mastered the facts of bribery, confession and regrets, and actively retreat. The crime of bribery that he has committed can be punished lightly, and the crime of bribery it he committed can be reduced. The court made the above judgment.</p>
<p>Please note the two important details of this judgment. The first is that Xu Ming was "punished from lightly" because his "most of the facts of bribery" were "what the supervisory organs have not mastered the supervision organs after the case", and It was punished by two crimes, that is, the so -called "bribery crime" and "the crime of using influence to accept bribery".</p>
<p>There is no need to explain more about "bribery". From 1995 to 2021, the history of bribery for 26 years.</p>
<p>As for why there is another "guilty of using influence to take bribes", we must first understand the reason for this crime.</p>
<p>The outside world noticed that the differences in the crime of "using influence and bribery" and "bribery" in the Criminal Law of the Communist Party of China began with the trial of Zhou Yongkang's son Zhou Bin.</p>
<p>Article 388 of the Criminal Law of the Communist Party of China on the crime of "bribery with influence" is: the close relatives of the state staff or other people who are closely related to the staff of the country, through the behavior of the staff of the country, or Using the convenience conditions for the power or status of the country's staff, through the behavior of staff of other countries, in order to ask the trustee to seek unfair interests, ask the entrustment to ask for the property or accept the trustees. If the amount is large or there are other heavier circumstances, it is imprisoned or detained for less than three years, and a fine; if there is a huge amount or other serious circumstances, it will be imprisoned for three years and seven years. Or if there are other particularly serious circumstances, it is sentenced to more than seven years in prison and punished or confiscated property.</p>
<p>State staff who resign or have close relatives and other people who are closely related to them shall implement the aforementioned behavior to use the original authority or status formed by the state staff who resign, and shall be punished in accordance with the guilty of bribery by the use of influence.</p>
<p>In the case of Zhou Bin at that year, the court determined that Zhou Bin had committed bribery, sentenced to 13 years in prison, and fined RMB 190 million. 100 million yuan; crime of illegal operation, sentenced to three years in prison and fined 200,000 yuan. Because Zhou Bin had legal or decided to implement the sentence of 18 years in prison and fined 350.2 million yuan because of the legal or decided to be punished by light punishment.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhou Yongkang's wife, Jia Xiaoyi, was sentenced to committed "impact to accept bribes".</p>
<p>Zhou Bin was dealt with judicially 7 years ago, and the three crimes were sentenced to 18 years and were sentenced to 18 years, and his two bribes were fined as high as 350 million. Times. From this comparison, it shows that the "light punishment" of the CCP authorities on Xu Ming is also very limited.</p>
<p>Zhou Bin was the son of Zhou Yongkang, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Central Political and Legal Committee, and Jia Xiaoyi was the stepmother of Zhou Bin, so the so -called "use of influence to accept bribery" of their mother and son could not understand. And now why Xu Ming is also scheduled to have this crime, according to the previous statement that the indictment has been quoted before: In June 2021, Xu Ming used the convenience conditions formed by the former members of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Secretary -General after leaving the job. It is promised to help others in case handling through the acts of staff of other countries, and illegally receive 1.2 million yuan in case handling.</p>
<p>Please note that Xu Ming was publicly announced in July 2021 that he was "under investigation", and the "use of influence and bribery" in Chongqing occurred in June 2021. This is enough to show that the cause of Xu Ming's investigation must be in Chongqing's "use influence". As for everything else, that is, all the bribes from 1995 to 2021 are proactively explained after the "investigation".</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Xu Ming's political failure in Chongqing began in June 2012 and was expelled from the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee. But after 9 years, he could still use his "convenience and status of the former member of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Secretary -General" to commit the crime. The cleansing work is greatly reduced. The follow -up analysis content will continue to be introduced to readers and audiences in the next article.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

<p>Description: Since the German Green Party chairman has served as the Minister of Economics, the government's guarantee for German investment in China has been greatly reduced. However, the Social Democratic Party, which is also the ruling party, still pays great attention to the economic relations of Germany and China. "Mirror Weekly" learned from the people in the circle that the huge differences in the ruling party's policy on China have led to a delay in the new strategy of China.</p>

Li Qiang hopes that Habeck "do not take discrimination measures."</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to "Ming Mirror Weekly", it is learned through the government's internal documents that the German Green Party Chairman Habeck(Robert Habeck)Since the Economic Minister of Economic, the Minister of Economy in Germany at the end of 2021, the government's government guarantee amount invested in Germany in China has reduced 5 billion euros. The newspaper, a new application case, pointed out that the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs rejected the total amount of four German companies with a total of 101 million euros <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德经济部对华出口担保政策持续开放/a-65950221">Investment Guarantee in China</a>Request; and in the other four cases, the application for extended investment guarantee in China with a total amount of 554 million euros in China was also rejected. In addition, a total of about 4 billion euros of German enterprises have not been accepted at all in China. There are also about 282 million extension applications.</p>
<p>In 2013, the German Federal Economic Affairs Department of Economic Affairs approved a total of 37 German companies to invest in China. "Mirror Weekly" pointed out that by 2022, the Ministry of Economic Affairs only approved a total of 9 items, and only 5 items in the first half of this year. For about a year and a half of the Economic Minister, Habeck has only approved a new application for investment guarantee in China and an extension of 1.1 billion euros in China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T14-48-00Z/65978423_404.jpg" />Schildez and Habeck obviously have huge differences in China</p>
<p><strong> Benefit orientation or value orientation? </strong></p>
<p>"Mirror Weekly" believes that this is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国联邦经济部酝酿强硬路线降低对中国市场的依赖/a-63070816">Habeck and the Green Party reduced economic dependence on China</a>Part of the effort. At the open level, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Habeck and the Federal Economic Affairs of Economic Affairs emphasized that over the past few decades, the government provided by the government has excessively concentrated in China, leading to "excessive concentration of federal budget risks." However, all this is most likely because of the ideological orientation of the Green Party: the ruling party strives to promote the foreign diplomacy and economic and trade policies dominated by values, and is no longer dominated by economic benefits.</p>
<p>The Green Party's policy orientation has formed differences with the Social Democratic Party, which is also a ruling party. Just this week, when the Social Democratic Party, the German Prime Minister Shulz, when the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang was receiving the visit, he said that "both countries benefited from mutual trade and investment" and praised the mutual investment for each other "to create economic growth, employment, employment Jobs and progress in climatic neutrality. "</p>
<p>Compared with the Green Party, the Social Democratic Party is more inclined to Germany's industry and trade union organizations. "Mirror Weekly" pointed out that many voters of the Democratic Party and Democratic Party are worried that if <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中关系/t-62235618">German -China Relations</a>Wheneling will cause your employment position to be threatened, so "human rights issues should be rely on when necessary".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-23T14-48-00Z/65976663_404.jpg" />What is the trend of German -China relations in the future?</p>
<p><strong> Continue to produce a strategy for China </strong></p>
<p>"Mirror Weekly" also noted that the differences in the German government's policy on China have long attracted the attention of the Chinese government. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567">Li Qiang during Germany</a>In the face of Habeck, he hopes that the Germans will not take "discriminatory means", otherwise it will only damage "healthy economic development".</p>
<p>At present, the German government's new China strategy has not been released. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Prime Minister's Palace and the Green Party still have major differences in many issues. Sources in the government circle said that the long -awaited document was unlikely to be released before the summer vacation.</p>

<p>The director of the movie "Titanic" Cameron believes that the Titanic and <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230623-1406985">Titan "</a>The tragedy is very similar. It is also a warning that no one ignores it, and it is also a multi -country to start rescue.</p>
<p>French International Broadcasting Station (RFI) reported that as a diving expert, JameScameron told the US Broadcasting Corporation (ABC): "I am (Titan) and Titanic disaster The similarities were shocked. Captain Titani was warned many times to pay attention to the ice in front of the ship, but still drove into the ice domain at full speed at night in the dark night, causing many people to die. "</p>
<p>He pointed out that the marine exploration community has always expressed concern about the security of the Titans, saying that the Titan's carbon fiber structure has "fundamental defects", but experts' warnings have been ignored. "This is really shocking ... … It's really super realistic. "</p>
<p>In addition to being a well -known Hollywood director and a submersible designer, Cameron can sneak down in where the Bitidani is deeper.</p>
<p>He also said that the Titan dive is still a "experimental" activity, which should not be charged and allows passengers who are not deep -sea engineers to adventure. The cost of exploring Titanic wreckage by Titan is $ 250,000 per person (about S $ 335,000) per person.</p>
<p>Major General Mog Mog of the United States Coast Guard held a press conference on Thursday (22nd) that in the morning, the Canadian remote -controlled underwater search car (ROV) found a wreckage fragmentation on the seas of the remote corner of the North Atlantic. It is confirmed that the Titan submersible has encountered "catastrophic internal explosion", and five occupants believe that it has been killed.</p>

Chinese e -commerce such as Pinduoduo escaped the US tariffs and the review of the supply chain source through small parcels to exports to the United States. Reuters data chart <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/tj-06232023103422.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibao/jingmao/tj-0623202222.html/@@stream</a>The latest report issued by a special committee of the US House of Representatives shows that Chinese e -commerce "Shein" and overseas version "TEMU" (TEMU "(TEMU) exports to the United States through small parcels, avoid US tariffs and supply chain sources for review Essence The above -mentioned survey conclusions have once again triggered concerns about Chinese overseas companies involving user information security and mandatory labor issues.</p>

<p>On June 22, the House of Representatives' SELECT Committee on the Strategic Competitionbetween The United States and the Chinese CommissionParty, the House of Representatives announced that the overseas version was announced that the overseas version was announced that Pinduoduo and the affordable clothing website "Hipyin" Use legal loopholes to avoid the US import tariffs and sources of product supply chain.</p>
<p>The report mentioned that these two Chinese e -commerce companies sold to the United States with more than 30 % of the use of small parcels. Such a sales model can avoid US customs review, of which Pinduoduo is sold through small sales through small amounts of sales. Avoiding the US's supply chain review of the US Labor Law (UFLPA) in the United States, not only illegally exports to the United States to export Xinjiang products, but also suspected forced labor.</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: Whether the clothing is made by Xinjiang cotton is difficult to investigate </strong></p>
<p>In response to the survey conclusions of the above report, the Hudson Institute Senior Researcher THOMAS J.Duesterberg told the reporter: "This is the issue of" preventing the forced Uygur Labor Law "in this station. . It is difficult to track cotton sources of low -cost clothing. I think this problem deserves serious attention, especially Temu and Shein to avoid US customs through small sales. The U.S. Congress depends on this matter. "</p>
<p>On Friday, the reporter from this station contacted the two Chinese e -commerce comments on this.</p>
<p>Hipyin's spokesman responded: "We provide detailed information on the Special Committee, and we will continue to answer the question of the special committee transparently. We are tolerate forced labor and actively cooperate with the" Preventing Uyghur Labor Law ". … We do not contact the manufacturers in Xinjiang. If we find that we have cotton with inappropriate use of clothes products, we will immediately take corresponding actions. "</p>
<p>However, until the deadline, Pinduoduo has not responded to this station inquiry.</p>

<p><strong> Chinese enterprise overseas operation dilemma TIKTOK has shared with China Data from Hong Kong democratic people </strong></p>
<p>In recent years, some well -known Chinese companies have become increasingly trapped in overseas operations due to problems involving user information security and human rights violations of supply chain.</p>
<p>The former senior executive of the Chinese Overseas Edition Tiktok's parent company, Yu Yintao, who was beating by bytes, recently sued the company's court documents that Tiktok had shared the data of Hong Kong civilian people in 2018, including users' online information, and the user's online information, and the user’s online information, and the user’s online information, and the user’s online information, and the user’s online information, and the user’s online information, and the user’s online information, and SIM card recognition, and IP address. Although the byte beating has repeatedly denied the allegations, it seems to confirm the concerns about the US Congress about the previous share of Tiktok with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>In response to the human rights issues caused by Chinese e -commerce in the United States, Dusterberg said: "For example, the US government questioned Tiktok to assist the Chinese authorities to propagate. And block the negative information about the Beijing authorities; there are similar conditions on WeChat. Because more than 20%of people in the United States use Tiktok, and more than 30%of young people in the United States use Tiktok as the main source of news, TIKTOK, Tiktok Assisting China to propaganda has become a serious problem. "</p>
<p>Dusterberg also pointed out that the strict supervision of Chinese e -commerce in the United States is also related to the principle of equivalent: "Unlike these Chinese companies that can enter the United States, social platforms and retailers in the United States cannot enter the Chinese market. In principle, American officials are more cautious and reasonable about Chinese companies. "</p>
<p>In response to byte beating and denying data with the Chinese government, Dusterberg said: "There is evidence to directly display Tiktok to share data with the Chinese government, and they also secretly monitor American journalists. It's not honest. "</p>

<p><strong> Scholars: The US government is worried about the opaque information of Chinese corporate information </strong>Yu Maochun, director of the China Center of the Hudson Institute, took Alibaba as an example to explain to reporters why the United States kept vigilant for Chinese companies: "The CCP's full -time reception of Alibaba is a very important lesson. This is not to say that these China is in China. E -commerce giants must be the CCP's national security and intelligence agencies, but in China, this kind of country that the Communist Party controls all. Once any company occupies a considerable position in the world's consumer market, China will not hesitate to supervise and control. This is an important consideration for national security for the United States. "</p>
<p>Yu Maochun also expressed his view that is similar to Dusterberg: "In principle of business -to -law, the American e -commerce market is very open, so China's e -commerce market is open to the American e -commerce company in the United States. The degree is completely different. Therefore, the United States has reasons to control China's e -commerce companies into the US market according to the principle of business opportunities. This is not surprising. "</p>

<p><strong> Tags: error, misleading </strong></p>
<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>It is expected that at the end of June, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will announce the complete evaluation report of the Final Edition of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station. According to the previous report, the IAEA probability will support the Japanese plan. In response to the disposal of the Fukushima accident wastewater, all parties internationally resurrected disputes.</p>
<p>On June 5th, Li Song, a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency in China, at the IAEA monthly council <a href="http://vienna.china-mission.gov.cn/dbthd/202306/t20230606_11090145.htm">accusations</a>Japan's decision has no scientific basis, so that the risk of pollution of Fukushima nuclear accidents to neighboring countries and surrounding environments. On June 7, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Wenbin further further at the Beijing Routine Press Conference.(https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/202306/t20230607_11091218.shtml)The Japanese government has repeatedly "whitewashed" nuclear sewage. In the case of "not fully demonstrated other disposal plans", "unilaterally decided" rows, to treat the ocean as its own sewer. Guided by this official public opinion, there are a lot of information such as "huge harm" in Chinese social media.</p>
<p>However, the Laboratory of Asian facts found that these claims are not based. Although the processing water of Japan's planned emissions cannot reach perfection, according to the standard of IAEA and the current standards in China, they have reached a safe level. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also suspected of misleading the allegations of Japan's "no full demonstration" and "unilateral decision". Since the Fukushima accident, Japan has proposed a variety of wastewater disposal methods to demonstrate, and IAEA has also participated in the research and evaluation process many times.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Water storage equipment, which has a water storage equipment with more than 1.3 million cubic meters of Fukushima Nuclear Power Station in Hakurabeach, has recently become the focus of international public opinion. Tokyo Power Company plans to start discharge of about 400,000 cubic meters of emissions this summer to complete the processing water of the ALPS purification process. It also pointed out that its discharge behavior is controllable and scientifically evaluated the "safety emissions" standard based on the scientific evaluation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>However, the Fukushima Hydrants Plan has been questioned by environmental protection organizations and some countries, especially China. The Chinese foreign department has recently expressed their continuous statements, questioning whether the Japanese sewage sewage is "really harmless", and said that the move "did not fully demonstrate other disposal plans" and was "unilaterally determined".</p>
<p>Wang Wenbin accused Japan of "irresponsible" remarks spreading a lot in Chinese and social media, and was further extended to interpret. Social media has begun to have "huge harm" remarks on nuclear waste water. Douyin, Tiktok and other platforms have circulated "Fukushima nuclear waste water contains more than 60 radioactive elements" and "half -life is up to 5000 years" and so on.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T16-09-53-04-00/000002.png" />There are a large number of comments on Japanese social media about Japanese nuclear wastewater discharge videos (picture/social media screenshots) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06232023160018.html/p1-793e4ea45a924f53622a56fe.png">![] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T16-09-53-04-00/000003.png)</a><strong> Is there a "huge harm" in Japan's row wastewater? </strong></p>
<p>The full name of "ALPS processing water" by Japan's planned "ALPS processing water" ADVANCED Liquid ProcessingSystem, an advanced liquid processing system, the international atomic energy agency pointed out that this is a pumping and filtering system that can effectively remove 62 radioactives from contaminated water -except radioactivity Alitium (Tritium).</p>
<p>素 is the isotope of hydrogen. The chemical formula is T or 3H, and the number of neutron is one more than hydrogen, also known as heavy hydrogen. 会 is similar to hydrogen, which combines oxygen to form a compound of HTO -like water. It exists in the trace of natural water, human and natural environment, and its sorbe is also widely used in the field of light, lighting, lighting and other fields.</p>
<p>The radioactive half -life is 12.32 years. The half-life of the water of the water is 7-14 days. That is to say, if you drink 1 liter of water full of 1,500 Becks, stay in the body about 750 Baker after a week.</p>
<p>BECQUEREL is a radioactive intensity <a href="https://www.chinansc.cn/gzxc/bwbd/hyfsjczsxgwt/201705/t20170503_550625.html">International General Unit</a>The radioactive strength is mainly to evaluate how many atomic nuclei are declining per second.</p>
<p>The discharge of water -containing water to the sea is the final treatment method that China, including 55 nuclear power units, also adopts the world. Under the guidance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Japan will be discharged into the sea, and the ALPS processing water will be diluted again. China's diplomatic system has always declared that the "processing water" that has been purified by ALPS cannot be "compared" with the normal running drainage of nuclear power plants, but it does not demonstrate the difference.</p>
<p>Davidkrofcheck, an associate professor of the University of Austland of New Zealand, clearly states that the water that has been discharged by Japan is the same as the safety level of the wastewater of the Nuclear Power Station, which is the same as that of water purified by ALPS. Before emissions, the concentration of the 度 was diluted to 1500 Berg/per liter, or even the World Health Organization <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wash-documents/water-safety-and-quality/dwq-guidelines-4/gdwq4-with-add1-chap9.pdf?sfvrsn=6fc78cae_3">Suggesting drinking water</a>The standard of 10,000 Beck/about one -seventh of each liter. At the briefing hosted by the Science Mediacentre of New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan, Crovcheque answered the question from the Asian facts to investigate the laboratory in the Laboratory, and he would eat the local fishing fish.According to the official website of the Ministry of Economic and Industry, <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/atw.html">Information</a>The carbon-14 cannot be completely removed through the ALPS purification process. However, the Ministry of Production and Economic Owners pointed out that the carbon-14 content in the storage tank is far lower than the regulatory standards of Japanese countries. After dilution, the carbon 14 content will be reduced to up to one thousandths of the Japanese national standards.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Economic and Industry, Japan, before the ALPS processing water, other radioactive substances except the cymbal is purified and diluted, the impact on the environment can be ignored.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T16-09-53-04-00/000004.png" />Officially released wastewater discharge plan and influence schematic diagram (Figure/Japanese Economic and Industry Provincial website) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06232023160018.html/p2-4ea77ecf7701622a56fe-7b804f53-526f672c.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T16-09-53-04-00/000005.png" /></a>Therefore, the "great harm" of Japanese nuclear waste water rumored by Chinese social media said that there is no scientific evidence that is sufficient to evidence.</p>
<p><strong> Are China's nuclear power wastewater standards higher? </strong></p>
<p>Since the 2011 East Japan Earthquake has led to an accident in the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, China, which has developed nuclear power at full speed, has also strengthened the management of nuclear energy security and improved a series of security regulations. However, the wastewater in Japan's plan is in accordance with the standards that China is implemented, which is also in line with regulations.</p>
<p>In September 2011, China implemented a new <a href="http://english.mee.gov.cn/Resources/standards/Radioactivity/radiation/201111/W020110309343679722427.pdf">"Regulations on the Protection of Environmental Radiation of Nuclear Power Factory"</a>(GB6249-2011) and <a href="https://www.mee.gov.cn/ywgz/fgbz/bz/bzwb/hxxhj/fsxhjbz/201103/W020191222415914838455.pdf">"Technical Requirements for Radioactive Liquid Discharge Emissions of Nuclear Power Plant"</a>(GB14587-2011), which improves the total control requirements of the radioactive substance emissions of nuclear power plants, and conduct a hierarchical management of the sensitivity of the location of the nuclear power plant-Binhai Nuclear Power Plant radioactive outflow regulations except 氚 and carbon14, except The concentration of other radioactin should not exceed 1,000 Barges per liter; the nuclear power plant of the lakes, rivers and reservoirs is 100 Baker per liter. In 2020, China submitted the latest performance based on IAEA's "Safety and Radiovision Safety Safety Safety Safety Safety Convention on Latinos Management" <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/china-7rm_chinese.pdf">Report</a>Essence</p>
<p>However, even if the control requirements have been improved, China's above national standards do not specify the concentration limit of the Binhai nuclear power plant emissions and carbon-14. The upper limit of the emission concentration is 1000 Berg/L.</p>
<p>The former State Administration of Environmental Protection was also [Announcement] in 2007 <a href="https://www.mee.gov.cn/gkml/zj/haq/200910/t20091022_173026.htm">Announcement</a>The approval of the radioactive concentration control value of the Binhai Nuclear Power Station in the Qinshan Third Nuclear Power Station was relaxed from the original 370 Baker per liter to 3,700 Bake per liter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T16-09-53-04-00/000006.png" />Former State Administration of Environmental Protection of China approved the relaxation limit of Qinshan's third nuclear power plant (Figure/Screenshot of the official website of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06232023160018.html/p3-751f600173af588390e8622a56fe.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T16-09-53-04-00/000007.png" /></a>___</p>
<p>In other words, Dongdian's Fukushima ALPS processing water this time is to deal with water. The limit of the 氚 concentration is about 1/2 of the allowable emissions concentration limit after the adjustment of the China Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in 2007.</p>
<p>In addition, in the total amount of liquid liquid 的, in 2016, the National Nuclear Safety Administration of the Ministry of Environmental Protection <a href="https://www.mee.gov.cn/gkml/sthjbgw/haq/201610/t20161012_365398.htm">approval</a>The total annual emission limit of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station base is 8.04e+14bq, which is 800 mega Bake.</p>
<p>The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station was in the "Nuclear Safety Information Report" in 2022 <a href="https://www.cnnp.com.cn/cnnp/resource/cms/article/1086607/1309623/QS-5EM-RCEM-23032701%20%E7%A7%A6%E5%B1%B1%E6%A0%B8%E7%94%B5%E6%A0%B8%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%80%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A%EF%BC%882022%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89.pdf">point out</a>At that time, only about 25%of the total was used, and the conversion was 2.01E+14BQ, that is, 201 trillion Bake, which is far from the official Japanese predictable Fukushima nuclear power plant to deal with the valuation of about 22 mega Bark per year.</p>
<p>? **China also accused Japan without providing sufficient scientific and factual basis to solve the concerns of the international rowing plans, the effectiveness of purifying the device, the reliability of nuclear pollution water data, and the uncertainty of environmental impact.</p>
<p>However, according to the verification of the laboratory in Asian facts, these allegations are inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>Since 2011, Japan has been regularly to <a href="https://www.iaea.org/topics/response/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-accident/fukushima-daiichi-alps-treated-water-discharge">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>Submit the progress and monitoring report of the accident handling of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant.(https://www.tepco.co.jp/en/hd/decommission/index-e.html), Explain the progress of processing, even setting the increase in ALPS processing water <a href="https://www.tepco.co.jp/zh-cn/decommission/progress/watertreatment/index-cn.html">Chinese and Korean special page</a>It is hoped that it will have better communication with neighboring countries who read Chinese and Korean, and regularly announce the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station every month <a href="https://www.tepco.co.jp/en/hd/decommission/data/index-e.html">Related Monitoring Data</a> 。</p>

<p>The Japanese Embassy in China pointed out that the Japanese side regularly reports to the embassy and media briefing from countries including China, including China, every month.</p>
<p>Regarding the communication performance of Japan and the international community on the problem of nuclear waste water treatment and disposal, at the briefing meeting of the aforementioned scientific media center, TonyHooker, a professor of physics, chemistry and Earth Sciences, Australia's University of Aders. Japan is scientifically, international, and data transparent. It is already very open and willing to communicate.</p>
<p>Japan proposed 5 ways to deal with ALPS processing water in 2016. After the final confirmation of the sea in April 2021, it was actively seeking international atomic energy agencies to participate and supervised the entire sea programs. IAEA composed <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-holds-first-meeting-of-international-task-force-set-up-to-review-safety-of-fukushima-treated-water-release">Special Working Group</a>Among them, scientists including China and 11 countries have visited Japan in the past two years, held dozens of meetings, and published 6 related <a href="https://www.iaea.org/topics/response/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-accident/fukushima-daiichi-alps-treated-water-discharge/reports">report</a>Specifies specific suggestions.</p>
<p>During the period, the special working group also independent third -party laboratories including Austria, Switzerland, France, South Korea, and the United States <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/first_interlaboratory_comparison_on_the_determination_of_radionuclides_in_alps_treated_water.pdf">cooperation</a>Confirm that Japan's ALPS processing water can achieve international standards that avoid harmful to the environment and the human body. The special working group at the end of this year <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-task-force-on-fukushima-daiichi-treated-water-release-conducts-final-mission-to-japan-prior-to-publication-of-its-safety-assessment">last time to Fukushima</a>To confirm that the final version of the final version of the report can form a reference indicator from the harmful influence of radiation substances in the future.</p>
<p>The Asian factual inspection of the laboratory sent a letter to IAEA, and asked the conclusion of the last evaluation of the special working group recently. As of press time, it has not received a reply.</p>
<p>The discharge of wastewater in nuclear power plants is indeed full of controversy, and China is not the only opponent. Including <a href="https://tchina.kyodonews.net/news/2023/06/b7d81935515c.html">Fishermen in Japan</a><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/59193/science-environmental-protection-international-law-g7-japans-fukushima-water-discharge/">Green Peace Organization</a>, The marine ecological community still opposes the Euki Planning Plan of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, and they are full of doubts about the consequences of wastewater discharge. According to Crovcchatk, this is also related to the slow speed of dealing the crisis as soon as possible in that year, but as a physicist, what he wants to remind the world is that the radioactive crisis after the Fukushima nuclear accident was dealt with. Forty years of way, we must avoid the next earthquake that may cause more serious nuclear -related crises. The treatment water of more than 1,000 barrels cannot be ignored by the seaside, but in all options, in his opinion, the rowing sea is a "least bad choice."</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong><em> Asian factual checkup laboratory (</em> <em>ASIA FACT Check Lab__) is a new unit established for today's complex media environment and emerging ecology. We were in the journalistic major, providing correct investigation reports and in -depth reports, and we look forward to readers a diverse and comprehensive understanding of public issues.

<h1>Fatal assistance? New Year: Chinese company transports a lot of gunpowder to the Russian factories</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T17-02-00-04-00/000000.png" />Polytechnologies, a display booth set up at the Baghdad International Defense and Security Exhibition, was taken on March 13, 2013. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/11-06232023165735.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-23T17-02-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Agence France -Presse information picture</p>
<p>Poly Technology, a Chinese state-owned enterprise Poly Group, transported tens of thousands of kilograms of fire-free fuchants to a Russian military factory-Balinur ammunition factory last year, and its number was enough to make at least 80 million bullets. The train that transported gunpowder entered Russia from the back Bugask port on the border of the Baikal.</p>
<p>According to the United States "New York Times" on the 23rd, these previously not reported goods were discovered by the US trade data aggregate "Import Genius", which caused new questions about the role of Beijing's role in the Russia and Ukraine War. U.S. officials have always expressed concerns about the so -called "fatal aid" to Russia to send to Russia, although they have not explicitly stated that China has transported such goods.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Anthonyblinken said when visiting China on Monday that China has guaranteed the United States that it will not provide Russia with fatal aid for the Ukrainian battlefield, and the US government "has not seen any circumstances" to refute this, but He said that the United States was worried about "Chinese private companies that might provide assistance."</p>
<p>Since the Russia and Ukraine War, Poly Technology has transported nearly $ 2 million in goods transported to the Balube ammunition factory. Some experts say this has constituted such fatal aid. According to customs records, Poly Technology intends to allow these gunpowder to use the bullets of the Karashnikov assault rifle and sniper rifle in Russia.</p>
<p>Williamgeorge, director of the "Import Elf" company research department, told the New York Times that the meaning of these gunpowder exports is very clear. It is not reasonable to cause fatal effects on the battlefield. "Alexander Gabuev, director of the Cunki Moscow Center, also said," This is fatal support ", but the problem is influence and scale How big is it.</p>
<p>It is reported that there is no known direct connection between the fire -free fuchants and the Ukrainian battlefield. Poly Technology Company describes these gunpowder as "for the production of foreign shotguns" in customs documents. However, the Safety Research Center Sino -Russian expert Briancarlson told the New York Times that although these magazines can indeed be used for hunting, it is very rare. He said: "These are military magazines." In addition, this kind of fire -free barrel was also used as ammunition for mortars by the army.</p>
<p>The New York Times pointed out that Poly Technology Co., Ltd. had previously undergone sanctions by the US government because it was selling missile technology around the world and providing support to Iran. The Baluer ammunition factory is a private factory in central Russia, but has signed a large number of contracts with the Russian government and the military in the past ten years. The factory was included in the sanctions list by the European Union last December.</p>

<p>The world's most striking billionaire -CEO Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Markzuckerberg shouted each other to compete with each other.</p>
<p>Musk said on Twitter on the 20th that he was ready to "fight a cage" with Zuckerberg at any time. The owner of Facebook and Instagram's parent company Metaplatform Zuckerberg was not outdone, and then released a screenshot of the screen of Musk's tweet, and wrote "Send me the location".</p>
<p>Musk did not shrink back, and soon responded to Zuckerberg and said, "Vegas Octagon."</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Octopus Hall is a place where many ultimate combat championships (UFC).</p>
<p>Musk, who is about to usher in the 52nd birthday at the end of this month, said on Twitter: "I have a very powerful action, called‘ Marine ’. I just need to lie on the opponent and do nothing.”</p>
<p>He also wrote: "In addition to holding my child and" throwing them 'into the air, I almost never exercise. "</p>
<p>Contrary to Maska, 39 -year -old Zuckerberg was trained by Mixed Martial Arts and recently won the Jiu -Jitsu Championship.</p>
<p>The two world -class richest people's remarks quickly spread in the social media community, which also made many people talk about it and talk about who will win this fighting competition.</p>
<p>However, with Musk's past remarks, it is difficult to say whether Musk and Zuckerberg are really fighting. Musk often does not cover it. For example, he said in April this year that he would let his dog be the CEO of Twitter, or he said in 2018 Essence Musk has only fulfilled his promise to resign from the position of CEO of Twitter.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this cage fighting competition will start, Metaplatform has demonstrated a social network plan to compete with the Twitter platform earlier this month. Even if Musk and Zuckerberg did not start in Las Vegas, I believe that it will be fighting in the social platform market soon.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-23T19-26/000000.png" />Barclays analysts believe that with Tesla's recent challenging fundamentals, the recent rise of the stock price seems too fierce. (Reuters)</p>
<h4>Tesla Inc (Nasdaq Stock Exchange code: TSLA)</h4>
<p>As many market analysts expect consumers' demand for cars, and the competition in the Chinese market will increase, the electric vehicle giant Tesla's stock will be lowered in a second time in just a few trading days. The stock plummeted 5.5 % on Wednesday (21st), but recovered a small part overnight.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley lowered Tesla's rating from "Overweight" to "equalweight" from "Overweight", and adjusted its target price from $ 200 to $ 250. Although the target price is raised, this new target price is 5.5 % less than the closing price overnight.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley analysis team's view of Tesla is that the valuation of Sla's stock is now reaching a reasonable level.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adamjonas said: "We do not say that Tesla's stock price rose will end '. Instead, it is found that investors have always existed in Tesla's stock price trend. There are some doubts. Although Tesla shares have rebounded recently, we expect Tesla's currently recognized profit forecast and will have a large negative correction. "</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley analysis team also believes that the "intensified competition" from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and the slowdown in consumers' demand for cars have brought greater risks to Tesla stocks. Jonas predicts that in the next 12 months, Tesla's stock price is expected to climb to $ 450 in the case of the bull market, and it can be retreated to $ 90 in the bear market.</p>
<p>Although the rating was lowered, Jonas still felt that Tesla's shares were "the stocks that must be owned" in the investor's electric vehicle investment portfolio, and the stock was also the "flag bearer" leading electric transportation and renewable energy economy.</p>
<p>In addition to Morgan Stanley, Danlevy, an analyst at Barclays, also reduced Tesla's stock rating from "increasing" to "level" on Wednesday. Liva adjusted Tesla's target price from the previous $ 220 to $ 260. This new target price is also lower than Tesla's closure market price overnight.</p>
<p>Levy said that with Tesla's recent challenging fundamentals, the recent rise of the stock price seemed too violent. He reminded investors not to forget the profit and demand of Tesla cars. This series of problems is still worrying.</p>
<p>Although Tesla's stock price has continued to decline in the past two trading days, last week, the stock still rose about 6 % as a whole. In June alone, the stock had risen by about 30 %. Before the stock price fell last Wednesday, Tesla also set a record of 13 consecutive rises. Although Tesla's stock price is still 36 % lower than the 414 US $ 414 historical high in November 2021, the stock price has risen by 144.78 % since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>No wonder among the 30 analysts of Tipranks, although 14 are rated to "buy" Tesla shares, there are also 12 "holding" rating, and even four "sell" rating. The average target price they give is $ 216.72, which means that they think that Tesla's stock price may fall by 18.10 %.</p>

<p>On May 26, Russia began to transport nuclear weapons to White Ross and start a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Beros. This is the first time that Moscow has deployed nuclear weapons abroad since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, causing concerns in the West.</p>
<p>It is irresponsible for Western countries to criticize the deployment of nuclear weapons overseas in Russia. Russian President Putin has deployed tactical nuclear weapons in the territory of the United States for decades. Therefore, it is not unusual to do so in Russia. It is reported that the United States has about 200 tactical nuclear weapons and half deployed at European bases.</p>
