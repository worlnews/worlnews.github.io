Xie Feng told the media at New York Airport that she came to enhance the exchange and cooperation between China and the United States and to defend the interests of China.

Xie Feng admits, "At present, Sino -US relations have suffered serious difficulties and are facing severe challenges." The three principles of "mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation" proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping are the root causes of China and the United States in the new period.

### Who is Xie Feng?

Xie Feng, 59, is regarded as "American". According to public information, he graduated from the Chinese School of Foreign Affairs and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the 1980s. He was fluent in English and familiar with the work of the United States. He used to be a counselor and spokesman in the United States, the Minister of the United States, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In 2017, Xie Feng served as a special commissioner in Hong Kong, during which the anti -repair movement broke out in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong "Sing Tao Daily", which is pro -built by the position, stated that Xie Feng criticized "street violence" at that time, such as virus raging, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong was appreciated by high -level appreciation for "daring to fight." In 2021, Xie Feng was transferred to the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, and he was in charge of the US affairs.

US State Department spokesman Matthewmiller said the United States welcomes Xie Feng and looks forward to cooperating with him. He reiterated: "As we said on many occasions, we are still committed to maintaining communication channels with the People's Republic of China to manage competition responsible."

### "War Wolf" or the problem solveor?

In January of this year, Qin Gang, the former Chinese ambassador to the United States, left his office and returned to China as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since then, Sino -US relations have deteriorated. The shortage of the job for more than 4 months is the longest since the normalization of Sino -US relations in 1979.

Xie Feng, an experienced diplomat with rich experience in the United States, has been appointed as the Chinese Embassy in the United States. It is regarded as a signal that Beijing may intend to thaw relationship with the United States. Reuters pointed out that for a long time, the Chinese ambassador to the United States has a long vacancy, and now it is finally sending people to a new one, which may help Beijing to fight back on the criticism of its ignorance of the Biden government calling for strengthening contact.

Bonnieglaser, an expert at the Marshall Foundation in the United States, told Reuters that China "finally decided to send Xie Feng, partly because of the to prevent spiral deterioration of bilateral relations." She said that as an experienced diplomat, Xie Feng was very familiar with American decision makers. If he is willing to promote better communication between China and the United States.

The Wall Street Journal also believes that "this may indicate that although a series of diplomatic disputes have occurred recently, Beijing is still willing to improve communication." Politico said that there were sources in the Huafu diplomatic circle at the beginning of the year. Ambassador, not the current assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying. According to the news, when Hua Chunying was a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she was notorious because of sharp counterattacks on foreign critics. The choice of Xie Feng in Chinese seniors may mean that they are more inclined to choose a less rude dialogue to alleviate bilateral dislikes.

In addition to the criticism of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, and criticizing the anti -repair campaign, in July 2021, he talked with the visiting US Deputy Secretary of State Weierman, who visited the United States, and once rebuked the US government to "highly height to China" The misunderstanding mentality and dangerous policy "required" correcting errors "and accused Washington's own creation of a" imaginary enemy "in China.

In February this year, after the "spy ball" incident in China, Sino -US relations have worsen. At that time, Xie Feng represented the Chinese government and shot down the "Chinese civilian unmanned airship" on the United States and proposed to the head of the U.S. embassy in China.

Politico quoted the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susanshirk, a former deputy assistant to the Clinton government, that Xie Feng's style should now be adjusted. Xie Shuli said: "War Wolf diplomacy is not smooth in Washington. If he (Xie Feng) is more like a warrior instead of a problem resolved, I will be very surprised."

However, the U.S. State Department then denied that Washington was considering canceling the idea of Li Shangfu's sanctions. US State Department spokesman Miller said: "We have no plan to cancel him or a wider sanctions against him or China."

In 2018, the US State Department announced that Li Shangfu, then Minister of Equipment Development of the CPC Central Committee, was listed as a sanctions object with Russian military fire merchants.

What is this? This is the brutal declaration of war to civilization, declaration of war to justice, and slavery to the freedom of war.

Today is May 24, 2023. To this day, Russia has launched a "illegal, unprovoed and unreasonable war war war" for Ukraine, it has been fifteen months; the Ukrainian war bravely fights against Russian devils, it has been fifteen months; the majority of the United Nations member states It has been done for fifteen months for all -round support and assistance to Ukraine. To this day, the ending of the Russian and Ukraine War is no longer slightly closer, but is about to be in the world -May 19, 5 days ago, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Seven Nostalgia of Japan. The Summit was held in Hiroshima; in the "Statement of the Leaders of the Seventh Kingdoms Group on Ukraine" issued on the same day, the fifth point was "supporting Ukrainian recovery and reconstruction", the eighth point is "liability for damage compensation", and the ninth point is " Crime. " Whose crime is investigated? Of course, it is the crime of investigating the Russian war criminals of the defeated country. The Seven Kingdoms Group solemnly mentioned the official schedule, indicating that they were full of confidence in Ukraine's upcoming defeat Russia.

And how will the victory of Ukraine come? The premise of "never allows Russia to threaten the use of nuclear weapons during the invasion of Ukraine, not to mention the actual use of nuclear weapons" (quoted from the "Statement of the Leaders of the Seven Kingdoms Group on Ukraine").

In the past fifteen months, how to effectively stop Putin's lonely injection and use nuclear weapons to change the war process in the international anti -aggression camp, it has been thoughtful and painstaking. It should be said that even if you retreat 10,000 steps, Putin's nuclear nuclear will not change the ending of the Russian and Ukraine War. However, the catastrophic consequences of war are much more serious. Out of the responsible consideration of avoiding such consequences, three strict self -restrictions have been made for Ukraine's strong backing international anti -aggression camps: 1. Do not send troops to participate in the war directly. 2. Do not let warfire overflow in Ukraine. 3. It is better to squeeze on the provision of weapons to Ukraine. At the same time, use a variety of high -tech methods and multiple acquisitions to obtain intelligence, and closely monitor the movement of the Russian nuclear arsenal, so that their anti -commissioned power and nuclear strike force are prepared Study in the cradle, or limits it to a relatively minimum harm.

In the past fifteen months, Russia's military strength has been proven, and the timing of decision has come. If people regard the "Statement of the Leaders of the Seven Domestic Groups" as the ultimatum issued to Russia, I think it is inseparable from eight or nine. In addition, I noticed that "Statement" announced that "continuing to take action to provide substantial support for Russia's war in the war of Russia", and also seriously warned the so -called neutral "persuasion" such as Brazilian President Lula: If you are The Russian army and military equipment have not been completely withdrawn and unconditional, and it is impossible to achieve fair peace, so this must be included in any peaceful plan.

Three days ago, on May 21st, the President Zelezki warned at the Hiroshima press conference during the Ukrainian war: If the world does not unite to oppose the Russian invaders, "other criminals who are sitting in big positions want to launch a similar war. It's just a matter of time. " Following, Zeleizaki decided to declare in the attitude of victor the country: Ukraine's peace plan is to make Russia a "last invader". "We will eliminate other potential aggressors. When the world's defense is firm, they will dispel the idea of war. "However, I think it is necessary to make Russia a" last invader "on the planet and make other potential invaders dare not dare to launch the war. The thoughts are implemented, and there is something that it seems to be done, that is: the State Council of the Security Council of the Russia who defeats the country and Russia; the establishment of the United Nations Security Council's institutional settings and permissions arrangements.

Over the past fifteen months, the UN Security Council, the top legal institution in the world, is in vain, but even a paper statement that condemns Russia's aggression cannot be issued, let alone the intervention of stopping aggression. If the Security Council does not make fundamental reforms, and still retains a privilege of a one -vote veto of the permanent member of the country, if the strategic partner of a permanent member country will move the evil thoughts in the future, especially if it is still a permanent member of the nuclear, Is the Security Council just the deaf ears? Can the international anti -aggression camp only watch the military and civilians of the invaded national and civilians fighting alone and sprinking their homes alone?

In my opinion, the reform of the United Nations Security Council should achieve the following goals: if there are still aggressors who dare to risk the world after Russia, no matter what their identity and nuclear support, the Security Council can make decisions decisively. The United Nations Army went to the country of aggressive, fighting side by side with the military and civilians of the country, fighting the invasive devils as soon as possible, and then warning the defeated aggressive country to nuclear and militaryization.

I believe that with the final victory of the Ukrainian Patriotic War, humans will usher in a milestone new victory, new victory in justice and freedom.

####  Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners

### The initial ally

On the second day of the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the Soviet Union became the first country to establish diplomatic relations with China. At the end of the year, Mao Zedong went to Moscow to visit and stayed in the Soviet Union for more than two months to participate in the 70 -year -old Japanese celebration life movement (picture).

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T02-42-00-04-00/000000.png)China has used digital RMB in 17 provinces and cities. In May, public institutions such as Changshu Civil Service issued digital RMB wages. [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt-05252023024141.html/@@images/image)Screenshot of Weibo [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt-05252023024141.html/@@stream)In late April this year, the official media reported high -profile that Changshu Civil Service and employees of public institutions in May were settled with digital currencies in May. As a pilot project, there are already seventeen provinces and cities to pay for digital RMB for salaries, but whether digital currency can be popularized still remains to be observed.

[** Where does the real estate registration and civil servants use digital RMB paid to synchronize their finger? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/ec-04262023081934.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-04222023164207.html)**

Not long ago, the official media reported high -profile that starting in May, Changshu City, Jiangsu Province, has issued a full number of wages in the editors and other people in Jiangsu Province. The Changshu Local Financial Supervision Bureau and the Changshu Municipal Finance Bureau recently issued the "Notice on the Implementation of the Full Digital RMB Issuance" stated that starting in May, it has been compiled by civil servants (including public officers), public institutions, and each of them The personnel of the state -funded unit implement the full salary of the salary.

For a time, Digital RMB became a hot topic of live broadcast platforms, but the caliber of the live broadcast owner was consistent, and there was no question: "From May, all civil servants of Changshu, including public institutions and state -owned enterprises, all of them were issued by digital RMB. Buy online online. Buy online online. East and west, shopping, bus, and seeing a doctor can use digital renminbi. "" The salary of civil servants has to change. Recently, a notification has been issued. Since May, all civil servants and public institutions in the city have already. ... "," Jiangsu Changshu starts in May, all public officials will use digital RMB ... "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T02-42-00-04-00/000001.png)At present, Digital RMB can only be used online, and should not be used offline like banknotes. (Network screenshot/ancient pavilion provided) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt-05252023024141.html/m0525-gtp2.png)** Official media promotes digital RMB folk reflection of multiple negative **

Judging from a series of reports such as CCTV News and other official media, at present, digital RMB can only be used online, not as official, but it can be used offline or mobile phone. On social platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and Douyin, no digital RMB users are commented.

Ma Ting, an industry insider who is concerned about digital currency, said in an interview with Radio Free Asia on Thursday that digital RMB has difficulty overcoming obstacles. She said: "There is no offline state, that is, the hardware that is not used without networking, is the offline mode that you support when you are not connected to the Internet. There is no such hardware. You can only use it offline to become a real currency."

Ma Ting said that at present, no matter online payment or offline payment, digital RMB encounters problems: "Condesses will occur online, such as blockchain and Bitcoin transactions. In the case of large -scale transactions, they will actually occur. It will be congested for one to two hours. Then non -blockchain will also be congested on the line, which we have this experience when we use it. I don't think these non -commercial institutions make things better than Alipay and WeChat payments. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T02-42-00-04-00/000002.png)At the China International Services Trade Fair held in Beijing in 2022, the booth (Reuters picture) of China Digital RMB

** Digital RMB research and development has not resolved offline use problems for nearly ten years **

China has developed a digital RMB payment system in 2014, but it has not made breakthrough progress. The public account "Sisyphus" wrote that not only did Digital RMB not popular, but the sound became smaller and smaller, and even some people had forgotten it. The biggest obstacle is the technical reason why the digital RMB has not been promoted in a large scale. The article wrote that when the digital wallet was designed at the beginning, it was mainly offline mode, and the transaction was supported through offline smart devices. But this requires a built -in hardware on the phone, or buying a smart device on the body separately, but this hardware device may be cracked, and once it is cracked, it will cause great trouble.

Even if the digital RMB payment has an offline model, the person who picks up smart devices can immediately consume arbitrarily, which is more loser than the loss of wallets with cash. Another online article wrote that after demonstration, the experts concluded that "to install a micro -chip or external chip on the mobile phone, but after the relevant software is cracked, the currency flow in the offline state cannot be controlled. After the network mode, I found that the money in the account had been transferred, and even the account information may be formatted in the offline state. "

Many non -civil servants' netizens have resisted digital RMB. Some netizens posted that they had to transfer wages from digital wallets to bank cards. This is not more. Some netizens have suggested that digital RMB is only forced to use in the civil servant system, and do not expand the scope. Mr. Qin, a netizen, told this station that he opposed Digital RMB: "The government's digital RMB, it (government) can master all the paths of money you use, and can directly freeze your money, even clear zero. Digital RMB can be like a health code. Pay the red code at any time. If you go to the government for salary or the house is forced to petition, you can also freeze your wallet. "

For a number of social platforms such as Weibo, there are no netizens who have received digital RMB salary comments. Ma Ting said that civil servants' social media accounts have been registered in the unit, and they are prohibited from publishing negative comments: "I did not see their experience of using digital currency because civil servants now do not let them go online. So they dare not speak randomly. Complaint. Digital currency is now using civil servants. "

"The Chinese people are highly confident in China's global influence." The report shows that among China, the United States, Russia, and the European Union, and the United Nations, Chinese interviewees regard China as the world's largest influence, with an average score of 4.36 (average score of 4.36 ( 5 points are full), and the second place in the United States is 4.22 points. In addition, 90%of the people believe that China's global influence has increased (90.4%) 5 years ago, and will continue to increase (90.8%) in the next ten years.

Current affairs commentator Ma Ju interprets Tsinghua's polls only "funny". He believes that this is a series of so -called national security policies for Xi Jinping: "This poll is the tough policy for the Communist Party and Xi Jinping's next tough policy. , Even if war behavior is preheated in advance, or a series of publicity in advance. I hope everyone is alert to what is happening. "

Song Guocheng, a researcher at the International Research Center of Taiwan Politburo, told this station that the Chinese Communist Party has continuously used the method of deleting historical memory to brainwash young generations, and praises the greatness of the Communist Party of China in the world. China is the world's number one and how China affects the world. It can be seen from the polls that China's totalitarian rule creates a spiritual cage, promotes a fence, and allows young generations to be in a state of information closure. It is impossible to have an objective international outlook.

"(China) The young generation has lacks objective vision and the background and foundation of objective knowledge, and judges that China is actually facing the point of isolation and helpless internationally, so it lacks the world outlook and observe the changes in the world." Song Guocheng said.

Song Guocheng further pointed out that whether the digital or values are fraudulent, the more the CCP is in the international unfavorable situation. The more the facts need to be fabricated to promote the opposite facts to avoid the internal people from understanding the real situation of their country, and then do not believe in the Communist Party.

According to polls, the Chinese people regard major epidemic diseases, territorial leadership disputes, and US -China relations as the three major international security issues that China should give priority. The report pointed out that although the conflict of confrontation between the United States and China is one of the most worried international security issues that the Chinese people are, nearly 50 % of the interviewed people believe that US -China relations will improve in the future, and the respondents who will continue to decline will only be 24.76. %.

In addition, about 80 % of respondents believe that the main responsibility of the Ukraine crisis is in the United States and Western countries, and that Russia has less than 10 % of the main responsibility.

Ma Ju said that the Chinese people believe that the interests of the United States and China are greater than the differences, and there are room for cooperation because there are many interaction of interests. But he believes that this is already the past. If you still understand this today, you are deceiving himself.

"Because the current contradiction between China and the United States is not simple and inconsistent, the core conflict is already a conflict between you and my life." Ma Ju said, "The so-called de-Risk now in the United States is to give the interest groups in the United States on Wall Street more. With more time withdrawing from China and avoiding risks. "

** 90 % of the Chinese people advocate being threatened to use soldiers overseas **

At the same time, more than 90%(90.34%) of the public also advocated that when the personal safety of Chinese citizens was seriously threatened, soldiers could be used overseas.Ma Ju said that China claims that the great rejuvenation of the nation will inevitably move, and it is already a formal style, which is a terrible reality. But few Chinese people really understand this stupid movement, how much harm to their country, people, and even the world. He believes that the Chinese people do not understand this and even deliberately avoid them.

### 40 years, hundreds of times against Taiwan's military sales case

The United States sold weapons to Taiwan, which originated from the United States and Taipei in 1979. Instead of establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing, the Taiwan Relations Law was formulated. After the evacuation of the US military in Taiwan, the United States began to provide defensive military military in accordance with the law. According to a memorandum established by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, the performance of the United States provided weapons to Taiwan "depends on the threat of the Chinese Communist Party."

### Turn Taiwan into a "fortress"

In recent years, with the continuous growth of Chinese military equipment and the increasingly tense US -China relations, the types of weapons sold to Taiwan have also changed. Grylesman, a researcher at Rand Corporation in the United States(Derek Grossman)In an interview with Voice of Germany in mid-October, "the United States sold many different types of weapons in Taiwan in the past, sometimes weapons that can improve Taiwan's asymmetric defense combat power, and sometimes it is an iconic weapon like the F-16 fighter. However, the United States now seems to have made a clear adjustment of Taiwan's military aid policy. "He believes that in order to prevent China from invading Taiwan through amphibious landing, the United States will assist Taiwan to become a" indestructible fortress ".

### How to deal with it?

The past U.S. military sales cases have caused Beijing's opposition, but in most cases, they are limited to verbal protests. On October 26, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press conference that China will impose sanctions on American companies and individuals such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, and Thunder who participated last week. In fact, Lockheed Martin rarely does business with China, and has provided weapons and defense equipment to Taiwan for many years. However, if China is on Boeing(Boeing)Implementation of sanctions may cause a heavy blow to it because the company also sells civil aviation aircraft to China.

Bloomberg quoted the U.S. Air Force statement this week that delayed planes not only because of the epidemic and supply chain, but also containing "complex research and development challenges."

In early May, the journal "Journal of Test Technology" jointly sponsored by the Chinese Society of Military and Workers and Central North University also published a paper push paper, saying that if the conflict of the U.S. and China broke out, the PLA could use hypersonic anti -ship missiles to sink the latest US military. The Ussgerald R. Ford, the nuclear -powered aircraft carrier, formed a devastating blow to the US aircraft carrier battle group.

However, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese hypersonic missile data used by the soldiers was disconnected from reality, which may make the simulation distortion and cause the results to be inaccurate.

### In response to Xinjiang race extinction

In addition to strengthening support for Taiwan, another report adopted by the Chinese House of Representatives Special Committee on the same day, it is recommended that the US government take action on the Xinjiang issue. The report suggested that Chinese technology companies participating in the "racial extinction" of Chinese technology companies imposed sanctions and involved [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人权组织起诉法国时装集团涉维吾尔强制劳工/a-65660627)Strengthen law enforcement.

The chairman of the committee Gragel said: "Let's send a two -party (common) message, that is, Congress will stand up against racial extinction -this is the worst crime of all crimes."

Washington has accused China of sustainable ethnic extinction on Xinjiang Uyghur and other ethnic minorities. Human rights organizations have accused Beijing that Beijing has forced detention and forced labor against more than 1 million Uighurs. China has strongly denied the statement and emphasized that the so -called "vocational training center" is to curb terrorism, divisionism and religious radicalism.

Adopting a tough attitude towards China is a small consensus supported by the two parties in the United States Congress. The Special Committee of the China Issue Special Committee consisting of the two parties has not drafted the power of legislation. It only puts forward policy suggestions. It must cooperate with the legislative committee to transform the proposal into laws.

The 40 -year -old Dutch was paralyzed for more than ten years after the spinal cord injury was injured by a bicycle. According to the research published in the "Nature" journal, after using a new system, he can now walk "naturally", whether it is uneven or climbing the stairs.

This progress is the result of more than ten years of hard work in France and Swiss researchers.

The two implants set up the "digital bridge" that researchers said, which can connect the connection between the brain and the spinal cord due to the loss of the GERT-JAN.

Last year, this team showed that a spinal cord implant that could transmit electric veins to stimulate the stimulating leg muscle movement, allowing three lower half -body paralyzed patients to recover the walking ability.

But when installing such devices, the patient has to press the button every time.

Gert-Jan said that the above devices made him unable to catch the rhythm of "natural pace".

The latest research published today is a technology combination of spinal cord implantation with the technology-based-computerInterface. ) The algorithm, real -time solve the brain record.

The brain machine interface can learn how the patient wants to move the foot, and then transmits the calculated data to the spinal cord through the portable device that can be placed in a crutch or a small backpack. You can do it without the assistance of others.

** 1. China's current three major issues involved in land real estate rights: retreating forests, agricultural management, land finance **

Recently, there are several hot issues in China, which is attractive: the crisis of defeat of the retreat of farming, agricultural management, and land finance.

1) ** Retreating to forests and returning to farming **

Not long ago, Xi Jinping reversed his "green water and green mountains are the golden mountains and silver mountains" national policy of "returning farmland to the forest", and suddenly announced that he would "return to forests and return farming" to ensure the large -scale movement of "rice bowls should be brought in your own hands".

As a result, this national system of the Communist Party of China began to toss: China urban and rural areas destroyed forests and fields everywhere, and the boundless forests fell down. In the bulging sound of the bulldozer excavator, the green mountains and green mountains turned back to the land of dirty stones overnight, and even some places became Balling Mountain.

Chengdu is a typical case. The ecological park of 100 kilometers of beautiful people with a cost of 34.1 billion is there. Within a few days, all of them are flattened and intended to create 100,000 acres of paddy fields. The price paid is 34.1 billion, and it takes 442.8 years of income for 100,000 acres of rice fields to pay off. The absurdity of this prodigal son is rare in the world, and the sighs of the country will definitely leave a record of shame in history.

Why do you want to toss so absurd?

It is said to be "food safety". In fact, China currently produces 680 million tons of food, consumes 780 million tons of food each year, and the gap is 10 million tons. This gap can be completely made up by imports. There are many good quality, so you don't have to retreat to the forests for self -food and self -food, and make such a major damage.

This decision reflects the will of the gambler who retreats the country in the crisis of crisis. It is a kind of wartime thinking that he wants to defend his crumbling power of power regardless of all costs.

But even for war thinking, the Xi authorities are obsessed with the current status of the basic international civilization.

Judging from the current international environment and civilization, even if the war is started, it will not block all food exports. This is the lowest humanitarian. The modern international consensus is that no matter what kind of human and gods you do, you will never include food and medicine on the international sanctions list.

At that time, the Soviet Union confronted the Chinese Momes in China, and the Chinese Communist Party said that the Soviet Union forced debt to repay debts, and could only transport food products to the Soviet Union. The actual situation was that the Soviet Union proposed to suspend debts. In order to face face, to fight against Emperor Xiu, he refused to live with the people. But looking at the Russian and Ukraine War today, although some difficulties in Ukraine's food exports have occurred, it is basically normal. Russia invaded Ukraine, and the international community's sanctions on Russia did not include food and drugs. This is the most basic international morality, basic humanitarianism.

Water conservancy expert Wang Weiluo said to the current retreat from forestry: "The result of returning forests (grass) and plowing and rice goes on the mountain is a large area of soil and soil loss, causing geological disasters." The flood in China in 1998 was a big result caused by a large area of cutting down forests and painful pain, so it proposed "returning farmland to forests". Twenty years have passed, and the results have been achieved at first, and the flood has been slightly contained. Now it is "returning to the forest and returning to farming", and the east of hard work for 20 years. But some people think simple and ignore their heads.

The Nobel Prize winner of the Economic Amadia Mori once said: Serious famine is actually an artificial shortage economy and a consequence of political decision -making. The Great Famine only occurred in an autocracy without news freedom. The ruler deliberately placed the target population for a long time in a state of serious insufficient supply in food, housing, medical care, education, or the price far exceeding the consumption level. To control them, forcing them to be trapped in a panting that can only satisfy the state of survival, and has no time to carry out other political appeal activities.

The most important purpose of "retreating to forests and returning farming" is to once again change the form of collective ownership of rural land again, completely deprive farmers' rights to land, stripping the connection between farmers and land, and so that farmers will become a free of free from the new planned economy again. Atoms have become migrant workers of state -owned farms. This can achieve the purpose of going to the real estate stock.

"Returning to the forest to cultivate" once again reflects the essence of Chinese social imperialism: "In the world, is it the king of the king", but. "Mo Fei" has become "Mo Fei's soil."

Therefore, the fundamental problem here is that Chinese farmers do not have land ownership. The collective ownership of the so -called rural land has also become a thing that cannot be competed with the government, which is taken. They cannot decide the use of land and their income themselves, and they cannot interfere with the government's arbitrary disposal of land and use them at will. No matter how the official toss, farmers have no say.

2) ** agricultural management **

In order to support the "retreat to forests and return farming", Beijing also established the agricultural management department and followed the countryside to strengthen the control of the dying rural areas.

Earlier this year, local governments at all levels have reported and organized a "agricultural comprehensive administrative law enforcement" team, which is also commonly known as "agricultural management". There are currently 82,000 agricultural law enforcement officers compiled in China. On duty among about 2,500 related institutions, with their own uniforms, vehicles and law enforcement equipment. According to official statements, this is a new administrative law responsibility for the management of past seeds, pesticide feeds, agricultural machinery and other fields.

In the name of enforcement in the name of law enforcement, these agricultural management violence forced farmers' vegetable greenhouses, and even pigs who snatched chickens and ducks and seized farmers. "" ". Because their evil -shaped and evil are comparable to the "urban management team" of the urban law enforcement team, they were described as "village tyrants" by villagers. This kind of violent and stable agricultural management has triggered the anger and tolerance of the people. It has finally erupted recently.

According to the Chinese official media "Today's Headline", Zhejiang Province was at the forefront this time, and the "agricultural management" that had been established for less than a few months was finally canceled. It is estimated that in the near future, there will definitely be more and more provincial effective laws to cancel "agricultural management".

** 3) The crisis of "land finance" **

China's land finance refers to the fiscal revenue obtained by local governments relying on "selling land", which mainly includes two parts: First, non -tax revenue of land -related governments, such as land rent, land transfer, new construction land is paid Use fees and so on. Second, taxes related to land, such as the business tax of cultivated land occupation tax, real estate and construction industry, and land value -added tax. As of 2020, the land transfer fund is the absolute main source of fiscal revenue obtained by the Chinese government's land.

The government uses land as a commodity, and the income of the land is used as a small vyte in a budget. This is actually the failure of the CCP system.

At present, with the frequent crisis of China's real estate explosion, China's land finances are facing a comprehensive crisis. Some local fiscal companies have bankruptcy, debt, and no debt.This land finance is closely related to the rise and fall of the real estate industry. Because the fiscal revenue of local governments mainly comes from selling land development rights to real estate developers through long -term contracts. However, due to the bubble crisis of the real estate industry in recent years, the income of land sales has been significantly reduced, and it has entered a stage of decline.

However, the CCP has never dared to use obvious fiscal revenue options in other countries: real estate tax. Because this will involve the basic interests of the real estate in the huge population; at the same time, it is not straightforward. The Chinese have been deprived of land ownership by the Communist Party of China, and real estate has only 70 years of use. Since I have no ownership, what power do you have to levy my real estate tax?

****

** 2. China's land ownership issues **

** Earth Power: Key key **

The above three issues are the three issues: the root cause of returning forests, agricultural management, and land finance: The root causes are related to the five words, that is, land ownership. Opening China's complicated phenomenon, the key of practical land ownership can reveal a lot of secrets.

For thousands of years, the land problem is like a lingering nightmare. The CCP long -term propaganda said that one of the main problems of traditional China is that the land is concentrated in the landlord. It is precisely the secret of land rights. Mao Zedong deceived the poor farmers to participate in the army with "fighting the land and dividing fields", and prepared an important violent armed forces for seizing the regime.

Many countries have implemented land reform in the early days of industrialization. Originally, as long as the land reform was assigned to farmers through peaceful acquisitions to farmers. The three -seven -five -lease reduction in Taiwan further distributed land to self -cultivated farmers, and a drop of land reform was completed without a drop of blood.

The Chinese Communist Party is not. After the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, a violent land reform movement was launched. Essence It killed as many as 2 million farmers labeled "landlords".

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese farmers have only four or five years as the owner of the land to receive a land certificate, but soon it is the mutual aid group. At this point, the junior and senior communities have returned to the "Mo Fei Earth under the Sky". In the situation, the land was collected by state -owned.

Before the reform and opening up, Chinese farmers became serfs. What has been implemented has always been a policy of transfusion for urban and industrial blood transfusion through the poor scissors of workers and farmers. The cruel dissection of rural farmers is relatively simple and rough through production materials and labor products. As a slave farmers, the life of the peasants is extremely poor, and there is no rights and property. During the Great Leap Forward, they were driven to the commune cafeteria for dinner. Finally, they hungry all over the country. The highest tragic record of great famine caused by political reasons.

Forty -five years ago, the farmers at Xiaogang Village, who were hungry on the edge of hunger, decided that regardless of their rules that they had to work in the people's commune, risked their lives, secretly broke through the ownership of the CCP, restored the family bag system, and according to their considerations, they thought it was appropriate. The method of cultivating land has created the prosperity of agricultural production, and caused a series of capitalist reforms later, making China one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

** is still the only local Lord -the Communist Party of China **

However, these reforms failed to reverse the policy of nationalization of land ownership in the early days.

After the reform and opening up, the deprivation of the party -state's rights to peasants has transformed into a plunder of production factors. In accordance with China's existing land regulations, Chinese farmers' rights in land contracting are quite incomplete and unfair.

This has a negative impact on the farmers' production and life. Because there is no real land ownership, it means that farmers cannot purchase, sell or rent land, and create a large number of land that can be used in a large number of land, and cannot use the land as a loan mortgage, which limits their ability to raise funds. Although they can leave the land to work in the city, no property right means that they cannot use land to help provide funds for new life.

As a result, rural economic stagnation is common. In 2018, the income of urban residents was nearly three times higher than rural residents' income, which was roughly the same as the gap between the economic reform in 1978.

Now, with the government's random tossing of land, they cannot resist the repeated toss from "returning farmland to forests" to "returning forests and returning farming". Coupled with the agricultural management of violence and stability, will the rural areas go back to the dark era before 1978?

Although there have been efforts to imitate a certain land market in recent decades, every land in China has been in the hands of the country. China has become the only country of landlords -CCP -CCP -CCP -CCP from 1949, which is still the case.

This is the key crux of all rural issues.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000000.png)Purple spots are a common butterfly species in Asia. When the purple butterfly disappears, environmental police messages cannot be ignored. [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/@@images/image)(Provided by the monkey subsidiary) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/@@stream)This year's Oscar's best documentary was selected by the "The Elephantwhisperers" in "The Elephantwhisperers", which made people see the dilemma of the pitch of the Yanshan Village. In recent years, the theme of animal conservation and environmental changes has gradually occupied a place in the Asian film industry. Endangered species such as Tibetan antelopes, white dolphins, Northeast tigers to black -faced spoonbill have become the protagonists under the camera. At the end of May this year, the purple butterfly also jumped on the big screen.

However, maybe you wondered, isn't purple spa butterfly a butterfly species that can be visible? Zhan Jialong, an insect expert and an ecological documentary director, once used to it. At the age of 18, he first encountered a Purple Butterfly Valley in Kaohsiung Maolin. Gu, it has been filled with the parking lot. "He realized that the butterfly conflict was quietly staged." At this time, what I saw was the most important butterfly in Taiwan. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000001.png)Zhan Jialong has long invested in the research of purple spots. The ecological documentary of "Disappearing Purple Die" is being released in Taiwan. (Provided by the monkey subsidiary) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/2.jpg)** From chaser to documentary director **

Purple spots have begun to fly into his life. For more than 20 years, he chased the butterflies to overwhelm the mountains. The thin and thin figure flew from Taiwan to Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and other purple butterfly habitats. Experts' academic and emotional strokes wrote the ecological biography "Purple Paef Die" for them, and even shot the documentary "Disappearing Purple Die" from the perspective of a butterfly. "After watching this film, you may find that the life of a butterfly is not the same as our life."

"If the bee disappears, half of our food will be disappeared." "Disappearing Purple Die" said at the beginning, "So what will happen to the butterfly disappear?" This question mark still stopped in mind. The sound of echoing the valley made the audience move from their ears to their hearts.

Taiwan's purple butterfly valley is the world's second largest overwintering butterfly valley, second only to Mexico Emperor Butterfly Valley. "In the past, there were 2 million winter butterfly valley in Taiwan. . "Zhan Jialong slowly opened the box." The status of the purple butterfly is in the flat land and low altitude, that is, the place where humans live in. They have always had many conflicts with humans, so we have to try to understand and protect them. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000002.png)The Emperor Butterfly Valley of Mexico ranks among the world's natural heritage. (Reuters) [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/3.jpeg)Purple spots are the butterflies originally originally originally distributed in Asia, which are mainly distributed in the north and south. "In addition to Taiwan, Guangdong, Hainan Island, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Thailand also have the phenomenon of purple butterfly. . "He talked about the differences in butterfly valleys in various places." For Hong Kong and Hainan Island, the entire valley will only inhabit one or two trees, but Taiwan is the entire valley and purple butterfly. "

Purple butterfly dance, Zhan Jialong described it as "the treasure of God to Taiwan". He explained that because Taiwan is an island and other places is a continental climate. The climate is relatively dry. In Taiwan, it is trapped in the island to migrate on the island. In short, the small of Taiwan Island has made it spectacular.

** Orange Butterfly Rain and Fantasy Purple Butterfly Valley **

Compared with the Emperor Better Butterfly forming a large number of scenes of tens of millions of clusters in Mexico's single valley. "When I went to Mexico, the sun came out, butterflies flew up, and the butterflies would stop until the sun. . "Zhan Jialong, for example, in the purple butterfly valley of Mao Forest, Kaohsiung, when he entered the forest, the butterfly was disturbed in 5 minutes. stop."

However, the purple butterfly valley in his eyes is more diverse and ever -changing, because the emperor butterfly valley has only one butterfly and one color, "Taiwan's Butterfly Valley has 4 purple butterflies, 6 kinds of blue spots, 2 birch butterfly. As a kind of white spots, and the wings of the purple spots have a structure like triangular prism. From a specific angle, the light of the original dark brown wings will emit purple light. "His eyes lit up, and the words turned around and said again. "The most difficult thing for this movie is to shoot purple butterflies into purple, because the moment of light may only be 0.1 seconds."

The director who loved the butterfly became an instantaneous change in capturing the purple spots with ultra -high -speed cameras. Following his lens, he walked into nature. The praying mantis was ambushing for the opportunity to hunt, and the eight -eyed crab spider had an unexpected raid. The parasitic bee fiercely switched from the butterfly body. The scenes made people see the natural diversity and survival laws of nature.

** Environmental crisis all sides Chu Ge **

One of the survival challenges encountered in Taiwan is the loss of habitats. "Humans have covered their own homes at flat land and low altitude. For the environmental pressure, climate change is another threat. "Global warming will eventually lead to Taiwan into a tropical country. Purple spots do not need to overwinter, and there is no butterfly road and wintering butterfly valley."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000003.png)Taiwan's purple butterfly faces habitat loss and global warming. (The official Facebook of "Disappearing Purple Paef Die" [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/4.jpg)

The use of pesticides in modern agriculture also brings survival threats to purple butterfly, and even destroy the entire ecosystem. He reminded that purple spots butterflags will die when they absorb honey. In fact, purple spots and bees will be pollinated like bees. Agricultural production can be combined with the ecology to introduce purple butterflies and be friendly to the environment and at the same time. More than 10 years ago, in order to solve the problem of pesticide poisoning spot butterfly, the Taiwan Purple Poor Butterfly Ecological Conservation Association and the Conscience Foundation jointly promoted farmers to transform friendly farming. Silently guard the purple spots butterfly habitat.

Not only pesticides, the Research team of the University of Cantonel also found that the genetically modified crops may be harmful to the emperor's spot butterfly. Zhan Jialong also noticed this research. He explained that genetically modified corn (BTCORN) is to colonize the gene of a bacteria into corn Inside, it is called Su Li bacteria (BT), and the pests will be poisoned when they eat corn to achieve the effect of diseases and insect pests. The experimental results show that the emperor's spots of genetically modified corn pollen, nearly half of the individual death, so genetically transferred genes, so transferred genes to genet Is the crop really safe? Butterflies seem influential.

The migration road of Emperor Paei -Butterfly is also in crisis, and "human roadblocks" may lead to their "ghost hit the wall". He takes the fence built by former US President Trump on the border of the United States and Mexico as an example. "The Emperor's Better Butterfly went south to Mexico to overwinter. Some biologists raised doubts. From the principle of effect, butterflies will fly along the wall after encountering the wall, and then turn over after a section, but when they turn over, they may be different hills, and the migration path changes. This is a butterfly. The concept of effect. "

** Give up the highway for butterflies **

From the time of spring into the summer, the purple butterflies in Taiwan migrated from the southern wintering area to the north, but the highway blocked the butterfly road, causing the purple butterfly to "get a car accident." Zhan Jialong said that the butterfly migration of purple spots and butterflies came from the south of the Central Mountains, all the way to Bagua Mountain and Daishan, and then entered the plain area. At that time, there were thousands of butterflies recorded in one minute, and even tens of thousands of butterflies were killed through highways. After the car was crushed, the entire ground was bright and slippery. The ground is like a pig was crushed 10,000 times. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000004.png)The Taiwan Expressway Bureau has set up a protective network on the No. 3 National Highway, and launched a sealing measure at the peak period of the purple butterfly flying over. (Provided by Taiwan Highway Bureau) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/5.jpg)Later, under the butterfly protection initiative of Zhan Jialong and other scholars and experts, since 2007, the Taiwan Expressway Bureau launched the "National Highway to let the butterfly road" conservation operation. High, when the number of purple spots is more than 250 per minute, immediately close the outer lane, and the butterfly can have more buffer time. These protection measures have also greatly reduced the death rate of purple spots. From 2007, in 2007, it has fallen to less than 3 % in recent years.

"This year's record to the maximum of about 1,000 butterflies passed." Zhan Jialong always had this group of aerial elves. He reflected that this butterfly action should be called "the national road", "because human development, high -speed high -speed, high -speed high -speed Highway grabbed the butterfly road, at this time humans should show their own height. "

** The network of life connected to butterflies **

In fact, not only the wintering ecology of purple spots butterflies is in the decline mode, there are 5 native purple spots in Taiwan, including Si Zi purple spots, end purple spots, round wings purple spots, small purple spots, and large purple spots. Travel. Zhan Jialong pointed out that the large purple spots have been extinct in the 1960s. It is also the first extinction butterfly in Taiwan. The reason for disappearing is still a mystery, because its herbivores and honey sources still exist. One possible reason is that the habitat is being habitat. Destruction.

"There are many butterflies in Taiwan, but they are not extinct, but they are the largest purposes. There is an extinction." He said, "The butterflies living beside us are easily disturbed. I often talk about purple spots. Butterflies are like people, it is easy to hurt family!"

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000005.png)Purple spots and humans are the community of destiny. Zhan Jialong reminded that purple spots are like humans, and it is easy to hurt family members. (Provided by the monkey subsidiary) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/6.jpg)What will happen if the purple spots disappear? "Purple spots have wings. As long as this environment is not good, it will leave, but humans have no wings." Zhan Jialong's tone was full of Zen machine. So where will humans go from? He replied in the documentary: "Everything on the earth has nothing to do, but it is closely affected by each other, like a vast and complex network of life."

Zhao Taiyong, the head of the Security Office of the South Korean National Security Office, said that it will discuss whether the ammunition required to fight against Russia in the future.

The Yonhap News Agency reported that Zhao Taiyong attended the Congress Operation Committee on Wednesday (May 24) and asked the above -mentioned response when he was asked if he would support Ukraine when he was supported by Ukraine.

Zhao Taiyong said that South Korea has always provided humanity and financial assistance to Ukraine, but because Ukraine suffers illegal aggression, the Korean authorities will be considered according to future warfare and take care of other situations. This is regarded as an open position on ammunition assistance. However, Zhao Taiyong said that it will not provide ammunition directly to Wu or indirect support through Poland.

Some members asked questions, and it is understood that 500,000 ammunition was transported to Ukraine, of which 100,000 were delivered, 70,000 were transferred in Poland, and 330,000 were shipped to Europe, and whether the 330,000 hair was delivered. Zhao Taiyong replied that this is inconsistent with the facts. Except for Fengshan Group to produce shells according to the contract, the rest are in a state of negotiation in South Korea and the United States. The Korean side did not directly provide ammunition to Ukraine.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T10-32-00Z/36989341_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65732354/36989341)(Voice of Germany Chinese website) On Monday (May 22), a netizen posted the news online, [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/國泰航空遭指歧視中國客-官媒重拳整頓/a-65715856), I heard that the empty service staff laughed at the passengers in private and could not speak in English. He described the "blanket" as a "carpet", and said that "if you can't speak the blanket in English, you can't get it." The incident quickly appeared on the hot search on Chinese social media, which caused violent criticism of Chinese government officials and Hong Kong government officials, including the Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao.

According to Reuters, Cathay Pacific issued a statement late on Wednesday, urging Cathay Pacific to fundamentally solve the problem and rebuild a reasonable and safe working environment to boost employee morale. The statement expressed his deepest regret on the "recent unpleasant incident", and said that Cathay ’s air passengers have always respected and treated all passengers from different countries.

The union stated that after the new crown epidemic, with the recovery of flights, the number of passengers increased, but the aviation staff on the front line was facing a shortage of manpower and material resources, and the workload increased significantly but the salary was low. "The company ignored these problems, which led to the extremely low morale of employees, and the complaints on the cabin service also increased."

Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" reported that according to the internal email issued by the Cathay Pacific Skyworth Service Workers' Union obtained by the newspaper, the trade union was "distressed to face many unrealistic allegations and online rumors." The email also mentioned that, according to the "cabin service guidelines", if the flight attendant was filmed and videos by passengers without the consent, it can propose to delete the relevant content to the passengers. Take a "zero tolerance" attitude towards non -conservation passengers. The report quoted the trade union that "this expectation Cathay Pacific will support employees to protect themselves and provide relevant guidelines, and it is a pity that it will eventually get sad news."

### Cathay: Trade union does not represent Cathay Pacific position

In response, Cathay Pacific issued a statement on the official Weibo on Thursday that "the 'Air Workers' Association' is an independent union and never represents Cathay." The statement also wrote that Cathay Pacific "does not accept, support or agree with the union's position on the matter."

Mandyng, director of Cathay Pacific Services, also emphasized in the statement: "We will continue to communicate directly with colleagues in the cabin waiter, including various ways such as online and face -to -face. We will continue to listen to their feedback and actively respond. "

But many Chinese netizens do not buy Cathay Pacific's response. There is a message under the relevant Weibo: "Still, you don't like the mainlanders, don't fly to the mainland route, there is no need to force yourself!"; It is support for not opposing treatment. "

Since the outbreak of the incident, Cathay Pacific has apologized many times. The chief executive of the administrative Lin Shaobo said that the company will "adhere to the attitude of" zero tolerance "against the company's rules and regulations and moral standards.

"For Musk, he must find big -name users and let them come to Twitter to create content."

But the problem is that Musk is increasingly limited to right -wing forces, which may scare away a large number of advertisers who are willing to pay for advertising in Twitter.

"If it (Twitter) becomes a completely right -leaning platform, then that's right, you will lose the audience and the advertisement."

Musk was pulled by two contradictions. He acquired Twitter for $ 44 billion. On the one hand, he hoped that the investment would return to the book, and to do this, he would have to retain the advertisers. But on the other hand, Musk hopes to maintain his true colors and be a unique self.

In a recent interview, when asked if he thought about his uncontrolled behavior on the Internet and brought bad consequences to the business, Musk was obviously angry and replied, "I don't care!"

(Voice of Germany) Rondesantis, 44, has recently toured in various states to build momentum for Republican President. The information he passed is simple: No state is more successful than Florida. His campaign slogan is: De Santis 2024-to make the United States like Make American Florida.

At the end of March before the campaign, De Santis also launched a new book, which opened his childhood, and his love for the American sports baseball.

It was his sports talent that opened the door of Yale University's history for him. After that, his experience was quite smooth: after a year of history, he studied legal science at Harvard University. In the second year of Harvard, he became an alternate officer of the U.S. Navy, and then served as a military judicial personnel of the Guantanamo Prison. He served as a consultant of the Special Forces SEAC in the Iraq war.

### from Member to Governor

In 2012, after two years of prosecutors, he entered politics. Desanteis was a six -year member of the Congress. In 2018, he participated in the primary election of the Governor of Florida and won. In November, he defeated the Democratic Party with a weak advantage. At the end of 2022, De Santis, who was married and had three children, even won the governor again with obvious advantages.

The governor scored in his hometown with good economic data, tax cuts and liberal new crown policies. His new crown policy slogan is: freedom, not welfare. Fitch is a well -known virusist. De Santis opposed the implementation of restrictions and prohibited the company from requesting employees to show vaccine certificates. Despite criticism, many Florida supported it very much.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T11-08-00Z/65727445_401.jpg)The main reason for Desantis's score in his hometown in Florida is the new crown policy of good economic data, tax reduction and liberals

### De Santis and Trump: No longer a good friend

Trump has supported his supporter De Setis and said the political successor "smart young leader". Until the former president discovered that his successor became his competitor. Since then, Trump has reprimanded De Santis as a fake hypocrisy and grateful politician.

The strategy of De Santis facing Trump's attacks is: ignore. In the election campaign, the governor of Florida tried to establish a strong conservative image of no scandal, no chaos and legal disputes. Many people call him "brain with Trump".

However, De Sandeis is a 32 -year -old council candidate: Trump can easily make a huge venue lobby popular, while De Santis is not so close to the crowd.

### Anti -"Awakening Culture" of Florida

The so -called "wake culture" refers to opposition to various social discrimination. Desanteis prohibits courses in facilitation and gender identity in school in Florida. In addition, it is limited to school professor's anti -race theory. Surgery students are prohibited from participating in public school girls' sports school team. Then, it is forbidden to display pictures of same -sex partners on the school's podium.

"We have to do it, and the parents are sent to school to obtain education, not to be instilled."

In addition, De Sandeis had an abortion ban for more than 15 weeks of pregnancy in the state before overthrowing abortion rights in the US Supreme Court. After 15 weeks, abortion was allowed only under special circumstances such as life in danger of life, but it was not amazing due to rape pregnancy.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T11-08-00Z/65727433_401.jpg)In the face of the CCP's attitude, Desandis performed well. He launched a bill in early May to prohibit Chinese agents from buying sensitive plots in Florida

### Florida prohibits Chinese people from buying agricultural land and sensitive facilities

If De Sandeis not only defeated Trump in the Republican Party, but also defeated the Democratic Party as President Biden, his foreign policy may be quite uncomfortable for the left -wing liberal Americans. Desantis's explanation of Fox News on the United States in Ukraine, further involving the territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not the core national interests of the United States.

On the issue of China, early May, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国多地限制中国人买地买房不全是真相/a-65625492)Essence De Santis said in a press release: "Florida is taking action to resist the largest geopolitical threat in the United States-the Communist Party of China." He said, "I am proud of signing this bill to prevent Chinese agents from buying us The land of farmland and our military base and key infrastructure. "

Desantis also signed two other bills, saying that it was to prevent sensitive data from being stored in China, and preventing the Chinese Communist Party from impacting the education system at various levels in Florida. He said: "We are implementing the commitment to suppress the Communist China."

Mr. He also told reporters that he had no overtime pay when overtime, and he could only reimburse a meal and taxi fee.

Mr. He said that the overtime phenomenon not only appeared in the enterprise. In his social circle: "Friends of government civil servants, they are also called to work overtime from time to time on holidays or holidays. This is also very common."

On the Weibo of Chinese social media, "48.8 hours of corporate employees work 48.8 hours" is used as a hot search topic. As of the press time, it has attracted more than 3.7 million reading.

We do n’t mean that the prisoners of war are ...” Some people think that the actual work period every week is higher than the statistical data reflected, and it is said that in China In public institutions, at least half of people are far beyond this time.

[](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/@@images/image)Screenshot of the show [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/@@stream)This year marks the 34th anniversary of the "June 4th" incident, and the "June 4th" memorial museum will be unveiled in Manhattan, New York, USA. The former Tiananmen student leader Wang Dan shared the preparatory process of the memorial hall in the "Asian Want to Talk" program.

[** On the eve of June 4th, the police demanded that the police in many places requested to investigate young mobile phones **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/hx1-05232023092839.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-04052023073746.html)**

Wang Danfa, the leader of the 89th Academic Games, started the establishment of the June 4th Memorial Hall. He said that it was expected to raise 500,000 US dollars. Except for more than 50 civil movements participating in the campaign, more than 70,000 US dollars were donated, and the rest were small donations. Among them, more than a dozen donations are just "89 yuan and 6 cents 4". The sand accumulates into a tower. With the strength of everyone, the memorial hall is finally about to settle next to the Times Square in New York.

Wang Dan mentioned in the "Asia Want to Talk" that the name of the library was inscribed by Bao Tong, the passing secretary of Zhao Ziyang. Bao Tong's death was very weak a year ago, and everyone did not dare to urge. Although he did not even have the strength of the pen during the hospitalization, Bao Tong insisted on completing the title of the museum before his death.

"The five words of the June 4th Memorial Hall are Mr. Bao Tong's last Mo Bao in this world, and finally dedicated to the June 4th Memorial Hall. Coincidentally, the power behind this can be moved. "Wang Dan said.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T11-20-00-04-00/000001.png)Bao Tong's name is written in the June 4th Memorial Hall.(Web image)  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/image1.jpg)** The June 4th Memorial Hall Bao Tong inscribed the painting of Yan Kefov **

In addition to Bao Tong's Mo Bao, artist Yan Keff also donated a 2008 painting "Non -Related Religious". He explained the idea of creating in the show. People born in China were brainwashed, just like a wooden man, and he could not dominate his own destiny. However, human nature is inherently yearning for freedom. The puppet people prayed. When he awakened his eyes, he naturally pursued democracy.

Yan Kefu: "Therefore, we have June 4th. What is paradoxic is that we have been educated by Marxism since we were young. Why do we still oppose it? At least for me, it is a human awakening. It is unstoppable, our longing for freedom is unstoppable. "

Yan Kefu lamented that many years ago in Beijing, the same classmates held a graduation exhibition "Mo Wang's original intention", which clearly felt that the authorities began to shrink their remarks, especially related to ideology. Artists have always been more sensitive to creative freedom. He said, especially after Xi Jinping came to power, he couldn't walk forward, and he could only go back in endangering the regime: "Why go back? It's not that he is stupid, because there is no way. Just like climbing a mountain, it has been a place to go to a place. There is no way, and then the cliff is ahead. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T11-20-00-04-00/000002.png)The painter Yan Keff was analyzed in the show. The spread of Chinese liquidation to the art world was a joke.(Screenshot)  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/984f67ef592b.jpg)** Chinese art works are ups and downs, but also the subject matter is also the subject matter **

The former Chinese art market is booming. Dai Zhongren, the host of the "Asia Want to Talk", described the price of contemporary Chinese works "not to set up helicopters, but to erupt rockets."

The host asked, don't you think it is a pity to give up such a huge market? Yan Kefu mentioned that he came into contact with several well -known Chinese painters and was hot in the market, but they were unhappy: "The reason is unhappy, don't talk about Chen Yi's high freedom, because he can't draw other things, he can draw other things. He It was set up very early. "

For example, Zhang Xiaogang painted the "family" series for a lifetime, but has been abducted by the market. Recently, Yue Minjun, who is famous for its "laugh" series, used to paint millions of Hong Kong dollars in the Hong Kong Sotheby's auction, but now because of painting soldiers "laughed", he was suspected of ugly and blasphemy. Yan Kefu, who once told Yue Minjun, said that the smile in Yue Minjun's paintings was "smirked": "In the big wave of the mainland, the artist was crazy, everyone was crazy, making money and earning money and earning money. Crazy, I want money and want to be crazy. What strange things are, there is a very magical place. Everyone only smiles, it is so simple. "

** "Disgrace Army" sensitive nerves China strict hands and art world **

It's not just Yue Minjun, but even the talk show actor Li Haoshi(House)Just because the word "excellent style, can win the battle", was suspended and was criticized for "insulting army". This is very absurd in the eyes of Yan Koff: "As an artist, I can't understand This level. Like laughing fruit, a joke is fined more than 10 million yuan. I think the whole thing is a joke. "

In recent years, China has strictly hit black hands throughout all walks of life. Now even the performance of the art world has been unavoidable, making people unable to associate whether the Cultural Revolution has resurrected. Under the high -pressure rule, can contemporary young people still have the opportunity to express dissatisfaction on the street like the Eighty -nine Democratic Games generation? Wang Dan said that there are different methods of fighting for different generations. In the 1980s, they were more free and unrestrained, and they often occurred on the streets. Nowadays, they are full of fear. Young people have their own way of resistance. "Lying flat" is also a means.

He said, "'We are the last generation', not even children, we will not give birth. Strictly speaking, in terms of political science and historian sense, isn't this just non -violent?" Wang Dan believes that Wang Dan believes that The younger generation of China grew up playing games. In their world, they can withstand jokes. In such an environment, the society suddenly closed, and even jokes are taboos. It is absolutely impossible to support such regimes from the bottom of the heart.** Six Forty Fire Sales Fire Live **

But Wang Dan was not pessimistic. He believes that although June 4th has passed 34 years, it is evaluated from a historical perspective to the success of a movement, although the on surface is crushed by the regime, like the Hong Kong countermeasures to the Central Movement, after the implementation of the "Hong Kong National Security Law", it seems like the implementation of the "Hong Kong National Security Law". Leaders like Huang Zhifeng were arrested. While expanding global expansion, it has caused a rebound in the free world and is isolated, which will inspire more people's vigilance and resistance to it.

Wang Dan: "Although Huang Zhifeng was arrested, the sacrifice of these few people brought a huge achievement, that is, the people of the entire generation of the whole generation of the soberness of reality."

Wang Dan believes that the white paper movement that happened last year was a replica of the "June 4th", and the pursuit of freedom and spirit were not cut off. He emphasized that the pursuit of the two generations has the same place, and hopes that through the June 4th Memorial Hall and related commemorative activities, they can connect the spirit of freedom in different times.

Quanhe Kui said at the press conference: "There have been various discussions and requirements. On the occasion of the war and humanitarian situation of Ukraine in an all -round way, our government will take appropriate practices."

When the South Korean National Security Office director Zhao Taiyong was asked about providing ammunition to Ukraine yesterday, he told Congress that officials would make a decision after the monitoring situation evolved.

Zhao Taiyong said that there was no plan to provide artillery shells directly or through Poland, but he did not describe parts of South Korea and the United States.

The voting results of 11 opposition votes and 5 abstains votes were obvious to the German Football Leadership. It also confirmed the resistance of the football group's financing plan. In order to reach two -thirds of the majority, 24 votes of 36 votes of Football Party are required.

"Our conclusion is that this process is over since today. This is democracy." Hans Joachimwatzke, chairman of the German Football Supervisory Association, commented. "We set this threshold by ourselves. The voting results are obvious majority, but it is not the majority we think. From today, this topic is over."

Real Madrid: If you want to buy this world -renowned team, "only need" to prepare 2.9 billion euros. In terms of the number of football awards, no team can be comparable to Real Madrid. Real Madrid is the current Spanish league champion, and it has also entered the finals of the European Champions League.

The most valuable team in the KPMG ranking is of course Bayern Munich. The Department of Furniture Music estimates the market value of 2.4 billion, ranking fourth.

For the ninth Juventus, this is undoubtedly an interesting issue. Juventus Club belongs to the Agnelli family of industrial giants. For such an industrialist who is not bad, why did he sell Juventus?

Dortmund ranked 12th and Schalke 04 team ranked 14th. With Bayern, the total market value of the above three German teams is 4.1 billion euros.

###  trading will bring 2 billion euros in incomeThe financing plan originally pointed out that the right to broadcast the media should be stripped out to become a business subsidiary, whether it is Germany or internationally in the country. The potential investor can buy 12.5%of the company's shares for a period of 20 years.

This model is not no risk. During the contract period, the club must give up 12.5%of the media income to the financier. Even if the income grows moderately (currently obtains nearly 1.3 billion euros from home and abroad at home and abroad), this also means that in the next 20 years, the major clubs of the German Football Federation will bear the income loss of significantly more than 3 billion euros.

### Opposition of the fan group and the club

For the German Football Federation, which is currently led by Axel Hellmann and Oliverleki, the launching financing discussed in this round is still considered "irreplaceable", and only in this way can the competitiveness of the league. In addition, the best situation is that through investment, sales will increase. In other words, although the investors need to be divided, the final total profit will be higher than before, and the goal is to achieve a win -win situation.

Heerman said: "I found that all the opinions from all walks of life were: need to invest." He was surprised by the results of the voting. "You can't say that there is a demand, and then the process is over. Every year, every investment made by investors to other leagues will become more and more difficult for us. Those who oppose loud opposition must now answer this question: Where will the security and stability of the Bundesliga come from in the future. "

The representatives of the suspect are the leadership of the Bundesliga team Cologne 1.FC and the B -League team St. Pauli FC. They point out that investors' interests may conflict with the interests of the league in many fields. They support other ways to obtain new capital. For these critics, pre -occupation of future income is considered a wrong way, which may have long -term damage to Germany's professional football environment.

"Results and fierce disputes show that there are still many issues that need to be clarified and unreasonable," said OKEGOTLICH, chairman of St. Pauli, and he was also a member of the German Federal Union Council. "We must make all clubs be able to understand the importance of such a transaction. The current approach is not enough in terms of time and space. We must form a clear strategy together and constructively. Praising it in a targeted manner to achieve our clearly defined goals. "

### Fans' criticism

The opponents of investors' shares were not even shaken by various recent threats. The German Football Leader Laiki issued a warning saying that if the transaction failed, then the Bundesliga would be stripped out from other parts of the German Football Federation and thereby ending the "subsidy" of the small club.

Many fan groups are also critics, they criticized [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人权组织谴责国际体育机构奖励威权制国家/a-61316736)Essence The refusal of the investment plan is a blow to the German Football League leadership that hopes to improve the financial prospects of the league.

Customers of "Amazonchina" received an email notification on May 23 that from July 17, the "Amazon App Store" service will not be provided. Because "Amazon China" only announced the stop of its China Kindle Electronic Bookstore last year, at this time, it was closed again in China ’s application store services, causing heated discussions on whether the company intends to gradually withdraw from the Chinese market.

Amazon China clarified on the 24th that stopping the "Amazon App Store" will not affect Amazon's business operations in China, including Amazon Overseas Purchase, Amazon Global Store and Amazon China official website, and the suspension of Amazon App Store has no shopping for Amazon shopping.

According to a comprehensive report, the "Amazon App Store" mainly provides applications and games and other content downloads. You can download this app store on the official website of "Amazon China" and download various applications through Amazon account.

Jiang Yaqi, the chairman of the Taiwan Legal Science and Technology Association and the associate professor of the School of Marine Law and Policy of the National Ocean University, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia on the 25th that this was not the first time that Amazon had reduced its business scale in China. Serve. Although it cannot be said that this is the company's "full exit", it does have a trend of gradually narrowing and withdrawing from the Chinese market layout.

Jiang Yaqi analyzed: "In recent years, China's regulations on personal data protection, data outbound, and data security are getting strict. In addition to the opaque Chinese regulations, it is difficult for foreign businessmen to review. Many officials are more stringent, but the regulations of the information and security data with inadequate law enforcement standards to overseas transmission are becoming more and more difficult to operate in the Chinese market. "

Jiang Yaqi believes that these foreign companies in China "internal and foreign and foreign -foreign" must not only compete with China's same -nature e -commerce, and the current Chinese regulations have become important assets between national geopolitical and scientific and technological competition. Many regulations in China are legally strictly booked by the standards of data security, but China's transparency in law enforcement or the requirements of national security is not so clear for foreign manufacturers. Of course, these will be improved. Risks of Chinese market operations.

Wang Xiuwen, assistant researcher at the Institute of Politics and combat concepts of the National Defense Security Research Institute of Taiwan ’s National Defense Security Research Institute, also mentioned that China’ s Anti -Spy Law has just been revised in April in April to take action on some foreign and domestic consultants and consulting companies.

Wang Xiuwen judged: "On the one hand, Chinese Douyin (TIKTOK) is preparing to be blocked or controlled in the United States, making Amazon worry about whether it will become an innocent cannon fodder under the competition between China and the United States; When foreign businessmen do not know if they have violated Chinese laws, or if China requires him to hand over customer information, I do not know if they can and are willing to provide it, and simply turn off the platform themselves. "

In addition, Wang Xiuwen mentioned that the Amazon App Store mainly provides applications and games in Android phones. This move is also related to Xi Jinping's wanting to rectify related policies such as the game industry: "Amazon feels that the signs are wrong, withdraw first. And Amazon also Amazon In the United States for layoffs, I do n’t know if there is their own internal relationship, that is, the consideration of reducing the company's internal operations by itself. "

** Anti -espionage method and violation of Guoan hat are too big ** ** China self -broken road decoupling **

Wang Xiuwen believes that China's "Anti -Spy Law" is extremely friendly to foreign -funded enterprises. Whether it will have a joint effect will affect other multinational e -commerce to evacuate China and have to observe follow -up. It is possible that after China banned Micron, China ’s relevant stocks in China have risen up. The Amazon App Store has collected it, which may promote the Chinese domestic e -commerce platform, such as Baidu, but the market is optimistic. This caused the outside world to suspect that the Chinese government said that fighting legal warfare was actually to ensure the survival of domestic industries.

Wang Xiuwen: "Who is this decoupled? It is China to decide with others. Amazon is so big. Don't even go through Amazon to shop overseas. This is funny. The new generation of young people is not like What they think. The hat of anti -spy method and the illegal Guoan's hat is too big, and Amazon should hurry up when you encounter any pressure. "

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T12-18-00Z/63515842_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65732307/63515842)The picture shows a job fair in Beijing in August 2022

(Voice of Germany Chinese) China announced that the unemployment rate in April announced was 5.2%, a decrease of 0.1%from March, but the unemployment rate of young people aged 16 to 24 is as high as 20.4%, the highest since record. According to data from the Ministry of Education, in 2022, the number of Chinese college graduates was 10.76 million. In 2023, college graduates are expected to be 11.85 million, an increase of 820,000 year -on -year, and the scale of graduates hit a record high. According to the "2022 China Returnees Employment Survey Report", since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020, the number of returnees returned to China has also increased significantly. The number of returns returned from 2021 and 2022 has exceeded one million, which has even increased the pressure of fresh graduates to find a job.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/毕业即失业-中国年轻人失业率居高不下/a-64834417)The Chinese government has also taken various means and measures.

Many provinces and cities have issued policies to encourage small and medium -sized enterprises to recruit fresh graduates. In 2022, Shandong Province adopted small and medium -sized enterprises who recruit college graduates and signed a labor contract for more than one year, and gave one -time employment subsidies to 10,000 yuan/person. In Jiangsu Province, if an enterprise enrolls the college graduates of the year to sign a labor contract for more than one year and participate in unemployment insurance, it will distribute a one -time expansion subsidy from the unemployment insurance fund at the standard of 1,500 yuan per person.

Ms. Mo Mo, who is engaged in manufacturing and sold on the Internet, said in an interview that because of the subsidy relationship, he recruited several fresh graduates this year, and even recruited a undergraduate study at 985 universities. Britain's fresh graduates who have obtained a master's degree.

"The person we recruited before, there are only three of the highest degree of education." Ms. Mo said. "In this year, there are many people who vote more than in previous years. The big e -commerce platform has been internship. "But after she recruited people, she was a little uneasy in her heart, worried that the development opportunities that her company could provide will not be able to match the expectations of the returnee master, and she was worried that she left the job not long after the job of returnees.

She said, "In fact, we don't need to be highly high, nor can we speak English, but we hope to get started quickly, work hard, and do it. And because we are small companies, all kinds of miscellaneous work must be done. , It may be different from the expectations of students who have experienced internships with big companies. "

### How to deal with the age of population?

### civil servant and master's degree expansion

According to the "2023 University Student Employment Research Report" released by Zhilian Recruitment, the slow employment ratio also increased from 15.9%last year to 18.9%. The main reason for slow employment is to take the postgraduate entrance examination and the preparation.

This year, the provincial examination of civil servants will be expanded sharply, with an expansion of 17%, of which 27 provinces are expanded. Gansu expansion reaches 80%, and there are more than 50%of many provinces. "In 2023, more than 50%of the provincial civil servants have been expanded by more than 50%" also appeared on Weibo hot search, becoming one of the ways for the country to solve the employment of fresh graduates.

Data show that most of the posts of enrollment are grassroots, such as the county government and the position of the district government. The largest proportion of the enrollment is the remote areas of Gansu Province, Yunnan Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Essence Freshman Bosheng has also relaxed age restrictions.

Many universities also conducted postgraduate enrollment. In 2023, there were 864 enrollment units across the country in the postgraduate entrance examination a total of 761,763 recruitment, an increase of 10,245 people from 2022. Because the employment situation is severe, more and more fresh graduates choose to continue their studies instead of finding a job. A total of 4.74 million candidates for the National Master's Graduate Admissions Examination in 2023 registered, an increase of 170,000 compared with 2022, a record high.

### University data "water injection"

The employment rate of fresh graduates has also become one of the important criteria for measuring universities and majors. In order to make the data look better, and to be able to go to the upper layer, there are also school fraud.

A Shanghai student Xiao Zhang, who is about to graduate from a master's degree, told reporters in an interview that his mentor asked him to find some ways to sign a three -party agreement so that he could be counted as an employment when statistics.

"He told me several times on WeChat that if he did not sign the three -party agreement, he would not let graduation defense." Xiao Zhang said, "But I don’t want to find a job immediately. Application materials, ready to apply for foreign doctoral projects in the second half of this year. "

However, the instructor advised him to find some acquaintances signed the three -party agreement, so that he could help the school to complete the task. He also said that if Xiao Zhang could not find the help of an acquaintance, the instructor could contact someone to help.

"I don't want to sign, I didn't find a job, but I didn't find a job, so the instructor asked me to deal with it."

Xiaodi, an undergraduate graduate in Harbin, was asked to sign a flexible employment agreement by a counselor. The flexible employment agreement includes two types: independent entrepreneurship and freelance occupation. After signing, it also belongs to finding a job during statistics.

She showed reporters the WeChat sent by the counselor. In WeChat, the counselor said straightforwardly that the flexible employment agreement was "the school simply just completed the task issued above" and asked Xiaodi to help him complete KPI. Moreover, the counselor assured Xiaodi that the agreement was only for statistics. She would not be affected in the future or the preparation of the examination.

### Why do many Chinese women unwilling to have more children?

### Public opinion publicity

There is a structural contradiction in the current employment market, that is, the incompleteness of talents and labor markets cultivated by universities. Some professional graduates are too large.

The "China Blue -collar Employment Market Embarra" in 2021 shows that the blue -collar employment index has risen sharply, and it has even exceeded the level before the epidemic. A survey by CCTV shows that 83%of manufacturing companies have expressed varying degrees of blue -collar workers. But many college students are yearning for white -collar workers in the office building.

In the past few months, the Chinese government has also used public opinion to promote the work of blue -collar workers. In a hot search on Weibo, the graduates of the logistics major of Tianjin University owed debt because of accidental friends. He chose the industry to take the takeaway. 400,000 debts were paid in the year.

There are many similar stories in hot search and media reports. For example, the post -95s Ms. Wang resigned from 300,000 years of salary work, because she resigned to sell fast food, and the monthly income was 40,000; for example, Ms. Huang of Zhengzhou University relied on "Rotten" monthly income; for example, the post -95s couple operated a snack stall in Yiwu, Zhejiang, and they could earn 9,000 yuan a day.

In a short period of time, such eye -catching stories are frequently reported, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体新时代的上山下乡运动/a-65661636)Call for young people to face the pressure of employment and rely on labor to change their situation. Call: "The era of Kong Yiji is gone, and young people with contemporary contemporary will never be trapped in a gown."There is a message from a young man: "It is you who let me wear a gown, and you who scold me in a gown too."

U.S. officials said that in addition to drone attacks, they believe that Ukraine should also assassinate the daughter of a well -known Russian sociologist, kill a Blogist author of Russia, and the Russian town near the Russian and Ukraine border. A series of attacks are responsible.

U.S. officials also believe that the "Beixi" pipeline was bombed by Agent of Kujes, and their relationship with the Ukraine government has not yet been determined.

Russian media reported on May 3 that Ukraine tried to dispatch drones to attack the Kak Palace, and the Russian side took action in a timely manner to cause the drone to be abnormal and did not cause casualties or property losses. Russian President Putin was not injured due to attacks, and his working day was as usual.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-25T12-32-09-00-00/000000.png)Although this is a popular development, the International Energy Energy Agency (IEA) warns that fossil fuel investment is increasing, and in order to achieve the target of net zero emissions in 2050, the investment of fossil fuel should decline rapidly.

FATIH Birol, executive director of the International Energy Administration, said in a statement issued by the latest energy investment report of the Energy Administration: "The development of clean energy is rapid and faster than many people realize."

He said: "This is obvious in the investment trend. Cleaning energy technology is pulling away from fossil fuel."

According to the data of the General Administration of Energy, the investment of clean energy this year is estimated to increase by 24%compared with 2021, and by 2023, it will exceed $ 1.700 billion. During the same period, fossil fuel investment increased by 15%.

Only 5 years ago, the amount of investment in clean energy and fossil fuel was equal. However, in combination with various factors, especially the high prices of oil and natural gas and concerns about supply, the expenditure of renewable energy has surged and advanced.

"A distinctive example is investment in solar energy, and it will exceed the investment amount of oil production for the first time."

The General Administration of Energy estimates that this year's investment in solar power generation will reach US $ 380 billion, and this investment is mainly used in solar optoelectronic boards, and investment and mining of oil exploration and mining should reach US $ 370 billion.

Data Jones, the data analysis director of the Energy Think Tank Ember, said: "This makes solar energy a real energy superpower."

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The United States "New York Times" reported on Wednesday (May 24) that US officials believe that earlier this month [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄指美幕後主使無人機襲擊-專家有點牽強/a-65523432)It is likely to be carefully planned by a special military or intelligence department in Ukraine, which makes American government officials feel uneasy. The United States is the largest military equipment supply country in Ukraine.

It is reported that the United States is an assessment based on intercepted Russia and Ukraine communications.

The New York Times pointed out that the United States intercepted the dialogue of Ukraine, and some of them said that they believed that its country should be responsible for this attack; the United States also eavesdropped Russia's communications. These communications show that the Kremlin's attack is not a Russian self -directed plan for planting stolen goods. Essence

The Kremlin spokesman Dmitrypeskov said in the relevant report, "We immediately showed that the Ukraine government was behind the scenes." "No matter which units in the Ukrainian government, there is no difference."

It is reported that U.S. officials said they did not believe that the Ukrainian President Zelezky would sign all secret operations by hand. These officials said that it is unclear to how much Zelezki knows in advance.

Russia has accused Ukraine of trying to assassinate the country President Putin by drone. Zeelianki immediately denied Ukraine's participation.

He pointed out to Reuters that Russia is taking advantage of the West's concerns about the upgrading of the situation to upgrade the situation to make the West reduce the supply of weapons to Ukraine by accusing Ukraine.

### Russia: Ukraine tries to assassinate Putin with drones

### Wagner Group transferred Bachmut to the Russian army

At the same time, Russia's Wagner hired mercenary group issued a statement on Thursday that the group began to transfer the positions of Bachurut, eastern Ukraine to the Russian military.

A few days ago, the Moscow military stated that it had deployed fighters and artillery on Russia's land to block the "destruction organizations" from Ukraine Vietnam.

On Thursday, Russia stated that Chinese Eurasian affairs Li Hui would visit Moscow on Friday. Li Hui started a trip to Europe on May 15th and visited many European capitals including Kiev.

"We will retreat from Bachmuut today from Bachomum. We will transfer positions, ammunition and all the military in a video released by Yevgeny Prigozhin."

He added: "We retreat, rest, prepare, and then we will get new tasks."

Earlier this week, Rigerjin acknowledged that about 10,000 prisoners he recruited were killed on the Ukrainian battlefield.

The Kremlin ally went to various hells in Russia last year to persuade the prisoners to fight with the Wagner Group in exchange for promise for amnesty.

Reuters [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/tj1-05252023133044.html/@@stream)A China think tank recently released a report stating that as global climate warming has intensified year by year, the Top Ten River system in Asia is facing a drought crisis. These rivers flow through 16 countries in Asia, supporting the economic and energy security of many countries.

The latest report released by the English group of this station quoted the Hong Kong Think Tank China Water Risk (CWR) pointed out that the ten large rivers of the Himalayas and the Cusco Mountains originated: the Amu River, the Yarlung Tibetan River, the Indian River, the Iloa Da River, the Mekong River, the Sa Sa, Sa Sa The Erwen River, the Tarim River, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, etc. are currently facing the challenge of global climate change. These rivers flow through 16 countries in Asia, including China, as well as Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and other countries. There are as many as 1.9 billion people through the area, with an annual economic output value of about 4.3 trillion US dollars. These rivers are not only the cradle of Asian civilization, but also produce three -quarters of rice crops such as rice.

** Human and natural reasons lead to the water supply pressure of the river **

However, due to climate change, the melting acceleration of glaciers, decreased snowfall, and monsoon changes. At the same time, human beings have excessive development of groundwater resources, etc., all of which cause the above reasons to cause shortage of water resources in the rivers, and will affect and endanger half of the population in Asia.

The report predicts that if the Paris Climate Convention is scheduled, when the global temperature is heating by 1.5 to 2 degrees in 2050, the four of the above 10 rivers will have the risk of water resource drama. At the same time, the methods of relying on these rivers to generate power generation will not continue. At present, 46%of the total power of the Asian coastal country relies on the above river to assist in power generation.

Debratan, the person in charge of China Water Risk Think Tank and the main author of this report, said: "The uncertainty and extreme climate of these ten rivers' water volume have enabled us to establish a new energy and water resource system to strengthen climate change. The ability to deal with ... ... In order to manage water risk and higher and higher water needs, establishing a new system is imminent. "

** China is facing the problem of medium and high water risk power generation.

The report evaluates that in all countries, Laos, which is not around the sea, faces the highest water risk, Myanmar and Cambodia are high risks, China is high risk, and Vietnam is low risk. Among them, for China, in the above ten rivers, only the Amu River does not flow through China. The remaining Jiuhe River supports the daily life of 44%of China's population. Help China generate more than half of total electricity.

The report also pointed out that Asian countries highly depend on coal -fired power generation. This power generation model not only accelerates global warming, but also requires high dependence on water cooling and driving steam turbines. Therefore Facing an energy crisis. To deal with these issues, the report calls on Asian countries to cross -border cooperation and formulate common policies in water resources sharing, energy and development issues.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The court sentenced the oldest of the four of them to prison for 5 years and 8 months, and sent the other three to the teaching. The case was processed under the framework of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, and China implemented the law in Hong Kong in 2020.

The four defendants were aged 17 to 21 years old when they committed the crime. They were members of the little -known organization called "Light City" organization. The organization advocated Hong Kong independence and called for resistance after the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law.

The organization was charged with TATP explosives to make bombs in 2021 and detonated in the public area-including the court building. Before they purchased the materials, the national security police in Hong Kong arrested them in July that year.

Li Yunteng, a judge of Hong Kong High Court, believes that the 21 -year -old defendant Owen "obviously needs greater responsibility. It is said that he" participated in the work of renting, planning and preparations, and reconnaissance target buildings. " Prison.

The judge said that the other three defendants aged 17 to 18 are "basically ordinary soldiers in the conspiracy plan" and did not successfully purchase TATP explosive raw materials. They will be sent to the teaching office. A facilities that are dominated by rehabilitation can accommodate young people aged 14 to 20, where they live there for three years.

### ** Acknowledge "conspiracy to create explosion" **

How long does it take to be based on the evaluation of officials disciplined officials. The "Light City" organized this month to recognize the crime of "conspiracy manufacturing explosion", rather than the charges of "conspiracy to implement terrorist activities" proposed by the prosecution.

The former can be sentenced to a maximum 20 -year imprisonment in accordance with the Hong Kong Crime Regulations, but the latter can be sentenced to life imprisonment according to the Security Law.

The full name of the Hong Kong National Security Law, "The People's Republic of China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Maintenance of the National Security Law", was implemented after Hong Kong suffered a huge and often violent clashes in 2019.

The authorities said that this was to restore stability and order, but critics said that since the effectiveness of the law, Hong Kong's autonomy and the right to freedom of citizens have been weakened.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T14-16-00-04-00/000000.png)China has accelerated artificial intelligence and military applications. The picture shows the Chinese military's development of the brain signal to control the robot. [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05252023134238.html/@@images/image)Reuters information picture [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05252023134238.html/@@stream)Audience friends, hello everyone. What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Today, talk about the application of artificial intelligence in the PLA's combat.

Bloomberg reported last week that China used the trend of artificial intelligence (AI) for war, from Silicon Valley to the Pentagon in the United States. Ericschmidt, a former CEO of Google, emphasized the severity of this issue at the parliamentary hearing. The "Special Competitive Research Plan" led by his leadership issued a report this month that the United States needs to redesign the army to respond to this threat.

** Artificial intelligence invading Taiwan soldiers push **

Schmidt warned at the hearing that in addition to the "military -civilian integration" plan that focused on the close cooperation between the Chinese military and the civilian industry, China should also consider that China's investment in national defense artificial intelligence far exceeds the United States. Although the United States has been "slightly leading" in key areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing for several years, China has invested more manpower to engage in research on the field of strategic artificial intelligence.

Many officials and members of the US Department of Defense believe that if the United States does not quickly develop strong artificial intelligence weapons, it may be defeated in potential conflicts with China in the future. The author stated to Bloomberg that the purpose of writing the report was to convey the urgency of accelerating the development of artificial intelligence to the Ministry of Defense, Congress and the public.

According to observations, China's investment and development focus on multiple key areas, including the research of artificial intelligence algorithms, big data analysis, machine learning, automation, and unmanned systems. In addition, China still uses artificial intelligence in military applications, develops smart missiles, autonomous drones and automated combat systems. Although the United States has led a few years, China is increasing investment in talent training, research and development institutions and laboratory construction, promoting artificial intelligence development, and applying it to national defense and military fields.

According to research and analysis of the US think tank, the Chinese military has used artificial intelligence to perform military chess in Taiwan. But it has not been confirmed by authoritative units. However, from some comments, articles and military public works in the PLA Daily, it has seen that artificial intelligence may be used in the PLA simulation and possible applications.

The first is that the situation is determined: artificial intelligence can help generate and simulate various battlefield situations, including geographical environment, behavior and response of enemy forces. Based on big data and machine learning technology, artificial intelligence can help the PLA create more real and diverse battle field scenes in simulation training, to evaluate and study various ideas of fighting Taiwan in a combatant way.

The second is command and control: artificial intelligence can provide assistance and support in command decision -making and combat command. Through data analysis and pattern recognition, artificial intelligence can help the commander better understand the battlefield situation, predict enemy intent, and support the formulation of decision -making. In addition, artificial intelligence can also assist commanders to perform the battlefieldist perception and decision -making optimization to improve command efficiency and combat effects.

** The decisive factor is that people are not things **

However, it should also be seen that although artificial intelligence can assist in command and decision -making process. But in actual situation, the experience and judgment of the commander are still important. The PLA's works have mentioned many times that although artificial intelligence can process massive data and simulation situations, in a highly complex and dynamic battlefield environment, uncertainty and accidents may be faced. Therefore, the flexibility, judgment, and rapid response ability of the commander become important, and these are unique to human decision -making. In the final analysis, the experience, intuition and decision -making ability of the commander are the key to ensuring success.

Mao Zedong once said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor, and the decisive factor is that people are not things." This sentence is deeply imprinted in the minds of the People's Liberation Army, becoming an unbreakable belief.

The third is to sort out the combat plan for Taiwan: artificial intelligence can be used to analyze and evaluate the effects and feasibility of various combat plans against Taiwan. By simulation and model deduction, assist the commander to better understand the advantages, weaknesses and potential results of different solutions, thereby optimizing and improving combat solutions. Artificial intelligence also helps to promote the organization and implementation of integrated combat combat, and generate and update the combat order required for future war forms.

In early August last year, NancyPelosi visited Taiwan, the President of the U.S. Parliament, and the PLA organized multi -military assault on the sea assault, fighting against land, air -making operations such as land, and air -making operations for 8 consecutive days. The purpose of refusing to stop the United States and Japan "is the purpose of the strategic deterrence, and breaks the central line of the strait to form a new normal to the Taiwan. The training was unified by the Eastern theater, and it was launched with a multi -military troops to become a system and full combat elements (from intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, command control, and joint strike to comprehensive guarantee). Without the assistance and support of artificial intelligence, the exercise operation is difficult to develop seamlessly in a short time.

In early April of this year, President Tsai Ing -wen in Taiwan and Kevinmccarthy, Speaker of the United States Congress, met in California in the United States. For favorable arrays, the trend of the siege is formed to the Taiwan. At the same time, the aircraft carrier -based aircraft of the aircraft carrier was used to take off from the eastern waters of Taiwan to coordinate with the western attack to Taiwan. It forms a storm of east -west clamping Taiwan Island. Without the assistance and support of artificial intelligence, it may be difficult to achieve such a tightly siege pressure effect.

** Intelligent training **

Since September last year, the PLA was investigated and unmanned, and there were at least 4 models. In April and May of this year, the PLA's three models of investigating all -in -one drones flew around Taiwan in the direction of the clock and clock for the first time, and began to enter intelligent training with drones. Military aircraft warships, collaboration between campaign and tactical levels, and mission collaboration between drones. At the same time, a new model of large -scale drones to the normalized reconnaissance of eastern Taiwan, conducting normalized reconnaissance on the battle base and weapon test field of the eastern part of Taiwan, supplementing satellite's time and regional reconnaissance gap, and can also be for the eastern part of Taiwan during the war to the eastern part of Taiwan. The combat power preservation area (or behind the strategy) forms a comprehensive and full -time reconnaissance, providing experience, route and data.Data is the basic requirements of artificial intelligence calculations. The greater the amount of data, the more realistic the amount of data. The better the training and generating effect of artificial intelligence. At present, the biggest deficiency of the PLA is the lack of actual data for artificial intelligence calculations. Practical experience can provide a large amount of real data and situations to help artificial intelligence systems learn and generate various complex battlefield conditions. Until now, the PLA mainly relies on computer simulation training and exercises, and has obtained data from military exchanges and technical cooperation with foreign forces. It is essentially different from the actual data of the US military.

In order to make up for this critical deficiency, the PLA has increased practical training in recent years, and focuses on the training field domain in the Taiwan Strait area.

The foundation of model optimization.

It is reported that the PLA's important goals for Taiwan are compiled into a directory, which is to use artificial intelligence and weapons and ammunition to use the nature of the target, the means and methods of strikes, and the need to fight. Outlet analysis and crackdown planning. Specifically, artificial intelligence can help the PLA achieve multiple functions.

** Catalog on the Taiwan target **

The first is target recognition and classification: artificial intelligence can automatically process and analyze various intelligence data, including satellite images, reconnaissance reports, and open source intelligence, and identify and classify important goals in Taiwan. Through training models and algorithms, the nature, characteristics and importance of the goal are automatically identified.

Secondly, target analysis and evaluation: artificial intelligence uses existing information and data, combined with model deduction and algorithms, analyze and evaluate the target, including the strength, defense ability, strike requirements, and possible strike methods of important goals, etc. evaluation of. In this way, artificial intelligence can assist the PLA to better grasp the characteristics of the goal and strike needs.

Then it is to combat planning and optimization: Based on the target compilation of the target, artificial intelligence uses optimization algorithms and decision -making models to combat planning and resource allocation. By considering factors such as different strike methods, weapons and equipment, and troops, artificial intelligence helps the PLA to formulate a more effective blow plan and optimize the configuration of combat resources.

However, the above are ideal. The application of artificial intelligence in the target catalog and crackdown planning is still exploring and developing. The accuracy and reliability requires comprehensive consideration of various factors. So you can understand it like this. The target catalog requires the PLA to continuously improve through the military chess confrontation, local simulation, and real soldiers.

In August last year and April this year, the PLA implemented military exercises in Taiwan. It can use this test and evaluate the accuracy, practicality and operability of the target and catalog, and obtain real -time intelligence in the nature, defense ability, and strike requirements of the target. Essence Such exercises help the PLA to improve the accuracy and effect of combat against Taiwan, and also provide valuable experience and data support for the further improvement and improvement of the target catalogs.

** Great development potential **

Taiwan and the United States have the intention of the PLA. Therefore, during the exercise, maintain the maximum restraint, do not make any tactical response, and do not give the PLA's opportunities to collect target intelligence, so that it cannot test and evaluate the nature and defense ability of the target. The outside world thinks that Taiwan and the United States show their weakness, but they are actually confidential. Data is combat power, the soil of artificial intelligence generated, and the key to the decisive victory of the war.

Artificial intelligence potential is endless. However, it should also be seen that the application of artificial intelligence technology is still in the early stage of development. There are still many challenges to be overcome for the complex combat environment and decision -making process. When applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy and data of the algorithm. Reliability, combined with the professional literacy of personnel, conduct comprehensive judgment and decision -making. From this perspective, the PLA has taken the pace and has huge development potential. Otherwise, the United States will not pull up alarm and fully deal with the challenges brought by China.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T14-27-00Z/63695579_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65735624/63695579)(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The "Daily News" website published an article saying that the actions adopted by China were not surprising. After all, the United States launched the export limit of chip and chip production equipment before, and it is also forbidden to enter high -tech products such as Huawei to enter the entry of high -tech products such as Huawei. U.S. However, this article entitled "Sino -US Technology Contents" is skeptical of whether American companies can really be decoupled. The article wrote:

"Over the years, analysts have been criticizing the huge dependence of US high -tech companies to the Chinese market. Taking Apple as an example, more than 90%of their smartphones are produced in the People's Republic of China. Apple is so densely concentrated in China. China's epidemic prevention and control measures have made Apple production difficulties, so that the crucial Christmas sales have been greatly affected. Discussion.

Economist Friedman, an economist of Cornell University, previously warned that [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印度能帮苹果摆脱中国困局吗/a-63711815)However, Bank of America Morgan Chase predicts that as of 2025, Apple's proportion of Apple's output in China will decrease from the current 95%to 75%.

However, it is not only American companies that move the production base from China to India, but some German companies have also begun to be optimistic about India. German automobile supplier Scholes has opened a new software and electronic technology research and development center in Pina, India. "

With the continuous intensification of geopolitics between China and the United States, some multinational companies have begun to reduce investment in China to avoid risks. But is India really a safe harbor for investment? The article wrote:

"India is actually not as risky as an investment destination, because the geopolitical signal sent by the country is also quite contradictory. Therefore, it is still unknown whether the country will have political differences with the Western camp in the future. For example, India is outside China outside China. The main buyers of Russian crude oil and natural gas. Robert Rethfeld, a marketing expert of corporate consulting company, said: 80%of Russian crude oil flows to India and China. '

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T14-27-00Z/63598262_401.jpg)In September last year, China's strict "zero measures" have caused Zhengzhou's Apple foundries for a discontinued production.

From this point of view, India is also indirectly funded Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. So far, the Western camp led by the United States seems to be a blind eye.

Participants pointed out that in recent years, China ’s irresponsible and opaque loan is an important factor that caused low -income countries to face the sovereign debt crisis. The United States needs to urge international financial institutions to play its core functions to resist China's debt trap risk.

[** "The Ten Anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative" is still effective to assist the development of the banner? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-05242023103331.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/9-03082023154027.html)**

On May 25, the national security, illegal finance and international financial institution groups under the Financial Committee of the House of Representatives of the Congress held a hearing, focusing on the competition of large powers, China ’s extensive impact on global loan behavior on the world's economic system. The members of the committee and the participating experts reach a consensus, that is, only by enhancing the function of international financial institutions can we effectively fight China's global economic ambitions.

The chairman of the group committee, Blaineluetkemeyer, pointed out that as many as 60%of the world's low -income countries are currently facing debt dilemma. In the case of the slowdown of the global economy, if you do not restructuring or exempt from debt, it is not owed that owed. Loans will face huge risk of financial default.

"China has played an increasingly larger and uncoordinated role in providing funds ... ... At least 65 countries owe Chinese lenders that owe Chinese lenders exceeding 10%of their total foreign debt. When countries fall into financial dilemma, these large number of opaque China The debt has hindered the reorganization. "He said," Ironically, at the same time, the World Bank continues to provide more than $ 1 billion of loans to China each year.

And it is essential to combat China's use of foreign debt to expand global influence. (Video screenshot/US Congress official website) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05252023140105.html/jw0525a.jpg)Jesse M.schreger, associate professor of business school in Columbia University, told the committee that China plays an important role in the sovereign debt crisis. He said that China is now the world's largest bilateral debt country, and most of its loans are settled in the US dollar. Chinese debt accounted for almost a quarter or half of the domestic GDP.

"China provides loans through policy banks controlled by the state to make it between traditional international private creditors such as bond investors and other official bilateral government lenders. He said, "((countries) in the end how much money owed China is not sure. China does not participate in the traditional credit and reporting system. It tends to set up confidentiality clauses to prevent the debt party from disclosing relevant information."

The Associated Press has recently reported that China's lending operation has now led to dozens of poor countries in the world facing the sovereign debt crisis and the economy is on the verge of collapse. These countries include Pakistan, Kenya, etc., of which Zambia and Sri Lanka have debt default. Some experts point out that unless China makes concessions, more debt defaults will occur in relevant borrowing countries. At the same time, although these countries are in crisis, the Chinese government is still unwilling to avoid debt.

Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) Agent Markrosen, executive director, strongly suggested US legislators to urge relevant international institutions to adhere to the core functions of providing assistance to the sovereign debt crisis. He also believes that China is the biggest challenge to maintain the stability of world finance.

"The biggest challenge facing the International Monetary Fund today is China. China provides a lot of funds to emerging markets and low -income countries in an opaque and irresponsible way. ","

He also said that China has been urging the increase in its share in the International Monetary Fund, but in view of its debt behavior, it is not the time to increase China's share.

Daniel F.Runde, senior vice president of the US Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS), emphasized that if the United States cannot play the leadership role of international financial institutions such as multilateral development banks in the competition of large powers, the majority of developing countries will be in the majority of developing countries will Turn to help in China and Russia. He also suggested that the United States should increase capital in the development of banking systems such as Fuxing and Development Bank in Europe, and incorporate Taiwan as an economy into the system to better support the global financial system led by the United States.

A recent research report published by the Research Team of the University of Okayama, Japan, pointed out that the grinding teeth may be related to food fiber intake during sleep, increasing food fiber intake or improving molar behavior.

Kyodo News reported that the research surveyed about 140 students aged 18 to 32 to 35 nutrients, and whether there were molars when sleeping. The results showed that the average food fiber intake of students who did not wear teeth was about 13 grams per day, and the food fiber intake of the grinding students was about 10 grams per day. The difference in three grams of three grams is the food fiber content of three bananas.

There is only food fiber associated with molars. There were previous studies that the more food fiber intake, the higher the sleep quality.

The research team of the University of Okayama said that molar can cause adverse effects such as tooth defects and periodontal disease. The lower the quality of sleep, the more prone to molars.

At present, the causes of molars are ingested with caffeine and alcohol, but no way to reduce the behavior of molars has not been found.

Reuters reported that Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday (May 24) that according to the communication of Ukrainian officials intercepted by the United States, the drone attack earlier this month was likely to be a special military or in Ukraine or Intelligence department planning.

However, American intelligence agencies do not know which unit in Ukraine has implemented the attack, and it is not clear whether the President of Ukraine or his senior officials know the operation.

The Kremlin spokesman Peskov said to the media on Thursday (25th): "We (after being attacked) immediately pointed out that the back of the attack was the Kiev power. In the final analysis, the attack was the attack of which unit of the Kiev government. ","

The Russian News Agency issued a statement on May 3 that the two drones attacked the Ke Palace on the same day, but were shot down by the Russian and intelligence department's electronic air defense system. Russia claims that the attack was implemented under the instructions of Ukraine in the United States in order to assassinate Russian President Putin and show that Russia reserves the right to revenge.

Ukraine at the time [](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230503-1390370)The United States also said that Russia was lying.

Ukrainian presidential consultant Mykhailo Podolyak said on Thursday that Ukraine and Kremlin's "strange and meaningless" attack has nothing to do.

He told Reuters that Russia tried to use Western concerns about Ukraine's possibility of attacking the Russian territory and causing an upgrade of the situation, thereby reducing the supply of weapons transported to Ukraine.

Online security experts warn that Malaysia's rapid promotion of 5G networks will cause general and risk of commercial users to face data leakage and extortion software attacks. This is because the weak network security defense system of Malaysia cannot keep up with the speed of promotion of new technology.

The Communications and Digital Minister Fami revealed last Saturday (May 20) that the 5G network coverage rate of Malaysia has reached 59.5%as of the end of April. The government's goal is to reach 80%of 5G coverage at the end of this year. Famie revealed on May 3 that once the 5G coverage rate reaches 80%, the government will make another company a 5G network supplier and break the monopoly of the current State Digital Co., Ltd. (DNB).

When the Malaysian 5G network has developed rapidly in recent years, there have also been multiple information leakage and extortion software attacks in the local area, allowing Malaysia to rank 11th among countries that are most likely to be attacked by Internet attacks in the second quarter of last year.

Duka, Chief Security Officer of Palo Altonetworks, told "Nikkei Asia": "With the promotion of 5G networks, telecommunications companies will gradually shift from the original core hardware infrastructure to cloud infrastructure. Learn how to turn to the cloud. This may occur (safe) vulnerability, and the attacker can be organic. "

Duka said that more and more external suppliers have entered the Internet for the expansion of private mobile networks, and hackers are more likely to launch network attacks. He said that the growth rate, faster response and increased traffic brought by 5G networks will bring new network security challenges to telecommunications companies and users.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-25T16-32-08-00-00/000000.png)Bolivia has recently reported a shocking news. The Spanish priest Alfonsopedrajas's personal diary was found to have sexual assault. Pedrahaas has been engaged in clergy related work in Bolivia for decades, and he has died in 2009 for cancer.

The priest of the Jesuit Edrahaas wrote in the log of his laptop that he had "caused many people to hurt many people ... too much", followed by numbers 85 and a question mark.

Pedrahaas also wrote that high -end clergious staff knew that his crimes remained silent.

Pedrahaas came to Bolivia in 1971 and served as a teacher in various places in this country.

Most of the charged sexual assault occurred in Juanxxii, a Sheng Ruowang (Juanxxiii) boarding school in central Bolivia. This is a school set up for poor children in rural areas.

A member of the Pedrahaas family gave his diary to the Spanish "El Pais", and the State News reported this amazing news last month. This led Bolivian prosecutors to investigate Pedrahaas and three other priests from Spain. These four priests have died, but there are other priests who have been accused of being still alive.

Giovaniarana, Secretary -General of Bolivian Episcopal Conference, said in a statement today: "The victim did not get the protection and care they deserved, but the church was indifferent to their pain."

Arana also said, "We are directly or indirectly involved in the deep pain caused by innocent sexual assault victims."

Bolivia President Luis Arce sent a letter to Pope Francis, Catholic Pope on the 22nd to ask Catholic priests to provide any relevant information about the crime of sexual assault in Bolivia.

Araner said Jordi Bertomeu, chief investigator of Pope's sexual crime, and Spanish priest Jordi Bertomeu, had arrived in Bolivia for investigation.

According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday (May 25), the number of net immigrants in the UK reached 6006,000 in 2022, a record high, and international students and migrant groups became the main British immigrant army.

Comprehensive Agence France -Presse and BBC reported that Jaylindop, director of the International Immigration Center of the National Bureau of Statistics, pointed out that the number of net immigrants has soared, mainly due to the purpose of "migrant workers, learning and humanitarian purposes, from non -EU countries for" migrant workers, learning and humanitarian purposes. "Driven by people.

In 2022, it is estimated that 1.2 million people arrived in the UK and 550,000 British immigrated to other countries. The difference between the two is the number of net immigrants.

Dr. Dr Peterwalsh at Oxford University of Oxford's immigration observation station said Britain is a popular destination for foreign students and workers. Government and universities have taken measures to recruit more students, especially students from countries such as India and Nigeria. They also brought about 100,000 partners and children.

International students usually have to pay high tuition fees, and these money can be used to subsidize the education costs of domestic students.

The rising number of net immigrants also surprised the British government. Prime Minister Sonak admitted that the number was "too high" in an interview on Thursday, but he had not lost control. He wanted to reduce it.

The Conservative Government led by Sunak has always strived to reduce the number of immigrants and hopes to end the free flow of EU personnel after Brexit through the increasingly stringent immigration policy, thereby allowing Britain to "recapture" the control of the border of the country.

The British authorities have just announced on Tuesday (23) that they will tighten the visa policy of overseas students and try to reduce the number of immigrants. The new policy stipulates that starting from next year, only international students participating in research master's programs can bring their families to Britain.

Sunak also promised to take more means, but did not disclose details.

A application intelligence company said that social media application Tiktok is testing a Tako of an artificial intelligence (AI) chat robot to communicate with users short videos and help them discover the content.

Reuters reports that the headquarters AI technology company Watchfultechnologies said that this AI chat robot known as Tako has been found in some versions of TIKTOK applications on Apple mobile devices.

According to the relevant screenshots and video information, Tako shows a ghost -shaped icon in the Tiktok program. Users can click on it when watching the video, make a text dialogue, and look for content with the help of Tako.

Tiktok's spokesman said: "In the selected market, we are promoting a new method of searching and excavation (content) on Tiktok. We look forward to learning from our user community and continue to create a safe place to bring entertainment , Stimulate creativity and promote culture. "

US media reported in April that Tiktok is testing a genetic AI tool that allows users to create avatars. According to Chinese media reports, TIKTOK's Chinese parent company's byte beating is developing a large AI model, but currently does not provide the function of providing AI chat robots on Tiktok's Chinese version.

According to information submitted to the US Patent and Trademarks last month, Tiktok has submitted a trademark application for "TIKTOK TAKO", which belongs to the "computer software for artificial human voice and text".

Watchful Technologies Researcher Danielbuchuk said that unlike Chatgpt ChatGPT, which is positioned as a multi -purpose, Tako feels more like a navigation assistant, focusing on encouraging users to watch more videos.

Buchak's demonstration shows that when users ask Tako, Tako will reply by summing up the tiktok user's prompts, and also recommend related videos.

TIKTOK set up a disclaimer, saying that TAKO is an experimental chat robot, and the answer may be inaccurate; Tiktok will talk to Tako for the purpose of security, and warn users not to share private information with Tako.
