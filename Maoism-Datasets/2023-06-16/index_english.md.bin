Erdogan emphasized that the Swedish constitutional amendments are not enough to solve Turkey's concerns, and in the case of demonstrations that his so -called "terrorists" continue to be held locally, Turkey cannot actively respond to the issue of Sweden joining NATO.

On the issue of the qualifications for EU member states in Turkey, Erdogan added that "the EU has been delaying the issue of Turkey's joining the European Union in the past 50 years. We will discuss this issue and must re -consider this issue. "

He also emphasized that "walking eastward or westward in foreign policy is not one of our principles, because the distance between us is equally close to the East and West."

### talk show actor Xie Bizi: Malaysia asked the intervention of Interpol in Malaysia for MH370 jokes

Last week, Xie Bizi, a talk show, who was born in a lawyer, was widely circulated on the Internet at the performance of a club in Manhattan. In the performance, she reviewed the history of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Triggered a stir.

**** American Singapore -American talk show actor Xie Bizi ** **** mH370 ** ** **** Air crash is joking, angry at the Malaysia authorities. She expressed the official response ** ** **** "** ******* excessive ** ** ****" ** ** ****. ** **

She told BBC that she was "not making fun of tragedy" and the victim, but tried to find humor in tragedy.

The Malaysian police said they had asked the Interpol to find Xie Bizi, and they are currently investigating her about inciting and offending network content.

Xie Biri, who grew up in Singapore, said that the interpol is "ridiculous" involving the Interpol.

Last week, Xie Bizi, a talk show, who was born in a lawyer, was widely circulated on the Internet at the performance of a club in Manhattan. In the performance, she reviewed the history of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Triggered a stir.

The International Interpol told the BBC that they had not received the Malaysian police's assistance to the case.

Xie Bizi said that her jokes "have been disconnected on social media."

"I have said (this paragraph) hundreds of times, and even made a short version in Singapore. It always makes the audience laugh. If it does not work well, I won't use it anymore."

She also said that "to get rid of" or make fun of the audience is part of her New York comedy club culture. She said that American comics have used the "9/11" attack as a joke material.

"Americans can appreciate more severe, sharp, and more straightforward humor, and in Asia, single -sized comedy is still in its infancy. You can't find a lot of sharp comedy in Asia." She said.

In the performance that triggered controversy, Xie Bizi first teased a Malaysian with a rough mouth, saying that Singapore has become the first world country since 1965 independence, and Malaysia "is still a developing country."

Then, she continued to ridicule Malaysia's planes to "not fly" and associate it with Malaysia Airlines MH370 tragedy.

"What? Malaysia Airlines is not funny at all, isn't it?" She joked with a smile, and then said with a word, "Some jokes won't land."

In March 2014, a Boeing 777 passenger aircraft from Malaysia Airlines disappeared from the radar on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Search and rescue personnel from many countries conducted four years of search in the Indian Ocean and discovered some wreckage, but did not find the host. 239 people on board were announced to be killed.

On March 29, 2022, Xie Bizi performed a talk show when he appeared at the comedy club in Bobbank, California.

The film was also deleted by Tiktok because it violated its hatred of remarks.

According to reports, the Malaysian Brigade and the United States and dozens of Malaysian overseas Chinese were burned on Sunday (June 11) in Flushing, New York, which protested, saying that this move had no mercy to the family members of Malaysians and the family members of the air crash and asked her to ask her Public apology.

Earlier, the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had condemned it. Foreign Minister Zambry Abdkadir said her talk show blatantly lacks sensitivity and sympathy for the family members of Malaysians and the families of air crash.

Vanu Gopala Menon, the highest commissioner of Singapore in Malaysia, apologized. Singapore Foreign Minister Vivianbalakrishnan also tried to calm the dispute, saying that he was "shocked" by these jokes.

"Of course, she does not represent the point of view of the Singaporeans." Vivian said, saying that the Singaporeans "cherish the relationship with Malaysian family and friends."

Some Internet users, including Xie Bizi's talk show actor, participated in her numbness. But some people think this is acceptable irony.

The main function of the Interpol is shared information about fugitives and brought them back to the criminal country.

"I really hope to see the face of an international criminal police organization who receives this request." Ms. Xie said.

"Honestly, if the International Interpol Organization takes this requirement and the incident is upgraded, can you imagine how famous it will make me famous?"Last month, Chinese talk show actor Li Haoshi was detained because he was accused of insulting the Chinese PLA during his performance.

The long -awaited visit will be postponed in February this year for the increasingly tense relationship between these two superpowers.

The U.S. State Department said on the 14th that Brinton will visit China from June 16th to 21st, and will become the highest -level officials in China to visit China. During this period, he will also visit London.

The statement pointed out that Brins will meet with senior Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss the importance of "maintaining open communication channels" between China and the United States. But the statement did not specify which officials participated in the talks.

The brief statement pointed out that the highest US diplomat "will also ask the issue of bilateral concerns, global and regional affairs, and the issue of potential cooperation on common cross -border challenges."

U.S. officials quickly adjusted their expectations.

Daniel Critebline, the highest diplomat in charge of East Asian affairs, told reporters at the press conference on the 14th, "We go to Beijing, not to get some breakthroughs or transformations in our way of getting along with us. ","

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-15T03-52-30/image-1-1686800031.jpg)The Philippines, the United States and Japan held joint maritime exercises

Critblink said, "We will go to Beijing with a realistic, confident attitude and sincere desire to manage the competition between us in a responsible way."

At the same time, the White House India -Pacific Affairs coordinator Kolt Campbell said that Brins will focus on promoting the "primary goal" in its agenda, but do not seek "formulating a long series of delivery."

Those above these goals will be better military exchanges, and this has been proven to be a field that has been particularly watched recently.

Campbell told reporters, "I believe that Secretary of State Broskens will strongly advocate the necessity of these communication channels." "They are mature and powerful troops to interact, and avoid these key communication channels to bear high risks."

US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller pointed out in a statement that Brinken passed the phone with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Tuesday and emphasized the relationship between "maintaining open communication channels and responsible management". importance.

The statement pointed out that Brins also "also" clearly stated that the United States will continue to use diplomatic contact to propose the area and potential cooperation areas. "

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-15T03-52-30/image-2-1686800091.jpg)The U.S. Navy released the so -called video with Chinese warships close -range(Peninsula TV Station)The Chinese side adopted a more straightforward tone in the manuscript of the call with Brinken, and pointed out that the Foreign Minister Qin Gang believes that since the beginning of this year, the relationship between the two countries has faced "new difficulties and challenges."

According to a statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Qin Gang made it clear during the call, "" Sino -US relations have encountered new difficulties and challenges, and the responsibility is clear. "

He also added that China always follows the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping.

The tension between the two countries -involving trade, espionage, military existence in the Indo -Pacific region, the Ukrainian war, and the situation of the Taiwan Strait was fully reflected in the post -China trip to China in February this year.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-15T03-52-30/2023-02-22T213850Z_579875763_RC2LGZ9ZA2EX_RTRMADP_3_USA-CHINA-BALLOON-CONGRESS-1686800166.jpg)The pictures provided by the U.S. government show the so -called "spy balloon" floating over the United States in the United States.(Reuters)The background of this visit was that the United States claimed that the so -called Chinese "spy balloon" flew over the United States and caused controversy. Recently, U.S. officials, including Brinken, also claimed that China has operated the so -called "spy facility" in Cuba for many years and upgraded in 2019. American media have previously reported such news.

The remarks about the situation in the Taiwan Strait have been heating up. Biden said many times last year that if the mainland chose Wu Tong Taiwan, the United States would interfere with and "defend" the island. For many years, the United States has adhered to its so -called "strategic fuzzy" official policy, that is, while providing important military support to Taiwan Island, it does not clearly acknowledge or promise to provide assistance when attacking it on the mainland.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Navy accused its warships of "unsafe" operations near a US destroyer in the Taiwan Strait. Officials set this incident into one of the recent incidents that may cause accidents and upgrade risks. In addition, these incidents also included a situation that happened in May this year -at the time, a Chinese fighter aircraft was over the South China Sea. A close range of a US reconnaissance aircraft. The United States claims that this is "unnecessary aggressive maneuverability", while China blame the liability for incident on the "provocations" implemented by the United States. Officials said that these incidents highlighted the necessity of strengthening communication between the two sides.

The United States also seek to strengthen its relationship with the Indo -Pacific allies, including informal "alliances" through the United States, Australia, India, and Japan. In addition, it signed a new security agreement called "Aukus" with the United Kingdom and Australia, which aims to equip Australia with nuclear -powered submarines.

Biden maintains a series of additional tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump to China. The Biden government has also implemented export controls on some key advanced technologies, such as semiconductors and its manufacturing tools. At the same time, it also encourages its allies to do so and seek to transfer key supply chains from China.

China often accuses the United States of dangerous cold war thinking.

Nevertheless, in recent months, the two countries have worked hard to control the tension. The two sides also seek cooperation in some areas, especially in the field of climate change.

Last month, Bayon's national security adviser Jack Shalin held a closed -door meeting with Chinese senior diplomat Wang Yi in Vienna.

The United States calls the talks "frank, substantial and constructive."

The support of the refugee hotline "Alarm Phone" said that the Coast Defense Force "had known the ship's adventure for several hours before sending any help", and said that the authorities had a problem with the fishing vessel "learned from different channels."

The organization added that immigrants on the ship may be afraid to face the Greek authorities because they know that the country's "terrible systems are used to deal with refugees."

Ang Miaomin -Myanmar Parallel National Solidarity Government(Question)The Minister of Human Rights -urged the world to investigate the responsibility of the war crimes that the Burmese military may commit more than two years ago.

Visit Australia, meet with propaganda groups and non -governmental organizations, and give a speech at the university. The minister also aims to win support for the movement of the military government to overthrow the military government.

Since the military will select the National Democratic Alliance in Myanmar in February 2021(NLD)Since the party has been dismissed from the government, this diversified country has split into many domestic conflicts, which has exacerbated the turbulence of some regions for decades.

The national unity government is different from the non -violent position of the overthrown leader Aung Shan Suji. On the contrary, the national unity government has established the so -called people's national defense army(PDF)Join the battle and sometimes train and fight with the established national armed groups.

The military's infringement of human rights has exacerbated various domestic conflicts, including bombing civilians. The minister calls him "endangering human crimes and war crimes."

Ang Miaomin told Peninsula TV, "We not only emphasize what the country is happening, but we also call on the international judicial system to pursue international responsibility through all possible ways."

Last month, Hurricane Mocha swept the low -lying regions in the northwest of Ruo Kaibang, destroyed many camps that Rohingya lived for more than ten years, and exacerbated people's military control to humanitarian assistance in this rapidly divided country. Worries.

The national unity government -composed of Aung Shan Su Ji ’s national democratic alliance -maintaining diplomatic relations with the foreign government, but has not yet obtained official recognition -this is also coveted by the generals who have been seized by leaders.

At this time, as the first representative of the national unity government, Australia also met with the consultant of Foreign Minister Huang Yingxian.

"We must do our best to make the national unity government recognize as a legal government because we must do our best because we are the legal government."

The PDF group of the national unity government was also accused of infringing human rights. In August last year, three members of Changwu in the middle of the world(Chang-U)The town is facing the charges of the execution of French abroad and rape suspected of military sympathy.

The charged perpetrators have not been rope.

In response, the minister told the Peninsula TV station that the case was "taking legal operations", and the national unity government "" uses the use of military behavior for each member of the People's National Defense Forces, and is doing many things to prevent this (happen to happen (happening ): Obief and respect. "

####

Further hindering the national unity of the government to create sustainable support factor is the diversity of racial groups that constitute Myanmar. Many of them fight against the army for a long time before the recent coup.

According to official statistics, there are more than 135 nations with more than 55 million people. This country was established at the end of the British colonial rule in 1948. It was formerly part of Myanmar and British India. Minorities, because the previous Myanmar government described them as a "incident" from Bangladesh, and based on a law in 1982, the Rohingya was deprived of citizenship.

Although this country is diverse, the majority of Burmese (also known as the Burmese) controls the army and major political parties, such as the National Democratic Alliance, which has exacerbated the continuous racial tension.

But the Minister of Human Rights told the Peninsula TV station that the leadership must tolerate other ethnic groups, including folk society and ethnic armed groups(Eag)Essence

The Minister of Human Rights said that "the national unity government is composed of different stakeholders, including parliamentary members of the 2020 elections, and representatives of racial background."

"What is important is to bring trust and prove that the government of national unity (in) cooperation with different racial groups."

In an interview with the Peninsula TV station, Ang Miaomin acknowledged that Aung San Suuki, which was detained by the military, failed to fully resolve the 2017 military suppression operation. This operation forced nearly one million Rohingya to enter the south of Bangladesh.

Many people -including the Rohingya -once believed that the Nobel Peace Prize winner will become their supporters. On the contrary, although she is still the leader of the country in December 2019, She went to the Hague International Court to defend the army to avoid allegations from racial extinction.

Ang Miaomin insisted that "the first thing (the national unity government) is to acknowledge the crime against the Rohingya, which is no longer a hidden agenda."

"We strongly recommend and are committed to the righteousness of the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities who have suffered a variety of forms of the military."

Rual THANG is Christian -based Qinbang from western Myanmar. It is located above Ruoche State. He now lives in Australia and meets the minister during his journey.

He told Peninsula TV that the government's successful government has successfully contacted different racial groups, not only in Myanmar, but also among international diasporas.

He said, "contact with different tribes and ethnic communities is necessary," he added, "otherwise, the legitimacy of their people, especially for ethnic minorities, may be affected."

RUAL THANG, who temporarily moved to Australia in 2019, is unwilling to return because of the battle upgrade since 2021 and the suppression of political activists such as him and the suppression of political activists.

RUAL THANG, who temporarily moved to Australia to study in 2019. Due to the battle upgrade since the coup in 2021 and the suppression of political activists like him, he is not willing to return to China.

After the coup, the Qinlan National Defense Force appeared(CDF)And Qinbang National Defense Force(CNDF)Wait for armed groups, and have long -term existence of the Qin National Army(CNA)Alliance, the latter was established after a major political uprising in 1988.

Rual THANG told Peninsula TV that in his opinion, the Qin people did not want to leave Myanmar, but wanted to obtain equal representative power in the federal cabinet.

He also said that "the Qin people have their own political agenda. The primary task is Federal State, but it is not necessarily the inheritance of / or) from the Myanmar mainland. This is not the political goal of the Qin people."

While admitting that the minister has made a unity for the establishment of unity between ethnic groups, he also holds skepticism about the diversity of national unity government, and believes that the national unity government continues to represent the National Democratic Alliance led by the Burmese.

He told the Peninsula TV stations, "In my opinion, the national unity government is an exile shadow government, which basically represents the National Democratic Alliance Party, and may not necessarily represent all ethnic communities."

According to the Burmese service of Radio Free Asia this week, the representatives from more than 170 PDFs from the Dajiandu province are still unwilling to form an alliance with the national unity of the government. They held a two -day strategic meeting at the end of May, but did not invite national united government officials official This indicates that there is potential differences.

#### Need to "trust the Alliance"

Some Rohingya also has a doubt about the motivation of the national unity government.

Hibratman, Australia, told the Peninsula TV stations that "(the (national unity government) did not allow any Rohingya representatives to participate in their political management."

"We don't know if (national unity government) is using us as a politician signs, or whether they are sincere."

Ruo Kaibang is where most of the remaining Rohingya people live in Myanmar, which further exacerbates the complex situation of Ruo Kaibang. This is the divisionism.(AA)Location, Hobel Blaman believes that Ruojun controls about 70%of the region in the area.

Hibelbraman told the Peninsula Television that the situation between the military, the Kaijie and the national unity government was a waiting competition to see who would control the area.

Habiblaman said, "We (we (Rohingya) do not know whether the national unity government will succeed, or whether it will be successful if the army will be opened."

Nevertheless, some analysts believe that the government's unity government has made progress.

Malape said in a Parliament on Wednesday: "In the past 48 years, we see that our army is increasingly declining." He said, "sovereignty must be based on the stability and strength of the army."

In the country's protest last month, demonstrators accused the agreement of the strategic competition that could be involved in the United States and China. Marlape emphasized at the time that Papua New Guinea would not be used as a base for "launching war".

Papua New Guinea has rich natural resources and is close to busy shipping routes. In recent years, the country has increasingly discovered that it is in the center of diplomatic wrestling between Washington and Beijing.

Former Prime Minister Petero'Neill said the agreement pushed Papua New Guinea to the public. "The United States does this to protect our national interests. We all know what is happening in our region in geopolitics."

****

** 1. "Brainwashing: China and the World in the Mao Zedong and the Houmao era" academic seminar of academic seminars and backgrounds **

From May 29th to June 1st, 2023, the academic seminar entitled "Badels: China and the World in the Mao Zedong and the Houmao era" was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Research Foundation, the East Asian Library of the University of Washington, and the California Modern China Research Center were co -sponsored. More than 20 scholars and experts participated. The meeting was successful, and fully research discussions and arguments were launched around the topic of brainwashing.

** ** Hold the original intention of ** ** "** ** brainwashing ** **" ** ** Seminar:

At present, the special historical situation of China and the international community has perfection of totalitarianism and trapped inside and outside. One of the two strokes -brainwashing has become the most critical element for maintaining totalitarian power. In this way, the research and disclosure of brainwashing has become one of the most urgent topics of the Chinese and the world.

** 2 ** **) Overview of the participating scholars **

****

** 2. Basic content and results of the Symposium on Brandiat **

*** Review of brainwashing: source and their spiritual traceability **

In the opening speech, Professor Lin Peiri talked about the general schizophrenia and multiple conscious structures of people in this brainwashing society in China, and put forward his interesting observation of Chinese -style "brainwashing" and "mouth washing".

Professor Xia Ming's "Study of Braastin's theoretical Research: Beginning, Flowing, and New Perspective" summarizes the evolution of brainwashing in history, especially nearly a century, and can summarize three different modes: 1. Classical brainwashing: From ancient times and the Middle Ages, we They all see the use of violence and torture to achieve the purpose of changing people's thoughts and beliefs. This method can still see residues (such as the Chinese government's persecution of objections, brainwashing in Xinjiang and Tibet). 2. Modern brainwashing: mainly through controlling people's environment (far away from family loved ones, closed, concentration camps, learning groups, social mobilization, publicity, monitoring, etc.) to change people's psychology, personality and behavioral model, forcing individuals or groups to obey and accept it Perfectist thought or totalitarian system. 3. In the 21st century, information science, computer technology, brain neuroscience, biomedical chemistry and other breakthroughs brought about brainwashing brought about by breakthroughs. The CCP tries to output its high -tech totalitism model to brainwashing the world.

Dr. Zhou Zehao is the translator of Edward Hunter's famous monograph "Brandr of Red China: Planning Destruction of Man's Thoughts". This new word is known for the first time in the book. Dr. Zhou pointed out that Hunter's unique contribution was to establish a direct relationship between brainwashing and communist red regime.

Dr. Chen Kuide's "Fairness: Tracking of a History of Thought" discussed the definition of brainwashing and its spiritual origin from the perspective of political philosophy and the history of thought, and pointed out that the word "brainwashing" was short long after the origin of the word origin, and it originated from the communist. China. However, the spiritual and ideological origin of "brainwashing" can be traced far. In addition to Marx, he mainly sorted out the influence of German philosopher Nietzsche, the cultural hegemony theory of the cultural hegemony of the Italian philosopher Grandisi, and the "powerism" of French philosopher Foucault on brainwashing.

He pointed out that there is a tendency to contemplate all human discourse exchanges as "brainwashing". This tendency has regarded all language and words as "brainwashing". This kind of pan -washingism will annihilate the differences between right and wrong, good, evil, authenticity, etc., causing a world of chaotic value, the world of "1984".

From the perspective of the basic context, strictly speaking, brainwashing is a special product of the twentieth century, and is a product of a highly closed totalitarian society supported by violence. The open society with freedom of thought and freedom is a brainwashing disinfection agent.

** ** ** brainwashing ** ** "** ** Practice in the CCP's political movement **

This session mainly discussed the practice of the CCP's stages of brainwashing: the Yan'an period, the intellectual transformation of the intellectuals in the early stages of the establishment of the government, the anti -rightist movement in 1957, the 1958 movement of the party, the Cultural Revolution, and so on.

Dr. Pei Yi's "from" baptism "to" brainwashing "-the historical positioning of Yan'an's rectification" specifically discussed the evolution of Yan'an's rectification brainwashing.

Professor Song Yongyi did the brainwashing of intellectuals in the "Ideological Transformation Movement"? "Report, this is a chapter in his monograph" Mao Zedong and New China ". He believes that the CCP's policy of intellectuals," transformation "should be one of its most basic policies, with its trilogy: 1 ) Inciting the political learning of Marxism-Leninism; 2) Criticism in the masses of the masses-review-explanation; 3) sports types are frank and organized.

In the early days of the Chinese Communist Party, a famous Chinese liberal intellectuals appeared in the first tide of self -examination of self -examination of self -examination of self -examination of Zhu Guangqian, Chen Yuan, Feng Youlan, Fei Xiaotong and others. The cause of this phenomenon is that intellectuals mistakenly believe that the CCP's military victory is the attitude of "uncomfortable and faith" of the victory of ideas, and there is also a strong pursuit of traditional Chinese tradition when changing the dynasties.

Professor Li Xixi gave a speech on "Belief and Resistance: The Christian Three -Self Patriotic Movement of the Mao Zedong period". Professor Li's speech provides a very convincing answer for many people's minds. Why is it in other fields in China, why is the Christian's resistance specially determined? Believe in the resistance of Panshi in the brain washing.

The report of "conscious brainwashing: the 1958 movement of the party in 1958" reported by Dr. Ding Shu solved the inside of the 1958 intellectual circles in China. In a sense, Dr. Ding can be said to fill the gap in the academic community.

** 3 ** **) Monitoring and brainwashing everywhere

This session mainly discusses some basic methods of brainwashing the CCP.Professor Wu Guoguang of Stanford in his speech in his "Strategy to Cognitive Wars: Analysis of the CCP's Publicity", divided into three differences in the historical development of the CCP's great strategy in the usual fun and humorous way of the common fun and humorous way, At the stage, the so -called Xi Jinping era formed by the Mao era, the post -Mao era, and the past ten years. That is, the brainwashing of the Mao era, the exquisite propaganda of the post -Mao era, and the cognitive war in the Xi Jinping era. He discussed the characteristics and commonality of the CCP's propaganda at the above stages, and outlined a historical evolution map of the CCP's propaganda strategy, and analyzed the motivation of this evolution and the unchanged context behind it.

Pei Minxin, a lecturer professor from the McKenner College of Clemundy, "dissecting the CCP's monitoring system" with rigorous methods.

** 4 ** **) totalitarian and brainwashing under international vision **

This session carried out a review of brainwashing internationally internationally.

Professor Cheng Yinghong, who is famous for studying international left -wing forces and his trend of thought, has made a refreshing research on "New Fascist and Newcomers: Discussing a New Perspective of Thoughts".

Professor Zhang Weichi and Professor Quan Zhize depicted and analyzed the young dictator of North Korea at the seminar "the idolized Kim Jong -un", let us see the other side of the Jin family dynasty.

Professor Guo Jian of the University of Wisconsin said with his unique vision, "conspiracy theory and awakening culture: American bipolar politics with different ways to return", sharply pointed out that the phenomenon of a certain way of the right and extremely left politics in the American society, and pointed out that it has to the world to the world harm.

The independent scholar Ms. Guo Yiping put forward her point of view with "an important role in" ideological factors in the failure of Russia's democratic transformation after the Soviet Union ", which caused some useful controversy.

** 5 ** **) From Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping: The new development of the CCP "brainwashing" **

** 6 ** **) Professor Yu Maochun made ** ** "** ** international diplomacy, the Chinese Communist Party's brainwashing publicity ** **" ** ** ** **

Because he was the chief Chinese policy and planning consultant of former US Secretary of State Peng Peio, his speech aroused widespread interest in participants, and at the same time gave the participants a sense of liveness in the evolution of US -China relations. People are particularly interested, for example, he pointed out:

The Chinese government pays a lot of money and allows a research center of Harvard University to do so -called polls in China. This poll was seriously summarized and said that 93%of the Chinese people recognized and supported the leadership of the Communist Party. The poll of this Harvard University has become an attachment for the Chinese government to confuse the Chinese people and the people of the world for many years. It is often cited by the CCP ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the party’ s public opinion and emphasized it. In fact, this is a classic example of deceiving the world. The so -called polls made by this Harvard University research center are not made by themselves. The truth is that this Harvard University Research Center, who has donated many Chinese donations, commissioned to register in China, and the "Zero Research Consultation Group" headquartered in Beijing(Horizon Research Consultancy Group)Capturing the sword to do it on behalf of.

He also gave a lot of examples disclosure and said:

II China uses translation to transform the world in international exchanges. This is a very complicated issue and a very important issue. The CCP training translator has systematic and strong policy guidance. It is definitely not just learning the language translation skills of "Cindaa". All the regular translators of the Communist Party of China I have contacted have a very strong party spirit, and they can grasp the size of the policy during the translation process. Just missed or turned naked.

..............

** 7 ** **) Mr. Hu Ping, a famous democratic movement theorist, did ** ** "** ** from ** ** '** ** thought transformation ** **' ** ** to ** to ** ** '**** Not allowed to talk about ** **' "** ** The keynote speech **

Hu Ping pointed out: The CCP's ideological transformation movement is "brainwashing", that is, "people's domestication". From a certain perspective, the history of the rise and fall of the Communist Party is the history of domestication, avoiding and rebellion. Brainwashing, with the words of Xi Jinping today, is called "not to be discussed." Today, the set of thought transformation has already been abandoned, but political learning has been reinforced, and personal worship is re -burns. The most important point of ordering the Chinese people to order the Chinese people is "not allowed to discuss". This is a vein with the ideological transformation of that year.

** Three, conclusion **

* This "Badshine" academic seminar theoretically confirmed that the theory of "brainwashing" can be used as an important tool for studying Chinese issues. * The meeting carried out historical review and in -depth analysis of the Communist Party of China as a patent brainwashing political movement. * The meeting issued a solemn warning message on the "brainwashing" to the past and the dangers of the world and the future.

Czech President President Paeville's opening speech mentioned in the opening speech of the EUROPEAN VALUES Center for SecurityPolicy at the Prague Think Tank's opening speech mentioned that China has increased its dependence on China with the acquisition of infrastructure in various countries. Such development is quite dangerous. The Czech Republic is unintentionally isolated in China, nor can it not be able to do business with China, but China's strategic interests are not compatible with the value of the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is unwilling to see that international order is influenced by China's economy and military forces, and the EU, NATO and other countries are necessary to unite and countermeasures.

"Let us keep unity in maintaining the situation in Taiwan, and do not allow China to strongly strengthen his ambitions in Taiwan. Taiwan has democratic rules, and the same Hong Kong is the same, but now it has been slowly disintegrated. The world should continue to support its full support. Defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom. "

When Pavili gave a speech, Wu Zhaozheng, a Taiwan Foreign Minister who visited the Czech Republic for the second time, sat in the first row. Taiwan has only formal diplomatic relations with the Holy See in Europe. This is the first time that European non -diplomatic diplomatic relations are the first stage with Taiwan Foreign Ministers. The organizers and the Taiwan Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs were posted photos of the two "same frames" in Twitter.

Wu Zhaozheng immediately delivered a speech with the title of "One theater, one vision" (one theater, One World, and Onevision, and called for democratic countries to unite to support Taiwan for the threat of the expansion of authoritarianism.

Wu Zhaoyi said: "In order to keep Taiwan strong and tough and have the courage to continue to maintain the status quo, we need the support of European friends. Among all those who speak for Taiwan, I would like to thank the Czech Republic to support Taiwan."

Wu Zhaozheng condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine. It also mentioned that China attacked Taiwan through composite means such as cognitive operations, fake messages, and online attacks.** Foreign Minister of Taiwan: I hope that the freedom of the people of Taiwan can also achieve it in China **

Wu Zhaozheng pointed out that Beijing proposed the so -called Chinese dream of "realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" to continue the Communist rule in a way to restrain people's speech, belief and freedom of election and destroy the objections. For example, Uighurs re -educate camps, oppress the Tibetan government, the end of the Hong Kong democracy, and religious Sinicization are all the appalling stories of China's move to the totalitarian system. Hong Kong experience also shows that the "one country, two systems" is not feasible, and Taiwan is more firmly choosing freedom and democracy.

Wu Zhaozheng emphasized that Taiwan is not demanding China. China shared the cultural root of the cultural and Taiwan. Taiwan is not hostile to the Chinese people. It is hoped that the freedom that the people of Taiwan can enjoy one day can be realized in China.

Wu Zhaozheng mentioned that the government of Slovakia and Lithuania sent a delegation to visit Taiwan to fight against pressure and is the "moral giant".

Zhang Mengren, a convener of Foreign and International Affairs of Furen University, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and said: "The Czech Republic is really a big move, and Pavili may meet Wu Zhaozheng a week ago. Do, symbolize the Czech Republic to support democratic countries. "

Zhang Mengren mentioned that German media reported that Pavili and Cai Yingwen's call was Taiwan's initiative. This time Pavili and Taiwan Foreign Minister's frames showed that Tajie's position is very similar, and it must be a diplomatic breakthrough.

Zhang Mengren said: "The President of the Czech Republic is a former NATO general. Not only is China not democratic and China threatens Taiwan, but the Czech Republic is also very taboo that China has similar relations with Russia. As a former Central and Eastern European Communist countries, he is very afraid of Russia's aggression. Therefore, if the relationship between China and Russia is not cut off, the Czech Republic's questions about China will definitely exist forever. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Czech Republic has participated, and the relationship is now less. It is also discussed to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is also invisible protests to China. "

Zhang Mengren also said that the Czech Senate Speaker Witzili and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ada Momova, visited Taiwan, and the new ruling team was very friendly.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-15T13-46-30/1-1686836415.png)Washington continues to strengthen its military presence in the Pacific (Reuters)

According to a historic security agreement, the U.S. military can now develop and operate military bases in Papua New Guinea, which is part of Washington's efforts to surround China in the Pacific region.

The full text of the agreement -has been kept secret for some time -it has been submitted to Papua New Guinea Parliament on Wednesday night, allowing its details to be disclosed.

After reaching an agreement with Papua New Guinea in the Southwest Pacific, the United States will be able to station troops and ships at the major airports, except for the Ronbugnem Base on the island of Manus and a port of the capital of the capital Mozby.

This agreement provides the right to grant Washington's "pre -reserve" place "pre -reserves of equipment, supplies, and ammunition", as well as the rights of "construction activities" in the "exclusive use" base.

On the occasion of competition with Beijing, the agreement opened the door for Washington to establish a new military existence in the Western Pacific.

Entering the Longbulum Naval Base can be used to strengthen the facilities of the United States in Guam in the north, which may be the key to conflict in Taiwan.

Facing the wave of protests accusing the authorities of abandoning national sovereignty, Prime Minister James Malape was forced to defend the agreement.

James Malape told the parliament on Wednesday evening, "In the past 48 years, we allowed our army to weaken," he emphasized, "sovereignty depends on the stability and strength of the army."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-15T13-46-30/1-1686836473.jpg)The tension between the United States and China is intensified, but the conversation still exists

#### counter -axis

Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources and close to major routes, which has become the main key to Washington and Beijing's diplomatic deadlock.

On the other hand, former Prime Minister Peter O'Neal said the agreement made Papua New Guinea a goal.

O'Neal said, "The United States does this to protect its national interests," he also added, "We all know the geopolitics that are happening in our region."

US President Biden originally scheduled to visit Papua New Guinea, but canceled his visit due to the US Congress's budget disputes.

After taking similar measures in Beijing, Washington is trying to fight for the support of the Pacific countries through a series of diplomatic and fiscal incentives in exchange for strategic support.

Chinese companies poured into the mines and ports across the Pacific Ocean. Last year, China and the Solomon Islands of neighboring countries signed a secret security agreement to allow them to deploy troops in the country.

The United States is concerned that the Chinese army's foothold in the South Pacific may surround its facilities in Guam, which makes the situation more complicated when regaining Taiwan in China.

Democratic and parliamentary matrix. "

Lexman emphasized that Li Zhiying was facing the allegations of "unnecessary" or was sentenced to life imprisonment: "His case is a strong and powerful example, confirming how Beijing and Hong Kong authorities use the so -called" National Security Law "to destroy the city of the city. The rule of law, basic rights and freedom. They are afraid of people like Li Zhiying who love freedom, because they are the biggest threat to the CCP's lies and oppression. "She believes that the EU must make principled and clear response, including the implementation of the responsible person. Target sanctions and re -examining Hong Kong's international status.

** Follow the organization welcomes the European Parliament Resolution **

Mark Sabah, the British and EU director of the British and EU, the British Royal Labor Coruster, the British and EU chief of the British and EU chief of the British and EU chief of the British and EU chief of the British and EU chief of the British Royal Lawyer CaoilFHIONGALANGALANGALALAGHIR, ) Published The statement is welcome to speak for the European Parliament for Li Zhiying, and believes that the Hong Kong government must respond to the call of the European Parliament and immediately release Li Zhiying immediately before it was later.

They are worried that Li Zhiying, as a British citizen, may die in prison for defending democratic values and exercising international protection.

** Political prisoners such as Zou Xingtong, He Junren, and other political prisoners urged the Hong Kong government to abolish the National Security Law ** **

The above -mentioned resolutions of the European Parliament listed a series of incidents such as the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, Li Zhiying's British lawyers who were rejected, "Apple Daily" and "Position News" were forced to stop transportation. Democratic prisoners such as Dai Yaoting, Zou Xingtong, Li Zhuoren, Huang Zhifeng, and He Xiulan pointed out that they were usually detained for a long time in the long process of waiting for the interrogation.

** Dohaies in the European Parliament **

After investigating the information, the European Parliament has passed the support of Hong Kong many times in the past and called on sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials, but the European Union was unmoved. The Hong Kong initiative of the "China Policy Transnational Parliament Alliance" explained to the station that the operation of the European Union cannot be understood in the laws of parliamentary democracy in general Western countries.

Tong Songqing said: "The European Union is a huge organization, and it has a very complicated structure. For example, the EU Council is composed of the heads of state of various countries. It is responsible for external affairs and adopts a consensus system. In Greece, Italy or Hungary, if they oppose certain things in the EU Council, the EU Council will not make a decision. "

However, she emphasized that even though the European Parliament cannot determine the direction of certain laws like other Western countries, its resolution is not completely without effect. Because these actions show that some people are still concerned about Hong Kong affairs and put pressure on the EU Council, forcing the EU to make practical actions to account for the CCP and the Hong Kong Government on human rights issues.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T15-26-00-04-00/000000.png)The United States and China confirmed that Brinken will visit the United Nations Agency on June 18 and June 19 on June 18 and June 19

US Secretary of State AntonyBlinken has postponed several months of visiting China. This weekend is about to begin. In the case of fierce competition in the United States and China, and bilateral relations have fallen into the trough for decades, what impact can this visit have on US -China relations? What are the expectations of the United States and China?

[** U.S. -China Foreign Minister Call Discuss to Maintaining Communication Pipelines and Global Affairs of Bilateral Relations **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/hcm1-06142023032513.html)*** [The United States condemn the Chinese military to provoke the casualties in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-06062023113925.html)**

On Wednesday (14th), the United States and China announced the news that Secretary of State Brillings would visit China this weekend. At the regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th, the reporter from Bloomberg asked more information about Brinkee's visit to China. Spokesman Wang Wenbin responded: "After being agreed by China and the United States, US Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeit will be on June 18th Visit China on the day of the day. The two parties are visiting relevant arrangements to maintain communication. We will release it in time. "

** What is the calculation of China ’s delay in the announcement of the news of Brinkeng's visit to China? ** This will be the first time that the Secretary of State of the United States has visited China for five years. Previously, Brinken was scheduled to visit Beijing early February this year, but it was temporarily canceled due to the "spy balloon" incident. This time, in the case of many foreign media disclosed the news, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was dragged on the phone of the State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Brinken, and it was announced before it was announced.

In response, Deng Yanwen, deputy editor -in -chief of the "Study Times" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, believes: "This may also receive the lesson of the last lesson and be more cautious." He said that recently the US media has also reported that China will set up an intelligence station in Cuba in Cuba. Beijing may be worried that if this incident is fermented, it will once again affect Brinken itinerary. "Another possibility is that before Qin Gang and Brinken talk, what problems may be talked about between the two parties may not be finalized."

Bonnie Glaser, the director of the Asian Project in the Marshall Foundation in the United States, told this station: "China is undoubtedly wanting the United States to look more interested in this visit. They think of it. It may make them look better in China. But China really wants to have this visit. "

** Blint's trip to the United States and China is not high in the United States and China **

Daniel J.kritenbrink, Assistant Secretary of State East Asia and Pacific Affairs, pointed out in the media telephone briefing on Wednesday (14th) that Brinkens visited China with three major goals to ensure that high -level communication channels are unblocked to reduce misjudgments. Risks; at the same time, express and defend the interests and values of the United States; and to seek potential cooperation areas that conform to each other's interests. He also said that Brintken's visit to the middle of the country is unlikely to bring breakthroughs and turns to US -China relations.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement of calling with Qin Gang and Brinken on the 14th, saying that "since the beginning of the year, Sino -US relations have encountered new difficulties and challenges, and the responsibility is clear." The statement also said that Qin Gang on the core of China on the issue of Taiwan issues such as Taiwan issue Concern and clarifying the "solemn position", emphasizing that the United States should "respect" and so on.

Ge Laiyi analyzed: "Both sides have a lot of doubt and distrust. China emphasizes that they have not asked this visit. They even say that Qin Gang and Brinken are not required by the phone call. They are still accusing all bilateral relations issues. They are caused by the United States, and they have no responsibility at all. So this will not be an easy dialogue, and what results can be observed. "

Ge Laiyi said that China did not like dealing with Brinken. She has heard that China also hopes that the Minister of Finance Yellen visits China first, but the United States insists on Blingken first. "I don't think this trip, China will be willing to give up, but the hope of the United States is not high."

** China talks about "sincerity" and "respect" Dabo: It is equivalent to the United States "shut up" **

Just before China announced that Brinken's visit to China, the domestic media in China continued to post, saying that on the one hand, the United States posted "the illusion of urgent communication", and at the same time, it was "repeatedly tentatively provoked" on the bottom line of principle. There is also an article that the United States is "forcibly '" Tyngers' "and questioned Brinken's visit to China. Chinese officials have previously stated many times that the key to the US -China communication is that the United States cannot "say one set and one set".

When Deng Yanwen analyzed the Chinese mentality, "Brinken is coming, but it is just to cooperate with you in a certain aspect, but after returning, what should you do? Don't respect. "

Robertdaly, the director of the Institute of Kissinger, USA, believes: "The problem is China's definition of 'sincerity' and the definition of" respect ", it seems to be 'shut -mouth'. If you have sincerity, If you respect us, you don't allow you to do anything we don't want, and you don't allow you to say anything that we don't like. This is a condition that the United States will not accept. "

Kurtcampbell, a coordinator of the White House, also emphasized at the media briefing on Wednesday that the United States is competing with China, but the United States does not seek conflict, confrontation or the new Cold War. What the United States wants is "responsible management competition."

Dabo believes: "We have some different views on the world's situation and the security of the Western Pacific, but can we reduce the possibility of direct conflict. US relations. It is impossible to change these relationships. "

** Bollingin visited the Huawei APEC Summit to pave the way? **

Ge Laiyi believes that if Bollingken visits China this time, there will be more positive signals to have more high -level US officials and Minister of Finance, such as Yellen or Commercial Minister Raymond Doro to visit Beijing.

In November this year, the United States will host the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in San Francisco. Ge Laiyi said that if Brinton's visit can make some preparations for the APEC summit, it will be a good result in itself.

Dabo also pointed out that if the two sides can adhere to the more polite tone at this meeting: "Because, in fact, their goal is not just to meet with relevant officials in China, but they must prepare Xi Jinping when they go to San Francisco in November in November. , Biden and Xi Jinping's summit. This is the most important. "

** The US -China military communication mechanism is difficult to recover **

A worry -free aspect of relations between the two countries is long -term interrupted military dialogue. Although the United States has recently tried to communicate with China to communicate with China, Beijing seems to have little interest. Earlier this month, China Defense Minister Li Shangfu refused to hold a seasons during a conversation with US Defense Minister Lloydaustin during the During Shangri -La dialogue.

Campbell said on Wednesday that I believe that Brins will strongly advocate the necessity of these communication channels. "They are mature and powerful military interaction, and the risk of avoiding the establishment of these key communication channels is too high."However, Deng Yanwen believes that in order to achieve further exchanges, China will first ask the sanctions against China Defense Director Li Shangfu, but it is currently unlikely.

RobertSpalding, a senior researcher at Hudson College of the U.S. Think Tank Hudson College, said: "The realistic conference is when Biden and Xi Jinping meet. The meeting has nothing to do. "

** The risk of the Taiwan Strait War is still not high **

At present, the cross -strait situation has continued to be tight. Kangda recently responded to the media that Bollingin's visit to China will reiterate the maintenance of the United States for the maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.

"The risk of war in the Taiwan Strait is higher than a few years ago, but I don't think it is very high." Ge Laiyi pointed out that neither the United States and China have no willing They are far from preparing for a major military operation. "Failure may lead to weakening Xi Jinping's power in China and may weaken the Communist Party of China. Xi Jinping is unlikely to make such a decision."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-15T18-20-17-04-00/000000.png)Reuters of the new crown virus 社 Reuters(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/huping/hp-06152023160205.html/@@stream)On June 11, the investigation report of the insight into the team's insight into the British "Sunday Times": "What happened in the Wuhan laboratory in the new crown?" Before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, scientists in the Laboratory of the China Wuhan Virus Institute cooperated with the Chinese PLA to create a virus mutant that can be used for biochemical weapons. Unexpectedly, the virus leaked from the laboratory. According to this report, the new crown virus is not only leaked by the laboratory, but also made by the laboratory. The amount of information on this report is very large. Many of the information were disclosed for the first time. For example, the report mentioned that the zero patient of the new coronal virus is a laboratory researcher, and the bizarre death of Zhou Yussen, a military scientist who developed the first new crown vaccine, mentioned that as early as November 19, 2019, Xi Jinping fought against the new crown. The "complex and severe situation" of the epidemic has made "important verbal and written instructions", so and so on.

We know that as early as the beginning of the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, some scientists pointed out that the new crown virus should be artificially synthesized. Because the coronary virus related to other SARS (SARS-COV-2) has a major feature, that is, in its spines(Furin Cleavage Sites, abbreviation: FCS)Essence So far, no natural coronary virus -related coronary virus is found. This Flynnase cutting site is like a universal key that enables the virus to enter the cells easily and make it infectious and pathogenic. Later, some scientists did experiments and found that the cutting site of Forinase could not be generated by natural evolution. The investigation report of the insights team tells us that this Flynnase cutting site is added by Chinese scientists.

Furthermore, as early as the outbreak of the epidemic, Chinese official media reported that the biochemical weapon expert and Major General Chen Wei of the Chinese People's Liberation Army went to Wuhan to take over the laboratory of the Wuhan Virus. This itself is doubtful that what happened in the Wuhan Virus Lab is related to the military, and the new crown virus is related to the development of biochemical weapons. The report of the insight team further confirmed this judgment.

As an expert said, if the existing evidence is placed on the court, the judge is enough to make the new crown virus is an artificial synthesis and leaked from the laboratory. A more serious problem is that the Chinese government has deliberately covered the truth from the beginning. If the Chinese government starts the world -class emergency mechanism established by China after discovering the virus leakage, it will timely start the China ’s first -class emergency mechanism established, and the epidemic can completely kill the germination state. Even according to the information published by Chinese official media, we can conclude that Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, who "personally command and deploy in person", is the first responsible person of this global disaster. We must ask Xi Jinping.

Twenty years ago, at an informal meeting of the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization Leaders held in Bangkok on October 21, 2003, a French National France -Presse reporter asked at the time of the general secretary Hu Jintao. Frankly: "SARS". He said: "When thousands of compatriots were threatened by SARS, when hundreds of compatriots died of this epidemic, as leaders of a country, I was anxious. It spreads to the international community, so as a leader in China, we are sorry for 1.3 billion Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. " The new crown epidemic is tens of thousands of times more than hundreds of thousands of times more than SARS (that is, Sas). What is Xi Jinping?

We propose to blame Xi Jinping, which has sufficient legal basis. China is the contractor of the International Health Regulations. The "International Health Regulations" require that the contractual national needs to report to the World Health Organization in a timely and effectively report in the country may constitute an internationally concerned public health incident. If this obligation is not fulfilled, it will trigger the relevant national responsibility, which will bring serious consequences of the liability of victims or affected countries. Article 6 of the International Health Regulations clearly stipulates the obligations of the contractor. The Chinese government seriously violates the International Health Regulations and has not fulfilled its obligations that it should perform. The accountability of the victims and the affected countries is completely legitimate to the Chinese government, and there is sufficient legal basis.

Unfortunately, like many other international treaties and regulations, the International Health Regulations lack execution, especially lack of compulsory execution. If a country that seriously violates treaties or regulations ignores it at all, who has the ability to force the government to confirm the mistakes and responsibilities? No. Especially for big powers, there is a lack of sanctions. However, we must show the firm position of accountability for the Chinese government and Xi Jinping. This is at least a moral sentence.

Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

In 2023, the hottest topic discussed throughout the network was: How can I get employed when I am unemployed?

Regardless of the recently dismissing P7-P9 executives, cutting the Dharma Academy and other R & D positions, or the large structural adjustment from real estate to the Internet to education and then consumer electronics in recent years, it has clearly stated that —— The logic of China's economic development has been fundamentally reversed. In the short term, this change will inevitably cause pain to the society. The most direct is the growth of the unemployment population and the overall unemployment rate.

According to the data of the National Bureau of Statistics in May, China's unemployment rate is 5.1%, and the unemployment rate of young people aged 16-24 has reached 20.4%. It is impossible to statistics outside, so unemployment data is inevitably distorted. From the perspective of everyone's senses, the unemployment rate around him is far more than 5.1%. The number of unemployed people is increasing, but the exports of re -employment are shrinking. Compared with the previous five -year jump, the annual salary increased by two zero crows jumping on the legend of the branch to become a phoenix, the senior executives who often hear the past millions of annual salary are often heard. It will be rejected outside the door, and there are rumors that the major cuts of the Internet have led to a sudden drop in Hangzhou house prices. All of this seems to be hinting -the Chinese economy is facing major challenges.

In fact, every developed country in history has undergone the stage of decline in economic development after high -speed development. This is not a unique challenge that appeared only after 40 years of high -speed development in China. But in the face of this new challenge, how to deal with is a very core question. Coping properly may rejuvenate the vitality as in Germany in the early 21st century, but it may eventually fall into a middle income trap like Latin American countries, which may eventually fall into a sluggish. Therefore, from this perspective, the Chinese economy and Chinese companies' tests have just begun, and the real challenges have not been fully displayed.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T22-36-37-00-00/000184396_piclink.png)(Figure: National unemployment rate statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, from June 2020 to May 2023)

Although unemployment is a natural phenomenon in the process of economic downturn or in the process of economic transformation, compared with the breakdown of the stock market bubble and bankruptcy of the banking industry, the growth of the unemployment population and the continuous increase in the unemployment rate will cause longer negative negatives to the entire society for a long time. The factors are that the crisis of financial related industries is actually possible to effectively handle it through combined measures. In a short period of time, positive feedback can be available to regain confidence. It's like trauma bleeding as long as you find the bleeding point, stop bleeding. However, the unemployment is not the same. It is difficult to remedy the unemployment through short -term measures. All internal stimulus measures are indirect. The core is to boost investors, enterprises, and consumers confidence, but when economic expectations are pessimistic, this How difficult it is to have to be repaired in the short term. This seems to be a patient with internal bleeding. It is useless to tie the ventricular sticker outside. Long -term cultivation of surgery must be performed to solve the problem in substantially.

There are many economic pressures facing China at the moment, including Western geopolitical challenges, decline in foreign trade exports, economic structural transformation, and aging population. There are many adverse factors that lead to an increase in the unemployment rate. To understand the unemployment problem of Chinese society more deeper, we need to analyze the entire macro politics and souls from a global perspective. Through comparison with other countries in history, we can obtain more in -depth insights and potential methods to solve problems. This article is a research completed by many experts in the world of Xinfu Think Tank. It strives to interpret it in detail from the following three dimensions: 1. China and Japan compare the background to see China's unemployment challenges; Relevant suggestions to the unemployment challenge. It is hoped that through such in -depth research, it provides insights with good strategic and decision -making for enterprises and related policy makers.

** Sino -Japanese comparison big background depends on China's unemployment challenge **

Unemployment is an economic phenomenon. Simply put, people who are willing and capable to work have not found a job. Unemployment, especially group unemployment, has a great correlation with the economic cycle. At the same time, how to understand the unemployment and the means of dealing with unemployment involves different society and culture. Therefore, in order to study the unemployment of a country in depth, we must compare it horizontally and vertically to obtain more deep insights.

To say that China's current situation is the most similar to which country in history. It is Japan in the 1980s. The high similarity of the two countries in the development process: from real estate bubbles to population aging, to young people lying flat, low -level low -level low -level low -level low -level The spread of desireism has made many people feel that Chinese society has entered the "Japanese model". In this regard, Gu Chaoming, the chief economist of the Japanese Institute of Nomura, has done a systematic research and comparison about the situation of China and Japan 30 years ago. Core insight:

First of all, the United States in the Great Depression in 1929, the economic crisis began in Japan in 1990, and China is facing the "Balance SheetRecession". The impact of this recession to the national GDP and society depends to a large extent on the government. Regulatory measures. Simply put, because the economic expectations are good, the family is the largest depositor and the enterprise is the borrower, because borrowing money investment can obtain higher returns. However, when the expected decline is sharply declined, the family and the enterprise are more conservative. They choose to save money in the bank instead of borrowing from the bank. The company will even surpass the family to become the largest store. If it is expected to be pessimistic enough, the central bank's interest rate cuts will eventually be invalid.

Obviously, in a economic system, if only people who save money and have no borrowers, the economy will collapse. This is the situation in the Great Depression in the United States in 1929. At that time, the United States lost the wealth equivalent to the first year of GDP in 1929 At the same time, the next year's GDP plummeted 46%. However, Japan's situation after the 1990s is the opposite. Although from the perspective of Japan's wealth loss, it is equivalent to three times the GDP of Japan in 1989, which is far greater than the loss of the United States that year. Above the level. The most critical point in the middle is the government's role conversion. To put it plainly, in this case, the most direct solution is that the government acts as a large -scale borrower to maintain the normal economic operation of the economy.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T22-36-37-00-00/000184395_piclink.png)(Figure: Comparison from 1990 to 2005 in the United States and Japan, the blue line is the United States, and the red line is Japan)Paul Crugman, an economist in the United States and the Nobel Prize in Economics, also has a similar point of view in a 1998 economic contraction analysis. In short, "if people hold lower income in the future, they are relatively low. In terms of expectations, at this time, even if the central bank's interest rate is zero, people will continue to save, which eventually leads to the overall savings more than the degree of absorption of the economy. Therefore, no matter how the central bank handles the current currency supply, it cannot be re -expanded to the economy to the economy. Restore full employment ... thereby generating liquidity traps. "In other words, macro -control cannot boost confidence, and the economy will inevitably enter the spiral reduction model. The confidence in China's economic reconstruction is particularly important!

Secondly, although China and Japan 30 years ago, although they faced real estate bubbles, the impact of real estate on the overall economy was completely different. It is mainly manifested in two aspects: First, Japan was mainly commercial real estate bubbles. In fact, there were not many real real estate activities. To put it simply, Japan ’s price is the original real estate price. In fact, the number of newly developed civilian real estate is very small. Therefore, after the bubble is crushed, the balance sheet of buying a house has become worse. But on the other hand, China, China has actually added a large number of real estate in recent years. With the de -foaming of real estate, there will be a large number of rotten real estate. Worsening the balance sheet of ordinary home buyers.

Therefore, from the perspective of data, Japanese real estate accounted for 20%of GDP and 26%of Chinese real estate accounted for GDP. It seemed that the difference was not much. China's real estate has a large diving like Japan (the average price of Japan fell by 87%of the year), and it is definitely not the same as the overall economy. Therefore, from the perspective of government, not only requires a large loan to stimulate the economy, but also to revive the construction industry, especially through some financial stimulus measures to complete the project that has begun. In any case, from the perspective of real estate and the overall economic relationship, it is difficult for China GDP to maintain a high level of foam like Japan GDP, and the probability of declining GDP is increasing. It can be seen that the fundamental problem behind Chinese real estate is the issue of people's livelihood and social stability, which is completely different from Japan.

In addition, the internal and external environmental pressures faced by China are actually much greater than that of Japan. The biggest contradiction in Japan from that year came from trade friction with the United States. In the late 1980s, Japan accounted for 60%of the US trade deficit. At present, China accounts for only 35%. At that time, the United States and Japan were even worse, but in fact, due to the epidemic conflict with the Russian and Ukraine, the situation of Western geopolitical confrontation between China faced was even better than that of Japan. Judging from the situation in Japan, in fact, the core of the US -Japan conflict is the re -distribution of trade interests. In the end, the "Plaza Treaty" signed by Japan, the United States, Britain, Germany, and France in 1985 as the solution. The market is used to adjust the over -appreciation of other major currencies, so that American products have become more competitive again in the world.

To some extent, Japan's foreign trade has been suppressed, but the contradiction between the United States and Japan has been solved. On the other hand, today, the strategic competition and hostile pattern between China and the United States have already surpassed the field of trading, and more concentrated in a series of areas such as cutting -edge technology, aerospace, biomedicine, and military industry, and this strategic competition between China and the United States More and more relationships have spread between China, China, Japan, and China. Therefore, no matter from the depth and breadth, Japan has never faced it, and it is naturally difficult for this time cycle to be obtained through simple historical comparison. In other words, China's demand for smooth economic circulation is greater than Japan.

From the inside, the Chinese population has reached its peak in 2021. From 2022, the population declined. In 2023, it was surpassed by India to the second largest country in the world. Although the decline in the population itself does not directly lead to the rapid decline in economic activities, the aging of the population will indeed make investors more cautious, because the growth space of the future market is more limited. Japan's population actually reached its peak in 2009, which was 19 years after the decline in Japan's economy. However, China's situation is not the same. China has reached its peak at the same time. This superposition effect may be amplified, thus producing more violent social emotions. Data from the comparison of this population cycle and the economic cycle has less attention, but it is indeed very important for judging the intensity of challenges.

European Central Bank(ECB)The interest rate has raised 25 basis points to 3.5%, and a signal indicates that it will raise interest rates again in July, warning that inflation is far from being defeated.

On Thursday, it decided to adjust its benchmark deposit interest rate to the highest level of 22 years, and the European Central Bank was trying to deal with a dilemma: on the one hand, there was an obvious round of wages in the euro area Fall in stagnation.

European Central Bank President Christina Lagader(Christine Lagarde)After the interest rate formulation meeting was over, it was said that the interest rate maker "still has a way to go". Unless the economic data has "substantial changes", they are likely to be tightened again at the next policy meeting held on July 27th again. Borrowing conditions.

The European Central Bank raised the inflation forecast in the next three years, and at the same time slightly lowered the growth forecast, and warned that it would be expected to "keep at a high level for too long" and will not return to its 2% in the next two years. The goal.

After the announcement of interest rate hikes, the yield of the two -year German government bonds increased by 0.13 percentage points to 3.18%. The exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar rose by 0.1%to 1 euro against $ 1.08.

The latest interest rate hike operation of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve(Federal Reserve)The decision to suspend interest rate hikes the previous day forms contrast.

The European Central Bank started to raise interest rates a few months later than the Federal Reserve, and the inflation rate (6.1%) of the euro zone is now higher than the United States.

The inflation rate in the euro zone has declined from 10.6%of October last year. However, this mainly reflects the reduction of energy costs. The European Central Bank is worried that continuous high inflation may lead to rising wages and cost spirals, making price pressure remote.

According to data released by the European Central Bank last week, the per capita salary of employees in the euro zone in the first quarter increased by 5.2%year -on -year, an increase of 4.8%in the fourth quarter.

The European Central Bank raised its prediction of the core inflation this year to 5.1%, 3%next year, and 2.3%in 2025 -partly because the labor market is strong.

"This is an eagle interest rate hike,"(Pantheon Macroeconomics)Economist Claus Vestson(Clausvistesen)express. He added that the latest prediction of the European Central Bank highlights "obvious stagnation."

The Jorge Asu Manson, a member of the European Central Bank Executive Committee and is now in charge of the German Insurance Association(Jörgasmussen)He said that he expects that interest rate makers will maintain a tightening model for a period of time. "If the market has to correct its interest rate expectations, especially for the first time the interest rate cuts, I will not be surprised."

After the European Central Bank took the interest rate hike, the stock market that had fallen on that day remained in the negative number range. The French CAC 40 index and the German DAX index fell 1%and 0.8%respectively.

Although the unemployment rate is low, the euro zone economy is still weak, and it has shrunk slightly in the past two quarters. Although what people first worried about Russia after the full invasion of Ukraine in Russia, it has proven to be more tough.

The European Central Bank has slightly reduced growth expectations. It is now expected that the region's economy will increase by 0.9%this year, 1.5%in 2024, and 1.6%in 2025.

The European Central Bank has confirmed that from July, it will stop investing in the income of its asset purchase plan -this is expected to help it reduce its monthly assets and liabilities of 25 billion euros.

Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

As he said in the podcast, the breakthrough of new media creation originated from "the description of contradictions of virtual and reality." Chinese artist Qiu Anxiong often refuses to be regarded as a "painter" because the artist should not be asked to represent anything except their art. However, Qiu Anxiong's work as an artist really makes people seriously think of adversity and toughness. Obstacles and obstacles, they can also be inspired. Watch the American drama "Sense8 of the 8 -member group" and enjoy the eight strangers who suddenly become super -sensitive all over the world in the drama. The audience who watched the unimaginable pictures of the unimaginable picture will find that they are psychologically and emotionally There are few connections generated in many science fiction film and television works. However, art is an alien activity. In some cases, oppression will only kill art expression; in other cases, it can be used as its forced space. Generally, these two things will happen at the same time, or different people will be different.

For an artist like Qiu Anxiong, he has always wanted to write like a person. His WeChat public account will talk about all kinds of alienated art topics every time, which is very different from the style of the current work practice. Because in the early days of his career, he always felt that the performance of art should not be too pedantic, and it should be diversified. When he started teaching art classes at the School of Design of East China Normal University, he decided to teach art as an art, rather than a professor as a coded political comics or social history in pictures. He let go of his professional knowledge, and he let go of his suspicion hidden behind him when he was young. Between him and students, between him and art, between him and him alone, he did not leave any sparse curtain or safe nets. He started to speak and started writing a lot of articles. He didn't know what else could say, as if a person was walking.

It may be difficult to recall now. When the current seminar is drowsy for the sources of many arts, his new media works look like fantasy and bold. It seems to be a spontaneous whirlwind, an artist Become nature rather than serving it just for it. When he started to create a series of works in the "Johor Bahru" in 2007, he directly chose to cut into the current social reality and various international politics issues. In the various conflicts of interest brought by politics, he chose to present the style of traditional ink in the form of a new media such as animation in the form of computer language.

He emphasized that the artist put today's world pattern into an ancient perspective, and the darkness shrouded in those unmanned streets was cited by the existential power, just like the demon in the robotic movie. But the artist's organizational thoughts are surprisingly simple: modern painting is no longer explanatory, it should be decorative. Once the painted old bank of painting depicts the financial giant and shows off the proud house, and the real imagination war is handed over to photography and movies. The rest is the most traditional painter.

Therefore, Qiu Anxiong saw that reality is an unparalleled great poet, and the ancient Chinese "Shan Hai Jing" still occupies the center of the circus, bringing people a variety of colorful imaginations. However, if Qiu Anxiong's insight is still the best manifestation of the decorative residues of painting, then his evil genius is to use mandatory future imagination to strengthen this insight, and then observe them through the arguments of totalitarianism. The scheme borrowed from the Marxist dialectics law is that history does not allow abstract painting to have other options. The more flat and more open abstraction, the better. Qiu Anxiong also insisted that his own eyes were the only arbiters of dialectics, so he could maintain the existence of this imagination.

Although everyone is waiting for the next breakthrough of painting, no one will take the money to Qiu Anxiong to realize it. He inspires the universal bend, rooted in jealousy, and then stops it. But at the art exhibition called "Breathing of the Soul" this time, this breakthrough occurred, as we saw in the second phase of the Yun'an Hotel, out of a kind of impatience, laziness, and laziness, and The combination of innovation, he decided to use animals to dilute his thoughts, and then let them immerse them into a large and empty canvas. By using an elephant or a leap -leaping monkey, a huge maritime oil drilling platform in the distance, or a launch of rockets, instead of a rigid group of portraits, he has improved the components of chaos in life, those flowing, overflowing, deteriorating, vivid, vivid, vivid, vivid The human body is intertwined with Taihu stone.

However, he still returned to the landscape related to the concept of traditional Chinese comic comics. Those soldiers who once appeared in our childhood, pine trees, and even guns stood on the horse. His huge picture was completed. In the three -year epidemic that is unforgettable for each of us. A new style, a new human paradox of the existence of human beings in the information society through the giant and empty cave of the city. With the support of Yun'an and Cyanson's art, it has become the use of traditional ink language in the contemporary context.

The serial painting picture book of "Sun Wukong Three -Bone Bone Essence" always has a style overlooking the thousand worlds on the clouds. This may be the height it should be, liquidity, waves rolling and pagoda needle are its local language. It was blinded by the sprayed rocket, and some high -tech was used because it didn't require too much theoretical foundation. Picasso once said that art should not be created in accordance with the laws of beauty, but must follow the artist's own intuition and imagination. Art is not a beautiful cannon, but a thing that instincts and brains can surpass and imagine. Andre Bulles once commented on Picasso: "And our childhood is full of various toys. These toys make us feel lost and misfortune today, and one day we will find that our entire life itself is from toys itself. The composition is just like our childhood toy, and Picasso gave me this. Maybe one day, we will see our toys in our lives again, just like our childhood toys. "After watching" Johor Bahru "3", we will think of the empty streets during the epidemic, people are banned in the room, and various large transportation tools are driving slowly on the empty streets. But the creation of this work happened in 2010. It is as if we did not understand that Luo Dayou sang in the song "The Master of the Future" created by Luo Dayou in 1983, "We don't want to be played by a scientific game, polluted sky, we should not be invented by you, computer children." Forty years have passed, and suddenly found that there are computer children around. It's time to let you know that cunning is not art. Even if the disorderly thinking in the fading memory is so weak when trying to create art, but it is still so smart in art.In the suburbs, the peaceful and serene raising clouds, under the combination of a large lush green plant and tens of thousands of big trees and dozens of buildings that moved to the ancient houses of the Ming and Qing dynasties, even the clouds over the hotel became slow. Among the other unprecedented villas that are not far from the exhibition, successful artists inadvertently consume huge sums of money to build the landscape in the courtyard. Friends sitting in the shuttle bus are rushing to the location of another art exhibition.

Qiu Anxiong's work is not a world of action, but a world of reaction. His absorption and liquidity, with the hints of zoo and urban viaducts, rather than the usual skyline of the Bund high -rise building and the traffic lights on the street corner. Essence A strong investment led him to capture through time and space, virtual and reality. The quietness and lyrical slenderness and elegance of the extraction of separation have began to have the same enthusiasm for social politics. The chattering monsters have the same feeling, Ao Cou came together with Youfu, not like more collisions. Looking at a highly developed society with an unknown vision, if it simply enlarge the outline of the monster, it looks as weird as the painting of mysterious religion. In this sense, Qiu Anxiong's work deliberately relaxes and the edges are soft, which eliminates more obvious indicators and can show his skills. However, this principle of replacement is the truth of all modernist art. The change in practice comes from the possibility of seeing some central things on the edge of the activity, just like the paint splattered on the canvas.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T22-58-07-00-00/000184530_piclink.jpg)Golden Zhichacapoicia, 2023,200x240cm

If he is a ambitious family condemned, he may benefit from this similarity. But he did not, partly because of his loyalty to serious things. Of course, some of his best paintings are his most interesting. There is a warm and bright effect, which seems to be his own. The attractive apes in the branches, all kinds of strange Taihu stones, the elephants hanging by the crane are facing the sky, without any deep things, everything is full of weird. They have the traditional "Mountains and Seas Classic". An irrefutable, excessive impact of the excessive picture is for its most basic reasons.

He tried to create the characters of "Johor Bahru" and the world of people who lived. He relied on urban adjectives and clichés: "Build a tradition of observing the world -not a western -style scientific system, but a perception system. It can be said that he is unreasonable. " Lu Xun said that "Shan Hai Jing" is "the book of the five views and the scholars". Seeing his evaluation, I thought of the various names of Sichuan, who was full of Taoism in Sichuan, and the reckless artist in front of him, and even the rock singer Wang Lei, who had no news in his mind for a long time.

Qiu Anxiong's sensitivity enables him to give ordinary experience. It is meaningless, incomplete, and obvious, and the huge and solemnity of art works, as if this is not the achievements of every landscape painting and static paintings since the birth of painting. In all the restrictions that make art important, this kind of huge, small, and emotional objects as huge, the same as the lifebuilding circle are the most familiar. In the classic model of the oppressed person's acceptance of the oppressive values, social radicals sometimes still think that only disruptive art is serious, and the kind of tension and tedious art is serious, and things that look like monsters are impossible. Matisse calmly insisted that his art was similar to providing comfortable armchairs for tired merchants, which is still the most taboo declaration of all artists. However, Qiu Anxiong's unscrupulous strange and absurd landscape, as a male territory, is eternal in Chinese tradition.

Drag the suitcase, turn around the high -speed rail station, and use various office software to coordinate the journey plan, afraid to waste any time period. This is a journey of special forces popular on the Internet today. There are localities, or chasing food or chasing monuments. In Shanghai, the best thing to make young people is the journey of watching the exhibition. Whether it is a pure art exhibition or a commercial consumer exhibition, the holiday contribution to the exhibition is a great driving force for them. All this itself is like a behavior art, and the city of Shanghai has become the largest exhibition hall.

Ten years ago, the cold spring was cold, and it was so cold, but in this way, the Shanghai Exhibition Center was still crowded with the audience. The weekend peak will be ranked for two hours. This is the first year of designing the Shanghai Exhibition to land in China. Chinese audiences contributed 6W flow, just to see the "original flavor" of the "original flavor" in the propaganda. After the exhibition, the Monet Painting Exhibition in the K11 Shopping Mall began, 100 yuan a ticket, a three -hour waiting period, to see the dream "water lilies".

Some people say that 2014 is the first year of the Shanghai Business Fair. From this time, to Shanghai to watch the exhibition, many people have joined the itinerary. There are professionals in the audience, and more artists. To this day, the special forces -style watching journey during the holiday has become another hot topic in social media. Learn the exhibition information from the circle of friends or the public account, see friends from all walks of life to get the circle, to trigger action, and then experience it on the spot. Only then did the end. At this time, the attractiveness of the itinerary itself has greatly exceeded the exhibits itself.

There are a lot of exhibitions, but the exhibition worth dragging the luggage car Malandon needs to be selected well. The quality and quantity of exhibits are aspects, and on the other hand, its positioning and dedicated attributes are also very important. The needs of the audience to watch the exhibition are different. What kind of exhibition is worth spending how much silver and physical strength, they have their own measurement standards, but the same is that today's popular exhibitions must have strong social attributes. Strong representative, obvious punch -in symbols, easy to produce, worth sharing.

Naturally, famous masters like Monet and Picasso naturally attract many audiences, and the charm of the real traces is higher than that of any text description. Some time ago, the popularity of "from Botici to Van Gogh: British National Art Museum Treasure Exhibition" in the Shanghai Museum, starting from January and ending in early May. In this way, the venue is full every day, and the painting is crowded before the painting. If you want to look at the stroke, you have to work hard from the gap. Before I went, I did psychological expectations. I definitely couldn't see it, and the exhibition experience was not good, but I still couldn't resist Potacheli, Raphael, Titida, the calling power of these masters. Just like going to watch the live concert of the stars, although most people can't see the performances on the stage, they can only watch it through the big screen on the scene, but they can feel the atmosphere of the scene in person. Seeing the broadcast is still different, the sense of atmosphere is a great charm of art.

If a famous exhibition is normal, there are also its attractive exhibitions in some professional fields. In 2021, Shanghai's Fuxing Art Center exhibited Ando Zhongxiong's work retrospective. The exhibition is based on the title of "Challenge", sorting out his many years of architectural ideas, models, manuscripts, and equal proportion of re -engraving space. This exhibition is the fourth stop of Ando Zhongxiong's global tour. As the winner of the Pritzker Award, Ando Zhongxiong's reputation is unquestionable in the industry, and there are many works in China. Compared with architecture, painting and music, its influence is more niche after all, but I did not expect that such a professional exhibition actually had a good results.

The exhibition continued from March to June 6 of that year. On the day of Children's Day on June 1, many parents took their children to visit. For children, going to Disney for a half -day vacation may be their greatest wish. For parents, it is more important to allow children to accept artistic influence.

Many of the audiences outside the door were dragging their suitcases and college students who came directly from the train station. They lined up while checking the itinerary of these days to see how to arrange more reasonable. The exhibition hall has been fully prepared for this situation, providing storage services, which will not affect the exhibition.

Those architectural students saw the master's work, and they were full of light, and they couldn't wait to extend their heads into the model without letting go of any node. After reminding the security guard, he apologized and looked at the details as much as possible. For them, this was more harvested than listening to the lecture in the classroom.

From a single exhibition to a full name linkage, the art season in Shanghai has more and more large -scale effects. Those who have been to the Milan Design Week are touched. In addition to the main exhibition hall during the exhibition period, many sub -exhibition halls are spread all over the city. Design works can be seen everywhere in the streets. Essence

Multiple -game exhibitions have provided better choices for tourists who watched the exhibition. After all, it is not easy to go out of the city at one time, especially for three years, and the shelf life of nucleic acids is limited. It must be calculated that the time will be arranged, otherwise it is likely to be rejected, or they cannot return home. Although it sounds romantic for the art of art, no one wants to experience it in person than this black humor, it feels too painful!

November each year is the day of the West Coast Art and Design Expo, and last year is the ninth. During that time, when the official media were publicized, there were 19 venues on the Avenue of the Art Museum on the West Coast, and 28 exhibitions were opened at the same time. In addition to design exhibitions, there is a Pomi Du Center Collection Exhibition at the West Coast Art Museum at the intersection; Yu Deyao Art Museum in Yu Deyao Art Museum, who has taken a while, has continued. At the same time, some luxury commercial exhibitions are interspersed. Such dense exhibitions are a challenge for selecting and schedules. When watching the exhibition, the audience is tired and excited. Any exhibition is worth sending a circle of friends, from the accumulation of likes, to self -awareness, and the completion of the artists, often rely on this field to complete the exhibition. Very worldly, but it is indeed effective.

In addition to art, good art space also has social attributes and attractiveness. Many of the art museums in Shanghai are masterpieces. The previously mentioned Fuxing Art Center is the work of British ghost designer Thomasheatherwick. The facade has a unique artistic liquidity, known as the "dancing building". Therefore, many viewers will take pictures when they are queuing. During the exhibition, the square area also displayed Ando's device "Green Apple", creating an artistic atmosphere from the whole.

The Pudong Art Museum, which was completed in 2021, was designed by the famous French architect, Jean Nudi Nuvel's knife. This is a punching point in the "White Box" located in the Huangpu River. The building complex in Puxi has different scenery day and night. Many tourists have been squatting for a long time in order to shoot different scenery. In the first time, the treasures of the town hall of the Tate Art Museum were exhibited "Offei", the same period was Cai Guoqiang, Miro, and the "Xu Bing's language" later. Each exhibition was heavy. Coupled with the July summer vacation period, it is full every day, and the ticket grabbing has become a technical work. At the end of last year, the Star Art Museum, hosted by Jean Nuville, has also been completed, adding a new goal to tourists who check in.This exhibition adopts an appointment system and is open to the audience for free. Many audiences go to the architecture itself. This old house is very mysterious and beautiful after repairing it. It is very attractive in itself. By the way, it is a good arrangement for the weekend.

In addition to the Rongzhai, there are also many gallery exhibition halls hidden in the Bund building group. Last year, the Jiushi Art Museum held in the Morandi exhibition was on the 18th of the Bund. Dongyi Art Museum is on Bund No. 1. The building, known as the Asian building, was built in 1916. It has a story with a brick and a tile.

Looking at the architecture and seeing history, it should be worthwhile to clean up the luggage. High -quality exhibits and high -quality exhibition halls also need to correspond to high -quality audiences. Whether it is a tribute or a special forces, as long as there is a gain, it is an experience. Only the homework you need to do before departure, in addition to cleaning up his head, you also need to understand the background knowledge of the exhibition. After all, whether it is Potcheli or Miro, it is a spiritual communication that matches the artwork, not just a photo of the net red in the back. This behavior art is also divided into high and low.(This article only represents the author's personal point of view, edit mailbox: zhen.zhu@ftchinese.com)

"After my death, to do an exhibition, it is called‘ I ’m going to a new journey’. ”

This is the imagination of the last exhibition before the death of Mr. Yu Deyao, the founder of Yu Deyao Museum of Art and Yu Deyao Art Museum.

In mid -May, the first exhibition of the "Touring Tour -the Yu Deyao Foundation Collection Exhibition" was unveiled as the first exhibition of the new museum of Yu Deyao Art Museum. The new curator of Yu Deyao Art Museum and Mr. Yu Deyao, Justine Alexandriatay, said: "This exhibition is designed in the direction of 'home'. The meaning of the new home. Home can be a fixed geographical location, where the loved ones are, or a place where the "travel". "

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T22-58-46-00-00/000184538_piclink.jpg)Yu Deyao Art Museum Director Justine Alexandria Tek)

At this moment, not only did Mr. Yu Deyao embark on a new journey, the Yu Deyao Art Museum also embarked on a new journey. Not only did he usher in the new curator, but he also moved to the new home -the dragon world upgraded by the ancient town of Qinglong in Shanghai.

** "My goal is different from Mr. Yu's goals" **

From the nearly 1,500 contemporary art collection of Yu Deyao Foundation, "Youyou" selected more than 40 works related to "home" created by more than 40 well -known Chinese and foreign artists. The image of different levels of "home".

The location of the new hall of Yu Deyao was once the ancient town of Jiangnan. After renovation, the original natural ecology was retained. It was surrounded by the Jiangnan river, corn, ponds, bamboo forests, and grassland, which was very different from the industrial customs of the aircraft where the old museum was located.

The artist Xu Bing's work "stone path" is connected to a curved path by 76 stones. On each stone, he carved an original "Tianshu" -the block word composed of English letters and led the audience to the exhibition hall from the courtyard to the exhibition hall. Essence Nara Michi's "Puppy" sculpture has greeted you. Ouyang Chun's "Spirit and Meat -Triple Playing" makes you occasionally doubt the significance of the survival in this city. The "topic" of Emeglin and Drasert -a pair of copper -casting white pillows, let you make you Recalling private intimacy.

Earlier, Yu Deyao Art Museum often held a large -scale sensational exhibition. During this period, "Nara Misimi" also held a heavy exhibition.

The "Tour" exhibition in front of me is peaceful and gentle, tricky, and talks in the ear like a close friend. It is accompanied by warmth as a family, but the sense of politeness is very different from the style of the exhibition held before the Yu Deyao Museum of Fine Arts Museum. Essence

Yu Zhirou said: "My goal is different from Mr. Yu's goals. Mr. Yu hopes that the eyes of the world will focus on Yu Deyao Art Museum. My goal is to survive in one place for a long time. Everyone around the museum knows us and knows all the projects and exhibitions we have done. Even if it is not a sensational exhibition, it can be a good exhibition. Of course, if there is suitable financial support, we still hope that there will be a sensational exhibition. , But this is not our most important factor. "

** Do not hide it, integrate into the community **

"From the opening of the museum in 2014, to the 8th year, we are also thinking about what kind of museum to be and what is the goal?" Yu Zhirou said, "We still want to continue to take root in Shanghai. There is an artistic atmosphere that attracts the attention of the world. We hope to integrate art into life and into community life. "

Strengthening public education and actively integrating into the community is the function of the art museum emphasized by Yu Zhirou. In the first place, the art museum can launch activities related to artists, works, and creative knowledge according to the theme of the exhibition; second, you can use popular courses, such as watercolor courses to attract children to participate; in addition, you can combine the place where Qingpu District is located. Culture, launching workshops projects, such as bamboo weaving, kite, etc., invite "non -heritage" teachers to teach.

"Do not hide it", sharing the collection with the public is the original intention of Mr. Yu Deyao's founding of the art museum. Yu Zhirou hopes to inherit his father's wish. Originally, they wanted to have a second museum, set up permanent exhibitions, and long -term display of collections. Today, not far from Yu Deyao Art Museum, there is also an independent project space "Xuezhuxuan", showing the works of emerging artists, which are open to the public for free.

Mr. Yu Deyao has many collections. It is currently owned by the family foundation and requires a large warehouse to store it. The "Tree of Life" created by the Star Collection of the Yu Deyao Art Museum was created by the artist Morgio Carterland, because it was nearly 10 meters high, it was difficult to place it in the new museum, and it was currently in the warehouse. Yu Zhirou said, "At present, we are an open attitude."

In addition, Yu Deyao Art Museum and the largest art museum in the West Coast of the United States Los Angeles County Art Museum(LACMA)And the Qatar National Museum has exchanges and cooperation. The collections of the three museums tour each other and are planning exhibitions that are planning to co -curate for three -party institutions. Yu Zhirou said: "The nature of the three institutions is very different from that of the local culture. The biggest challenge and excitement is to find a common direction that all three parties are interested in."

** "My pressure is bigger than my father" **

As the second generation of the museum, is it stressful?

Yu Zhirou said, "It's big." Where is it? funds.

"My main focus is on looking for good projects and funding support." Yu Zhirou said, "In fact, there are many art resources, and the contemporary art market in China is very popular all over the world. Do the exhibition. The final question is the funding problem. "

The heavy exhibition requires funding support, which is not supported by ticket income. Like all the art gallers, one of Yu Zhirou's main energy turned to find capital resources. "I'm not like my father, I can make so many funds and resources." She said, "My pressure is larger than my father."

I couldn't help asking: "Did Mr. Yu taught how to find resources before?"

Yu Zhirou said: "He threw you into the sea and let you learn to swim. He asked you to think on himself instead of obeying his decision."Yu Zhirou recalled that in the matter of receiving Yu Deyao Art Museum, Yu Deyao only asked, "Do you like the art museum?" Yu Zhirou said, "I like it." He said, "Okay."

When answering "I like", Yu Zhirou was ready to face inheritance and responsibility. Although it is difficult, Yu Zhirou said, "I still decide to continue. And, I already like contemporary art."

18 years ago, the first time I arrived in Oslo. It is winter. In the long night, the broken wine bottle is full of the ground, and the day is full of haze. The 19th century Norwegian drama writer Iboson wrote: This freedom kingdom is full of unwilling people. The painter Monke said on a certain occasion: "It's really a place where people live here."

Monks, who used to be a poor artist, do not know if he often went to the GrandCafe in the Grand Hotel to seek appetite and spiritual shelter. When Monks was young, a apartment was rented on the roof opposite the parliament, which was close to the big hotel cafe, but he didn't have a few money in his pocket. Get your own painting in the store for exchange. At that time, the owner of the hotel opened to the artist, allowing the artists who were constrained to create "food stamps". It is said that the paintings that Monks took in include "Madonna", which gave him a rich steak meal, plus beer. However, the waiter who got this painting at that time sold it before the work was famous. I can imagine the sigh when this person regrets.

Later, I went to Oslo three times, most of them were winter. Recently, I set foot again, and I was surprised to find that the northern cities in the early summer were shining throughout the week. In addition, the summer day is getting longer, and the midnight sky is still dark, and the dawn of the midnight is broken. After entering the big hotel that opened the door to the present day in 1874, after entering the wall with a porch with a photo of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, I found that the suite named "Alfred Nobel" was "Alfred Nobel" every year. Nobel Peace Prize winner's designated room. Every year, the Nobel Prize winner will go to one of the oval balconies in the room and accept the cheers of the people downstairs. After I opened the balcony door, I found that the Norwegian Parliament was obliquely opposite, and I bowed my head to Karl Johnst Avenue.

Photography: Zhang Lu Shi

The Norwegian royal family and the big hotel have a long time. In 1894, the "Rococo Hall" was opened upstairs in the big hotel. When it opened, Yibusheng was also present. Soon, a "Ballsociety" sponsored by the Norwegian queen was also opened. exhibition. A narrow "Queen's Hall" was hidden next to it. To this day, the King of Norwegian and the queen will come here for dinner at least two times a year. Opposite the "Lococo Hall" was the first banquet hall opened in Norway in 1886. For the first time, people were able to listen to the symphony orchestra while dining. The banquet of the Nobel Peace Prize every year is also held here. In 1912, the first Antarctic expeditions led by Norwegian explorer Rogersonson returned, and the dust -washing banquet was also held in a big hotel.

The history of the big hotel is a microcosm of Oslo's modern history. In 1850, Oslo was not called "Oslo", but Kristiania (Kristiania). At that time, the city's population was less than 10,000, but the size of the city was expanding. Each railway began to build, and gradually brought tourists on both sides of the east and west. The ice -breaking ship has also been introduced, and people can also enter the city through the fjord in winter. At that time, a snacker Juliusfritzner decided to open a "big hotel" to choose the Call Johns Avenue. At that time, it was not the city center, and the parliamentary buildings next to it were newly built. The emergence of the big hotel slowly attracted politicians and journalists who went in and out of the parliament, followed by the national theater actors who walked for three or four minutes, and then there were artists who went to the cafe to find inspiration, as well as the newspapers who wrote columns to the newspapers. Reporters, there is a famous column name simply called "big hotel anecdotes".

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-03-46-00-00/000184242_piclink.jpg)Painting on the cafe wall in the Oslo Hotel: "Bohemia in Christiania". Photography: Zhang Lu Shi

In the cafe in the big restaurant, he witnessed a period of "Bohemia in Christiania". "Bohemia in Christiania" is a newspaper and magazine founded by Monks' predecessor Christiankrohg. Crogna teaches and creation is not far from the big hotel. The paintings of influence often make the Burcho class sitting like a needle felt. Cross's wife Odakrohg and their female companions are common in and out of large hotel cafes. They also brought their heads, making many young artists in the pockets sit on the corner desk of the cafe. Essence This group of people lived a free and creative life, but often drunk.

This time, I happened to meet and held the "NATO Foreign Minister's Informal Conference". In midnight, looking downstairs in the "Nobel Set Room", the truck full of flagpie drove to the side of the parliament to stop. Late night, the flag of NATO member states stood up one by one, and the sidewalks and lanes also surrounded the lanes and lanes. Iron fence. While taking breakfast in the cafe in the next morning, there were two black suites with guns with guns. Police were deployed inside and outside the big hotel. Pedestrians are okay to not let the hotels close to the hotel. The fence is built on the sidewalk between the parliament and the hotel. The flower pot moves to the sidewalk from the roadside to take on riot anti -terrorism props to prevent the vehicle from shovel. The flags of various countries will be withdrawn at night and hang up in the morning to prevent someone from burning the flag. A Oslo I have never seen before, which came into sight.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-03-46-00-00/000184243_piclink.jpg)Nobel Peace Award Barfang. Photography: Zhang Lu ShiWhen I walked into a big restaurant for the first time, I suddenly found that the purple girl who passed by was the Norwegian film actor Lifhuman I saw in the theater the night before, which is the Swedish wave director Bergman. The "Royal" actor also said "Muse". I was very excited when I was young. After returning to God, I turned and asked a staff member to "invite" Uman who had just got on the car. At that time, Uman was almost old, and his temperament was still quiet and noble.

The world was drizzling. I talked with Uman on the spot. She said that Bergman lived in Stockholm in the last few years, and she lived in New York. She only filmed Bergman's play in those years. The daughter of the two and the surname of Uman, the surname of Uman, have grown into a well -known female writer in Norway. Uman also often appeared "Nala" in "Doll's House". She told me that every time she played this role, she was still inspired: "We women have always been like Nala, but still the patriarchal supremacy in the privilege. In most society, on the way to pursue the truth, dance in their own ways. "

Oslo is not big. This time, I also made a special trip to the New Monks Museum on the seaport. But if you want to find a more grass -roots artist site, in fact, there is one place for nine minutes from the big restaurant: there is a light red three -story apartment building on the Pilestredet Street, with the sign of the "Monke's former residence" on the door. When I first visited many years ago, the Monker masterpiece "Scream" with a black and white print style "Scream" on the side of the building was at least 6 meters high. The 19 -century apartment building, close to the Oslo "punk" and left -wing art workers, the non -governmentalist base, Blitz. The old staff of an Oslo government next to me shaking their heads helplessly: "Children want to vent their dissatisfaction and come here. When seeing a similar old house, when the new young people "occupied the house" in the 1970s and 1980s, they were gradually transformed into a comprehensive space for graffiti, creativity and party. In recent years Vegetarian restaurant. This time, I found that the wall where I couldn't see the "Scream" was now, and I realized that a new office building had been newly started next to Monke's former residence.

Urban development is inevitable that the new development zones of seaport cities such as Burger and Oslo are particularly conspicuous. Oslo is no exception. Akerbrygge, not far from the Nobel Peace Center (even the Nobel Peace Prize Museum), has been the area where the shipyard has been repaired three or forty years ago. In the 19th century, it was a harbor that was smuggled by robbers. In the past ten years, it has gradually developed into a new area of Harbor Catering and Housing, and the ASTRUPFEARNLEY MUSEET set up by the shipping family, Fieneri, has also moved to a newly designed art museum building here ten years ago. The art museum is next to a hotel named after "Thethief". Such a naming is to leave an annotation for a regional history more than a century ago. This district is not as limited to the height of the building as the Oslo Old Town, overlooking the seaport and the canal from the high balcony, just like being in different cities.

This time I went to Oslo, and I met a sunny day for a week, and the sunshine time continued until 10:30 in the evening. Many years ago, the long night stayed in the impression that it was difficult to recognize as the wood on the outer wall of the Fienery Art Museum.

Since the ancient emperor and the poet have something in common, the only point may be their obsession with immortality. The name of the Emperor's name means that he must leave the name of the name, and build the palace in order to be with the sun and the moon; Caesar became the first mortal to have a temple after his death. Ovid's immortal poem "Transformation" last wrote: The people will recite me. If the poet's forecast/non -fiction, my prestige will live in all centuries (translated by Li Yongyi).

However, throughout the history of human beings, there seems to be only one person who really reaches the scale behind it to become the industry: Shakespeare. In the past three hundred years, he has supported generations in the performance, publishing, tourism and academic industries. There are still 400 books related to "Hamlet" every year; the London drama market Shakespeare drama still occupies one -tenth of the share. The formation of this phenomenal cultural idol itself has become a manifestation. However, Shakespeare's fame research is only one of the 26 categories in the field of Shaxue.

Above this topic, Mr. Xin Yamin's latest book "Birth of Shakespeare: Early Shakespeare Cultural History" added another book. If you start to read this book from the last few references of this book, we will find an interesting fact: the author quotes 107 types of English works, of which a large number of direct research is related to Shakespeare idolization research; and 33 Chinese Chinese in the reference In the book, there are only 10 books with Shakespeare.

This shows that Shakespeare's research and writing as a cultural symbol have prospered in the past 60 years. "Sha's Famous Studies" began in the 1950s and across many disciplines, including performance history, editing and classification history, reviewing systems, geopolitics, religion, and political ideology. It is a veritable history of Shakespeare and English culture. For example, its book title, this book focuses only on the history of early Shakespeare's cultural history. From the period in the late 17th century, the restoration period of England to the end of the 18th century, because the idolization has been completed in these 100 years, making it an important part of the British ethnic community and the modernization of English culture. Essence The 19th century is the period of cultural idol industrialization, especially in the early 20th century.

What kind of power has shaped idol Shakespeare, so that this dead white European man is four hundred years old? This is also the problem raised by the author. This book is not trying to give a complete analysis and answer. Various forces and factors are promoters, without any single forces and people to complete this process. One of my readings of this book is exactly the opposite of the so -called constructivism. In the past 200 years, the classic Shakespeare is actually a very democratic process. Although it is inseparable from some promoters, some love and worship are more loved by drama and poetry, but there is no systemic and top -down construction. After the 19th century, Shakespeare's idolization and the expansion of the British Empire synchronized to the world. However, he surpassed the history of the empire. When the Empire is backward, this world -class idol is still like the sky. Just as he wrote in 55 poems in the Fourteenth Elements: There is no tombstone of the cloud stone or the princes of the king.

First of all, it is fascinating that Shakespeare itself seems to be indifferent to fame. British literary critic and prose writer William Hazrite at the end of the 18th century(William Hazlitt)It is believed that the works of poets in the Western forms such as Dan Ding, Joe, and Milton are full of desire for the fame and Fangbaixin. 20 World English Poet W.H. Oden(W.H.Auden)It is keenly pointed out that at the beginning of the creation of these great poets, they were determined to write the classic masterpieces of the handed down, and Shakespeare seemed to be ignorant about drama and poetry. " Take yourself seriously. "

For play writers and actors Shakespeare, drama is one -time, a short -lived existence on the stage, and the stage and actors are the only medium. Drama writing is only for the theater box office, not publishing, and it will not be regarded as a reading text that can be circulated. This drama writer who has not been educated from central England and has not been educated by college has created a huge amount of wealth through genius creation, diligent management, and staying away from right and wrong. He is more concerned about the current state of survival, with a large number of real estate and land, not the fame behind him. Even his epitaph has nothing to do with the later generations, but warned that later people should not move his bones. He just wanted to lie quietly and waiting for the trial day.

Because of the existence of English hegemony in the past century, it is easy for people to think that Shakespeare as a cultural idol and symbol is the result of the system. In fact, the literary taste and aesthetic standards of Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries were mainly affected by France. At that time, the word Renaissance hinted for British writers to import imports from France. In the 18th century, French philosophy and poet Voltaire evaluated Shakespeare's "no noble interests, nor did they understand the laws of drama art." The principles of neoclassical drama established by the French and the extensive French cultural influence has a profound impact in the UK due to long -term French Charles II, who has long exile in France.

The British had to get rid of the influence of France in the 18th century. Thomas Leimo(ThomasRymer)He is the royal historian of William III, a firm and stubborn European classicist. He called "our previous era poetry is as vulgar as our architecture. "Poetics". The British used the time of the two generations to refute and clear the influence of Lymmer. Therefore, the British's cognition and recognition of Shakespeare is also the process of getting rid of the cognition of France and neoclassicism and establishing national cultural confidence.

This journey is precisely the status of Shakespeare to obtain classic writers and evolve into the process of British and English cultural symbols. This is a complicated process, which involves Shaoxue research and all aspects of the British social culture, ideology, geopolitics, etc. at that time. These aspects and processes have shaped Shakespeare as a cultural symbol. By the mid -18th century, the British felt that he could be compared with Western ancestor Homer, all of which were natural poets, and then became a national poet and against the cultural invasion of French classicism.The author puts the starting point of this process during the performance of the 17th century. The performances of this period were actually adapted from the Sayama drama. Inspired the awakening of the British people's national literature; with the development of copyright and the development of the reading market, text survey and publishing became the most important driving force for the popularization of Shakespeare; after 1730, the original Sayama drama returned to the stage again, and the superstar actor was on the stage on the stage. Promote its idolization up and down; in the 18th century, British literary criticism and France, especially the argument with Voltaire, promoted Shakespeare to become national poets and cultural idols; with the development of publishing and forgery of manuscripts and journalism, a Shakespeare cultural industry has been Gradually scale; but first of all, the Germans discovered and worshiped Shakespeare, in the 18th century German translator August Schlegel(August Wilhelm Schlegel)Called its nation -based compatriots who were born in a foreign country, which greatly stimulated the national self -esteem of the British, and accelerated to push it to the altar and push it to the world.

This book discusses the structure with clear structure, and the text is smooth, which makes people read pleasure, but there are still several questions about it. The author limited the topic research in the 17th and 18th centuries. As shown in the title of his book, this early starting point was set as a restoration period. During this period of drama performances, Shakespeare was not mainstream, and most of the dramas were adapted, and the actual effect played a role in preserving the drama. I think this early should be pushed forward for 70 years, specifically 1598. Shakespeare has become a cultural symbol in the 18th century to a greater extent to a greater extent, which is attributed to the continuous survey and publishing of their works, not performances.

The earliest books signed Shakespeare were two chiefs of narrative poems published in 1592 and 1593(Venus and Adonis)And "Rock Lith's Benesship"(TheRape of Lucrece)And won a wide reputation for him, it has been printed more than 10 times. However, in the European literature level at that time, only tragedy and poetry had a lofty status, and drama works were regarded as low -level interests that were not ascended to the Church of Daya. In the late 16th century, shortly after the development of England's publishing market, drama publishing only accounted for very little share. Only when the publisher saw the box office of a drama and determined that the publishing was favorable, it would be registered and published in the Book Industry Association, and the identity of the famous author was not famous at the time, because there was no concept of copyright at that time, and the script ownership was in the playwright writer. After submitting the manuscript, it belongs to the troupe.

According to Lucas Our(Lucas's)In his research on its monograph Shakespeare as liverary drawist, the name of Shakespeare began to appear on the four -opening drama book in 1598. It is likely that the book vendors found that the drama and the reader market recognized him very much, so his name became a book. Sales protection. Since then, his drama publications will be crowned with his name, and even publishers have stolen his name publishing books. Shakespeare to become Shakespeare's cultural symbol and the most important milestone in the industry was the first publishing of the book in 1623.

This book did not begin to discuss the issue of Shakespeare's drama publishing until the third chapter of "Text Surveying and Classification -Become an Academic Research Object". It also pointed out that publishers, cultural merchants and artists in the 18th century are the most important force for Shakespeare's fame to push into the altar, but these two chapters were originally two aspects of classification and publishing, and they were the most important factor in Shakespeare to the altar to the altar. Essence

Before the appearance of video technology, the drama existed only on the stage. Between the movements and the lines of the lines, it was unable to save, it could not spread, and it could not form a popular influence.

As mentioned in most of this book, Shakespeare's classicization occurs in the field of comments and publishing, so classic classics depend on text reviews, courses and publishing. Davis Katt Caston(David Scott Kastan)In "Shakespeare and Book"(Shakespeare and The Book)It was written that although it can be said that Shakespeare's "life" in the book is not as important as he is in the theater, he must admit that he has been preserved in the printed matter. Mr. Xin Yamin's book did not despise the key role of the book publishing on the history of Shakespeare's cultural history, but this book seemed to be lost in the performance of the Shakespeare's classic in the restoration period. In contrast, the author spends a lot of pen and ink to introduce the criticism of Leimer and others and the performance of the adaptation version. Compared with the publishing and classification of the book, it seems that it is not so important.

For the preservation, dissemination and popularization of Shakespeare's drama, and the most important incident to push to the altar is the first pair of Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories & Tragedies. The first pair of opening may be the most important book in the English world, the immortal monument of Shakespeare, and the beginning of his "all generation". It is no exaggeration to describe the importance of this book anyway. The first pair collected 36 dramas, of which 18 were not published in the form of rough printed. Imagine that without the first pair of books, classic articles such as "Macbeth", "Twelfth Night" and "Judge", and all Roman dramas and later legendary dramas may be likely to fire or in the theater or The decades of dust after the theater closed the theater and lost annihilation.

More importantly, the first pair of Kaiben enabled the complete works of Shakespeare's drama to be published. In the middle of 60 years, the second, third, and fourth pairs were published. Foundation. 1709 Lawyer and writer Nicholas Luo(Nicolasrowe)Entrusted, based on the third -to -book book, the Complete Works of Six Volumes and Eight Ben Shakespeare Drama was published. Luo's editor created a text paradigm and a scholarship. The text paradigm is the scene and scene of each drama that he compiled, and determined the basic version of all Shada dramas since then. This set of drama includes the Shakespeare's small biography written by Luo, which is the beginning of more than 70 Shakespeare biographies in the next three centuries. The biography of generations about drama writers is an indispensable part of the magical movement, although his life facts only need a dozen pages.

Luo also wrote in the preface: "((I) compares different versions, and I can give my real text.(GIVE THE TRUE Reading As Well as I CouldfromThend). Although Luo's version is based on many wrong third pairs of issues, although his version is far from perfect, he has opened the long history of Shakespeare's drama text editing and courses. In the past 100 years, Adeng(Arden)The version of "The Complete Works of Shakespeare" has been published for three generations, and the Judge version of the Sayama drama, which began at the end of the 19th century, has not yet been published.

Malong opened the Shakespeare version of the first study, and since then of Shakespeare's words and every punctuation of Shakespeare, it has been repeatedly determined, studied and controversial. Each complete set is different from another. The generation and publishing of such generations of generations have continuously issued new lives and disputes in Shaosha drama, and also continuously promoted the intergenerational development of this huge cultural industry. The writers have also been held on the altar. Whether it is Luo or Malong, their pioneering work stems from the first pair of books.

The first pair of opening may be the most important incident in the history of Shakespeare's culture. It is the origin of Shakespeare's sealing gods and has become the sacred relic of Shajiao. There were about 700 first pairs of first pairs of books published in 1623. Now 235 books exist are not extremely rare, but the recent auction price exceeds 10 million US dollars, becoming a veritable worship.

This year is the first 400th anniversary of the publication. To understand Shakespeare, as poets and writers, and Shakespeare as a Western cultural symbol, reading the first pair of Kaiben and "Shakespeare" is the best posture in the cultural history and drama world in Shakespeare.

The 53 -year -old Basel Art Exhibition has always been considered the leaders of the art market. Every year, it has attracted collectors, art lovers, curators, museum curators and gallery owners from all over the world to come to this Rhine Rhine. The artistic Swiss town. Basel is not only an art trading platform, but also the golden timing of the art circle and exchange opinions, making it influence far beyond the art exhibition for several days.

In addition to the main exhibition area of the art gallery, Basel also has the "unlimited image" and the "urban art journey" unit based on specific public art. Only in the "unlimited imagery", you will see 6,000 libraries that are covered with African printed cloth at the same time. Sports will take Greek Roman sculptures for gym for weight exercises, or 100 arranges are neatly sat down to sit down and sit down. Rest chair.

Of course, these are artworks that marked different currency prices, British artist Shonbarley(Inca on Saturday)"African Library"(The African Library,2018, Goodman画廊)£ 1.25 million; Austrian artist West(Franz West, 1947- 2012)"100 chairs"(100 chairs, 1998, David Zwirner 画廊)It is $ 1.2 million; Lithuanian artist Saratonas(Augustasserapinas)"Gym"(IIurLionis Gym, 2023, TSCHUDI and Apalazzo Gallery together)It also costs 100,400 euros. I often doubt how to sell such "big and difficult" works?

** The art generated **

"If you don't make money, we cannot continue to participate."(LouiseHayward)Broken my doubts. This 56 -year -old gallery, which has a 56 -year history, exhibited a 9 -meter -long oil painting "Fool Ship", which has an infinite image of Chinese artist, as well as American artist Aken Gill(Cory Arcangel)The 256-hour YouTube video "Related To Your Interests202020-2021). Because Yu Hong's paintings have always been very sought -after, I am more curious about how the gallery sells an artificial intelligence generation. It consists of 855 videos, and it takes nearly 11 days to see the works that can be seen from beginning to end?

Hayward told me that Arkori began to explore the so -called "click bait" as early as the mid -2000s(Clickbait), Examine the society's obsession and abuse of the Internet and its strong technical tools. Akengill has used Diffbot artificial intelligence that has the ability to search for filtering messages since 2020. He first clicked the bait as a message search target, and asked Diffbot to identify the key themes in the bait text, and then used Google image applications to find images related to these themes. The last step was to read the text by artificially generated voice. The application automatically stirs all images and audio and videos together, generate videos similar to slides, and upload two nonsense videos a day to YouTube. Because artists must pay a monthly fee of hundreds of dollars in Diffbot applications, the investment is too large. After the results have accumulated, they decide to draw a note for the project after 18 months.

Hayward is glad that the gallery has the opportunity to show this work for the first time in Basel. She believes that Aken Gil's work reveals the problem of cultural abuse and automation, but also has the boundaries between humans and computers. "He handled these problems in a creative and humorous way, which caused important discussions on artificial intelligence and its ethical impact." She revealed that there are already several art museums to come to see the works. There are three works in this work. There are three in the work. Version number, priced at $ 150,000.

** "Mattress Store" that questioned cultural consumption **

Berlin's Nagel Draxler Gallery and the Mredith Rosen Gallery in New York jointly exhibited Belgian artist Bayer(Guilla)"Mattress Store"(Mattress dream, 2003-2023)Essence Bayer is known for his humor and the work that has a deep province. His works often imitate the daily business space. "Mattress Store" is almost a typical mattress retail store. In order to ensure the persuasiveness of the work, the artist copied the unique visual elements and details of the general mattress store, and challenged the audience to think about the boundaries between art and consumerism through the simulated environment, questioning the authenticity of consumer culture, and business space to us. The impact of daily life.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-43-33-00-00/000184549_piclink.jpg)"Mattack Shop"(Mattress dream, 2003-2023)Courtesy of Art Basel

Kok, the head of Nagel Draxler Gallery(Fake coco)It is believed that "Mattack Store" is almost the perfect fit of the "Immortal" exhibition area. As early as 1984, Bayer once showed "Lighting Store" at the Basel Main Exhibition to play with the dynamics of the art market. "From then on, major changes have taken place in the art market. His works like" Mattack Shop "in Basel have a very time significance because it allows the audience to review Bayer's view of the art market nearly 40 years ago."Kok pointed out that it is a challenge for the gallery in the gallery, but it is also vital to the gallery, but because the "image unlimited" provides an opportunity to display important works. The booth space is not so large. If this work is displayed, there is no place to show other works. Although there may be greater risks in terms of sales, the "unlimited image" provides a great opportunity for galleries and artists to contact art museums or private collectors who appreciate such artworks. Although the work exhibited in "Immortality" last year was not sold, French artist Etia was displayed before(Cader)"The Culture of Fear: An Invention of Evil, 2013), although it was seen by a art museum, it took two years to complete the entire transaction.

** Based on other works to balance the expenditure of "unlimited image" **

Like Kokk, the founder of the Lebanon Sfeir-SEMLER Gallery Shergsler(JARIEAR SEY-Selers)I do n’t expect to make money from the works exhibited from “Unlimited Image” at all. I just hope that the performance of the gallery at the main booth is sufficient to share the “unlimited image” overhead. Gallery exhibited Palestinian artist Laba(Khalil Rabah)The work "Relocation, except for other"(Relocation, Among OtherThings，2018)Essence This work is a series of "Palestine Natural History and Human Museum" that artists have continued to carry out for a long time. Because Palestine does not have its own land, the "natural history and the human museum" is actually an abstract and hopeful concept. Therefore, in addition to exploring exile in Laba's works, it also challenged the museum's own ideas and purposes. "Relocation, except for other" is a device composed of some messy home supplies. There are bed racks, car parts, pots, buttons, and toy bears that lack mattresses. Items. After the artist bought these mixed daily necessities from the private and flea market, it transformed it into an artistic composition.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-43-33-00-00/000184551_piclink.jpg)"Relocation, except for others"(Relocation, Among Other Things，2018)，Courtesy of Art Basel![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-43-33-00-00/000184552_piclink.jpg)"Relocation, except for others"(RELOCATION, AMONG OTHER Things, 2018), Courtesy of Art Basel

The gallery owner explained that because of the scale of the work, it is difficult to put it in the group exhibition. It is also very difficult to display the space of the main booth. Due to the huge cost of the project, she is very fortunate to be able to draw a tie. "But it's hard to say, maybe we have a good lucky collector or curator with passion!" Steruer Simurler thought he was quite lucky. In recent years, he has sold several works in "unlimited imagery" Most of them are sold to the art museums in Europe or Persian Gulf countries. Perhaps this "relocation, except for others" with a price of $ 400,000 also has the opportunity to be appreciated by the art museum.

** Together overhead, income equal division **

You can often see several galleries selling a work in "Unlimited Image". There are 76 works in this "image unlimited", of which French artist Apurio(Jean-Marie Appriou)"Horizon"(Horizons,2023)The most "gallery gas" is jointly exhibited by 5 galleries from New York, Milan Massimo de Carlo, Cologne Jankaps, Paris Perrotin, Zurich Eva Presenhuber. Italian artist Bangvichini(Monica Bonvicini)"No more"(Never Again, 2005)It was presented by Vienna Krinzinger, Zurich Peter Kilchmann and New York Tanyabonakdar Gallery.

According to the host of the Vienna Gallery, Coringqinge(Thomas Krinzinger)Explanation, Bangwichini, a 12 autumn thousands of hanging machines made of galvanized steel pipes, iron chains, and leather, is both interesting and full of feminism and political awareness. Although the work is marked(Pre -tax)350,000 euros, but due to the high cost of production, transportation, and exhibitions, and the price of 50%of the cost of returning to artists, the remaining 50%of the three galleries were divided by the three galleries, and each gallery was quite limited. However, Klinqin also believes that it is the most important thing to make works appear in front of such an international art audience.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-43-33-00-00/000184555_piclink.jpg)Artist: MAI-Thuperret, "Untitled", 2021/2023, Courtesy of Art Basel![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-15T23-43-33-00-00/000184556_piclink.jpg)Artist: Monicabonvicini, works: NEVER AGAIN, 2005, Courtesy of Art Basel

Based on the above gallery opinions, "unlimited imagery" shows large -scale installation works in the best way. The purpose is to attract the most audiences as much as possible, rather than purely considering business factors. That's the status that allows Basel Art Exhibition to stabilize the art museum level.

# The age of Japanese criminal law is increased to 16 years old

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Tokyo, 16th) The Japanese Senate passed a bill that was important to reform the law of crime today to increase the age of the intended behavior to 16 years. Japan's current consensus behavior is 13 years old, the lowest of the developed countries.

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-16T-16-32-07-00-00/000000.png)The Japanese Senate unanimously passed this new bill. The content of the bill also clarified the necessary conditions for rape prosecution and incorporated the prostitution into criminal crimes.

Britain is 16 years old, France is 15 years old, and both in Germany and Italy are 14 years old. If human interaction with the above -mentioned age thresholds lower than the above -mentioned countries, it will be regarded as rape in law.

In 1907, Japan set the age of intentional behavior to 13 years, and has not changed so far. Japan's last revision of criminal law on sexual crimes was for the first time for more than a century in 2017, but the proposal believes that the reform is not perfect. In 2019, the suspects of rape cases were sentenced to innocent release, which caused the Japanese people's attention to sexual crimes and called on judicial reform.

According to previous laws, prosecutors must prove that victims have lost their behavior due to violence and coercion.

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-16T-20-02-08-00-00/000000.png)Agence France -Presse reports that the "El Nino" is officially coming, which is worried that there are more temperature records and set more temperature records.

The EU climate monitoring agency, Samanthaburgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said: "The world has just experienced the warmest early June in May; It is less than 0.1 degrees Celsius in May. "

Part of the data of "Copernicus Climate Change Service" dates back to 1950. This agency said: "The global average surface temperature in early June this year has greatly exceeded the early June record of ERA5 (Global Climate Analysis Tool)."

"Copernicus Climate Change Service" recently announced that in May this year, the global marine temperature was higher than the May record of the year.

This agency pointed out that from June 8th to 9th this year, the global average daily temperature was about 0.4 degrees Celsius higher than the record in the same period of previous years.

In addition, the global temperature in early June has a higher level of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius before industrialization, and exceeds the upper limit of global warming over the 2015 "Paris Agreement".

Data show that from June 7th to 11th, the global average daily temperature is at a critical value of 1.5 degrees higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, of which the maximum of 1.69 degrees Celsius on June 9.

In recent years, this upper limit has been broken many times in winter and spring, but it is the first time in June.

"To avoid more serious consequences of climate crisis, each slight scale is important."

The characteristics of the phenomenon of holy babies are that the temperature in the central and eastern seas near the Equatorial Ocean near the equator is more warm than the average. This phenomenon occurs once every 2 to 7 years. The last time was from 2018 to 2019.

Most of the hottest years in history occur during the phenomenon of holy infants. Scientists are worried that land and ocean temperatures in the summer of this year and next may make a record. (Translator: Ji Jinling)

### Why does the United States end China's "developing country" status

** On June 8th, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted through a bill called the Ending China's Developing National Act, which paved the way for all the US Senate's voting. **

At the end of this year, the House of Representatives in the United States also passed a similar bill. According to the legislative process of the United States, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed them, and then signed by the US President, and the law will officially take effect. There is no news when the US Senate will vote on the bill.

This bill requires the US administrative department to take measures to promote international organizations to terminate China's "developing countries" and change China's status to "developed countries".

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded that "the United States wants to impose the hat of the" developed country 'to China, not because of appreciation of China's development achievements, but the intention of drunkhs is not wine. China's status is a card for curbing China's development. "

###  The benefit -Why don't China want to be a "developed country"?

In the long run, of course, China wants to be a "developed country", and this concept was proposed as early as the 1980s, the so -called "three steps" strategy, the third step was in the middle of 2049 During the 100th anniversary of the co -construction, the per capita GDP reaches the level of medium -developed countries. The people's lives are wealthy and basically realize modernization.

[Why do the United States end China's "developing country" status](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65915282)"Now (abandoning the status of developing countries) is not the time. When it is a developing country, it has both political interests and economic benefits." An international relationship in Hong Kong said to BBC.

For example, in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement, more than 150 terms have clearly specified that developing countries enjoy "Special and DifferentialTreatment", and members of developing countries can be degraded in tariffs, extended negotiations, and non -tariff barriers. Enjoy more preferential treatment.

However, in bilateral trade, many developed countries will decide whether to give another country's developing countries according to the actual situation. For example, in February 2020, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced the cancellation of preferential treatment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) developing countries of 25 economies, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, China, which is higher than China, and China, China, China, China, China, China, China, and China, China, China, China, China, China, and China, China, China, China, and China, China, China, and China, China, and China, China, and China, China, and China, which is higher than China. South Korea, even Albania, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Ukraine and Vietnam, which are lower economic levels.

However, in other international treaties, developing countries can also enjoy the treatment, especially the field of environmental protection. The Manifesto of Human Environment in 1972, the "Montreal Protocol" in 1987, the "Framework of the United Nations Climate Change" in 1992, the "Kyoto Protocol" in 1997, and the Paris Agreement in 2015 to varying degrees to varying degrees It is recognized that developed countries should take care of developing countries, and allow the latter to suspend the implementation of emission reduction measures and more loose emission reduction obligations. It also requires developed countries to provide funds and technologies to developing countries.

The logic behind it is that developed countries have been the main emission country of greenhouse gases in the past few hundred years, so they should now bear more discharge obligations than developing countries.

Politically, China has long defined itself as a "biggest developing country". As early as the Mao Zedong era, the concept of "third world" was proposed. From the international strategy, it was selected from the United States and the Soviet Union to the United States and the Soviet Union. brother".

"Almost no exceptional political interests are developed countries in Europe and the United States. They are deeply embedded in Western political systems, discourse systems, and international governance systems. Developing its own status in developing countries, or in emerging nation -states, China is often said to be carried into the "United Nations, the concepts of the third world, Asia, Africa and La La, etc. are familiar in China. The five -country brick country and the Asia Bank are all efforts to build a multi -polarized world order through "developing countries".

It is worth mentioning that at a China -Africa cooperation forum, Chinese leaders called China "the biggest developing country" as usual, and a number of African leaders under the stage laughed and believed that China was too humble. China and Africa Africa were too humble. China and Africa Africa The country is obviously not a type of country. This scene was widely spread on Chinese social media.

### Standard -How can I be a developing country?

In response to the relevant bills of the United States Congress, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "China, as the world's largest developing country, has sufficient factual basis and a solid foundation for international law. of."

So is there any exact standard, can China be judged whether China is a developing country?

The clearest standard comes from the United Nations Department of Statistics (UNSD). In a regional and national classification standards called M49, the agency clearly distinguishes from developed countries and developing countries -Japan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand And the entire European identification as a developed country; in the process of trade statistics, some islands and regions such as Israel, Cyprus, Bermud, Greenland, St. Pierre, and Miton are developed as developing countries; the rest are developing countries. China is naturally listed.

However, the United Nations website shows that the current version of M49 is formulated in 1999. It also specifically stated that there is no definition of developing countries and developed countries (or regions) in the United Nations system. However, in 1996, the distinction between "developed regions" and "developing regions" was introduced to statistical standard countries or regional code (ie M49). These groups were just for statistics at the time, and it did not represent the judgment of the development stage of any country or region.

The comprehensive and higher division standard comes from the United Nations Development Planning Department (UNDP), which comprehensively considers the health, education, economy and inequality dimension to evaluate a human development index (HDI) for countries with different levels of development worldwide, and it is extremely divided into extremely extremely divided into extremes. The high, high, medium, and low levels are only the first countries in developed countries, and the other three files are developing countries.

According to this standard, China ’s human development index was 0.768 in 2022, ranking 79th in the world, and belongs to the High HDI group, so it belongs to developing countries. However, there are 66 countries with high HDI, and China's ranking is relatively close.

WorldBank divides each economy into four categories: high -income, medium high income, low -income and low -income in accordance with total national income (GNI). Similarly, high -income economies are developed countries, and the remaining three categories are developing countries.

The World Bank will announce a standard in July each year. The current standard for entering the ranks of high -income countries is that the per capita GNI exceeds $ 13,205. According to the data released by China in February, the total national income (GNI) of China last year was $ 12,608, but it had reached 95%of the above standards.

The WTO (WTO) generally accepts the claim that any country claims to be a "developing country". Therefore, some countries and regions that are in line with "developed countries" will also choose to adhere to their "developing countries", so as to enjoy preferential treatment in the WTO.

In this system, few countries will take the initiative to abandon their "developing countries". One of them is South Korea -October 25, 2019, the South Korean government decided to automatically abandon the "development country treatment" in the WTO status. But at that time, the South Korean human development index ranked as high as 22, higher than France, Spain, and Italy. The total national revenue of South Korea announced by the World Bank at that time also reached 43,000 US dollars, which is the same as Japan, which is nearly three times that of China.

### Controversy -China and the United States each hold the word

The above -mentioned scholars said that in almost all international standards, China is still counted as a "developing country", but there are two facts that cannot be ignored:

I. Developing countries cover a wide range. Compared with Yemen, Rwanda and other countries, China is obviously closer to the level of developed countries. Even if the renminbi appreciates this year, China will enter the threshold of developed countries in the WTO.

Second, this is still discussing in the per capita category. If this multiplied by 1.4 billion, China's huge volume and international political and economic influence, only the United States and the entire European Union can match, so it is very different from the impression of "developing countries". big.

The per capita VS is the core argument of China and the United States on this issue.

In China, from the media to diplomats, the arguments on this issue are focused on -although China's economic development is fast, the domestic development is unbalanced, and the per capita has not reached the level of developed countries. The economy should consider society and medical care.

In the United States, regardless of the Senate or House of Representatives, they focus on China's huge volume -China has become the world's largest exporter and the second largest economy, and it is no longer in line with the standards of developing countries. Essence

"From the economic and military scale to the large -scale investment in countries around the world, it is clear that China is no longer a 'developing country'," "Chris Vanhollen, a member of Maryland, said in a written statement. "For a long time, China has been using this status to obtain unfair advantages in the multilateral agreement."

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-16T01-47-07.000Z/_117675361_066283134.jpg)Image source, reuters

Mittromney, Republican of Utah, also issued a statement saying, "China has the world's second largest economy and is expected to surpass the United States economy ... China continues to be seen on the global stage. It is ridiculous for developing countries. "

Earlier in the House of Representatives voting a similar bill, Member Youngkim also said that China is the second largest economy in the world, accounting for 18.6%of the global economy. Their economy is second only to the United States. The United States is regarded as developed countries. China should be the same.

The speeches of these members also revealed the purpose of the United States to a certain extent.

In this regard, Zhang Zhixin, an associate researcher at the American Institute of the Chinese Institute of Modern International Relations, said that the United States is actually doing so to ensure its advantageous position in economics, trade, technology, finance and other fields, and re -build an international internationally conducive to safeguarding the US hegemony. New political and economic order.

"When the competition between China and the United States is increasingly intensified, the US Congress moves on the one hand to ensure that it can get more favorable chips in economic and trade negotiations, and on the other hand, it is fundamentally hoping to decompose chain with China 'to China, so as to thus Containment or delay China's rise. "Zhang Zhixin said.

Can the United States succeed? The answer given by the above scholars is that "it can be successful within a certain range, but the impact will not be too great."

She said that the World Bank, World Trade Organization, IMF and other international organizations. As the main contractor, the United States, the United States has a great influence. If there is a two -party full vote bill support, it will effectively affect these organizations. However, in the context of the confrontation between China and the United States, these international organizations are facing the dilemma of failure, and in real trade, the US tariffs on China continue to trade during the trade war, far higher than the tariffs set by developed countries under the WTO framework. Therefore, it will not change the current situation of both parties.

"It should be noted that China's negotiation capabilities are also strengthening, and the United States will not want to be under pressure, forcing China to withdraw from international organizations and start another stove. Different points of focusing, the United States hopes to reduce China's economic interests among international organizations; what China is more valued is international politics, that is, unite the third world country, to form another polarity different from the West. China China. China. China. You can adhere to the positioning of developing countries on the diplomatic field, and at the same time make some compromises in international organizations. "

(Voice of Germany) Mandiant, a subsidiary of Google, said on Thursday (June 15) that a hacker group suspected to be supported by the Chinese government found a widely popular email security device The loopholes broke into hundreds of public and private sectors around the world, and nearly one -third of them were government agencies, including diplomatic units.

McGrady pointed out in a blog post that behind the scenes of their "highly convinced", the Lord was a hacker tissue called "UNC4841" and engaged in "spy activities that support China".

The report states that the hacker will send an email containing malicious documents to access the equipment and data of the target unit, especially for projects that "have a high degree of policy importance to the Chinese government".

55%of the victims came from the Americas, 22%came from the Asia -Pacific region, and 24%came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. These include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Southeast Asian National Foreign Ministry, Taiwan and Hong Kong's Foreign Trade Office and academic units.

McGrady pointed out that the device that was drilled was the Email SecurityGateway of the Barracuda Networks. In May of this year, the barracuda network detected spy activities and released to contain and remedy nails to fill the loopholes. However, the hacker group immediately modified its malicious program. "".

The barracuda network said in early June that some of its email security devices were attacked by hackers as early as October, so that the invaders obtained the backdoor of the Internet attack. The company announced at the time that the hacker's attack was "very serious", and customers were advised to replace these devices in an all -round way.

### Net offensive incident endlessly

Charles Carmakal, the technology chief of McGrady, also stated through an email on the 15th.

While Madian made a report, US federal agencies were reported to resist another cyber attack. CNN, CNN in the United States, reported on Thursday (15th) that Russian cyber criminals used software vulnerabilities to attack global network attacks. In addition to the hit by the US federal government agencies, hundreds of American companies and units were also suffered.

At that time, Beijing refuted that this was the United States and its allies that distributed false information, and criticizing the United States was the "hacking mission".

Agence France -Presse reported on the 15th that China has always denied the allegations of hacker groups, and has accused the United States of conducting cyber spy activities on China and invading its universities and companies' computer systems.

The United States has not collapsed.

On January 8th, in Trump's [supporters rushed into the Congress Building](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007606996/capitol-riot-trump-supporters.html)Two days after trying to prevent Congress from confirming that his campaign failed, Mark Milly(Significant)General's general told General Li Zuocheng that "the situation may look unstable," this is the second similar call between the two. "But democracy is like this, General Li. We are 100 % stable. Everything is good. But democracy may sometimes be very hasty."

However, despite the guarantee, Milly was very worried about Trump, so that later that day, he summoned a senior commander meeting to remind them that the procedures for launching nuclear weapons stipulated that decision -making requires his participation.

This book also revealed that [Trump asked him to overthrow the election](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20210106/pence-trump-election/)On the issue of certification, [Vice President Mike Pence(Mike Pence)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/us/politics/pence-trump-election-results.html)In fact, it is more reluctant than the public knows.

He proposed the false statement of the problem of the Arizona voting results and asked if there was any way to postpone the certification.

Pence's spokesman did not respond to the request of the comment.

The "Danger" scheduled to be released next Tuesday states that its narrative is based on the notes, documents at the time, and interviews with direct participants and witnesses who have not disclosed their names. The New York Times got a sample.

Similar to other media reports published after Trump's departure and books, this book details the last few months of Trump in the last few months of his term, especially in the election failure and [start to deny the election results](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/us/trump-election-lie.html)After that, his post of president was actually crashing.

Mili believes that Trump has experienced mental decline after the election.

This book has nearly half of the length of the first few months of the Biden government, telling how the new president has worked hard to cope with the epidemic, economic recession, Congress, and withdrawal from Afghanistan.

But the details of the Trump administration may receive the most attention.

In the book, a few days before the 2020 election, American intelligence showed that China believes that Trump plans to create an international crisis by launching a military strike. The last effort.

Mili is more worried about China's growing military forces, and the possibility of a misunderstanding of a move that triggers the war between the world's superpowers. At that time, he first passed a secret channel with General Li. He wanted to assure Li Zuocheng and Xi Jinping that the United States had no plans to attack China.

In the call on January 8, 2020, Li Zuocheng hinted that Chinese leaders were worried about the US government's unstable. In that one and a half hours, he asked Mily for the military if he would take action.

Erin Schaff/The New Yorktimes

The book states that although Mili has made a guarantee, Li Zuocheng is worried that Trump may try to find an opportunity to continue his power by seizing this opportunity, just like Hitler in 1933 [Using the German Capitol House Arson Case](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-reichstag-fire-and-nazis-rise-power-180962240/)Come to master the power of the very period.

The book wrote that even after that call, Mili believed that the situation was "severe", and Li Zuocheng was still "extremely nervous."

The conclusion that Mili was concluded was that Trump did not want to launch a war, but he might order a certain military blow, which caused a chain reaction and caused war.

"I keep reminding him," quoting Milly's words in the book, "you may find yourself entering the state of war, which depends on the location and object of your attack."

Later that day, Mili and Nanyi Pelosi(Nancy Pelosi)The Speaker talked, and Peros was increasingly worried that Trump would vent his force and use force.

"This is too bad, but who knows what he will do?" Pelosi said. "He is crazy. You know he is crazy. He has been crazy for a long time. So don't say you don't know his psychological condition."

"Ms. Speaker," Mili said. "I agree with all these."

As the highest military adviser to president, Mili was not within the command system, and he tried to guarantee that he could prevent Trump from being able to stop Trump.advertise

"So," Perosi said, "What do you mean by illegal or crazy?"

"I can guarantee you," Mili said. "All I can do is to guarantee you that I will stop the US military from happening."

After talking with Pelosi, Mily met with the military's highest commanders in the Pentagon's war room and told them that they wanted to check the long -term nuclear weapon launch procedures. He reminded the commanders that only the president can order such an attack, and Milly must directly participate in the process.

"If you get the phone," Mily said, "No matter who comes from, the action must be in line with the articles of association. This is a procedural. No matter what others tell you, you have to do things according to the procedure. And I am part of this program. . You must guarantee that there are right people in each link. "

He also said: "Strict procedures are designed to avoid errors or accidents due to negligence, or to carry out evil, unintentional, illegal, and immoral launch on the most dangerous weapons in the world."

Subsequently, he walked in the war room and asked the commander one by one to confirm whether he understood his words.

Twelve days later, Mili said that he might be one of the happiest people at the Biden's inauguration, because Trump finally stepped down.

"We all know what you have experienced," Biden told Milly shortly after the inauguration. "We all know how much work you have done."

Although there is a lot of pen and ink describing Milly's view on Trump, the description of Pence in the book revealed for the first time that the loyalty and political future for Trump, as well as their assistants and consultants' suggestions on obeying the Constitution, When conflict, to what extent the vice president can do.

A few days before the arrival of January 6, Pence called Quille. Quille was the only one who was still in the world who had been forced to prove that he had defeated in the election.

Pence told him that President believes that Pence can deny the election results in order to keep his power.

"Mike, you have no room for virginity on this issue," Kui said to Pence. "Nothing. Forget it. Let's put it down."

"I understand, this is what I have always tried to tell Trump," Pence said. "But he really felt that he could do this. And there were others there said that I had such power."

Pence subsequently agreed with Trump's false statements on election fraud. "Well, there are some problems in Arizona," Burns said.

"Mike, I live in Arizona," Kui said. "No problem here."

The two two -party bills proposed in Congress this week aim to change a trade rules of nearly 100 years of history. This rule allows imported parcels below a certain price threshold to be less supervised during the customs clearance of US Customs.

The rules of trade are called "low exemptions". Critics said it provided unfair advantages to foreign e -commerce companies, including some places where forced labor problems. At present, the U.S. government does not levy tariffs, taxes or other expenses to companies with import value below 800 US dollars.

A bill proposed on Thursday aims to prohibit China and Russia from being qualified to use the trade law as a "non -market economy". It also seek to collect more information about the US Customs and Border Protection Agency on all the goods below 800 US dollars, including the identity of items, natives of items, and consignor and importers.

The bill was proposed by the Florida Republican Senator Malcow Luberi, the Ohio Democratic Senator Sharod Brown, the Oregon Democratic Representative Erl Brumennor and the Florida Republican Republican Councilor Neil Dimin. The proposal believes that the modification of this trading law will eliminate a loophole, which allows companies to transport products that may be manufactured by forced labor into the United States; in addition, the modification will also provide fair US companies that manufacture products imported from other countries. Competitive environment.

"I think that our legislation is aimed at very narrow abuse areas, and it is likely to obtain strong support for the two parties," Brumennor said in an interview.

** Why is this important ** **: The law affects the pricing of e -commerce companies. **

In 2016, the minimum limit ranging from $ 200 [Improve](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/de-minimis-value-increases-800)By $ 800. This measure reduces the burden on the customs department. Later, the new crown epidemic broke out, and online shopping began to flourish.

Some online retailers have obtained economic benefits from this law because they can send small batch orders directly from overseas. This is different from many traditional retailers, and the latter usually imports a large amount of clothing to the United States -pay the necessary fees -and then send online shopping orders from the warehouse.

The online clothing retailer SHEIN established in China is one of the companies that will affect the bill. Shein is very popular among American consumers with extremely low prices and advanced mobile applications and websites. Its $ 11 shirt skirt and $ six printed Bikini can bypass import taxes and ship directly to shoppers.

In recent months, SHEIN has set up a distribution center in the United States to ship goods to American consumers. This may cause the company to pay more fees in customs because it will first import a large amount of goods into its warehouse.

However, shein faces reviews due to some business behaviors. Some people claim that its design has plagiarism and in the clothing [use cotton from Xinjiang](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-21/shein-s-cotton-clothes-tied-to-xinjiang-china-region-accused-of-forced-labor#xj4y7vzkg)U.S. officials said that the Chinese government abuses Uighurs in Xinjiang. Investors expect SHEIN to make their first public offering this year, which will only increase their questions about the company.

The bill proposed on Thursday did not mention the name of the company, but "SHEIN may be the company that uses low -exemption vulnerabilities most obviously," said Brumonor.

"Maybe consumers can save money, but what is the price?" He said when he talked about SHEIN's cheap product line. "I think we have made up our minds. We will respect the environment, human rights and product security, even if this requires a little more money."

Shein stated in the statement that the company "zero tolerance for forced labor" and established a system to comply with the Uighurs forced Labor Control Law. The system includes "behavioral standards, independent audit, reliable tracking technology and third -party test", a spokesman for Shein said. "We have no manufacturer in Xinjiang."

She also said, "Since entering the US market in 2012, shein has been abiding by US tax and customs laws."

** Background: US criticism of Chinese companies is becoming more and more severe. **

The second bill proposed on Wednesday is the US government seeking companies that are related to China [strengthen supervision](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/business/economy/china-business-tiktok-shein.html)The latest signs.

The bill was initiated by Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Casidi and the Visan Star Democratic Senator Tami Baldwin, calling on the ban on Chinese companies from using low -exemption rules and requesting more information to enter the United States.

In March of this year, the US Councilor's relationship with China on the Tiktok platform and China conducted five hours of CEO of Tiktok [质] [question](https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230324/tiktok-hearing-congress-china/)Essence Other companies such as e -commerce retailers TEMU also face the relationship with China. This month, Rubio wrote to other members to remind them to pay attention to SHEIN's business behavior and lobbying activities.

In 2016, when the rules were adjusted, "at that time, people were not as concerned about China as much as they are now," Kelly, Drama, and Volun Law Firm senior consultants, former US National Foreign Trade Commission, William Laiyin Shi said.

** What will happen next: There is still a long way to go through these bills. **

The two bills need to be reviewed separately in the two hospitals, and may face a long way to pass.

In recent months, SHEIN has been conducting [Charm Attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/business/shein-fast-fashion.html)In terms of sustainable development practice and independent designers more voices -it faces many doubts in these two fields.

On May 31, there was another company with an annual output of 2.4 million tons of steel in Tangshan, Hebei. A engineer of the steel industry told this station that the price of steel in the first six months of this year fell 25%, and this decline was unbearable.

Mr. Fang Fang, an engineer of Tangshan Iron and Steel Enterprise, told this station this Friday that a large number of steel mills this year have stopped production and the decline in market demand and the sharp decline in prices. He said: "First, the failure of the steel mill is always closed. There are more than 500 steel mills in China, so it is normal to close 10%. Second, the whole steel industry is really not good. From January 1st to today, the thread fell from 4,600 yuan to 3600 yuan per ton, down 25%, which is still available? So in the process, many companies have closed down. "

In this regard, Mr. Fang said that the best state -owned enterprise in China is Baosteel Group, and private enterprises are Shagang: "If these two companies lose money, it means that the steel industry in the country is losing money."

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The European Union Council warned on Thursday (June 15) that Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE may pose a threat to the security security of the European Union and announced that they would stop the equipment of these companies.

According to Agence France -Presse, the European Union Council stated in a statement that compared with other 5G suppliers, Huawei and ZTE have obvious risks. Therefore, the Executive Committee will take relevant security measures to avoid excessive relying on these suppliers. equipment.

ThierryBreton, the internal market of the European Executive Committee, said at a press conference that the relevant equipment "may become a" weapon "that may harm us (referring to the EU) interests. Vulnerability is a risk that the EU cannot afford. He called on the EU's 27 member states and its telecommunications operators to exclude Huawei and ZTE's equipment outside its mobile network.

According to Reuters, Bretton has said recently that some third -party countries in terms of emotional and digital security are invasive, and some EU members are still in their 5G core networks. Essence The report states that Breton's remarks at the time implied that it was China.

In 2020, through a guideline, the European Union urged member states to restrict or prohibit high -risk 5G suppliers to avoid the safety of the core of its telecommunications network. High -risk suppliers such as ZTE conduct restricted or exclusion.

Breton said that such a disable is "too slow". Because it excessively relies on the company's equipment and forms weaknesses, the European Union is therefore exposed to major collective security risks.

The French New Society pointed out that the strict 5G specifications launched by the Executive Committee earlier did not completely ban any supplier and did not name Huawei. This statement marked the turning of the EU -while maintaining a relationship with Beijing, it is also right, and it is also right. China has adopted an increasingly strong position.

Passant Mamdouhridwan is a new friend I know. She was born in Egypt. After completing her undergraduate studies at Cairo University, she obtained a master's and doctoral degree at Peking University. She is currently engaged in post -doctoral research at Fudan University. She has 12 years of life and work experience in China. Passant's research field is the relationship between China and the Middle East, focusing on the development of the "Belt and Road" in the Middle East. This interview is based on- "the relationship between China and the Middle East" as the main line, trying to show Passant's thinking about this field. The following is the author's interview with Passant:

** Question: ** Please introduce your scientific research interests and the current research topics at hand.

** Passant: ** I am from Egypt, and I have 12 years of study and work experience in China. In 2021, he received a doctorate degree from the School of International Relations of Peking University. At that time, I mainly studied strategic partnership between China and Egypt. I currently engage in post -doctoral research at Fudan University, and scientific research focuses on health cooperation between China and the Middle East countries. My research direction involves the cooperation between the Middle East international relations, the diplomatic relations between China and the Middle East, and the "Belt and Road" in the Middle East Northern Africa region. At present, my research is more inclined to the development of health career cooperation between China and the "Belt and Road" countries, and the development of the "digital silk" road in the Middle East and Northern African countries.

** Q: ** As a scholar who studies the relationship between China -Middle East, how do you think how the bilateral relations have developed in recent years? What are the real challenges?

** Passant: ** In recent years, China and the Middle East countries have been closely close to their cooperation in various fields, and have achieved great achievements in bilateral relations under the “Belt and Road” initiative. At present, the Middle East countries have strived to achieve a balance of diplomatic relations. Some countries have long been an important regional strategic allies as the United States for a long time, and now they have shifted to China and Russia to achieve higher strategic interests of the country.

Economic and trade cooperation is an important part of China and Arab countries. The Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the Gulf country are important trading partners in China. China is also the main importer of oil of the Gulf Cooperation Committee (Sea -League). Saudi Arabia is an important source of oil imports in China. There are many multinational companies in the UAE. China ’s investment fields in the United States in the Sea Association include transportation, energy and telecommunications. Infrastructure projects include: Dubai Metro, Harry French Port, Riyadh Metro, Haxiang clean coal power plant in Dubai, and Oman's Dukumu refinery. China Infrastructure Investment and Construction Projects of China in Egypt, Algeria and Morocco in North Africa are: the new capital of Egypt, Suez Canal Economic Zone, Algeria Metro, Morocco's Tangier-Med Port, Hassan II Bridge, etc. Essence

Although there is unlimited development in the "Belt and Road" in the Middle East, there are also many challenges. Countries in the Middle East are facing complex domestic governance and geographical political challenges: First, internal governance is out of order. In the case of regional political and economic unstable, civil war broke out in many countries, which may have a impact on the domestic investment environment, and also caused Chinese investment projects to be delayed or difficult to complete on schedule. Recently, we saw the situation in Sudan. In 2011, a series of parade demonstrations broke out in the "Spring of the Arabia". The Libyan civil war upgrades caused Chinese citizens to be withdrawn organized. The internal political instability of Syria and Yemen also produced negative spillover. Second, terrorism constitutes a challenge. Due to sectarian conflict, civil war and other factors, specific countries have become hotbeds of terrorism and extremism. Third, the virus spreads. During the global epidemic, the global supply chain was stagnant, which led to the decline in the economy of various countries, which caused some projects in the “Belt and Road” to be delayed. Fourth, cultural differences. In this regard, I want to emphasize the importance of folk cultural exchanges, which may lead to new changes in multinational relations.

** Q: ** Does China's direct investment in the Middle East have a positive effect? What do you evaluate this?

** Passant: Since the "Belt and Road" initiative was launched, China and 17 Arab countries have signed the "Belt and Road" agreement. China has continuously increased investment in infrastructure, construction, energy, communication, real estate, technology, finance, health, education, tourism, tourism and other fields. I have made some interpretations on the specific projects. China has become an important source of foreign investment in the region. Prior to the "Belt and Road" initiative, most of China's investment in energy sources has now expanded to a variety of fields. China has played a key role in infrastructure projects, including ports, highways, and highways, highways, and highways, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and roads, highways, and highways. The investment and construction of railway and energy projects have the figures of Chinese multinational companies everywhere. These investment not only has a positive role in achieving the economic development of the country in the region, but also brings objective benefits to solving employment and realizing social stability.

There are strategic partnerships in China and the Middle East: Egypt (1999), Algeria (2004), UAE (2016), Qatar (2014), Jordan (2015), Iraq (2015), Iran (2016), Morocco (2016) , Saudi Arabia (2016), Oman (2018), Kuwait (2018). Since 2010, China has gradually surpassed the United States to become the first trading partner of the Middle East. In 2021, China ’s total imports from the Middle East countries were US $ 130 billion, the United States was US $ 34 billion, and China exported the Middle East to US $ 129 billion, and the United States was US $ 48 billion. This shows that China's economic and trade influence in the Middle East has continued to increase, and it has become the most important economic and trade partner of regional countries. At present, the countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are actively promoting economic shifts, pushing economic diversification, and gradually reducing the single dependence on the petroleum economy, increasing investment promotion to attract foreign investment.

As China promotes the construction of "digital silk", technology and communications have become an important area for bilateral cooperation. At present, Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the UAE actively cooperate with China in promoting 5G networks and artificial intelligence. Huawei has built the first "OpenLab" in northern Africa in Cairo, Egypt, and has played an important role in promoting digital cooperation in Egypt, 5G communication, and AI. Saudi Arabia signed training in the field of artificial intelligence to enhance artificial intelligence -related technical talent reserves. Saudi Arabia's dim sum. "Zain." Started 5G, and Huawei regarded Saudi Arabia as one of the key countries with 5G. Huawei and the UAE's DU Company also signed a memorandum of understanding of 5G strategic cooperation. These all show that China is promoting the development of regional science and technology to achieve geopolitical economic strategies. It is worth mentioning that the United States often expressed concerns about cooperation between the Middle East and China in this field, and expressed the warning of the market share of China's Huawei equipment to the Gulf State (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Barin). In fact The country's 5G technology equipment, and Huawei is not in the market. This shows that the Middle East countries will continue to seek balance between benefits.** Passant: ** In recent years, China's role and influence in the Middle East have been significantly improved. The decline in the influence of the United States in the Middle East has also become a favorable opportunity for China to play a more positive role. If we review the "Arab Spring" in the Middle East, we can see that the region has experienced many evolution and challenges, including the transfer of the influence of the great power, the game of the United States and the Russia and China in this region, and the non -national behavior is in good right. The challenges of regional politics and the reshaping of the Middle East relations have all become an important driving force for the evolution of the new pattern of the Middle East.

China has always been regarded as an important economic and trade partner by all parties in the Middle East. China has actively promoted regional peace. A large number of investment projects that have been launched have a certain benefit to promoting the development of the Middle East economic development, and at the same time, it also has a huge role in achieving regional political stability. For a long time, the United States has been a very important country in the process of security in the Middle East. The role of role in many Middle East disputes has become more and more prominent. For example, in 1979, the United States promoted the signing of peace treaties in Egypt and Israel. The country's peaceful country, and current Chinese diplomacy is quietly changing this situation.

Looking at it now, China's political participation in the region is increasing, which is the role of China in the Middle East country. As a major country led in Sunni in the Middle East, Iran, as a influential country led by Shiites, has become the key to conflict conflicts in the Middle East. At present, in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen have Iranian military organizations, these countries have become the focus of conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iranian sects, which leads to long -term geopolitical turmoil and brutal civil war. In addition, for a long time, Israel and Gulf Arab countries have strengthened political mobilization under the theory of "Iran", trying to curb Iranian forces together, and restrict Iran's "nuclear weapons projects" through economic sanctions through the United States. The Iranian economy has been in difficulty in sanctions, and the recent domestic demonstrations have also brought unstable political situation. Therefore, both Saudi Arabia and Iran are willing to achieve reconciliation through Chinese mediation and regional stability. However, it is not so simple to have the opportunity to completely end the conflict. It is worth mentioning that when the relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia is constantly turning, will the future situation affect the progress of Israel's "Abrahamaccords"? I think that the normalization of Saudi Arabia and Israel still requires some conditions, which also takes time to observe.

In the end, the United States played the role of reconciliation from China. It is also a benefit. The stable Gulf area is good for maintaining the interests of the United States.

** Question: ** The Middle East as an important direction for Chinese diplomacy, and the region is facing challenges such as nationalism, counter -terrorism, and war turbulence. What role do you think that the Middle East country may play in the context of the strong competition between China and the United States?

** Passant: ** The United States intervenes and leads the Middle East affairs for a long time. The Middle East country is the main exporter of global oil resources and is at an important point in maintaining the global hegemony in the United States. During the Cold War, the interests of the United States were concentrated in controlling oil, ensuring Israel's security, and resisting the Soviet Union's penetration in the Middle East. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States became the world's only power country. In 1979, the Campdavidaccords of Egypt and Israel was regarded as an important progress of American and Middle East diplomacy. After that, the United States provided a large number of military assistance and armed forces training support to regional countries (Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia) in order to safeguard national interests, all served the strategic interests of the United States in the United States.

After the September 11 incident, the United States began to declare war on Taliban, Afghanistan in 2001 with the reason for cracking down on "terrorism". The United States accused Saddam's own nuclear weapons and launched a war in Iraq in 2003 to overthrow the Saddam regime. This allowed Iraqi to Iraq. Even the entire region was caught in conflict and turmoil. The United States has a bad consequences like the interference in Libya and Syria. The United States' military intervention in the Middle East not only causes damage to the Middle East, but also causes the United States to lose its diplomacy in the Middle East.

China ’s diplomacy in the Middle East is different from the United States. China relies on soft power in the Middle East to focus on economic benefits. Conditions, maintaining friendly relations with regional countries for a long time, have become one of the reasons why many Middle East countries are more inclined to strengthen relations with China.

In the context of the competition between China and the United States, the Middle East country is likely to continue to seek balance between China and the United States. Even in the case of the United States suppressing China's influence in the Middle East country, regional countries will still formulate independent foreign policies based on national interests. Essence The United States is still the main military alliance in the Middle East and the biggest partner of security cooperation in the Gulf area. This role is difficult to replace for the time being, and China cannot make up for the role of the United States in the short term. It is undeniable that the Middle East is no longer dominated by the United States, but it is regional, such as China, Russia, and even India to impose influence and continue to maintain partnership with the host country. Balanced relations and realization of national interests are diplomatic policies that are generally implemented in countries in the Middle East. The current new pattern of the Middle East is a manifestation of global polarization. So far, China and the United States have not had an intuitive and fierce geographical conflict in the Middle East. Chinese scholars have always regarded Pakistani conflict as the core topic of the Middle East dispute. Actually, the Palestinian issue is still one of the main reasons for the unstable Middle East. With the increase in China's political influence, China can play on this issue even more Positive role.

In short, I think that China will always avoid conflicts with the United States in the region. The stability of the Middle East is conducive to maintaining the sustainable supply of oil global oil. Important forces will not fall into trouble.

Human rights non -governmental organizations jointly made an appeal to Brinken.

The joint letter urged Blint to seek accountability for the Chinese government's violation of human rights. The letter pointed out that in recent months, the Chinese authorities have suppressed many communities, including ordinary citizens participating in peace against the stern and clear zero policy, and Chinese Muslims who have carried out religious activities. The Chinese Communist Party also sentenced Xu Zhiyong, a well -known human rights defender Xu Zhiyong in 14 years, and human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi was in prison for 12 years. Human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng was detained during the meeting with EU officials in Beijing and EU officials.

The joint letter asked Brinken to tell the CCP authorities: the United States intends to conduct an international investigation on the crime of the atrocities of Xinjiang with the allies, immediately release all human rights defenders, and release the Americans and their families who have been mistaken for or forced to miss in China. Abolishment of a compulsory boarding school system imposed on Tibet children. The joint letter also called on Brinken to meet with members of the "Tiananmen Mother" if the situation allowed.

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-16T04-02-07-00-00/000000.png)Daiqi said at the National PressClub (NPC) speech that "fragile supply chain and unsustainable globalization" need to be reformed to respond, and challenges will have an impact on trade policies.

The American Biden government has been trying to get rid of traditional trade agreements. Dai Qi said that by focusing on efficiency and low cost, these transactions allow non -agreement to provide a lot of content.

Daiqi pointed out that this is beneficial to "the stools, and they have not signed any other responsibilities and obligations in the agreement, such as labor and environmental standards."

She believes that this is good for those countries that use "unfair competition to become a production center."

Daiqi also said that the production is shifted outside the United States with efficiency and low cost, and "increasingly consolidated in an economy", just like China, this country "manipulate cost structure" and controls key industries.

Although people expect that as the state gains wealth due to trade circulation, labor standards and environmental protection will gradually rise, but there is no set up of the above situation. Dai Qi said that this system encourages countries to participate in competition by maintaining a low bid.

She said that in new trade activities such as the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" discussion, U.S. officials try to pay more attention to labor, environment and small enterprises.

According to Daiqi, redesigning the supply chain means that production can be more likely to recover from crisis and interruption. (Translator: Xu Ruicheng/Draft: Chen Yuting)

The 21 -year -old man in Massachusetts Tesyla currently faces six confidential information that deliberately reserved and transmitted confidential information related to national defense. Each charges can be sentenced to up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine of $ 250,000.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced these allegations on the 15th of this month and highlights the trust and national security of Tella's suspected leakage.

Chiristo Lei, director of the Federal Investigation Agency, said, "Personal trust protection confidential information obtained by security permits and protecting our national secrets."

Since its arrest on April 13, Tiela has been under the detention of the federal. However, the fact that the national security secrets were spread through the online chat room, which undoubtedly became a shame in the federal government, and led to the tension between the relationship between the federal government and the allies, and also caused the risk of exposing military secrets.

But shortly after that, in January 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice accused Texe La La from visiting, replicating, and publishing sensitive information, and shared this information in the "Discord" online community that he often visited with gamers.

The indictment explained that Teeira either transcribes confidential information by himself, took a record of photos and published it to the Internet.

This information includes sensitive details about Ukraine's efforts to repel Russia's comprehensive military operations in February 2022. The leaked documents are said to include the Ukrainian air defense system, the number of casualties, the latest situation of the United States aid, and the details of the Russian spy activity.

For example, some documents seem to indicate that the United States has been monitoring security officials in South Korea and put pressure on South Korean President Yin Xiyue to ask them to provide ammunition to Ukraine.

These contents have caused strong protests from Korean politicians, and some of them have accused the United States of violating their national sovereignty. Other officials questioned the authenticity of these contents and said that some records had been tampered with.

In a statement issued by U.S. Prosecutor Josya Liva on the 15th, "individuals who have been allowed to contact confidential materials will bear the basic obligations to protect the information security of the United States, active soldiers, American citizens, and their allies."

According to documents by the US Department of Justice, Tiera was reprimanded twice in September and October last year for processing confidential information.

A date labeled as a memorandum of Air Force on September 15 last year, telling how a superior officer "observed the situation of Tyera's confidential information information." When Tesbera "put his note into his pocket", the superior official asked him if he was going to tear it. They discussed the incident, and Teeira "was instructed that he would not take any form of notes."

But by the next month -a date labeled as a memorandum on October 27 shows that Terra's superior believes that he "may ignore the order on stopping in -depth investigation information information."

Since then, the 21 -year -old man's defense lawyer has pushed him to be released by his father.

However, given that Tesyra's crime is particularly significant, and his credibility is questioned, U.S. Judge David Hennsis ruled that he would not be released until he was tried until he was tried.

Henis hinted that Tiela may have the risk of escaping.

Henis said, "Foreign countries know the defendant who is not loyal to the United States." He also mentioned Tesyra's "obsessed with guns" and his remarks with conspiracy theory and threatening words on the Internet.

The release of the prosecution on the 15th is just the last day of the US government that must be formulated: the prosecutor must file a lawsuit within 30 days after Tesyra was arrested.

Recently, the British internal affairs are very lively.

Nicolasturgeon (Chief Minister of Scotland), the leader of the Scottish Independence Movement, was suddenly arrested and released innocently seven hours later. Earlier she resigned suddenly, and the reason quickly broke out -she and her husband were in a financial scandal and had to resign. This incident made Scottish independence prospects on a shadow, but for other people who opposed Scotland independence, it was good news.

If Stergin News only attracted the public for two days, then the news of Johnson's resignation last Friday, fermented daily, is still a British news leader. On Thursday, PrivilegesCommittee, the British Lower House of Lower House, finally announced the results of the investigation report on the Johnson party. The conclusion is: "On the party incident, Johnson deliberately misled the parliament."

The former Prime Minister was in this situation today. Last year, he was forced to resign from the Prime Minister. Last Friday was forced to resign from parliament members, all of which originated from one thing -the party door. During the worst period of the new crown epidemic in 2020 and 2021, Britain has made several regions and even national blockade several times. Voters strictly obey the law. The death of new crown -positive relatives cannot accompany them. Later, the Prime Minister's House had a few illegal parties. In contrast, public opinion was angry. But Johnson repeatedly denied his knowledge and argued that he was dragged into the party scene, and was later called "liar" by the media.

This causes a chain reaction. Johnson was forced to step down in July 2022 (see ["48 hours to witness Johnson's forced resignation]](https://www.ftchinese.com/story/001096618?archive)), Then the Conservative Party re -elected the party leader (that is, the new Prime Minister), and staged a historical rare scene of three prime ministers within a few months (see [Why is the Prime Minister's Prime Minister's career so short? "(https://www.ftchinese.com/story/001097632?archive)And ["Sunak becomes the first wave of Asian Prime Minister in the UK"](https://www.ftchinese.com/story/001097659?archive)), Also pushed the British economy into a trough.

British Prime Minister illegal, the degree of investigation is almost unprecedented. The House of Lower House appointed the Privilege Committee to investigate the party incident, with a total of seven people in the committee, four of which were Johnson's colleagues. The independence of British politicians was also surprising. The four conservative members did not favor the former party leader. He came to the party's inference that "the party incident and Johnson deliberately misled the parliament."

The report was given Johnson in advance on Friday. On the same day, Johnson announced his resignation of members of Congress. Not only him, his two hardcore conservatives also resigned. This means that the three people's constituencies must be made up, which increases the pressure of the Conservative Party: Can the Conservative Party still get the support of voters and keep these three seats? Every time a seat is lost, it means the reduction of the conservative party image.

The following is the contents of Johnson's resignation letter last Friday: "I received a letter from the Privilege Committee, which clearly stated -what surprised me -they are determined to use my litigation procedure to drive me out of the parliament. They are still I did not take out a slightest evidence to prove that I deliberately or recklessly misleading the House of Commons. I have been a member since 2001. I have taken my responsibility seriously. I did not lie. I believe the committee also understands this. Selecting intentionally ignoring the truth, because from the beginning, their purpose was not to discover the truth, or to truly understand my thoughts when I spoke in the house. Their purpose was to determine that I was guilty from the beginning and regardless of the facts. This is the kangaroos. The definition of court. Most members of the committee -especially the chairman -before they saw the evidence, they had expressed deep prejudice against my crimes. They should have avoided it. Now I think of it, I thought at the time, I thought at the time that I thought at the time that I thought at the time that I thought at the time. These procedures may have a little useful or fairness, which is a manifestation of innocence and trust. But I am determined to believe in this system, believe in justice, and rehabilitate the truth I know. It is the same belief in our system fairness, which has caused me to entrust Su • Gray wrote a survey report (Note: Gray's report states that during the blockade of the new crown epidemic, Johnson's Tangning Street Office's leadership was inadequate and caused illegal gatherings to prevail). Obviously, my confidence is misplaced. Of course, the Labor Party, the Liberal Democratic Party and The Scottish National Party drives me out of the parliament at all costs, which is very suitable for them. Sadly, as we saw in July last year, some Conservative MPs also held this view. Not only me of me one. People think that a witch hunting operation is ongoing to retaliate against Brexit and finally reverse the results of the referendum in 2016. Canceling my position is the necessary first step, and I believe someone has been trying to achieve this goal. I'm afraid I am afraid of me. I no longer believe that Su Gray is now the leader of the Labor Party leader. It is any coincidence. I am very proud of all the achievements I have achieved during my time as the Prime Minister: I completed the Brexit and won the largest major support for 40 years. Realized the fastest vaccination of any major European country and led global support for Ukraine. It is very sad to leave the parliament -at least now -but the most important thing is that I feel confused and shocked. I can be hosted and managed by a committee and management of Harriet Harriet Harrman (Note: Labor Party Councilor, Chairman of the Privilege Committee), and this committee has such a bad prejudice. "This committee has such a bad prejudice.

At that time, public opinion believed that Johnson suddenly resigned because when he discovered the conclusion of the Privilege Commission, and to revoke him for ten days, he chose to resign quickly to avoid the scandal that was revoked, the so -called stop loss.

At the same time as this happened, another strange smell appeared. In the list of 16 new House members nominated by Johnson, eight were rejected by the House of Lords, including Johnson's father (before Johnson had sent his brother to the House of House). Is this related to the current Prime Minister Sonak? Xiangfu said no. Recently, the British media has played the same shot of Sunak and Johnson from time to time. At that time, a newcomer of Sunak became a wealth of wealth and respectfully became the deputy of Prime Minister Johnson. Johnson promoted Sunak's indisputable facts. In order to enter the Mansion, Sunak betrayed Johnson to betray Johnson.

On Monday, Sonak, who had been silent, suddenly spoke: "Johnson asked me to do something I didn't have to do (that is, overthrowing the appointment committee of the House of Lose House to veto the decision of the eight Johnson nominated). I think this is wrong. Not ready to do this. As I said, I think this is wrong. "Johnson quickly accused Sunak" Talking Rubbish ". Until now, the two have not continued to fight.Johnson, who has withdrawn from Congress, said the report concluded "a long -lasting political assassination."

Next Monday, the British House of Commons will vote on the party report. The British internal affairs turmoil caused by Johnson is probably just beginning. In the past, some media said that Johnson was Trump in the UK, and I have always felt too much. But recently, Johnson's words and deeds have indeed Trump's style (reportedly dining with Trump in the United States a few weeks ago), and used the words of confrontation with parliament to attract the voters who support themselves. The division within British society. Because he is such a complex, clever, changing, and even cunning figure, he has made it out of charge, but he has contributed very much. It is difficult for voters to use the party to judge his love for him.

Johnson himself has hinted that he will return to the political circle every day, but will the future British politics still have his own place?

# "Beautiful Mind Cross": Trump's "Love Box"?

Description: Trump has been used to collect newspapers and documents for a long time, and puts them into the box with him, which seems to give him a sense of security. However, he tried to treat government confidential documents as his own, and his obsession with the filed box now made him face serious legal risks. Doug Mills/The New York Times President Trump's attachment to the things in the box made him face serious legal risks.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-16T05-01-09-08-00/15dc-boxes-01-gvkh-master1050.jpg)In the past few years when President Trump entered the White House, he almost had to bring a box full of documents and fragmented items in the past few years.

"Beautiful Soul" is a book about John Nash, which is made into a movie of the same name. Nash is a schizophrenic mathematician who is played by Russell Crowe in the film. He was filled with a newspaper in the office, thinking that there was a Russian password he needed to crack.

The word has a specific connotation. The assistants used it to summarize a organized chaos that Trump insisted on. He collected and transported a large number of newspapers and official documents to bring them around, which seemed to give him a sense of security.

A former White House official who asked for anonymous description situation said that although these materials were chaotic, if anyone had read it or arranged in a specific way, Trump would notice it. This person said that this is "his way of thinking."

Things in these boxes -and Trump insisted on bringing them -now become aimed at the former president and his personal assistant, Walter Aya [38 allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/09/us/trump-indictment-document-annotated.html)Core. Prosecutors accused Trump after leaving.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/us/politics/trump-arraignment-documents.html)And the national security secrets are in danger.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-16T05-01-09-08-00/15dc-boxes-02-gvkh-master1050.jpg)A photo of Trump's indictment shows that in early 2021, he placed several boxes of documents in a bathroom in Florida Club. Justice department, viansSociateed Press

A text message quoted by the indictment reflects his strong desire to retain these materials. The prosecution is about the possibility of being transferred after being transported to his residence and a private club Maragou Manor in Florida.

When a employee asked another employee if he could transfer some of the boxes to the warehouse, the second employee (being confirmed to be Trump's former assistant Molly Michael) replied, "Wow!Okay, okay So the president specifically told Walter to put these boxes in the business center because they are his 'file'. "

The indictment stated that there was another saying in the text message in the text message.

Trump's attachment to things in the box now makes him face serious legal risks, but this seems to be in line with his long -term behavioral model.

People who have worked for Trump for many years have been working (including before he as president), saying that Trump has kept news clipping, documents and other souvenirs.

He has a table in an office on the 26th floor of Trump Building in New York, and often fills documents. He has preserved a series of letters written to him for decades, including more than 30 years of celebrities. Later, he published these letters into books, and each sold for nearly $ 100.

From the first few months of governing, Trump began to bring the documents and documents that day had been brought from the West Wing of the White House to the President's residence with a carton.

According to two people who are familiar with this approach, Trump can generally recognize something in the box faster than everyone around him. One of them said that he was very "careful" about what boxes he put in what boxes. Although the photos posted by the Ministry of Justice showed that in a storage room in the Malara song, confidential documents were scattered.

Not long after John F. Keli took over Trump's staff in July 2017, Kelly and other assistants began to worry. Some of these documents may be the presidential record, and it may be lost if it is kept in the residence. They strive to make Trump realize that the whereabouts of these documents need to be tracked, but he is not very interested in it, those people say.

The assistants began to screen the files in the box and looked for the presidential record, but Trump still had a way to bring some documents back to the residence. There are more and more boxes.

When you need to travel, he will point to some boxes and say that he will bring these aircraft No. 1 and refuse to bring other. He seems to know what he chose the box, the two officials said.

According to a briefing on Trump's relevant behavior, this has not changed after he left the White House. He knew the contents of the boxes around him. The helping hands will persuade him to reduce the number of documents he carry. Another person who knows Trump's habit says that in the past two years, whenever a box is full, his assistant will put the box into the warehouse and then give him a new box.

The photos included in the indictment detailed how Trump accumulated dozens of boxes. The box was piled on a stage of Miala, plugged into the storage room, and even piled in the bathroom, and some were placed behind the shower curtain.

At his New Jersey's Bedminster Club in New Jersey on Tuesday night, Trump, who just went to a Miami court a few hours ago, insisted that the boxes insisted on hundreds of supporters that the boxes were "newspapers, media cuts" and newspaper, and newspapers and media newspapers. "Thousands of White House photos", as well as "clothes, souvenirs, etc.".

"I have no time to go all the things in the box," Trump said. "It was a very time -consuming difficulty, and it took a long time. I planned to do it, but I was a busy person."

According to the prosecutor, the so -called Trump did not know what he did not match the fact because he was too busy.

The indictment stated that as early as January 2021, after trying to obstruct the transfer of the transfer to Biden, Trump was preparing for leaving the office, and he and the White House staff, including Naita, packed the materials. "This process has the participation of Trump himself," the indictment said.

He brought a few boxes twice after his output for review -one was at the end of 2021. At that time, the National Archives asked him to return the documents taken away from the White House. The subpoena of the group requested to return all the confidential documents he mastered -it shows that he knows the content of the box. According to several people familiar with the matter, Trump repeatedly told the consultant that these file boxes were "mine".

Everyone who heard the financial background of the financial background establishes a collection or opening of an art foundation, it is difficult to make people not link it to speculative, tax avoidance, etc., and the collection list -like collection lists also make many pure collectors snoring. Before having the opportunity to learn more about the French financial leader and the founder of the Kalmne Foundation Edouardcarmignac, many people kept his preconceived judgment, but the facts were not exactly the case.

As the founder of the famous French Investment Fund Carmignac Gestion, EdouardCarmignac is similar to many financial giants and a large number of blue -chip -level art works collected by the foundation. The romantic feelings of serving Maxernst's works and laughing for Bo Bei made me feel that the collection story of the colleagues who were named Artnews "TOP 200 Collectors" may be a bit different.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T05-28-22-00-00/000184514_piclink.jpeg)© FoundationCarMignac - Photo Camille Moirenc![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T05-28-22-00-00/000184515_piclink.jpeg)C FondationCarmignac - Photo Camille Moirenc

Not long ago, I went to Porquerolles, South French, to visit Villa Carmignac. This is the Foundation Exhibition Hall, which was officially opened to the public in 2018 after the CARMIGNACFOUNDATION founded CARMIGNACFOUNDATION in the millennium. There, the current director of the foundation, the son of Edouard, Charlescarmignac, shared many anecdotes of his father and his own collection.

Charles tells me that the first collection in his father's life is not actually the Alice in Wonderland of Max Ernst(ascene)Instead, the mother's copy. At that time, parents still lived in New York, and Edouard had not gained such wealth today. He fell in love with an expensive painting, so his mother spent several weeks to copy every detail of the work, and it became the first "treasure" full of memories.

Although Edouard has gained the blue chip of the master, unlike many collectors' collection of collection on the shopping list, Edouard has compared its own collection as "compulsion" in the interview. The life encounters he experienced and the relationship between emotional connections have a constant relationship. When he was young, he once wanted to be a rock star, but entered the financial industry after completing the MBA school of Columbia University. After understanding his life story, it is not difficult to find that he is not completely speculative in art selection, but is emotional.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T05-28-22-00-00/000184523_piclink.jpeg)RoyLichtenstein, Landscape, 1977 Oil and Magna on Canvas-40 In.x60 In.

For example, the preferences revealed in his collection of Pop art stems from the emotional retention when he was young -Popart was born in the age of his growth and is a genre that he can resonate and empathy. Edouard, who lives in New York in the 1980s, often lingered in the AndyWarhol factory, and became friends with artists who gathered carnival there at that time. In 1984, Edouard met Basquiat through this circle and became a friend. CarmignacFoundation's first and most important collection is the Basquiat name Zing's work. The "C" logo in the painting also inspired the company's logo design when Edouard founded Carmignacgetion.

The collection of many collectors is actually the accumulation of "chance of life" -meeting with an artist or "enlightenment" of a certain art genre because of an experience. However, people who are rich and urgent often have a lot of "wealth" with many "wealth" above money, such as the time they pay for the person who loves or the moment of unexpected experience. If you have less travel in the collection and the perception and surprise you have obtained with people and things, you will have less appreciation and understanding of the "perspective of others", so that the collection is lacking romantic, and the trading artworks are converted into pure speculation. The process of interaction between collectors and art has lost the power of life.

At the same time, he also admitted that he would be driven and encouraged by emotional power like his father. Charles believes that art has the power to change people's hearts is related to his own experience. Many years ago, he traveled to Tomoshima, Japan, where he saw the work of Japanese artist Reinaiito -a giant cement wall. CHARLES observed the trend of water droplets and interaction with the elements of the surrounding objects. Recalling a woman who once loved, it is difficult to use words to describe the kind of sudden perception and the love that had been renamed. After returning to France, he took the initiative to contact the old person and re -opened with her a period of time. relation.A piece of art or an exhibition can change the relationship between people and people, and it can also change the relationship between people and things. Charles mentioned that Jean-Mariegallais, the current curator of Pinault collections, has planned a exhibition called Painting THENIGHT in Centre Pompidou-Metz. This exhibition has changed his relationship with the night. After watching the exhibition, he dared to do it. TheInner Island presented on the island by the Carmignac Foundation is planned by the same curator. This exhibition includes Peter Doig, Kiki Smith, Auguste Rodin, RoyLichterstein, Andrew Cranston, Francisupritcc Works of different media artists such as Hard. Start with the island as the beginning and the end of the island. I hope that through an exhibition adapted to local conditions, the public will rethink the awareness of a spiritual space such as the island and the relationship between itself and the island.

Sometimes, the chance of life needs to wait. Villa Carmignac was originally a farmhouse and appeared in the film "Madman Pilo" by the French new wave director Jean-Lucgodard. After being bought by architect Henrividal in the 1980s, he was repaired into a villa. Edouard came here for the first time when Edouard was invited to attend Vidal's daughter's wedding for the first time. He sincerely loved and expressed his acquisition of Porquern, a villa on Porqueolles, and villas above the hills. A few years later, Vidal died, and his daughter specially contacted Edouard to confirm the willingness to buy, which was now Villacarmignac. Charles said that this incident made his father remember and moved for a long time, and this fate also found the foundation for the continuation of the context of the foundation.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T05-28-22-00-00/000184516_piclink.jpeg)C FondationCarmignac - Photo Camille Moirenc

Taste is an accumulated wealth accumulated. Many clever encounters in life are indeed or changed or affecting the shaping of aesthetics. Charles' personal growth experience is different from his father, so he makes him more fond of conceptual art. For example, in his personal collection, there is a work of Benoîtpype called Millennium Hourglass. The special asphalt material in the hourglass allows it to complete it after thousands of years. Leak; there is also a work created by Charbel-Joseph H.Boutros Night Enclosed in Marble: A white marble box that intends to wrap the night of the Lebanese night.

Since Charles officially started to take care of the work of the Art Foundation, the father and son have often discussed and exchanged ideas, and the content of the tendency is not consistent, "after all, we are not cloned people," said Charles. Father Edouard pays more attention to the visual and instant intuitive feelings brought by the work itself. It does not need to be explained by the work. However, Charles said that his father would actually be attracted by conceptual works of art, but he was stubborn without admitting.

Charles, who inherits his father's character, chose a different path, and his identity is far more diverse than his father: he is a musician of the rock band Moriarty, a journalist, an entrepreneur, and an entrepreneur. He is a riddle writer and the current director of the Art Foundation. Cross -domain professional background allows him to constantly produce new inspiration and unintentional ways when he is actual operation foundation. For example, more than ten years of music career determines that Charles is good at operating, but also a very good listener; the entrepreneurial experience of the newspaper and the experience of working in the news industry gives him a wide range of resources and work with different types of people. And provide the ability of a global perspective. More importantly, these experiences let Charles pay attention to promoting art and presentation exhibitions in a "storytelling" way.

Due to the attention of the news industry and the keen insight into political current affairs, the Foundation specially opened a special branch project except the exhibition in 2009 -CARMIGNAC PhotojournalISMAWARD to support news photography reporters' long -term reports.

Charles talks about his biggest challenge facing the career of the reporter. The lack of funds and local resources.

Villacarmignac has a unique geographical location -to go to this island, you need to cross the ocean to cross the Mediterranean; you must walk along the mountain road for 15 minutes before coming to the exhibition hall. On the island, I immediately committed allergies for pollen, but I was deeply intoxicated by the beauty of the natural ecology that did not add powder. Here, visitors can feel more clearly that people are coexisting with other life forms. Villacarmignac keeps the local original scenery and the characteristics of the vein as much as possible, and has not exaggeratedly reconstructed. All the exhibition space follows the island and simple and effective design principles. It adopts museum -level standards and is cleverly combined with the surrounding landscapes to provide the best display conditions for the works.

Since its opening in 18 years, Villa Carmignac is committed to the development of the development of the local institution, and in 2020, with the Port-CROS National Park and Villanoailles jointly created the Pleinsud network participated in the southern French art community to respond to the regional environment and sanitation crisis.

For almost a week in the past, China and South Korea relations have continued. Because the Chinese ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming and the largest opposition party leader in South Korea explained the relevant diplomatic positions of China, leading the current Korean government from President Yin Xiyue, Foreign Minister and Senior Foreign Minister, to South Korean Guoan officials and the ruling party, Congress, Congress, Congress, Congress Members, almost strictly criticized China. In view of the huge dependence on the Chinese market and raw materials in South Korea, and the huge security issues caused by the Nuclear Nuclear to South Korea, all the reasons have caused a problem, that is, where is the way out of South Korean diplomacy?

From the perspective of the author, in terms of factors such as South Korea's geopolitical environment and its comprehensive strength, leaving the word balance, South Korean diplomacy will never go out.

** Korean diplomacy cannot leave balance **

No matter how radical South Korea is today, the following basic facts are the fate that South Korea cannot get rid of. These facts determine: Once South Korean diplomacy leaves a balance, it will become the vassal of other countries and can never be independent of the forest of the world. These basic facts are: the harsh and geographical environment of North Korea and North Korea surrounded by the big nations; the extreme limitedness of its own resources and extremely narrow in the market; The fatal cognitive division of the government and the people caused by a foreign forces.

From the perspective of the geographical environment, the Korean Peninsula is surrounded by large powers, mainly China, Japan, and Russia, which are surrounded by the Three Kingdoms, but its geographical location is very important. At that time, it was a must -see channel for Japan to enter the land of Eurasia. In ancient times, the Korean Peninsula was mainly protected by the feudal dynasty in the Korean Peninsula, and China also warned Japan for this land. Since modern times, China, Japan, and Russia and Japan have also had a war to fight for this land. In the end, Japan won, incorporated the Peninsula into the Japanese territory, and began a 50 -year colonial for the Korean Peninsula. And due to the weakness of its own comprehensive strength and the serious lack of experience in modern governance, in this millennium history that has been conquered and ruled, the dynasty of the Korean Peninsula has formed a way of survival that has a profound impact on today and even in the future. The dependent diplomacy is dependent on a large country to maintain survival. Whenever the surrounding country around the peninsula game, wait and see first. When the victory is approaching, he does not hesitate to fall to the side of the winner. As a result, for South Korea, at least in modern times, there is no real independent diplomacy. Therefore, South Korea must get rid of the attachment to a single country and implement a true balanced diplomacy, otherwise it will never be truly independent, otherwise even the development and growth of its own national economy will be a big problem.

On the contrary, North Korea in the north has formed its own national sense of independence and a whole set of ideological systems, and has educated several generations of nationals. And under this guidance, North Korea has held up international pressure and developed its independent nuclear guidance, while South Korea rely entirely on the US nuclear protection. Under one nation and two opposition ideas, the two sides regard each other as their enemies, and South Korea is facing a very harsh external security environment.

Therefore, South Korea's only way out of its own harsh geographical environment is to implement truly balanced diplomacy with other countries. Only by balance can it be safe and ultimately independent.

Third, as far as the Korean economy is concerned, globalization and trade are the lifeline of South Korea's economic development. From this alone, South Korea must also implement balanced diplomacy.

South Korea's land area is narrow and lack of resources, and the domestic market cannot meet the needs of the huge economic development of the Korean economy at all. In particular, it is worth mentioning that, except for foreign sales and investment markets, the core raw materials of key industries in South Korea have almost no one to produce themselves, and they need to be imported to meet the needs. It is controlled and not independent. And balanced diplomacy is precisely the good recipe for resolving this pair of contradictions, because this is necessary for globalization and trade.

In the end, Korean politics and the public have cognitive division on the major directional issues involving their own countries. Anyone who is a little familiar with South Korea knows that Korean politics and the public are completely divided into cognition of their own country's directional issues, especially the cognitive issues of several key neighbor countries in South Korea, such as North Korea, China, the United States With Japan and so on, the entire country is in a state of cognitive division, and there are pro -beauty, pro -dynasty, and even pro -Japanese in political parties and political figures. This is the historical result of South Korea's long -term attachment to different countries. As a result of this status quo, South Korea will always become the use of objects and vassals of a large country, and changing a president will change to a large country. In this way, South Korea will always fall into a periodic turbulence on its major directional issue, and finally cause its country and nation to fall into a state of instability for a long time. All this can only be solved by implementing balanced diplomacy.

Therefore, the core of the future of South Korea is the balance of diplomacy, that is, a effective diplomatic balance is implemented between different ideological countries and between large powers. After doing this, you can be stable, safe and developed, and can become the so -called "center" of Korean dreams. This prospect should be similar to a country like Switzerland, that is, a neutral and uninhabited independent country. That's not so, don't say independence, even South Korea's national security is a problem.

** Bian selection standing team is a nightmare **

According to the historical experience of South Korea since the end of the 19th century, if South Korea implements diplomacy at the edge -selection station, it will be a dream of South Korea, especially today.

South Korea once resolutely abandoned the Qing Dynasty in China and selected the side to stand in Japan. As a result, the land was annexed and the entire country was destroyed. Later, the selection of the side team in the United States, the country was frequently insulted, so that today, South Korean diplomacy has been restrained by the United States. The complete independent sovereignty state has become a controversial issue.

But this is not the trend of history after all. Since the South Korean economy has begun to take off and the country has begun democratization, South Korea's dependent diplomacy cannot adapt to the psychological development of the Korean people. So people see that the history of the outsider of Korean people is manifested regularly: consistent against Japan; democratization is anti -United States; now anti -China is anti -China. However, this country rely on foreign trade to establish a country. In addition, it is constantly revenge, and it is destined that there is no future.

As far as the China -South Korea storm is concerned, the background introduced by the authorities of China and South Korea to the author is: Before the Chinese Ambassador met with the South Korean opposition party leader Li Ming, when the United Nations discussed the North Korean nuclear issue, China and Russia voted again: At the same time, South Korea was elected as another election as a selection as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selected as a selection of it. The Security Council is very important to the country, which seems to have given South Korea confidence. Another background is that South Korean President Yin Xiyue blatantly expressed the issue of Taiwan as a "international issue" recently, which deeply affected China's views on South Korea and even Yin Xiyue.

As far as China is concerned, its Korean Peninsula policy may indeed be improved. South Korea can negotiate with China, but all this should not lead to today's incident. This is actually a public selection team.However, South Korean sources revealed to the author: South Korea is not ready for China and South Korea. The only future in South Korea is that like Switzerland that year, it has become a neutral, non -alliance country, and uses the global economic wave to develop itself, contribute to the world, and make themselves stand in the forest of the world.

For the first time, the European Commission communicated with Huawei and ZTE as a telecommunications supplier that constitutes a higher risk for the security of the European Union, and announced that it would no longer adopt services that rely on these two Chinese telecommunications companies.

Agence France -Presse reported that the European Commission issued a statement on Thursday (June 15) saying: "We believe that, compared with other 5G suppliers, Huawei and ZTE are essentially higher risks."

The statement said that the European Commission "will take relevant security measures to avoid purchasing new connection services to relying on these two suppliers' equipment."

The European Union's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, called on 27 member states and telecommunications operators to exclude Huawei and ZTE equipment outside their mobile network.

Bullerdong said at the Prucele's press conference: "We cannot continue to rely on equipment that may become 'weapons' and attack EU interests. For our common security, such a fatal weakness is too risky."

According to Bloomberg, in order to stop the key infrastructure, Chinese equipment was adopted, and the European Commission issued a new set of guidelines on Thursday, urging EU member states to gradually eliminate high -risk suppliers in the telecommunications network. The EU Commission's corporate communication system has also been banned from adopting Huawei and ZTE equipment.

The European Commission said that about 24 EU member states have developed rules or are laying a foundation in order to give the authorities to set up limited power in this regard.

However, Breya does not name it that only 10 member states use these specifications to restrict or eliminate high -risk sellers. "This speed is too slow, constitutes a major security risk, which makes the EU collectively exposure to risks."

The European Commission introduced strict 5G specifications three years ago, and no supplier or named Huawei was disclosed at the time. The statement on Thursday represents the EU's increasingly tough route in terms of policies for China, but at the same time still maintains relations with Beijing.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T07-22-23-00-00/000184012_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

Recently, the movie "Little Mermaid" starring American singer and actor Halle Bailey has gained a good box office after its release. According to the data of Box Officemojo, the film's total global box office is currently US $ 425 million, ranking fifth in the movie that has been released in 2023, and is expected to maintain the top ten in the year. The production cost of this film is revealed that it is $ 250 million. The usual experience is that the box office of such scale movies must reach twice the production cost to achieve balance of revenue and expenditure. If the film finally reaches about 500 million US dollars in the global box office, it can be roughly estimated to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. The so -called box office failure or even collapse is too.

The film is bleak in China's box office (South Korea and Japan are not ideal), and it is far lower than that of the same type of Disney movies in China, which has also aroused controversy on racial discrimination on the Internet. Some netizens said that they were not the skin tone of discrimination, but they were not satisfied with their appearance, or they believed that their appearance did not meet the Chinese aesthetic standards. However, no matter how the two sides argue, the many irony and negative evaluations of the netizens are indeed aimed at the skin color and ethnic identity of the starring actors, such as "black fish", "marine pollution", "Qing Daofu" and so on. Although it is the freedom of watching movies, it is not wrong to have warning racial discrimination on racial discrimination. It is worth noting that Disney officials have not accused racial discrimination because the film is not good in China, mainly because the international media mentioned this and believed that there were racial discrimination factor behind it. This is not a accusation for Chinese audiences, but an objective report. The content of the report is the objective racial discrimination language and trend on the Chinese network. From the principle of news reports, this approach is not wrong.

Since the selection of Bailey as the heroine, there has been a wave on the Chinese network, that is, "abnormally abnormal", as if the film's starring cast is very ridiculous, so it seems that people's watching and watching the film and Evaluation needs to be promoted around this theme. But normal audiences do not have to be limited by this recognition framework at all. If an audience is not sensitive to skin color problems, then he can treat this film as a normal Hollywood classic animation live version, experience the fun of watching movie, and the American cultural trend experience brought by the new version, such as seagulls The rap performance of scuttle (voiced by Okafifena) was included in the film. What needs to be opposed is to treat the skin color or starring candidates as the core issue of this film. In fact, the so -called "controversy" brought by Bailey's skin color is not controversial to those who are not sensitive to skin tone. For example, I saw a film review blogger on YouTube that Bailey's performance in the film was better than Emma Watson's performance in "Beauty and Beast". People are concerned about acting problems, and do not think that skin tone or appearance will affect the movie viewing experience.

Many netizens have accused Hollywood with a dark -skinned actor to play Alier. In terms of Chinese Internet buzzwords, it is the so -called "Sao operation". But from the perspective of the film's casting process, this accusation is difficult to stand. The casting of films like this scale must be a professional process, and it is impossible for a few people to say it. According to the director of the film, Rober Marshall, whether from the singing or performance, Bailey performed well during the audition, which is equivalent to setting a benchmark for all candidates. Therefore, choosing Bailey is the only logical choice. It can be seen that the scope of the casting of the film originally includes candidates with various skin tones, so a deep skin -colored actor chose the possibility range, so how can Hollywood say that Hollywood deliberately engaged in "political correctness" choice deep choice deep selection. What about the skin color actor? In an interview, Marshall also said that in this era, people will still be limited to that Elyer can only be performed by white people, which is a very "old antique" idea. From 1989 to today, the times have undergone tremendous changes. It is no longer a correct way to set up limits of actors based on racial identity. From the perspective of the final film, on the one hand, the beauty of Bailey's singing voice is unquestionable. On the other hand, she starred in her first starring, and her acting skills can be remained. And the ignorance after boarding the land and the world, all showed it lively. As for the so -called "aesthetic", the probability of Chinese audiences in daily life in daily life is lower than the United States and Western Europeans, so there may be some aesthetic differences. It is also a very normal aesthetic.

The so -called Hollywood "forcibly incorporates minority ethnic groups" and "political correctness" is originally a distorted accusation of the normal practice of the United States. The art itself has racism. The normal approach is that anyone of any race and skin tone can be considered to play the role of the movie, so as not to make the original and capable actors who are originally talented and capable because of race and skin tone. Reasonable business behavior. The extreme right -wing of the United States is not used to this normal approach, so that the casting determined through normal processes will be described as "forcibly incorporate", and the normal practice of ignoring racial factors as "political correctness" It is based on the purpose of political statement, regardless of the actual situation, but this is just a malicious thing, because it reverses the facts, that is, people of all ethnicities may show superb acting skills and become a alternative. The situation, forcibly excluding ethnic minorities is a political prejudice). If Chinese official media copies this kind of words that embezzle the extremely right -wing in the United States, it will be criticized by international mainstream media as a racist meaning, and it will not be wronged at all.

Anyone who has no prejudice to starring and ethnic groups can look at and appreciate this movie with a normal attitude. It does not have to be restricted by the right -wing recognition framework, nor is influenced by racial discrimination and hatred comments on the Internet. I have many new feelings when watching the movie. For example, the whole film shows the high curiosity of Alice and Alec about the unknown world (Eler's first lens is to watch the telescope falling into the bottom of the sea; ), Thus sublimating the love of the two to the basis of common interests to create the image of the soul partners of the two. Another example is that when Alier learned that Alex was married to Vannisa, he was sitting on the dock and crying in the cartoon, and the movie version was lying on the reef by the sea. This actually takes care of the tragedy dimension in Andersen. This reminds the audience that if Alek and Vannisa are married, Alier will be controlled by the sea witch Usula, this fate is similar to the tragic ending of the "foam" in the original Andersen, and the reefs and the waves can exactly can be exactly the waves. It reminds the audience to associate this dimension, which also responds to the words in the original Andersen's original book quoted at the beginning of the film. We can also give many similar examples. If this film is just a "political correctness" posture display, why should the producers bother to make so many exciting new settings?_ (Note: The author's mailbox is bo.liu@ftchinese.com) _

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T07-34-03-00-00/000184169_piclink.jpg)This is an intuitive attractive, but somewhat worrying argument. This argument is that the globalization of the past three decades has lowered inflation from all over the world, because cheap products imported from China have reduced the cost of buying clothing, toys and electronic products in rich countries. But the world economic division caused by geopolitics is facing all this. European Central Bank(ECB)President Christina Lagader(Christine Lagarde)In April this year, the tension between the United States and China may damage the value chain and promote the price of global consumer prices by 5%.

In fact, things are not so bad. There is no doubt that serious large -scale disorderly economic decoupling will crack down on economic growth and push up prices. However, the current situation of geopolitical tensions is unlikely to be catastrophic, and the role of globalization (especially cheaper products) inhibit inflation is not as great as people think of intuitively. What is more needed is that a deeper global structural force may push prices in the next few years or even decades.

When asked if the Russian and Ukraine War ended under these conditions, whether Putin could continue to master the regime, Kissinger's answer was "impossible."

Kissinger said that it is important that Ukraine can rise into a strong democratic country after the war, and it is best to avoid the resentment of "Russia's disintegration or Russia's decline", because this may trigger a new tension.

Bubble Mart International Group Co., Ltd.(9992.HK)More and more look at overseas, bet on consumers in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia will pay a higher premium for their fashion collection toys than Chinese consumers.

A week ago, the company announced the acquisition of its British partners(This seems to be the first time it has disclosed the acquisition), This bet spans a new milestone. Judging from the latest annual report, the company must have enough funds to make such procurement. As of the end of last year, its cash and short -term investment were about 5 billion yuan.

This overseas expansion is very important for Bubble Mart, because the mainland market, which currently accounts for most of its sales, has shown signs of rapid slowdown after years of high -speed growth. According to the latest business status of the company announced in April, its sales in Mainland China in the first quarter actually fell 5%to 10%, continuing a decline of 3.3%last year.

In contrast, Mart's overseas business has achieved three -digit growth during the three -month report period.

For retailers like Bubble Mart, the decline in sales of local markets is a particularly worrying trend, because most other retailers and consumers have reported that most of China canceled most of China at the end of last year. After epidemic prevention measures, their business increased significantly in the first quarter.

This difference may be because toys are not necessary to a large extent. It is not like household items, and demand has always existed. More importantly, Bubble Mart's toys are more targeted at adults and have high profits due to its "worthy of collection" attributes. Under the current weak economic situation in China, collectors are more likely to postpone the purchase of such things that are often regarded as hobbies.

Western countries and Southeast Asia are the two major overseas markets of Bubble Mart. They are currently relatively economical, which explains why they are attractive choices. More importantly, Western consumers usually pay more money to buy toys than consumers in the development of markets, so companies like Bubble Mate can get higher profits.

The latest global operation of Bubble Mart was announced a week ago that it announced the acquisition of mogicltd. For the latter, a blog post from the company only said that it was "good at local retail." The financial terms are not disclosed, which means that the purchase price may be less than $ 5 million(35.8 million yuan)This is most likely to be paid with sufficient cash reserve with bubble Mart.

Before the news was announced, Bubble Mart has adopted a series of similar measures on the international stage in the past year. These include the opening of the first physical store in Malaysia in May and the first store in France in February. In November last year, the company announced that it began the second branch of Australia in Melbourne.

Investors seem to be satisfied with this acquisition in the UK. On the day of the news of the news of last weekend, Matt's stock price rose 2.8%. The stock continued to rebound this week. As of the closing of Thursday, the level increased by 8.2%from the level before the announcement.

** Climbing the peak **

Although the stock price has recently risen, the recent way of bubble Mart is not flat because it faces many challenges in the Chinese mainland market, and the market accounts for 90%of its sales last year. When it was listed in 2020, it was a super star. Its stock price rose nearly doubled from the issue price of HK $ 38.5 to a high of about HK $ 100. The reason why investors like this company is not only because of its fashion toys, but also because of more traditional children's toys, its products make it profitable because of the collection value.

However, with the signs of slow slowing in sales, the stock has fallen from a high point in the past year. The closing price on Thursday was HK $ 17.7, less than half of the IPO issuance price. Nonetheless, the valuation of the stock is still slightly higher than similar enterprises. The current long -term price -earnings ratio of Bubble Mart is 20 times, leading ahead of domestic competitors famous(MNSO.US;9896.HK)19 times, and easily lead the fashionable American retailer Tajit(TGT.US)16 times.

Therefore, investors have not given up Bubble Mart, although they are not now valued at it.

Having said so much, in the end, let's take a closer look at the current status of Bubble Mart's overseas business and the possible development direction in the future. The company's history can be traced back to 2010, but it did not start to expand overseas seriously until the last two or three years.

As of the end of last year, Bubble Mart has a total of 43 stores overseas, but about half of them operate with local joint ventures and franchisees. It also sells a large number of products by automatic vending machines known as the "Robot Store". Last year, there were 120 automatic vending machines overseas. The company seems to focus on expanding overseas directly -operated stores. Last year, 21 new stores were opened to make the total number of direct -operated stores reached 28.

With the increase of the number of self -operated stores, the company's revenue from overseas retail stores soared from 3.2 million yuan in 2021 to 136 million yuan last year. According to this level, overseas retail stores accounted for about one -third of its overseas total revenue last year. Its overseas revenue last year was 454 million yuan, an increase of 163%over 2021. In the first quarter, it continued to maintain this growth, and said that the overall overseas income increase in the first three months of this year was between 160%and 165%.

As we pointed out earlier, the gross profit margin of overseas business is often higher. Last year's average gross profit margin was about 74%, and the gross profit margin of domestic business was about 60%.

In the latest annual report, Bubble Mart did not give a specific roadmap for the international development plan. It only said that global expansion is one of its business priorities. However, the latest acquisition shows that Bubble Mart is not casually said, and it may make other similar acquisitions in the short term because it tries to achieve diversification of business outside the local market.

A Federal Grand Jury in the United States has sued for six crimes [leaked the highest US military intelligence record on the Internet](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230414-1382875)The Air Force National Guard Soldier Tesyra.

Reuters reported that the US Department of Justice issued a statement on Thursday (June 15) saying that Jack Douglasteixeira, Northern Donaldon City, Massachusetts, was charged with confidential information related to transmission and defense related to defense.

The Ministry of Justice said that each unauthorized reservation and transmission of national defense information can be sentenced to up to 10 years of imprisonment, up to three years of supervision release, and a maximum fine of 250,000 US dollars (about S $ 34,236).

Terra was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency at the North Data Donesty on April 13.

Tiera joined the Air Force National Guard in 2019. It is an administrator of a network transportation system. The work includes the normal operation of ensuring the "global large communication network" of the army. Tiera held the highest level of secret information security permits awarded by the federal government. It was promoted to the first pilot in July last year and won the Air Force Achievement Medal.

According to reports, the military intelligence documents exposed online were originally reposted by a group on the community chat platform Discord, and then spread widely in Telegram and followed.

Tesbera is a junior air force. His position only needs high school education, driver's license and 18 -month -on -job training. He could contact the US military's confidential documents, making the outside world question how the United States protects intelligence materials.

This case is considered to be the worst leakage of the United States since the Vikh Decrypture and leakage incident in 2010.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-16T09-13-00-04-00/000000.png)Pictures of the United States and China National Flag Reuters [Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chengxiaon/cxn 061620230748.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chengxiaonong/cxn-06162023090748.html/@@stream)The Communist regime is accustomed to showing his tallness, never showing weakness, and of course he is unwilling to expose his shortness. However, Xi Jinping's speech recently spread widely in Chinese official media, showing his deep anxiety about the current and future difficult situation of the Chinese Communist Party. Why is Xi Jinping so worried, what major crisis has Beijing recently encountered? In fact, it was not the CCP's sudden crisis, but that the CCP recently discovered that it fell into the Sino -US Cold War trap.

** 1. "Stormy Well" makes Xi Jinping bothering **

Recently, the CCP official media reported the following news: On the afternoon of May 30th, Xi Jinping presided over the meeting of the Central National Security Council. Such a text appeared in the meeting report issued by the official media. Urgent and even a major test of stormy waves. " In a short sentence, I pointed out the state of Zhongnanhai's current state of mind. The words "extreme thinking" and "major tests to be prepared to be urgent and even stormy and even stormy" have shown that after the CCP's senior management has been judged in the tension of internal and external tensions, it is believed that the situation is not only very urgent, but also very serious. In this case, Zhongnanhai has never said it before. This is the first time that the CCP has said so for more than 70 years. It can be seen that the CCP is really worried about the future.

Zhongnanhai has always had deep concerns about the public's disclosure of the CCP's senior management. Why should Xi Jinping worry about the long -term concern of the Chinese Communist Party in the future? Obviously, Xi Jinping should have a consideration of publicity. This news is not only published in the official media of the Communist Party of China, but also "People's Daily" also cooperates with this news, which specializes in posts to emphasize the importance of the news. Why do the Chinese Communist Party expose their ugliness? The reason is not complicated. When Xi Jinping is becoming increasingly tense in the country, it will send a message to the public "difficult years are here", which clearly shows that the Chinese people need to be "prepared for difficulty."

The so -called "extreme thinking" of the CCP actually refers to "the worst situation that may occur"; the so -called "high wind and waves, even the stormy waves" is the evaluation of the degree of the worst and worst. danger. It can make Zhongnanhai say this, indicating that the Communist Party of China has judged at this moment that the domestic and international situation it faces now is very dangerous. This situation is obviously not caused by international and domestic incidents in late May, because there are no important emergencies; in fact, the international risks accumulated in more than three years have now reached the degree of anxiety of Xi Jinping's anxiety. Essence

** 2. Why does "the situation is dangerous" come from? **

Is this situation judged by the Communist Party of China in the military? Obviously not. I mentioned the article "The Chinese Navy's Short Board" published on this station on April 27. On April 13, Xi Jinping's speech in the southern theater in Zhanjiang, Guangdong showed that Practical ability. But this is not a problem that can be solved in the short term, and it is not enough to cause panic. The article published on this station on May 30, "The Communist Party of China's long -term strategy for Taiwan and the current" forced uniform "intention" also mentioned that China has determined before April this year that the force of force has not enough strength and the price is too high. The force of force will not work for a while, but the CCP's own strategy encounters setbacks, not a sudden pressure from the outside.

Is this "steep situation" facing a sudden crisis of China's relations with the United States? It is not that Biden has been seeking diplomatic dialogue with Beijing, but the CCP has been taking Joe. After the spy balloon incident between China and the United States, the Chinese Communist Party secretly asked the United States not to publish the equipment information of the spy balloon salvaged, and Biden agreed not to announce it; CCP meeting; June 18th, US Secretary of State Brosky, will visit Beijing. Therefore, between the United States and China, Biden has always opened the door of diplomatic dialogue, but Beijing hesitated. This state of diplomatic relations is obviously not a crisis.

Is it that the US chip sanctions have caused serious economic difficulties in China? Yes, not. China has been a large -scale theft of smart property in the United States for more than two decades. It was not until President Trump did not begin to cause the United States to vigilance and prevention. After last year, the US chip bill came into effect, which had an important impact on China's chip imports. The total value of China's chip imports in the first four months of this year fell by a quarter. In the past few years, the CCP has invested huge funds and hopes to achieve the upgrade of the chip industry. As a result, it has ended in failure. Now China introduces chip manufacturing equipment or introduced large foreign chip companies to implement technical cooperation, which has been blocked by the United States.

Wei Shaojun, chairman of the IC Design Branch of the China Semiconductor Industry Association and professor of the School of Integrated Circuit, Beijing Tsinghua University, said in a speech at the end of last year that China has reached the era of chip "passive localization replacement". The evaluation of Szehong, the managing director of Huaxing Capital, China, is that China's semiconductor industry "basically returns to the Stone Age." However, the US chip bill came into effect last year, and all the oscillations appeared last year. Therefore, chip sanctions in the United States are not a sudden crisis in China's relations with the United States.

** Three, the Cold War pattern of China and the United States is fixed: the root of the "stormy waves" **

What is Xi Jinping anxious? The analysis of the author is that he has fallen into a trap of a dictator rule and facing a comprehensive crisis, and this trap is the formal and comprehensively entered the track of the Cold War; when this track, the Soviet Union is the lesson of the car, and the CCP Can't find a way to crawl out of the trap.

Xi Jin Plain thought that he could rush all the way on the road to implementing foreign hegemony, forcing the United States to make a "rise"; but this approach actually extended the Cold War -style confrontation between China and the United States to diplomacy and High -tech levels; once China and the United States confrontation is locked to the high -tech level, the Cold War between China and the United States is finally shaped into a standard comprehensive Cold War, and the CCP cannot withdraw from it.

It can be said that this trap that Xi Jinping fell in was actually dug out by himself. He is now comprehensively evaluating the international and domestic situation facing the Communist Party of China, and found that the CCP has entered a state of "the worst situation may occur." This state is the "high wind and waves, even stormy waves" he said at the National Security Conference.

If there is any important international conference recently, that is, the summit held by the G7 on the Hiroshima of Japan on May 20th, in addition to warning the "military activities" of China in the South China Sea, the summit reiterates the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It is also emphasized to pay attention to the strong toughness and economic security of the economy. In order to express dissatisfaction with this, the CCP announced on the night of the Hiroshima Summit that it sanited the US memory chip large factory Micron. Only about 10%of Micron's revenue comes from China, and the CCP's sanctions have a limited blow, but it is a signal that the CCP launchs a high -tech confrontation between China and the United States.From the level of chip war alone, in fact, it is impossible to understand that Xi Jinping's Cold War trap that Xi Jinping fell. Only from the perspective of extending from a military level to a high -tech level from Sino -U.S.

** 4. The Second Cold War on the earth **

The Cold War between the Communist Party and the Western countries headed by the United States, the Cold War of China and the United States was the second game; the first Cold War was the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union for more than 40 years. The red power in the Cold War is all forced, and no one forced it to launch the Cold War. Judging from the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union and the Cold War of the Sino -US and the United States, before the start of the Cold War, the red power was a beneficiary of a large number of economic and technological aid in the United States. From the perspective of simple economic and technological development, why is the red war launched the Cold War under such a favorable situation?

The outbreak of the Cold War originated from the Red Power suddenly challenging the United States military, trying to shake its existing international order. In 1948, the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union was suddenly armed to block West Berlin, which belonged to West Germany, trying to force the Alliance's garrison to withdraw from West Berlin. The U.S. military had to use a large number of transport aircraft to transport 4,500 tons of coal, food and daily necessities for citizens of West Berlin every day (see I published in this station on January 24, 2022, "Why is Taiwan regarded as a new West Berlin?" The cause of the Cold War between China and the United States is that in early 2000, the CPC Navy fleet suddenly went to the Midway Island Sea in early 2000, claiming that "Sword refers to Pearl Harbor" (see I published on February 28, 2020 on the article "The Chinese Navy's Sword Refers to Pearls. Hong Kong, what does it mean? ").

Every time facing the military provocation of the big country, the United States tries to communicate in the diplomatic field to reduce the tension between the two sides. From then on, diplomatic negotiations have always penetrated the entire Cold War process, which can prevent the outbreak of serious military conflicts, but it cannot reduce the level of the Cold War. On the contrary, the Red Congress continues to expand the army to prepare for the military strength. The United States also has to expand its army to prepare for war. After entering the stage of the two sides to expand the army, whoever has the advantage of the two sides depends on who leads the military reserve competition. The leading technology is the prerequisite for maintaining military advantages. Therefore, the expansion of the army's preparation morning and evening will involve how the United States with technological advantages implements high -tech blockade on a large red country. If the red power in the Cold War can continue to obtain Western technology and components needed from the United States to expand the army, then Western countries will lose under the military threat of the red power. Of course, the red power has always been copied or imitated the Western technology equipment, and he rarely develops high -tech technologies worthy of the use of Western countries. To this end, the red country thinks about how to steal Western technology all day to "curve overtaking".

In this way, after the emergence of the United States from the Cold War, it is bound to strengthen anti -spy work to prevent red powers from stealing technical secrets from the United States, and at the same time blocking the most advanced military technology to the red power. In the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union, the United States first arrested the Soviet spy among the US nuclear scientists, cutting off the Soviet Union's stealing pipelines of the US nuclear weapons; and later prohibited from exporting to help the Soviet nuclear submarine reduce the noise machine tools of propellers, sanctioning the intentional violation of this ban that intentionally violated this ban. Toshiba, Japan. In the Cold War of China and the United States, the United States also first crack down on the CCP's "Thousand Talents Plan" to theft of American technical secrets, and then prohibits exporting high -end chips.

** Five, why do you have to play the Cold War? **

**** The Red Power insists on challenging the United States for two reasons. First, the Communist Party has determined that its authoritarian regime has the advantage of defeating Western free and democratic countries. Some decision makers in the United States have also mistakenly believe this. Carter's national security adviser Bu -Rezuski wrote in the memo of the White House in December 1979, "Compared to the United States, the decisive action of the Soviets is clear goals. … Maybe they can achieve their goals with their own results. In international affairs, nothing is more important than the actual results, which does not depend on moral concepts. " In the end, the ending of the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union proved that the Buenjetki was completely wrong, and the Soviet system was precisely the main reason for the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Today, Xi Jinping's "China's rise" theory has completely copied the superior theory of the Soviet Union's communist system. And Wall Street now also believes that the CCP's authoritarian regime is efficient.

Second, the Communist regime mistakenly underestimates the institutional potential of the United States. The CPPCC had believed in a long time that the inflation and cyclical economic stagnation in the United States would become a long -term trend and eventually reduce the economic strength of the United States. Suslov, the ideological director of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, said that "the United States is in a crisis of inductance caused by its own system." Xi Jinping's "East Shengxi Realm theory" a few years ago was the same as Suslov's meaning.

But in the end, history proved that the wishful thinking of the Soviet decision maker has led the Soviet Union to rush all the way on the road of the Cold War. It was not the United States, but the Soviet Union that really fell into inflation and economic stagnation. In this way, the Soviet Communist Party was buried in the Soviet Union. There are various problems in the United States, but American companies relied on the free economy. During the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union, it always maintained the leading momentum of scientific and technological innovation. The United States far surpassed the Soviet Union in terms of economy. The red regime that eventually failed.

Because the CCP's think tank is timid and incompetent, he dare not say to Xi Jinping's words against the ears. Therefore, after Xi Jinping provoked the Cold War of the Sino -US Cold War in the past few years, he actually repeated the standard operation of the Soviet Union in the Cold War of the Soviet Union, but Xi Jinping was I can't recognize the mystery. Until the recent comprehensive crisis appeared, Xi Jinping seemed to find that the overall situation was not good; but it was too late, the CCP could no longer reverse the process of the Cold War. Xi Jinping fell into the cold war trap that he dug himself, and he couldn't climb out.

** Six or two cold warfares **

Comparing the opening of the two Cold War with the path, it can be found that three points are found: First, the red power of the red power of the United States and the Soviet Union and the Cold War of the Sino -US Cold War are very similar. Third, the process of the Cold War reached the stage of blocking the high -end technology in the West, and it entered the fixation of the Cold War pattern. It can be said that the red power of the red war has been found in the Cold War trap, but it is also inevitable. At the same time, the red country has never hopes to win in the Cold War. The main reason is that under the Communist Party system, there is no way to surpass technological development to surpass technological development. Western countries.

The main difference between the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union and the Cold War of the China and the United States is that due to Xi Jinping's blind restlessness, the Sino -US Cold War process is much faster than the US -Soviet Cold War. From the beginning to the end of the US -Soviet Cold War, it has been dragged for more than 40 years; and the Cold War of China and the United States has only been in 2000. It has only been three years since it has entered the stage of high -tech blockade in China. From this feature, the process of the Cold War between China and the United States and the end of the end may not require more than 40 years in the Cold War of the United States and the Soviet Union, but it is also impossible to end in three or five years.

Can Xi Jinping now actively stop military threats to the United States? It is actually impossible because the Cold War is irreversible. The Cold War is not like the car on the flat crossing, which can turn around; the Cold War is a car on a closed high -speed road forever, which can drive faster or slower, but there is no place to turn around because there is no exit. Why can't the cold war pattern be fixed? It is determined by the nature of the Communist Party. The ideology of the Communist Party and its system are the lifeblood of the Communist Party. This ideology and system are like the guardrails on both sides of the highway, which has blocked the Communist regime on this road.(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator)

Therefore, China officially calls the unemployment rate of urban investigation.

At the same time, in May, [the recovery of the world's second largest economy after the end of the new crown epidemic has slowed down again](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/躺平还是润中国年轻人面对严酷就业现实/a-65879593)Essence Chinese official data shows that industrial production increased by 3.5%in May and 5.6%last month. The factory is gradually restoring all the capacity.

Economic recovery has also been traditionally constrained by the traditional real estate market. After many years of continuous growth, the Chinese real estate market has continued to weaken. Experts say there are real estate bubbles. From the beginning of the year to May, the investment in the real estate market has decreased by 7.2%, and the decrease is greater than expected.

In addition, the consumption atmosphere is not ideal. The retail industry increased by 12.7%year -on -year and 18.4%in April. This is the main index of private consumption behavior. The weak domestic demand, coupled with the almost zero inflation, slows down the progress of economic recovery.

In terms of foreign trade, it is affected by the weak world economy and the adverse inflation in Europe and the United States. Zhang Zhiwei, president of Baoyin Investment, said on Thursday that all data unanimously showed weakening economic power.

The People's Bank of China tries to stimulate the economy through a more relaxed monetary policy: reducing the interest rate of medium -term loan and injection of 237 billion yuan (about 30.6 billion euros). These external measures are designed to reduce the financing costs of commercial banks and encourage them to issue more loans at more preferential conditions. On Tuesday, the central bank had unexpectedly lowered short -term loan interest rates.

Julian Evans-Pritchard, a macro financial analyst, did not think that these measures could achieve great results. However, these measures still show "[political decision makers' concerns in China's economic recovery continuously increased](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/降薪招致抗议中央抓就业中国经济的艰难日子来了/a-65606559)"

Xi Jinping and Gates' last meeting was during the Boao Forum in 2015. In early 2020, Xi Jinping trusted Gates and thanked him and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for providing assistance to China, which also included providing $ 5 million for China to fight against the new crown epidemic.

### Brinkean is about to visit China

Reuters pointed out that with the intensification of Sino -US tensions and China's emphasis on national security, foreign companies have become more cautious about the Chinese market.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin announced on Wednesday that it is agreed by China and the United States, [US Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeit will visit China from June 18th to 19th](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯訪華在即-美不期望雙邊關係突破/a-65917669)Essence

This will be the first US Secretary of State to visit China in 5 years, and the highest -level US government officials who have visited China since the Bayeng government.

During his visit to China, Brinken will meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. Sources said that [Chinese President Xi Jinping may also meet Blinken](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯傳數週內訪華-或見習近平/a-65845535)Essence

The United States pointed out that Brinken's visit to China aims to stabilize the relationship between the two world's largest economies and strategic rivals in the United States.

The United States also hopes that Brinton's visit to China can pave the way for US Finance Minister Yellen and Commercial Minister Raymond. It is expected that during the visit to China, Blingken also negotiated the meeting for the US President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the September G20 Indian Summit and the APEC Summit of the Asia -Pacific Economic Organization (APEC) US Summit in November.

Description: A New York retired police and two Chinese citizens holding a green card were involved in the case. The prosecutor said that each defendant was "involved in the action under the circumstances", but the defendant's defense lawyer pointed out that the three of them did not know that the Chinese government was a tracer behind the scenes.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-16T09-45-05-08-00/15china-investigator-pbfm-master1050.jpg)On Thursday, after the two -week trial of the Brooklyn Federal Court, the jury was reviewing a case of China's "fox hunting action".

According to the US Department of Justice, a retired New York police and two Chinese citizens were accused of playing a key role in the "fox hunting operation". Beijing claims that this is a global action against "fugitives", while the Ministry of Justice believes that this is part of the efforts of the authoritarian government to control their diaspora.

The three defendants in this case include a 55 -year -old retired police officer, private detective Michael McMahon, 66 -year -old Zhu Yong (sound) and 27 -year -old Zheng Congxian (sound). The latter two are Chinese citizens holding the American green card.

The three men were charged with the Chinese government to follow Xu Jin, a government official in Wuhan, and their relatives. More than ten years ago, the victim Xu Jin moved to the United States, and the Chinese authorities later accused him of corruption and misappropriation of public funds.

The prosecutor accused each defendant that "participated in the movement under the circumstances that they monitored, tracking, threatening, and intimidation (victims)". The "ruthless action" adopted.

The prosecutor explained how Zhu Yong hired McMahon at the end of 2016 with the help of a translation company, and then instructed him to carry out surveillance activities and recorded it. Prosecutors also pointed out that in 2017, Chinese officials forced Xu Jin's 82 -year -old father to fly from China to the United States to persuade him to return to China. At the same time, the Chinese authorities demanded that McMahon surveillance during Xu Jin's father's trip to understand Xu Jinju. In 2018, Zheng Congying left the intimidation note in front of Xu Jin's house.

The defendant's defense lawyer pointed out that the three of them did not know that the Chinese government was looking for the command behind Xu Jinjin's movement.

The lawyer on behalf of McMaho emphasized that "no direct evidence" shows that his parties know that he is working for China. The excuse he was hired was that a Chinese private company wanted to recover stolen money from the people who stole public funds. Zhu Yong's acting lawyer said that when Zhu Yong launched the police officer and Mcma Hong of the China Wuhan Public Security Bureau, his participation in this operation had ended. Zheng Congying's defense lawyer said that at the time in 2018, his customers were "just a child" and participated in the plan for less than a day. Walk.

This is the first federal trial related to the "Fox Hunting Action". The three were accused for the first time in 2020, and now faced a number of crimes, including being foreign agents and conspiring this without notifying the judicial minister, as well as inter -state tracking.

Paying more attention to your own problem is human nature. But looking at a wider world is also crucial. A series of shocks -the new crown epidemic, supply bottlenecks, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring inflation, and tightening currency and financial conditions -have adversely affected the economy in most regions of the world, but the most vulnerable countries and the most vulnerable among these countries The crowd is the first. All of this (and will continue) has terrible consequences on the economic development, poverty reduction and even political stability of poor countries. We must not ignore these banks in the world(Worldbank)The latest "Global Economic Outlook"(Global Economic Prospects)The challenge shows clearly in the report. Of course they will let the new president of the World Bank Peng Anjie(Ajaybanga)Facing a series of daunting tasks.

The summary of these impact consequences is frustrating -the long -term slowdown of world trade growth, protectionism, debt accumulation, and deterioration of climate crisis have exacerbated these consequences. The "multi -crisis" that has not been discounted has "caused a heavy blow to the development of emerging countries and developing countries, and its impact will continue in the foreseeable future. By the end of 2024, economic activities of these economies are expected The level predicted on the eve of the outbreak is about 5%lower. "In the worse, in more than one -third of the poorest countries, the per capita income of 2024 will be lower than the level of 2019. This will have a profound impact: people who are poor but not guaranteed will find it difficult to improve the human capital of themselves or children. Today's disaster will radiate to a distant future.

As always, East and South Asia are expected to perform relatively. However, other areas, especially Latin America and Sahara, Africa are expected to perform poorly. However, this must be observed from a longer -term perspective. The report pointed out that since the middle of the last decade, if you do not have entered China, the level of per capita income and high -income countries in emerging and developing countries has been stagnant. The relative per capita income of low -income countries is even longer. In short, the process of narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor in the world seems to be stranded.

There are many reasons for the long -term stagnation of relative income and complicated. There are domestic policies and political reasons, as well as the global environment. But one of the factor is definitely the slowdown of protectionism and the slowdown in the growth of world trade. It is worth noting that between 1970 and 2008, the average world trade volume increased by 5.8%, while the average annual GDP increased by 3.3%: trade is the engine of economic growth. From 2011 to 2023, the average annual global trade increased by only 3.4%, while the average annual growth rate of GDP fell to 2.7%. This is not "de -globalization"(deglobalisation)Essence But this is definitely a "slow ballization" that some people now call(slowbalisation)Essence

But now, many of the most difficult challenges are funding. The long -term accumulation of debt, especially the accumulation of debt in low -income countries, is interacting with the turbulence of interest rate hikes and credit markets, causing serious debt difficulties. As usual, these issues include not only rising costs, but also reduced supply: credit is distributed again. Therefore, the report pointed out that now one of the four emerging and developing economies is actually unable to enter the international bond market financing.

The evidence of the tightening of credit conditions is both significant and disturbing. Since February 2022, the borrowing cost of borrowers rated as C -Class has soared by 14.4 percentage points. As a result, the growth forecast for these countries in 2023 has fallen from 3.2%a year ago to 0.9%.

However, the debt pressure of the poorest country is not a new phenomenon. The proportion of low -income countries' public debt interest net payment accounts for government revenue not only has increased sharply since the epidemic, but also has long been higher than the average level of all emerging markets and developing countries. A large amount of debt reduction is necessary. A large part of them will have to come from China -in this or that way. Today, it is worth noting that low -income countries owe Paris Club(Parkjub)The bilateral debt of high -income member states is less than half of the Paris club countries -mainly half of China.

The severe financing and debt situation has reached an urgent point. If urgent and thorough reforms are not carried out, it is impossible to have the opportunity to eliminate extreme poverty. If necessary to invest in slowing and adapting to climate change, the situation is the same. It is also unimaginable that the problems of poor countries with low credit rating will rely on private sector to solve themselves. Relevant countries have an overwhelming reason to take emergency, effective and generous actions.

The "New Global Financing Agreement Summit", which is about to be held in Paris, provides a valuable opportunity for rapid progress. But it is important that these progress must be obtained through cooperation with China. The need to carry out changes must be based on such a cognition: the current situation is neither sustainable nor desirable. These changes must cope with the urgent needs of humans and the earth; reduce the cost of existing debt and provide the required resources and risk sharing tools to generate affordable financing in the future.

Yes, the impact in recent years has made high -income countries more difficult to take generous and effective actions in politics. People will be closed when they are frightened. But there is no doubt that these impacts make it more important. If it is properly used, the value of the institution that Peng Anjie takes over as the forum is greater than the value as a bank. At this difficult time, he must make full use of it to unite the world and deal with these extremely urgent challenges together.

But even the locals of Behubar knew little about the secret base in the jungle.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-16T10-37-23-08-00/15russia-china-01-vqkb-master1050.jpg)Blessings of birthday wishes rarely have such important significance. However, when the blessing is a difficult situation, Russian President Putin shows that the Chinese President Xi Jinping is good, and even this seemingly small sign has become a message to the world, especially Western competitors.

On Thursday was Xi Jinping's 70th birthday. Putin sent a congratulatory message to the Chinese leader. I wish him a "dear friend" good health, happiness, and smoothness, and further strengthened people's impression of the personal relationship between the two authoritarian leaders. Essence

"The contributions made by you for many years to strengthen the strategic cooperation partnership between the two countries are difficult to estimate," Putin wrote in Congratulations.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly 16 months ago, the close relationship between the two leaders and the two countries has been the basis of Russia's economic survival. However, as Russia rely more and more to China, China has adopted a more cautious attitude towards Moscow and seeking to re -win some European support. In the long run, this relationship is increasingly risky.

In Russia, China is welcomed as an economic partner replaced by the West, although Moscow may be a concern for Beijing. As Western companies withdrawn from the Russian market, China provides this isolated country with [Many products](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/business/economy/russia-sanctions-trade-china-turkey.html)Essence It is the most important energy customer in Russia. Russia purchased more than any other country, and it may become a larger consumer country for Russia's natural gas, because Europe no longer purchases Russian natural gas. Continuous energy income helps the Russian government with funds for this war.

In China, Russia is considered an important partner to fight against increasingly united and hostile West. But Russia's demand for economic and political support -and the request to provide weapons for the Ukrainian war -also exacerbated people's concerns about the war between China and Putin, which will make China more and more likely to face this war. Diplomatic damage brought about.

In particular, China is increasingly worried about alienation of Europe. This is a much larger trading partner than Russia, and it is also a key party in the competition between Beijing and Washington. The Chinese government has been seeking a tension relationship with the continuous upgrading of the United States, and agrees to start in [Beijing] from Sunday(https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230615/blinken-china-visit/)A two -day talks were held with US Secretary of State Brillings.

"This is an embarrassing dance," Tang Zhixue, assistant professor of politics in China and Russia at the University of America in Washington University([ Joseph Torigian](http://josephtorigian.com/) )In an interview, he said that he was partnership between Moscow and Beijing. "Chinese people don't want the West to think they can split this partnership, but this relationship is also having a real price to China's economy and reputation."

Putin wished Xi Jinping's birthday when his hometown held the International Economic Forum. This annual forum similar to Davos once again stated that Russia has deepened the isolation of Russia because of the war on Ukraine.

The event was previously displayed to the Russian market to Europe and the United States. This year's forums cannot be seen on high -level managers in the West. The theme of this forum is the "de -US dollar" of global trade and the economic potential of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Russia and China are members of this regional organization.

However, compared with the past few years, China has not made a lineup in this forum. This seems to be part of Beijing's efforts to avoid being regarded as a war that is willing to support Putin.

The main Chinese guests who plan to attend the forum are the heads of the Chinese ambassador to Russia and the head of a trade delegation. [Xi Jinping himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/business/economy/russia-china-us-trade.html)He attended the 2019 forum, and he and Putin publicized the China and Russia on that forum to defend global free trade. Many Chinese executives and officials also attended that forum.

Although the Sino -Russian trade has increased by 41%in the first five months of this year, Chinese companies are cautious about investing in Russia. This is largely due to the risk of being punished by the Western government, especially since the Russian and Ukraine War.

"Cooperation may even be reduced compared to the Russian and Ukraine War, because after all, it is necessary to consider US sanctions," said Xiao Bin, a foreign policy researcher in Beijing when talking about China's investment.

On the other hand, many Russian corporate leaders also worry about China's dominance in private.

"So reliance on China is a nightmare of the Russian elite," said Tatiana Mitrova, a researcher at the University of Columbia Global Energy Policy Center.

Chinese officials have been trying to improve China's diplomatic status in Western European countries. These countries have criticized China to stop war for the use of Russia. There are even scholars in the Chinese system [boldly put forward a reason to say](https://archive.ph/ZlkbO), Beijing needs to clearly show that China -Russia's partnership has endless.Nevertheless, Yu Bin, an expert in China -Russia relations and senior researcher at Shanghai East China Normal University, warned him not to interpret the display of these friendly relations too much. "There is a kind of humanity, but I won't exaggerate it," he said. "The first thing is that the normal relationship between the pursuit of the two big powers is very important."

Although there is a deep friendship between Xi Jinping and Putin, the two of them had unforgettablely stated at the beginning of last year that this partnership was "endless", but China and Russia's friendship still stopped.

Putin wants Beijing to make a commitment to the construction of the "Siberian Power 2" natural gas pipeline in Beijing. The huge partner provided by the economy.

Relatively speaking, Beijing has always maintained this project low -key. This may be because when the Ukrainian war is still continuing, the signing of agreement on a large fanfare may take down the risk of enthusiastic China to enthusiastically support the Russian war.

"China does not want itself to look like a country that helps Putin with war funds," said Alexander Gabev, director of the Russian Eurasian Center of the Carnegiei International Peace Foundation. "If China wants the world to believe that it is a peaceful creator, it is not good to provide more sources of funds for Putin's war."

"Both sides must be interested in this relationship," Gabayev said. "But this relationship also has internal asymmetry. China is a larger party, and China has strong manufacturing and scientific research forces. Russia is mainly a single -dimensional economy. This trend is now accelerating development."

In the long run, some people in Russia are worried that China may use Moscow's weakened position and dispersal state of war to promote the existence of China The influence of the region of competition relationship.

However, so far, the Chinese leadership has been cautiously acting, and strives to avoid giving people a cheap impression when China is weak in Moscow.

"What I want to say is that the Chinese know the sensitivity of the Russians, especially in the past 10 or 15 years, so I don't want to fall down the stones," Yu Bin said.

The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?

On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article [report](https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&source=search_tab)It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.

We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.

In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?

With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.

It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.

As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor [Xi Jinping once scolded](https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html)Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.

As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".

What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?

On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported [report](https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&source=search_tab)It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.

However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.

According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.

So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?It seems that the people who may be responsible for the release of China Industry.com are precisely some people who are "mediocre and peaceful stalls, peaceful peace, and mixed days." These people only care about publication, and do not care about the lack of missing missions in the living incidents such as Jiaxinguan Plant. They do not care whether the exaggerated achievements have happened in the reports issued.

Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[[Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality](http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html)"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.

However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.

In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".

In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.

The good situation of enterprises ".

The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.

Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".

For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.

The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.

In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.

Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.

# Ultra -high temperature comes to attack the Chinese economic recovery in advance and add another challenge

Author: None (Language: zh)

Description: Although the "clearing zero" epidemic prevention policy six months ago, the momentum of China's economic recovery was still weak. Analysts pointed out that the hot summer weather that had arrived as early as in previous years not only caused a severe test of the Chinese power supply system, but also covered the growth prospect of this world's second largest economy.

(Voice of Germany Chinese), although the hot and high temperature is a commonplace for summer in most parts of China, but this year's midsummer seems to come earlier: Shanghai has reached the highest temperature in May in one hundred years -36.1 degrees Celsius. In the past month, 446 cities in China have recorded the highest temperature in history in the past month. The temperature of the capital Beijing this week is approaching 40 degrees.

Reuters pointed out that since March of this year, China has experienced the temperature higher than ordinary years. Meteorological experts predict that [extreme hot weather] in various places this summer(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/研究中国多省被列全球最易遭受气候变化相关灾害地区/a-64767330)It may be more serious than last year. The continuous high temperature has made China's high -load operation at high load, and some southern cities have begun to warn enterprises and residents to save electricity.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-16T10-47-00Z/62890147_404.jpg)High -temperature warning!

Chinatable, the German online media focusing on China, pointed out that high temperature and heat not only put pressure on the power grid, but also have a shadow on the Chinese economy, which has a weak recovery. Farmers complained about hot weather, and the government also warned the serious impact of extremely drought or flood disasters on crop harvesting.

Author JöRNPetring pointed out that the hot summer that arrived in advance made people think of the experience of restricting electricity due to power supply in some places in China in the past two years. On the one hand, at high temperatures, the air conditioners of almost every household are operating with axis, which consumes more power than usual; on the other hand, due to drought, the low water level affects the power generation capacity of many hydropower stations. In this case, local governments usually use coal power plants to generate electricity to fill the vacancies -but it has a burden on the environment.

[Background Reading: Why did China frequently occur in extreme weather events? ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国为何频发极端天气事件/a-62261134)
###  Power rangeage and electricity limit situation will appear again?

So far, this year, there have been no compulsory electricity restrictions that are worthy of attention. From a meteorological perspective, it has just been two weeks in summer, but the problem of power supply has been exposed. In particular, Guangdong's large economic provinces, Guangdong, seem to face huge challenges. Because most of the electricity consumption in Guangdong Province comes from Yunnan — seven of the top ten hydropower stations in China are located in the province. But between January and April of this year, Yunnan's precipitation was 60 % less than last year -this has led to a significant decrease in electricity transported to Guangdong.

According to a notice issued by the official website of the National Energy Administration of China, the agency held an emergency drill of large -scale power outage in the province and district this week in the East China region. The hosting and participating units include the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the State Grid Co., Ltd., and the power and energy institutions of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian Province.

The report also pointed out that East China Power Grid is the largest and most voltage regional power grid in China. In the summer of 2023, the highest power load in East China Power Grid is expected to be 397.25 million kilowatts, and the security of the power grid guarantees and the supply situation is more severe. At the same time, East China is highly dependent on external electricity. Once a catastrophic weather occurs, it may cause a large -scale power outage.

In 2021, due to a serious shortage of electricity, many factories in Guangdong Province were forced to stop production and stop work; in the summer of 2022, it was mainly the factory in Sichuan Province. Analysts point out that if similar situations will occur this year, serious consequences will cause serious consequences, because the industry generally expects that China can usher in a strong recovery of economic recovery after getting out of the "clear zero" epidemic prevention policy. After the short -term rebound at the beginning of the year, [a series of economic prosperity data announced this year is not satisfactory](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消费疲软-中国经济面临通缩风险/a-65868466)Essence

The outside world has generally expected that the two -day meeting of Japan's two -day meeting will remain unchanged. This is the second policy meeting held by Rita, President of Japan Bank and Men who took office in April.

Japanese banking decision officials have maintained the current negative interest rate policy today and have not adjusted the 10 -year Japanese bond yield to allow the fluctuation range.

After Japan and Bank announced the policy, the yen against the US dollar exchange rate fell from about 140.20 yen earlier to about 140.75 yen.

Oxford Economics (Oxford Economics), the head of the Japanese department, Shigetonagai, pointed out that Japan Bank seems to not rush to change the existing policies, "even if it has recently risen in economic growth and inflation."

He said: "We think that the Bank of China will maintain the status quo for about 1 year to evaluate whether the economy is expected to reach a 2%inflation rate during the 5 -year term of Zhitian and men."

According to the US "Wall Street Journal" report, people familiar with the matter revealed that the Chinese government may vigorously stimulate the economy, invest billions of dollars in infrastructure construction, while relaxing the policy of restrictions on the property market. And as part of the stimulus policy, the Chinese government considers issuing a special government bond of 1 trillion yuan to help local governments with debt -based local governments to regain the economy. These plans may be released as soon as possible in the next few days.

Earlier, there were news that Chinese officials frequently met with business leaders and economists to seek advice to revitalize the economy. In the meantime, some people mentioned that the industry was looking forward to the meeting of the Central Political Bureau in July to introduce structural reform measures to boost the economy.

It is reported that the People's Bank of China has reduced several interest rates this week, indicating that the Chinese government is increasingly disturbed by the economic prospects. However, some economists have questioned that the latest interest rate cut measures may not be able to reverse confidence, and the current economic stimulus measures are still adhered to the old road and increased investment through borrowing to stimulate growth. Promote family income and consumption. Others say that the cancellation of housing restrictions on small and medium -sized cities may not significantly improve the housing market.

Reuters reported that the US Department of Energy issued a statement on Thursday (June 15) that hackers obtained access permissions through the security vulnerabilities of Moveit Transfer, and data from the energy department's two entities leaked.

Moveit Transfer is a widely used file transmission software.

An official of the US Department of Energy said that the data was leaked by the US Department of Energy, Oak Ling United University and the Waste Isolation Test Factory (WIPP). WIPP located in New Mexico is a facility for national defense -related nuclear waste.

The network of British Energy Giants Shell, Georgia University, Johns Hopkins and Johns Hopkins Medical Group have also been invaded.

John Hopkins Medical Group is a non -profit organization that cooperates with the university with six hospitals and primary care centers.

CL0P, which has been announced to be responsible for Moveit operations, said earlier that it would not use any data obtained from government agencies and deleted all such data.

The ransom group, which is linked to Russia, did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on the US Department of Energy's statement.

BRICS Development Bank (referred to as the "New Truster"), founded by the BRICS (China, Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa) in 2015, was in trouble, and it may become a "zombie bank".

According to the Wall Street Journal, the new operation and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is headquartered in Beijing, is to reduce the dependence of developing countries to the US dollar and help the fastest -growing countries to obtain development funds. A alternative option of the fund organization.

Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the new bank frozen all new loans in Russia to show its attitude of compliance with Western sanctions. However, Wall Street still had doubts about this and kept cautiously providing loans to the bank. This makes the new bank bears more and more debt to meet the needs of its own liquidity.

Shortly after the establishment of the newly -established in 2015, the institutional investor of Wall Street and Chinese state -owned banks borrowed money. Two -thirds of the borrowings were priced in the US dollar, which broke the bank's statement that it did not rely on the US dollar. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, the new Bank was informed in the market that the cost of its new loan may increase by more than four times compared with the invasion, which made it difficult to raise money. The bank's loan issuance speed also slowed to a very low level.

At the same time, due to the slowdown in China's economy, Beijing is not willing to lend more funds to the bank. Xi Jinping also seems to keep a distance from this bank because the bank's establishment is mainly because of Xi Jinping's predecessor.

At present, the new operations are injecting capital injection in countries such as Saudi Arabia, but there are no signs that this effort will be fulfilled soon.

Li Anyou: "Xi Jinping is not a stable person. Xi Jinping must have to catch 'Taiwan. It is a place to control from China. Taiwan is the key to the first island chain. The global strategy situation is a very critical place. But he (Xi Jinping) is not easy to catch Taiwan, so my more optimistic aspect is that Xi Jinping is willing to wait until he thinks that time is mature. "

Li Anyou: "I think all the politicians in Taiwan have no way to stabilize the issue of the Taiwan Strait, because Beijing is unwilling. No matter who it is, Lai Qingde, Ke Wenzhe or Hou Youyi, or another, Beijing will also ask the new president to acknowledge 'Nine The second consensus'. But if the new president acknowledged the 1992 consensus, from the perspective of Beijing, it was the first step. They would raise their requirements later. So who is the next Taiwan president, China will still let him live in life. It's not good. "

He said that the issue of Taiwan is a crux that US -China relations cannot be resolved. The United States can only avoid the improvement of conflict risks. US Secretary of State Brosakus visited China on Sunday (June 18), which is a work that resolves risks.Li Anyou also warned that if the American politics (characters) were visited to Taiwan for politics, or in cross -strait relations, they made over -intensified remarks and expanding the fear of the United States to China, which would increase the risk of conflict between US -China relations.

Chen Lifu said: "If you have international reputation, the Communist Party is not too dare to move. Although it has been signed by Liu Xiaobo, it is already politically incorrect for the CCP. He also led the renminbi as well as full of money. It can be seen that the influence of China is enough. China does not want to establish an enemy. "** Sports feast rumors that the Chinese Football Association refuses to and the Argentine Friendship Tournament ** ****

Chen Lifu analyzed that Messi is a professional star, like an artist, and playing goals in China is a commercial show. If the invitation is invited to operate into a foreign player, they must express their anti -Taiwan independence. Once they are beaten by Messi, the money that is smashed must be drifted.

In response to the hot discussion of Chinese netizens about the Chinese Football Association's rejection with the Argentine Friendship Tournament, and temporarily looking for the Australian team to play, Chen Lifu said: "A stronger kick with Argentina, 80 % of them will lose, China lost on his birthday, isn't Xi Jinping lost?"

(Voice of Germany) [Chinese State Council Prime Minister Li Qiang will lead multiple ministers to visit Berlin on June 19](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体肖尔茨邀请李强6月访德/a-65431157)Participate in the seventh round of German and Chinese government negotiations, the motto of the consultation is the "Gemeinsam Nachhaltighandeln". At present, the "reserves" between Beijing and Berlin seem to be shrinking. This is clearly performed during the meeting of Borispistorius and Chinese Defense Director Li Shangfu in Shangli -La, Singapore. German fighter pilots come to train Chinese Air Force pilots](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/法律存灰色地带-德国担心退役飞行员与中国分享情报/a-65868166)way of doing. Thorstenbenner at the Berlin Think Tank Global Public Police Research Institute (GPPI) believes that the incident shows that "we must be sober because Beijing will use all opportunities to obtain key technologies and capabilities to strengthen its own industry and military. Base".

### The fuel that may cause conflict is increasing

Whether it is technology outflow, or in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Russia, Beijing still insists on "friendship like a rock" with Moscow, the increasing situation of the Taiwan Strait, and the pressure on China to China: between Germany, the conflict " "Fuel" is growing. And further intensified due to the geopolitical competition between China and the United States.

At the same time, China is still the most important trading partner in Germany, which is the seventh consecutive year. In 2022, the total trade between the two countries reached nearly 300 billion euros, of which Germany's trade deficit with China exceeded 80 billion euros.

[Background reading: Germany introduced the first national security strategy China is an opponent and partner](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国出台首份国家安全战略-中国是对手也是伙伴/a-65912004)Therefore, this relationship is not only important, but also complicated. The contradictions of Germany and China relations can be seen from this fact that in the official documents of Germany, China is also described as partners, competitors and strategic opponents. In the past, Berlin emphasized the partnership. Government consultation since 2011 has witnessed this: This high -level intergovernmental dialogue is only carried out with particularly intimate partners. In 2014, German -China relations were even mentioned to the height of "comprehensive strategic partnership". But since then, the atmosphere has changed in the capital of Berlin and other European countries. The focus of the relationship has obviously began to turn to strategic competition.

### Berlin wants to say goodbye to "everything as the old"

Barbarapongratz, a Chinese think tank (Merics Research Center), Berlin, predicts that this steering will also affect the seventh round of German and Chinese government consultations. The German -China relations expert said: "The German government wants to say goodbye to‘ everything ’. Some signals have shown that compared with in the past, government consultations will have few big scenes and will not be concluded by major business contracts.”

### How can the German Foreign Minister visit China for "correction" for Macron?

In the joint ruling agreement of the ruling alliance consisting of the Social Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, it can already feel the new trend of Germany's policy on China. The agreement was mentioned 12 times in China, which also included in the key word entries of strategic competition and cooperation with European partners. The agreement wrote: "In order to achieve our value and interests in the competition with China, we need to formulate a comprehensive Chinese strategy in Germany under the common European Union's policy framework. We hope to continue intergovernmental consultation And make it more European. "

Merics experts Pon Gelaz concluded that so far, "so far," in response to Germany's relations with China, Chinese strategy, or government consultation, it has not really discussed. "Except for the Chinese strategy announced by Berlin, it has not yet been introduced. The German national security strategy is pushed again and again. The Chinese strategy of Berlin is based on the national security strategy, and the latter's repeated delay is also due to the differences between the internal opinions of the ruling alliance.

Berlin political scholar Eberhardsandschneider believes that the atmosphere of talks is "relatively favorable." The Chinese expert said: "If a document is now published in China, it can be imagined that China's self -esteem will cause government consultation to be canceled." He also said, "Different from the German government is an open secret. China. Know this too. "

### Different

This is not surprising, because governing partners will also argue in public, especially between the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party. The Green Party claims that it is valuable and adopted a tough tone to China, while the Social Democratic Party focuses on economic interests at the same time. For example, when the Green Party Foreign Minister Annalenabaerbock visited Beijing for public confrontation with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in April, the conservatives of the Communist Party Parliament Party issued a position on Germany's policy on China. Members call for a pragmatic Chinese policy in the document and warn not to adopt anti -China strategy.

Merics experts Pon Gelaz said that there are huge differences in foreign ministers Belbak and Prime Minister Shulz, and party politics is the characteristic of the current policy of China. "But if you listen carefully, you will notice that they have differences in tone. But the difference between the information they pass is not much," said the expert of China.

The German -China government consultation will be presided over by Prime Minister Shulz, which may make difficult issues at least friendly. Chinese issue expert Sand Schneider said he did not have much specific expectations for the actual results. For him, the most important thing is that the consultation was held after three years of personal contact. He said: "I agree with those Chinese colleagues who talk to me: everyone reunited together, which is imminent. Not only at a formal meeting, but also in the well -known tea dinner time, communicate with each other. This will change. The atmosphere may make the 'common action -long action' possible, at least in some areas. "

According to reports, the United States and Iran are conducting dialogue and try to cool down through the form of "understanding".

Reuters quoted Iranian and Western officials that the United States and Iraqi will formulate the implementation steps one by one in order to restrict Iran's nuclear plan and release Iranian citizens detained and thaw some Iranian overseas assets.

These steps will be regarded as a "understanding" arrangement, not a agreement that requires the Congress for Congress.

Many US legislators oppose the benefits of Iran in the negotiations, because Iran provides military assistance to Russia, suppress domestic implementation, and its support for agents who attack the interests of the United States.

US State Department spokesman Miller denied any agreement with Washington and Tehran.

However, he said that Washington hopes that Tehran's tension is eased and promised to restrict nuclear plans, stop supporting regional agent organizations and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and release detained U.S. citizens.

Miller said that the United States "continues to achieve all these goals through diplomatic contact." He did not provide details.

When an Iranian official was questioned, "You can call it a temporary agreement, a temporary arrangement or an understanding arrangement. In short, both parties want to avoid further upgrading the situation."

He said: "The first thing to do is to exchange prisoners and some Iranian assets."

In July 2015, Iran reached an Iranian nuclear agreement with the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany. In May 2018, the U.S. President Trump unilaterally withdrew the agreement, and then restarted and added a series of sanctions on Iraq. Since May 2019, Iran has gradually suspended the performance of some of the clauses in the agreement, but promised to take measures "reversible".

After Biden took office, since April 2021, the Iranian nuclear agreement has held multiple rounds of talks in Vienna to discuss the recovery of the United States and Iraq, and the United States has involved the negotiations indirectly.

In early August 2022, the European Union submitted a "final text" about the recovery of the Iranian nuclear agreement to the negotiating participants. Iran and the United States subsequently exchanged written opinions on each other, but the negotiations have not made significant progress since September 2022.

The development of modernization and social changes has brought a decline in marriage rate, and the superposition of population policies has led to a reduction in the number of marriage age population. The number of marriage people in China has declined year after year. Data show that in 2022, the number of marriage registrations in China fell below 7 million pairs, a decrease of about 810,000 pairs from the previous year. The reasons for the low marriage rate are complicated. First of all, with the development of society and the popularization of education, contemporary young people pursue themselves, and the divorce rate is increasing day by day, resulting in the loss of confidence in young people in marriage. Secondly, China's high housing prices and high -priced gifts have been prevalent in recent years, which further blocks the willingness of young people to become families. This program will explore various factors of China's marriage rate and its impact on the pension system. The guests who participated in the discussion were Li Hengqing, an economist at Strategy and Information Research Institute in Maryland, USA.

** 2022 The number of weddings fell below 7 million to Chuang Chuang record **

Recently, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs released data showed that the number of marriage registrations in China in 2022 was 6.833 million pairs, a decrease of about 810,000 pairs from the previous year, and set a new low since the relevant data records of the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1986.

According to surging news reports, from the data in recent years, after the number of marriage registrations in 2008 exceeded 10 million pairs, China has increased year by year, until the peak of 2013 was 13.469 million pairs. Subsequently decreased year by year.

From the perspective of value, 2022 is the year with the lowest number of marriage registration since 1986, and it is also the only year that breaks through the 7 million pairs. Compared with the peak in 2013, the decline has reached 49.3%.

The report also said that the Ministry of Civil Affairs is stepping up some institutional obstacles in marriage registration. In May this year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs further expanded the pilot of marriage registration in different places. It is reported that after this adjustment, all pilot areas will cover 21 provinces, autonomous regions and cities, and all implement the "cross -provincial generalization" of the marriage and divorce registration of mainland residents, covering 78.5%of China's total population.

** Are you guilty? **

The men's color gift to the woman is one of the traditional Chinese wedding customs, but in recent years, the cost of color gifts across the country has soared. Especially in rural or low -income families to become a family for their sons, they have to hollow out and save. It also caused contradictions due to high -priced gifts, and finally ended in a breakup.

According to Chinese media reports, in recent years, colorful ceremonies in rural areas have remained high, and even watched all the way, and there are also strange phenomena in rural areas higher than the city, the more difficult the family is, and the higher the family. A village party secretary in the central region stated that their villages are close to the richer counties, and the gifts are generally 180,000 yuan, but some local remote villages are as high as 280,000 yuan or even 380,000 yuan.

According to a reference news network report, the survey showed that more than 40 % of the families contradicted due to colorful gifts. The general interviewed men believe that Cai Li is a bad habit, and the pressure of the man's family alone, and should be abandoned. More than 60 % of women believe that Cai Li is a man's sincerity. The man believes that the reasonable gift is 10,000 to 50,000, while the women think that it is 50,000 to 100,000.

China ’s first population in the past 60 years last year has increased. In addition to increasing efforts to encourage marriage and fertility, local governments have also promoted marriage and customs that are mainly targeted at sky -high prices.

For example, in February of Liyang County, Jiangsu, a new era of civilized marriage and love advocacy activity in the new era of "Lady Yangyang", proposed unmarried young women to refuse high -priced gifts. Jiangxi has carried out educational training activities in many places, requiring young women to participate, and popularize a happy life without gifts. Nanchang City was also held on March 8th, a collective wedding event of "don't be happy to be happy". In addition, Dingxi City, Gansu, clearly clarified that the marriage gift must not exceed 50,000 yuan.

** The marriage rate is decreased, the population of the population is negatively shaken the country **

The decline in the number of weddings directly brings a decline in fertility, which will further strengthen China's low fertility social environment. In the context of China's population aging, the burden of support for employees in the future continues to increase, and the problem of pension gaps is prominent.

In 2022, the natural growth rate of China's population has fallen to 0.6%. From the perspective of the population structure, the proportion of aging population over 65 years of age will continue to rise in the future. The pension system is faced with difficulties in unsustainable.

According to the First Financial Report, in 2021, the maintenance rate of employees in Chinese urban enterprises increased from 30.4%in 2000 to 37.7%, that is, every 3.3 employees supported one retirement, and evolved to every 2.65 employees supported one of one in -service employees to support one. Retirees. In addition to the incorporated employees and expanded employees' bases from 2005 to 2011 to reduce the employee base and reduce the maintenance rate of insurance, the growth rate of retirees in insurance participation is generally higher than the growth rate of insured employees, which has led to the basis for the maintenance rate of urban employees. trend. In the future, the aging population will intensify, and the low birth rate will inevitably lead to continuous increase in maintenance burden.

According to the calculation of the World Bank, the replacement rate of pensions, that is, the average basic pension and the average salary of the employees received by the urban employees after retirement, can maintain the living standard before retirement without less than 70%. However, the average replacement rate of pensions in Chinese urban employees was only 43.6%in 2021, far lower than 55%of the international warning line. It can be seen that most retirees will face the cruel reality of gradually deteriorating the treatment of pensions.

According to Reuters, Western and Iranian officials have revealed these talks, and these measures can be called "forgiveness" rather than agreements to be reviewed by the US Congress. In the report, Reuters pointed out that many members of the National Congress opposed to providing any benefits to Iran because it provided military assistance to Russia, launching suppression in the country, and agent who supported the interests of the United States in the region. "

The US State Department spokesman Matt Miller denied that the country had reached any agreement with Iran, but he said that Washington hopes that Tehran can ease the tension, curb its nuclear plan, stop supporting groups in the region to launch an agent attack, stop supporting Russia The war against Ukraine and the release of American citizens detained by them.

Miller went on to point out, "We will continue to achieve all the above goals through diplomatic means," but he did not explain it in detail.

A Iranian official said, "You want to say why it can be -whether it is a temporary agreement, a phased agreement or a common understanding. Both parties want to prevent further upgrading of the situation."

He explained that "this will first include the exchange of Iranian assets that are frozen in the frozen prisoner."

He also said that other measures may include US sanctions related to Iran's oil exports in exchange for Iran to stop performing 60%of uranium concentration activities and launch more cooperation with international atomic energy agencies.

 After a few months when Iran's special envoy, Rob Mali, refused to contact with Iran, met with the Iranian representative in the United Nations.

A Western official who required anonymous to point out that "I can call it an understanding of a calm situation." He also added that in the Sudan State of Aman, the US National Security Council official Brett McGick and the Chief Nuclear negotiator of Iranian Nuclear Nuclear Nuclear negotiation representatives Ali Buckry held more than one round of non -direct talks.

This Western official explained that this idea is to create a current situation that everyone can accept and allow Iran to avoid 90%of the Western red line that concentrates the abundance of uranium, because this abundance will be regarded as a nuclear weapon stage.

The official said that in addition to limiting the enrichment of uranium to 60%, the two parties also hoped that Iran could cooperate with international atomic energy institutions instead of installing more advanced centrifugal equipment in exchange for Iran to obtain it to get it. "A lot of funds" frozen abroad.

#### pressure and criticism

On the other hand, Michael McCell, chairman of the US House of Representatives of the US House of Representatives, to President Joe Bayeng, and put forward concerns about the Bayeon government recently tried to reach a new nuclear agreement with Iran. McCell added that the government not only did not use its foreign influence and military deterrence to prevent Iran from engaging in its so -called malware, but instead rewarded Iran's improper behavior in exchange for the other party's false commitment to stop upgrading.

On the other hand, the British Middle East Minister Tarrica Ahmad said that Iran violated its commitment to nuclear agreement by increasing uranium concentration activities. The British minister also urged Tehran to abandon "undermine the stable bad actions of the region" and stop supporting Russia's war in Ukraine in Ukraine.

After trying to restore the efforts of the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015, the United States hopes to restore some restrictions on Iran to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Such weapons may threaten Israel and trigger arms competitions in the area. However, Iran claims that it does not intend to develop nuclear weapons.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2018 that he unilaterally withdrawn from the Iran nuclear agreement reached in 2015. This agreement limits Iran's uranium concentration to within 3.67%and limits its uranium inventory within 202.8 kg. After the US exit the nuclear agreement, Iran has broken these restrictions as a unilateral decision to adopt the United States to unilaterally decide Revenge.

# Sleeping late does not necessarily die early.

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 16th) A 37 -year study pointed out today that people who are accustomed to staying up late will not be short -lived than those who are accustomed to getting up early and getting up early -as long as they do not drink and smoke in the long night.

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-16T13-02-08-00-00/000000.png)In the past, research showed that people who stay up late and it is difficult to get up early is more likely to suffer from a series of health problems.

In 2018, a large -scale study in the UK found that in 6 and a half years, night people have a 10%risk of death than morning people.

Although this may be a worrying news for the night owls in the world, this research does not take into account the factors that may cause these deaths, such as alcohol intake.

Therefore, Finland researchers published a research on the journal "International Time Biology" reviewed by colleagues, which further discussed this issue.

This study tracks the 24,000 homosexual twins in Finland, and in 1981, they asked them to answer themselves as morning people or night people.

One -third of them said that they were night -type people, 10%said they were definitely night -type people, and the rest were morning people.

Night -type people are often younger, and they also have more tendency to drink and smoke.

When the researchers conducted a follow -up study in 2018, more than 8700 of these twins had died.

During these 37 years, researchers found that the risk of death was 9%higher than that of various factors due to various factors. This number was similar to the results of the 2018 research.

However, the research published today states that the difference is "mainly derived from smoking and alcohol." For example, night owls with less drinking and smoking will not die earlier than morning people.

The first author of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, studying the first author of the Finnish Vocational Health Research Institute, told Agence France -Presse that the research results showed that night owls could take action to reduce their risk of premature death.

Heblin said: "Obviously, night -type people should think more carefully about their intake of alcohol and tobacco."

Heblin mentioned that without considering other factors, people's sleep time preferences, also known as "current types", have "rarely or almost no" their mortality.

Jeevan Fernando, a current scientist from Cambridge and has not participated in research, told AFP that although the research results were reasonable, there were also limitations.

Feinan Du said that the experimental participants were identified as morning or night -type people. This approach "not satisfactory because it does not include any objective information", which is different from modern research methods.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-16T13-37-00Z/65907484_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65941895/65907484)(Voice of Germany in Chinese) "Air Guard 23" Air Force Exercise is currently being held in NATO. This is the largest air force joint exercise in NATO history so far. In addition to NATO member states, Sweden and Japan's two non -member states were also invited to participate in military exercises. Among them, the participation of Japan looks particularly extraordinary.

In fact, [Japan's cooperation with NATO has been quite hot](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日媒北約擬藉東京辦事處-升級印太合作/a-65907575)Essence NATO Secretary -General Jensstoltenberg called on NATO and Japan to strengthen close cooperative relations when he visited Tokyo this year. After Russia launched the Whaled War, the Japanese government announced extensive sanctions on Russia and provided humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, which suffered war.

The reason why Tokyo does this is not a consideration without its own interests. As Stoltenberg warned: "What happened in Europe today may be repeated in East Asia tomorrow." Japanese officials also explained to the people of the country with the same word to strengthen cooperation with NATO in Tokyo.

NATO's establishment of Tokyo Liaison Office plans to encounter obstacles

However, NATO and Japan's substantial steps have encountered problems: NATO plans to cooperate in the first contact place in Asia in Tokyo to coordinate the cooperation with Indian partners such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

However, before the plan was officially announced, it was unexpectedly criticized by Beijing, but unexpectedly, French President Macron also objected to the plan.

According to the "Financial Times", Macron said in a public speech in Slovakia that [NATO must stay in the category of the North Atlantic, "If we try to expand the geographical category of NATO, it will be a great mistake."](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英媒馬克宏反對北約在日本設辦事處/a-65834394)Patrick Cronin, head of the Asia -Pacific Affairs Institute of Washington Think Tank Hudson Institute, told Germany that French President Macron's rejection of Japan "shocked the Japanese."

Cronin said that Macron will set up a small problem such as the Tokyo contact office, which is deemed to be a major foreign policy change. This approach is "very ridiculous". He added that Macron did this likely to protect the business interests of France and Beijing, and at the same time to create a European protector image that avoids Europe's involving Sino -US conflict.

Cronin said, in this way, Macron can sell himself from China: "You see, I am trying to keep Europe and the United States independent and avoid European affairs in Europe."

### as an intermediary of China -Europe relations

Janneleino, an expert in diplomatic and security affairs, has lived in China for many years. He partially agreed with Croonin's point of view, but he also said that Macron's behavior has another explanation. Renault said: "At that time, the affairs involved in European -China relations, China would find former German Prime Minister Merkel to coordinate. I think Macron wants to pick up Merkel's class and act as a middleman role."

Renault said: "France actually hopes that Europe can get involved in Indo -Pacific affairs, but does not want to appear there as a NATO partner. If the European Union participates in the Indo -Pacific Affairs, then France as the EU country, of course It's important. "

### China Warning: NATO should stay away from Asia

No matter what Macron's motivation is, he is welcomed by Beijing's position to open the Tokyo contact office. On June 6, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, responded to Macron's related statement: "Asia is not the geographical category of North Atlantic, nor does it need to establish the so -called" Asia -Pacific version of NATO ' What does it mean for transactions and provocative camp confrontation? "

Wang Wenbin said that the attitudes of most regions on the relevant issues are very clear: "Oppose to put together various military groups in the region. Re -acting in Asia. "

In the end, Wang Wenbin also issued a direct warning to Japan: "Japan should also make a correct judgment that meets regional stability and development benefits. Do not do things that destroy the mutual trust between countries and damage the regional peace and stability."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-16T13-37-00Z/64567580_401.jpg)On January 31st, NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg held a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Kishita.

On Wednesday, at a press conference held before the NATO Minister of Defense, a reporter from a Chinese media group asked whether NATO had an intention to enter Asia in the east, and Stoltenberg refuted this speculation. He said: "No one has such a plan."

But Stoltenberg also expressed the need to strengthen cooperation with the Pacific region: "China has enhanced military reserve and threatened to neighboring countries."

For this purpose, the upcoming NATO summit will also issue invitations to Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Last summer, the leader of the above country attended the NATO summit for the first time.

In addition, NATO is still being discussed alone with the above -mentioned four countries, hoping to upgrade the current "global partner" of the four countries to the "tailor -made partnership" (ITTP), so that NATO and these countries will carry out network security in network security in network security in network security , New Technology, Climate Protection, and bilateral cooperation in the national defense industry.

### 动 Passive is active

Regarding China's position in the establishment of a liaison office in Tokyo, Renault made different suggestions. He said: "Since Macron believes that we should not set up a liaison office in Tokyo, because this will annoy China. So why do we talk about direct talks on this issue on this issue?"

Renault believes that whether it is NATO or Beijing, they have publicly expressed their willingness to conduct dialogue. "Both parties continue to reiterate the willingness to carry out dialogue in public, so why don't we try?"

Renault said that if Beijing rejected NATO's conversation suggestions, then China is not so straightforward to oppose India -Pacific countries with NATO.

At the beginning of this press conference, German Chancellor Schultz summarized the strategic summary of this year's highly anticipated strategy that Germany was "strong". Strategy, that is, "complementarity, flexibility and sustainability.

"Complementarity" is regarded as the core of this 80 -page strategy. The purpose is to focus all important issues related to security and resources in a basket, which means that Germany will say goodbye to one of its most important decision -making mechanisms. This is based on the decision -making mechanism that shares tasks and permissions between various security affairs departments, and this mechanism is often criticized because it delayed the decision -making process during the current turbulent period.

The German government uses the term "flexibility" to ensure that all complementary institutions in Germany have the ability to protect "democratic systems from external influence". In order to eliminate all the security risks of these changes to the security of German citizens.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-16T14-05-56/33JL763-highres-1686896457-1686923280.jpg)Schultz emphasized that this security strategy is mainly based on the three principles(French media)#### "Immature" strategy

Olaf Bangk, chairman of the Democratic Regent Alliance and security expert, told a reporter from the Peninsula TV station that the German government took a big step on the road to catching up with other big powers. He also added that so far, Germany has been relying on the United States, France, and British partners come to respond to their security challenges, and this strategy lists national security as the highest priority of the country.

Lu Curinsky, chairman of the "Plan4risk" security organization, did not depreciate the importance of this strategy, but when he talked with a reporter from Peninsula TV, he pointed out that the main problem of this strategy is its "unclear". He does not want to say this. It is a failure strategy. Therefore, he tends to call it "immature" strategy because it lags behind Germany to other Western countries, especially France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

He also added that the strategy reflects the attitude of German society on the concept of sensitive security and emphasized that the strategy should include the content of the elimination of war and crisis.

He also pointed out the important area of this strategy. In addition, the German government has not clarified the crisis and the war area of war, for example, Asia is not a priority for German security. In addition, Germany must consider its "limited capacity of the army" and ensure that it provides fiscal and human resources so that Germany can play a military role in crisis areas.

Regarding the role of the three major intelligence agencies in the process of implementing this strategy from the "external, internal and military levels", Lurinski pointed out that the necessity of exploring the cooperation between these three major institutions is "necessary and important to be important and important. "But", but more importantly, this strategy acknowledge that it is necessary to set up an intelligence analysis department to provide the theoretical framework for German intelligence activities.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-16T14-05-56/maxresdefault-1686923388.jpg)Germany: Future military power(Peninsula TV Station)
####  Russia is the "biggest threat"

This strategy emphasizes all the obligations of Germany and its army, whether it involves Article 5 of the North Atlantic Convention.(That is the common defense clause)The provisions involve Article 42 of the Marstrip Treaty -the Treaty stipulates that all EU member states should defend each other, or involve clearing the "Aachen Treaty" that Germany supports its French allies. Article 4 provides.

But the most notable is the content of Russia and China. This strategy believes that "in the foreseeable time, Russia will be the biggest direct threat of European peace and security." At the same time, it also defines China as "cooperation in cooperation. Partner "and" systemic opponents "did not put forward too much detail in the relationship between Germany and China, because the Schultz government is formulating a separate Chinese strategy and plans to submit it in the next few months.

Christian Toshaff, a professor of international relations at the University of Berlin, believes that due to trade reasons and the need for international community to participate in important issues such as climate crisis, this strategy has not adopted the wording of China's upgrade.

Toshav pointed out to a reporter from the Peninsula that in Germany, in response to the "Russia's war against Ukraine, there are reasons to think that Russia is the imperialist forces that pose a biggest threat to European security, a country that is separated from international law." The content is more milder, and it is admitted that China needs to treat China as an important trading partner and international participants to resolve various crises.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-16T14-05-56/maxresdefault-1-1686923334.jpg)Germany issued a national security strategy(Peninsula TV Station)
####  Stability in the Middle East

It is true that this strategy clearly refers to Russia and China, but the interpretation of its content shows that it reflects the transformation of the priority of the German security policy for a period of time. The task has shifted to the fields of preventing terrorism and conflict between national conflicts.

Hena Fayeville, a professor of anti -terrorist politics at the University of Frankfurt, said that Germany's security concept of relations with the Middle East and North Africa countries was affected by the perspective of maintaining the necessity of stability in these countries.

She also added that this view is based on two main lines: the first one focuses on the partners that regard these countries as a partner that can rely on in the short term and in the middle to replace Russia's energy, and finally realize the transition from fossil energy to alternative energy sources in the end. ; The second is the supervision and management of refugee tide.

The expert added that this actually means that the stability of the Middle East and North Africa countries is the "priority of priority" in this new security strategy.

On the issue of cracking down on terrorism, the expert pointed out that the strategy "laid the foundation for preventive measures including society, folk, police, and intelligence, in order to gradually reduce the use of military means."

Some senior officials of some EU member states have publicly supported Stoltenberg to stay as the Secretary -General of NATO. Stoltenberg was asked if he had been persuaded to continue staying on Thursday (June 15). Decision shows that he is open to the prospect of staying in office.

Reuters reported that NATO confirmed in February this year that Stoltenberg, the former Prime Minister of Norwegian Prime Minister, did not intentionally seek to continue to hold this position, [he will step down in October](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230212-1362425)Essence

Stoltenberg reiterated to reporters at the NATO National Defense Minister Conference on Thursday at Brussels on Thursday that he did not change his mind. But he repeatedly refused to disclose what he would do if NATO member states asked him to stay.

"I am responsible for all the decisions I have to make in this alliance, the only exception. That is, that is, about my future, it will be determined by 31 allies."

Stoltenberg is 64 years old. He served as the Norwegian Prime Minister twice from 2000 to 2001 and 2005 to 2013. He has been the Secretary -General of NATO in 2014. His last term was extended in March last year.

The White House spokesman asked Pierre to say that Bayon had not decided to the New NATO Secretary -General's candidate, and said that Stoltenberg was an outstanding NATO secretary general.

According to foreign officials, the British Defense Minister Wallace publicly stated that he wanted to get the job, and was always optimistic that Denmark Prime Minister Fredrikson, who had been optimistic about becoming the Secretary -General of New NATO, insisted that he was not a candidate.

Fredrickson told Danish Broadcasting Corporation DR on Thursday that Stoltenberg's stay in "it will be a very good arrangement." She said further, "I like my job very much, and I want to stay in my current position. So, I will not go to NATO."

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) This weekend, US Secretary of State Brills will go to Beijing to start his since taking office [First China Journey](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688)Essence The commentator of the "South German will" believes that the US Secretary of State Brills has a simple goal when visiting Huai Huai: [He is just "Er Will Ja Nur Reden"](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/usa-china-tony-blinken-supermaechte-diplomatie-spionageballon-1.5937299)However, this move will break the current deadlock of Sino -US relations, start a series of bilateral ministerial meetings, and lay the foundation for the direct meeting of leaders of the two countries in November this year.

The author pointed out that the White House hopes to re -lead Sino -US relations to the diplomatic track and think of it as the focus of its foreign policy:

"In the complex process of approaching each other, at least the United States has a relatively simple view that if you don't want to make your mind a simple eagle, and cause war, even if it is completely accidental, then Beijing and Washington must use a foreign language tone as soon as possible as soon as possible Talking. Political management of bilateral relations and returning to the Internet of Diplomacy are the central content of the White House policy. In this regard, Beijing knows that if the world is divided into two major camps that are not compatible with water and fire, it will have to suffer huge economic losses. "

"The idea of being out of the United States and the influence between two camps has been proven to be disconnected from reality. On the contrary, Western investors hurriedly left China in a batch of political ice. Ryan's concept of "lowering risk 'instead of" decoustile' is not only guiding the European strategy, but also to point the direction for the US strategy.

Looking at this way, the mission of visiting China is actually so simple: the United States hopes to enter the dialogue level with China. Careful dialogue on military reserve control can be tentative as the first step. In order to achieve this goal, even if the Bayeng government ushered in [the opponent's oral stew to drink](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美外长通话-秦刚暗指双边关系困难责任在美方/a-65910231)Will not resign. "

###  upgrade

After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the over -the -world of the US -Canada border.

Although the official tone is still steadily good, the property market is weak and the consumption is weak, highlighting the trend of economic decline. Faced with insufficient economic motivation, Beijing is also planning to introduce a series of market rescue measures. But can the old way work?

[** In order to boost the economic Chinese government to fight private capital abacus **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/ec-04202023073921.html)*** [China Local Debt: Just beginning](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/heqinglian/hql-06022023121842.html)**

The American "Wall Street Journal" quoted people familiar with the matter on Thursday that the Chinese government is planning to introduce more than a dozen major measures to re -revive the domestic sluggish economy, including investment of billions of dollars to support infrastructure construction and cancel the second set of small cities in the second set of small cities. The housing purchase restriction regulations, as well as special government bonds issued by about 10 trillion yuan to help local governments reduce debt burden.

** The latest economic data is exposed to the end of China's economic recovery **

The latest economic data released on June 15th of the National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that several important economic indicators in May this year have increased year -on -year but the growth rate has fallen slightly, and the official expectations of economic recovery have also postponed the end of the year.

Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics of China, said at the press conference of the National New Office of the day that by the third and fourth quarters, with the improvement of the base, the economic operation will return to the level of normalized growth, and the economy realizes the annual expected development goals of the year. There are still many powerful support. Fu Linghui also said that China ’s consumption has resumed good, and the employment situation has improved overall this year.

However, the latest data shows that China's unemployment rate in May broke the record in May, reaching 20.8%.

Li Hengqing, an economist in the "Institute of Information and Strategy" in the American civilian institutions, said in an interview with this station that the measures launched by China's plan are still to boost the economy through stimulating credit. People question. He believes that the confidence caused by insufficient internal and external demand in China is sluggish. In the final analysis, it is a political issue: "For example, now it is required to boost confidence, why can't it be boost? Now there is no confidence because China is a human society rather than a rule of law society."

Li Hengqing analyzed that the subsequent actions of the Chinese government will focus on boosting confidence rather than truly solving the problem of economy. This can only win limited space for breathing.

On Thursday, the People's Bank of China lowered the key policy interest rate, which was the first time since August last year. The above official data also shows that in May, the sales price of new commercial housing in more than 70 large and medium -sized cities in China fell from the previous month, and the sales price of second -hand housing declined from the previous month. Obviously, the real estate industry, an important reliance on China's economy, is facing overall market pressure because the people's demand for house purchase is insufficient.

** Experts: Solving the new problems with old methods **

As early as the outbreak of the international financial crisis in 2008, the then Chinese State Council Prime Minister Wen Jiabao had launched ten measures for rescue markets to stabilize the economy. The measures are expected to cost RMB 4 trillion as of the end of 2010, and the outside world interprets it as a "4 trillion plan". Compared with the multiple dilemmas faced by the current Chinese economy, Wen Jiabao's market has a relatively single market, mainly focusing on the construction of affordable housing and major infrastructure.

In the face of the danger of economic recession, will the Chinese government take the same way this time? Xie Tian, a professor at the University of South Carolina University of South Carolina, told this station that during the previous financial crisis, foreign capital was willing to invest in Chinese real estate to stabilize the economy. One way is not as effective as before.

"A large number of machinery such as railways and highways are used in infrastructure. Now infrastructure does not absorb too many people (employment)." He said that the real estate industry can provide a large number of employment positions, but because China's real estate supply is greater than demand, it can no longer release it. Multiple production capacity.

Professor Xie Tian also pointed out that the Chinese government has recently stimulated the traditional growth momentum of the economy by manipulating the devaluation of the RMB -exports, but this will cause the dissatisfaction of international trade partners and greatly increase the cost of imported medical equipment and crude oil in China. Policies do not have the possibility of long -term implementation.

The outside world noticed that unlike the economic crisis faced by Wen Jiabao's period, China's current challenges also include the deterioration of relations with the United States. risks of.

Li Hengqing analyzed that in fact, China has the same concern as the United States decoupled. He believes that in the stimulus measures launched by Beijing's plan, it is likely that the so -called chip self -reliance is the focus of support, and the fields of biotechnology and artificial intelligence will also be focused on attention.

After the news came out, it triggered various discussions.

** Isn't it unemployed for one hour every week? **

At the press conference on June 15th, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics of China introduced the statistical method of China's unemployment rate, saying that China divided the 16 -year -old population, employment, unemployment and non -labor force. When talking about the definition of "employment", he said: "According to the standards of international labor organizations, the employment population means that during the investigation reference period, it is usually one week to obtain labor remuneration or operating income for one hour or more, and Those who temporarily leave the job due to vacation and temporary stop work are employment. "

However, according to the standards announced by the International Labor Organization, the lower limit of this pair of employment statistics is actually 15 years old rather than 16.

After this news came out, it quickly became a hot topic of public opinion. As of the press release, the topic of Weibo hot search "1 hour and more in one week and more" has attracted more than 56 million reading times. Some netizens said ironically: "The rescue rate must rely on the statistical department."

There are two systems. The first set is For the internal, relatively real, how many people have died in the anti -rights and the Cultural Revolution. They say ten, I can only believe six. "

** Worker: "What is enough one hour to do one hour?" **

Fu Linghui also stated at the press conference that in general, China ’s unemployment rate this year is still at a high level. It is said that in May this year, the total number of young people aged 16-24 in China was initially estimated. About 33 million entering the labor market: "Among these more than 33 million, more than 26 million have found jobs, and about 6 million are still looking for jobs."

Many netizens believe that this statistical data of more than 6 million youths "is still looking for work" is far from actual employment. Some Weibo netizens said: "In other words, these 6 million young people have not worked for a week? Purely lying?" Some people said, "It turns out that there are some young people aged 27-24 years old, and some of them are part of the employment youth. It ’s this statistical. I work more than an hour a week, and I have income.”

The common sense of our people also separated from the lives of the people. He bluntly said that if a person works only for an hour a week: "It must be unemployed, what is enough for an hour for an hour (work)? I feel a bit nonsense."

The meeting between Xi Jinping and Bill Gates is also the first time he has met with foreign entrepreneurs in recent years. Xi Jinping showed a high -profile court of "American friend" that Bill Gates seems to be different from many foreign entrepreneurs who have recently visited China. Is this a friendly signal for foreign companies in Chinese companies?

A European company employees in China are not optimistic. He responded in a written interview in writing: "That's because he is Bill Gates, you can have high specifications. Generally, the status of small and medium -sized (foreign) enterprises will not change much, although we are still all of them are still I hope not to be too difficult. "

Prior to Bill Gates, senior executives such as Elon Musk, CEO Elon Musk, and JP Morgan Chase, also returned to China after the Chinese government adjusted and relaxed the epidemic policy after the Chinese government adjusted and relaxed the epidemic policies. access. But they were not met by Xi Jinping's high specifications.

Although Bill Gates promised when visiting Beijing's "Global Health Drug Research and Development Center (GHDDI)" on the 15th, its foundation would donate $ 50 million to the center in the next five years to develop infectious diseases. However, according to the British "Financial Times", in the situation of geopolitical tensions, Microsoft is transferring some of its best artificial intelligence researchers from China to Canada. Someone who is familiar with the plan said that this is a countermeasure in response to the rise in political conflicts in the United States and China, and at the same time, it is necessary to prevent outstanding talents from being dug by Chinese companies.

The report quoted one of the experts from the relevant research institutes that although Microsoft has a deep connection with China, "there are the best researchers here, especially those engaged in machine learning." It may be harassed by digging or employees.

Qin Peng, a political and economic expert who lives in the United States, believes that Xi Jinping's "old friend" said that he could not change the fact that foreign capital decentralized risks in China.

Qin Peng: "It is more considering the company's own income. (Gates) to invest in vaccine and drugs to work hard, it may also be good in other IT projects (for China) in China."

The outside world noticed that although foreign executives have recently traveled to China one after another, they could not erase the concerns about the suppression, supervision of the Chinese side, and the "unknown red line". Prior to this, the relevant Chinese departments suddenly visited the Shanghai Office of Bain & CO, a US consulting agency, and the authorities also implemented a network security review of the products sold by American chip manufacturers Meiguang Technology in China. In addition, an incident of a Japanese pharmaceutical employee was arrested by Chinese safety personnel. The Beijing office of Mintzgroup, a US due diligence company, was also searched by the police.

** 15. As the altar of Yonghe Palace and Huang Temple (below) ** **

"The world is still a wild place." It is an Italian writer who has experienced the new crown epidemic, saying in the book "Us in the New Time" [1]. Yes, the world of 1780 is a wild place. The 42 -year -old Panchen Lama is devoured. When I stare at the Panchen Lama statue of the Sixth World Panchen Lama in Qianlong, I can't help but feel bad about this appearance. The handsomeness, but the "Speaking Temple, Ruhuzhong" Snowfield Tibetans (from the record of the literati of the Korean envoys), are so full of suspense, and were taken away by an inexplicable so -called ceiling plague. Life is Beijing, a rich and unpredictable empire.

Yes, the world in 2021 is still a wild place, eliminating countless sentient beings. For viruses (more than one type), there is no difference in the past, present, and future. In front of the virus, it can be described as quoted in the book "The Flowers of Heaven": "Good people and bad guys are dying without differences."

One of the examples: I have been reported by Reuters on December 21, 2015. [2] disclosed "the treatment of enjoying important characters in China" in China. The Gangjian Lama, who was originally a small temple attached to a small temple affiliated to Zashlunbu Temple in Shigato. Frequently visited, he met with senior leaders in China and was entertaining at the government approved religious party. "As for why he can enjoy such special treatment? Speaking of which is a complex, long, dark story. In short, as Reuters reports the respondent: "Gangjian is a strong man with Xiong Deng, he is the most firm supporter of the Communist Party and the Chinese authorities. "The so -called" Xiong Deng Movement "was originally just a religious issue related to the ghost and god, that is, the" Xiong Deng "faith, but it is not difficult to solve. However, letting go here, and said that Gang Jian, who is not based on the Dharma, but is a limelight of the Dharma but depending on the ghosts and the power of strong power. He was killed by the new crown virus in Italy on April 18, 2020 on April 18, 2020. For his death, Tibetan society cheered. There is a humorous metaphorical comment on Sina Weibo: "After wearing a lifetime of iron crown, I changed a new crown before death." The iron crown refers to the hat of the ghosts and gods.

There is still a place I should go: Huang Temple, also known as Huang Temple and West Huang Temple, is the accidental place for the Sixth Panchen Lama, and it is another thrilling theater of the empire emperor. To be precise, it is the empire. The altar of the empire, the Emperor Kangxi, was tortured here with Ling Chi's torture and executed a Mongolian Lama who helped the King of Galdan Khan [3]. Another article pointed out that Ling Chi was not a person at that time, but three people: "... After conquering the Junggar rebellion, Kangxi ordered the Junggar Ministry to surrender the three Lama Iragick who participated in the rebellion, and" gathering the king below the king, the king of Mongolia, the king of Mongolia, the king, The Minister of Culture and Martial Arts, officials, and stabbing is equal to the Huang Temple ', which will be executed late for it. "[4] This is also too bloody, especially if the Buddhist temple is quitting the killing of the Buddha. What a fierce.

(Picture from the Internet) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-16T16-20-39-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weise/ws-06162023153823.html/66708rfa72797ea68bc48bba002.jpg)I have been sent to Beijing for many years, and I have only been to Xihuang Temple once early, but I couldn't go in. As the location of the Senior Buddhist School of the Chinese Tibetan Department of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it is usually not allowed to disturb outsiders or unrelated people. I was waiting for a living Buddha at the reception room at the entrance of Huang Si. It was a mixed scammer who had met but had a breakdown because of his opposition. The desire becomes red, obviously the heart is born. I still remember to look at the window at that time. The inside that I couldn't see clearly was not like a temple, but more like a party and government agency's courtyard. There was a silent warning over and over again: "I am not allowed to enter."

I tried to search for relevant information on the Internet, and I realized that Xibao Temple has now been opened to the public. It is called the "Xihuang Temple Museum". However Rinpoche and monks receive the time of "patriotism education". So what kind of courses do they take? Will it be necessary to listen carefully to the party members and cadres with the attitude of surrendering. Patriotic story?

Taiwan has faced the threat of military force from China to become the focus of attention from the international community. At the same time, it has been a year since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War. What kind of inspiration does this war bring to the wrestling of the United States and China in the Taiwan Strait?

[** Why did China be silent about Brinken's visit to China? Scholars: Meizhong risks focus on Taiwan **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-06132023123248.html)*** [American Legislator: Provide an alternative to regional countries to resist the threat of China](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-06142023140029.html)**

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, the Russian and Ukraine War has impacted the existing international security system. At the same time, China's threat of military force against Taiwan has been continuously upgraded, which has led to the increasingly fierce strategic competition between the United States and China. In response to Ukraine and Taiwan, they are also facing a strong threat. How will the direction of the Russian and Ukraine War affect the attitude of the United States and China on the issue of Taiwan? In the possible Taiwan Strait War, how will the United States and China be inspired by the Russian and Ukraine War?

In response to the above issues, the Atlantic Council of Washington think tanks held a seminar on Friday and invited many scholars to discuss it.

** Scholars: The Russian and Ukraine War made China -Russia partnership more stable **

At the meeting, John Kulver, a senior researcher at the Atlantic Council and former CIA senior intelligence officer, pointed out that China received three points of inspiration in the Russia and Ukraine War. First of all, the Beijing authorities believe that the United States unanimously hopes to limit China's rise regardless of party factions: "China believes that the United States is a strong hostile hegemony that is still declining but still strong. The hostility of the United States to China is regardless of the party and systemic. "

Secondly, Calver pointed out that through the Russian and Ukraine War, China is more convinced that Russia is China's main strategic partner: "China and Russia are unlikely to sign a common defense treaty, but they will strengthen cooperation in many fields, such as military integration, such as military integration , Intelligence sharing and energy trade. In this bilateral relationship, Russia is a relatively small side, especially after the Russian and Ukraine War, Russia has become weaker. Need to hinder the power of the United States through Russia. "

Karver believes that the third revelation obtained by China through the Russian and Ukraine War is to hope that European countries can obstruct and reduce the hostility of the United States to China: "Beijing hopes to adjust its foreign strategy to achieve the purpose of maintaining a friendly relationship with European countries. However, China is unwilling to condemn Russia to launch a war that makes European countries, especially Eastern Europe, and doubts the credibility of the Chinese government. "

Karver also said that after the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, Western countries have slowly imposed economic sanctions on Russia and often lacking effects, which may encourage the Chinese authorities to attack Taiwan.

At the meeting, Sarahkirchberger, a senior researcher at the Atlantic Council, pointed out from the perspective of European countries that European countries have different views on the outbreak of the Russian and U -wars. For Eastern European countries that have been invaded by Russia, they are not surprised by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but other Western European countries are awakened by Russia's ambitions.

Kirberg said that although European countries' views on Russia are not completely consistent, they have a high consensus on the role of China in the Russian and Ukraine War: "(European countries) regarding China as a hidden supporter of Russia because China is unwilling to condemn the Russian and Ukraine War, and even unwilling to call the Russian and Ukraine War a 'war'. At the same time, China also calls Russia's invasion as Russia's response to NATO expansion. Such a statement cannot persuade European countries. "

Kirberg pointed out that China ’s favorable position of Russia has led European countries to depart from China, but China cannot afford the cost of losing European countries. Therefore, China is actively wanting to re -relax the relationship with European countries through diplomatic means:" China seems to be unable to Really understand how big European countries are in China. "** Scholars: To deal with the Taiwan Strait and the United States, the United States should be clear and strong in the United States. **

In response to the inspiration of the Russian and Ukrainian war for the potential Taiwan Strait conflict, Kirberg specifically made three policy suggestions to the US government. First of all, Kirberg believes that before the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, European countries' scarcation of Russia was not tough enough, and it still relied on Russia's energy. Will send troops to Taiwan ', the purpose is to maintain transparency and reduce hostility. However, this may pass the error message of' the United States will not counterattack 'and encourage China to attack Taiwan. "

Secondly, Kirberg pointed out that China may launch a war in non -traditional methods such as blockade and information warfare in Taiwan, which will make it more difficult for the United States and allies to respond. Therefore, the United States should prepare for various situations in advance: "Like Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Ukraine, it obviously violates the UN Charter. It is difficult to be defined, which will make it difficult for allies to cooperate. Therefore, we recommend that you continue to push various situations of the Taiwan Strait, so as to deal with various possible attacks. "

Kirberg also pointed out that Russia's current partnership with China is quite strong. Therefore, Western countries should not focus on differentiation of China and Russia, but should continue to maintain diplomatic communication channels with China to avoid the Taiwan Strait War from misjudging due to misjudgment. break out.

In addition to the so -called "private friendship" of more than 20 years from Fujian to Zhejiang to Beijing, more important thing is that Cai Qi has implemented Xi Jinping's instructions during the main administration of Beijing. In the special operation of cleaning the low -end population, he did not hesitate to scold Xi Jinping's fame and back black pot, showing his absolute loyalty to Xi Jinping with practical actions.

Since the closing of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October last year and the First Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the outside world's attention to the second leader of the new party work, that is, the role of Cai Qi, who played the role of "Deputy Secretary", is far higher than the leader of the administrative leader. Li Qiang's curiosity, who replaced the post of Prime Minister of the State Council of Li Keqiang ---- Especially Cai Qi first served as the director of the Central Office as the Standing Committee of the Politburo, and was then announced as the vice chairman of the National Security Commission.

Mr. Wang Youqun's article "The Epoch Times" article "Xi Jinping's power of power can trust the power of power? "The analysis said: Recently, [Xi Jinping](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E4%B9%A0%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3.html)Conscience [Cai Qi](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E8%94%A1%E5%A5%87.html)Usually part -time jobs have attracted widespread attention at home and abroad. This aspect shows that [Cai Qi](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E8%94%A1%E5%A5%87.html)Special trust in Xi; on the other hand, it also shows that there are very few people who can trust the top of power. For Xi, this is not a good thing, but a huge crisis hidden. After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the "Xi Family Army" was fully positioned. From the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, to the Standing Committee of the Politburo, to the Central Secretariat, to the Central Military Commission, the key positions were Xi. But how many people are really assured?

Wang Youqun's article said: According to the past practice of the Communist Party of China, Li Qiang should be the second figure of the Communist Party of China. However, Cai Qi, who ranked fifth among the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, has a series of key positions. In addition to the first secretary of the Central Secretariat, in March of this year, Cai Qi unexpectedly served as the director of the Central Office and became the first person to be the director of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China in 74 years. In April this year, Cai Qi was also an exception to concurrently served as the vice chairman of the National Security Council. Earlier, the vice chairman of the National Security Commission was two, and the chairman of the National People's Congress and the Premier of the State Council took up. Now it has increased to three people, highlighting Xi's reliance on Cai Qi ...

In addition, Cai Qi also has a series of titles, such as the leader of the Central Propaganda and Thought Group, the leader of the Central Party Construction Leading Group, the leader of the "Xi Thought" theme education leading group, etc., in charge of the CCP ideology, publicity machinery, etc.

But in fact, whether it is today's Cai Qi, the previous Wang Huning, or the last Liu Yunshan ... as the Standing Committee of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Party, he served as the Secretary of the Central Secretariat (1). The leaders of the Fang several leadership groups have been formed since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and they are also the director of the Central Office as the Standing Committee of the Politburo.

At that time, Wang Dongxing, who was around Mao Zedong, after the death of Mao Zedong, he was promoted to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the vice chairman of the Party Central Committee. The director of the editor committee, the first deputy principal of the Central Party School, and other positions. The process of Wang Dongxing was stepped down by Deng Xiaoping in the future, and in December 1978, in December 1978, in [the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%85%B1%E7%94%A2%E9%BB%A8%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E5%B1%86%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E5%A7%94%E5%93%A1%E6%9C%83%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1%E5%85%A8%E9%AB%94%E6%9C%83%E8%AD%B0)It was criticized by the name and was announced to be exempted from [General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E5%8A%9E%E5%85%AC%E5%8E%85)Director's position, after more than a year, was only in February 1980, in the [Fifth Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee] in February 1980](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E5%B1%86%E4%BA%94%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%A8%E6%9C%83)He was "approved to resign" and was "approved".

Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" has an article analysis: There are many "exceptions" of the 20th personnel of the Communist Party of China, but the biggest exception is that the Standing Committee of the Politburo Standing Committee Cai Qi served as the director of the Central Office. Although Wang Dongxing served as the director of the Central Office as the Director of the Central Office as the Vice Chairman of the Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the Politburo in 1977. Compared with Cai Qi, the situation of the two is still different. The path of the members and members has risen to the high level, and it is essentially different with Cai Qi as the director of the Politburo Standing Committee.In the late October last year, the Twenty CPC Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was closed on the second day. The American Voice -over website published the article "The Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cai Qi with the faith of Xi Zhong, not talent and the success of the political achievements", saying that it was Cai Qi, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, The CCP system is also a legend. When he took over as the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee in January 2017, he was not even a member of the CPC Central Committee. In October of that year, he became a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the leader of the party and the state. This year, the Communist Party of China held the 20th National Congress, and no one expected that he would enter the same way, but he went further, and became a member of the Supreme Seven Politburo Politburo chosen by Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee. Many observers believe that the reason why Cai Qi can be unexpected is actually not his political achievements, but the friendship that he and Xi Jinping formed in Fujian and Zhejiang for 20 years.

Speaking of the so -called "private friendship" of Xi Jinping and Cai Qi for 20 years, we must no longer emphasize the content I have introduced in the relevant articles of last month, that is, after the introduction of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee The outside world emphasized that Li Qiang and Ding Xuexiang's former Xi Jinping's "big secrets" characters mostly emphasized, but few people were paying attention to Xi Jinping's "big secret" of Xi Jinping.

The Chinese living in the United States may know the story of "Fuqing Gang". In Baidu Encyclopedia, it says: "It is active in overseas to oppress the local overseas Chinese [Chinese] [Chinese](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA/879778?fromModule=lemma_inlink)[Gangster](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%BB%91%E5%B8%AE/74477?fromModule=lemma_inlink)At first, the criminals overseas [Fuqing](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%A6%8F%E6%B8%85/624276?fromModule=lemma_inlink)People compose, so it is called ‘Fuqing Gang’. "

In the Chinese Communist Party's politics, there is also a "blessing gang", but the "green" here is "the" "Qing" Qing "" Qing "Qing" Qing "Qing" Qing ", instead of the Tsinghua University of Tsinghua University, who received Xi Jinping as a student of workers, peasants and soldiers. "clear".

The "Fuqing Gang" on the officialdom of the Communist Party of China refers to the so -called "knowledge youth" experience of "going up the mountain and going to the countryside", and then a group of people on the grassroots or middle levels in Fujian. Of course Xi Jinping. Members include Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, He Lifeng, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and Wang Xiaohong, Secretary of the Central Secretariat.

Among them, Cai Qi was born in December 1955. At the age of 18, he became a "educated youth". At the age of 20, he joined the Communist Party of China and was recommended as "workers, peasants and soldiers", and entered the Department of Political Education of Fujian Normal University.

In the same year, it was recommended as "workers, peasants and soldiers" in Fujian Province. Chen Xi's luck was better than Cai Qi. He was recommended to enter Beijing. He was fortunate to have become a brothers up and down with the son of the CCP revolutionary veteran Xi Zhongxun in the Department of Chemical Engineering of Tsinghua University.

Cai Qi stayed in school with a political worker cadre in June 1978 with a "ordinary class" completion certificate of a paper university. As for his official resume, the "Ph.D. degree" graduated from the School of Economics and Economics of Fujian Normal University School of Economics and Law, is the same price as Xi Jinping's "doctoral degree in law" of Tsinghua University!

After Cai Qi stayed in school in 1978, he served as the secretary of the party committee secretary of the school. It was recommended to enter the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee for 5 years. In the years when the secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and the full -time deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Cai Qi, who was one of the deputy directors of the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee, was clearly "serving the comrades of the service". Then, whether it is a prefecture -level party committee secretary or the recommendation of becoming a cross -provincial exchange cadre from the Central Organization Department, Xi Jinping is arranged and designed by Cai Qi. This is why Xi Jinping first thought of Tsai Qi to himself after the establishment of the National Security Council. reason.

Recalling the content of the personnel arrangements of all deputy national levels at the 19th National Congress of the 19th National Congress held in October 2017, one of the most typical representatives of the "new army of Zhijiang", one of the examples of Xi Jinping's strength, The "three -level jump" has jumped from the "double non -" political bureau members of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Previously, in May 2017, the first five months of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, after the mayor of Beijing, the mayor of Beijing, was announced as the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. There are some "big things late" on the career. In 2010, when Cai Qi was 55 years old, he ranked among the deputy ministerial level and served as member of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and Organization of the Communist Party of China. At the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2012, Cai Qi did not enter the Central Committee, which is the "double non -central committee member, non -central alternate member) officials called public opinion ... From November 2013 to the announcement of taking over as the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Cai Qi's position has changed 5 times in less than 4 years. In November 2013, Cai Qi served as executive deputy governor of Zhejiang Province; in March 2014, he was transferred to the full -time deputy director of the Office of the National Security Council; in April 2015, he was promoted to the executive deputy director of the Office of the National Security Commission and became a ministerial -level member; 2016 10 Monthly served as the mayor of Beijing; now he is the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee as the mayor of Beijing. It took more than two years to complete the leap from the "Double African" deputy ministerial level to the deputy national level, but in fact, this Cai Qi was promoted to the deputy provincial and ministerial level in 2007, and the specific position was the mayor of Hangzhou. Because Hangzhou is the so -called deputy provincial -level "planned unified city", its mayor and the municipal party secretary are deputy provincial and ministerial levels.

In fact, in the Central Political Bureau of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October 2017, Xi Jinping's direct political confidence in Zhejiang period was arranged in four in the Zhejiang period. Chen Miner.

Among them, Chen Minle was promoted to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee when Xi Jinping arrived in Zhejiang. To deputy provincial and ministerial level. The promotion of the deputy provincial and ministerial levels, such as the two people, were Cai Qi and Huang Kunming, who were announced within two months of Xi Jinping's departure from Zhejiang.

The story that happened was that Chen Minle, who was 5 years younger than Cai Qi, was arranged as a central alternate member with Xi Jinping to enter the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in October 2017. Five years later, Chen Minle rose as members of the Central Committee in the 18th of the Communist Party of China. As of this, Cai Qi is still the so -called "double non -".

After the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, although Cai Qi at that time was already a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Chen Minle and Ding Xuexiang, who were two years younger than Chen Miner, determined that in those years Among the top 20 high -level personnel analysis content of the Communist Party of China, the successors of Wang Huning's "Deputy Secretary" are concentrated on Chen Miner or Ding Xuexiang, and almost no one is optimistic about Cai Qi.We have introduced it more than once in the past related articles: Mao Zedong's class struggle thinking mode has long been "engraved in mind and melted in the blood. "Everyone who opposes the enemy must support it. We must oppose that" class struggle "thinking of" being opposed to the enemy rather than a bad thing "is a cadre judging standard for Xi Jinping's" classes "thinking of" being opposed to the enemy. " Essence

People still remember the huge and unmanned "special operation of low -end population" launched by Cai Qi in Beijing.

At that time, there was an article on the Internet titled "The wind direction has changed!" The article that Boom Cai Qi turned into a counterattack Xi Jinping "said that the administrative mistakes of the Beijing authorities should be criticized, especially Cai Qisang, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, bears a certain responsibility. However, what was unexpected to all circles was that the incident continued to ferment, and the public letter required Cai Qi to resign on the Internet. Some liberal leaders also stood up and bombarded Cai Qi. Or fortunately, some people also proposed to hold the responsibility of using Cai Qi. Obviously, the wind direction has begun to change, and from the discussion of the livelihood of people's livelihood, it has begun to develop in the direction of the personnel route struggle. As we all know, Cai Qi is the representative of Jiang Xinjun, which is reused by Xi Jinping, rose from the deputy ministerial level to the deputy national level within five years. Directed, questioned ... In a sense, the political cannon bombarded this round of outline is facing Cai Qi, but Xi Jinping is really attacked. The drunkard is not wine.

At that time, the author also analyzed in the text of our free Asia: "Can't judge whether the" open letter "that Cai Qi resigned is true and whether it has been passed to Xi Jinping’s ears. If it is, the result must further strengthen Xi Jinping's dependence on Cai Qi’s dependence and Yiyi It is not the opposite. At that time, Cai Qi himself also published an article in the People's Daily: Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping inspected Beijing twice and delivered an important speech. The capital work made a series of important instructions to point out the direction for us ... We must take the important thoughts of General Secretary Xi as the head of the case, tool book, and motto, deeply study with feelings, deeply grasp the spiritual essence, ideological essence, and core essence, and further promote the implementation of the Beijing -China land and form a vivid practice.

Cai Qi's remarks can also prove that what Cai Qi did after the 19th National Congress of Cai Qi in Beijing, especially the "cleaning low -end population" is acting, which is equivalent to using Xi Jinping on the so -called "big and wrong" issue. Essence It also gave birth to Xi Jinping's decision to promote Cai Qi again and arrange for his ministers.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

People who knew the situation of the couple had now confirmed that they died in prison during his sentence. In addition, according to the US prohibition of imports related to slavery, the French Senate recently approved a bill of seeking the EU version. The US Congress proposed a two -party bill, giving priority to the Uyghur refugee status. A supporter said that "the United States cannot refuse those who escape from this persecution." In this episode, we will learn about the relevant situation together. The conversation of relevant people was recorded by Anke.

According to sources, Hagi Ahong and his wife bought Hepipiham as a resident in Bachu County, Kashgar. The authorities arrested them on the grounds of "illegal" religious activities in 2017. They were sentenced to 10 years in 2019 in Tumutuk Prison.

The prison is imprisoned for other people who have been arrested at the famous Uighurs and ordinary Uighurs in 2017. The authorities have detained them in the "re -education" camp and prison. Discover in religious activities abroad.

The Chinese government has been severely criticized by the international community for seriously infringement of Muslims' rights (including forced labor).

Several Western Parliament, including the German Federal House, has announced that these infringements have constituted racial extinction or harm to human beings.

According to an exile from Tumutuk in Radio Asia's earlier report, the Tumutuk prison authorities released several detained Uyghur bodies. A week secretly died in prison.

Based on this information, Radio Free Asia confirmed that the body of the Uyghur motorcycle repairman bought the Memettursun Metniyaz belongs to one of the remains returned to his relatives. The resident of Bachu County went to the Micathards in Saudi Arabia many years ago. In early 2017, he was imprisoned for completing the Micia's pilgrimage journey.

The Bachu County Police, which was contacted by Radio Free Asia, also confirmed that one week before the Eid holiday, the body of the death prisoner had returned to their family, but they said they did not know the exact number or cause of death.

A staff member of the Bachu County Police Department demanded anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. He told Radio Liberty Radio in Tumukuk's prisoner who had died in prison. One of the family.

The staff member also said that there have been rumors that the prisoners who died before the holiday had eaten contaminated food in prison, but Radio Free Asia could not determine the authenticity of the news.

Another employee of the Bachu County Police Department confirmed that Harji Ahong, who was in his 70s, and his 60 -year -old wife have been serving in prison since 2019. she says,

"They are old couples. Both died."

In addition, a recently submitted to the US Senate will force enterprises to disclose the connection between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the forced Uighurs to work, and provide funds for those who escape from Xinjiang to counterattack the Chinese government's propaganda.

Earlier, the French Senate passed a bill, which urged the European Union to follow the ban on the United States prohibiting the import of goods related to Uighur labor. French legislators said that the ban has entered the European single market for many such commodities.

According to a press release, in addition to the request to submit documents to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the new bill of the US Senate will also expand existing travel restrictions on Chinese officials related to ethnic extinction, and will "counterattack the broadcast plan for China to propagate". Provide further funds.

The Uyghur racial extinction accountability and sanctions bill proposed by the Florida Republican Senator Mark Rubio and the Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merckley will also provide funds for the ongoing Uyghur culture and language protection projects.

Rubio said in the press release: "On the basis of the current legislation, the two -hospital bill aims to strengthen the second -level sanctions that provide assistance to Uighurs for the Communist Party of China to the Communist Party of China."

Rubio and Merckley said that if the draft of the bill is passed, it will help fill the loopholes in the 2021 "Uighurs Forced Labor Prevention Law" and further punish those who profit from Uyghur slave labor.

However, to be a law, it must first be approved by the Senate's committee, then vote in the Senate, and then obtained the House of Representatives.(ChrisSmith)support.

On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, French Senator approved a resolution on May 31, calling on the European version of the "Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Law" to prohibit imports related to slavery.

Mélanie Vogel, the European Ecological -Green Party, representatives living abroad, told Liberty Radio that her party proposed to put legislation to pressure EU officials.

In the single market in Europe, 27 EU member states have no right to unilaterally change trade policies, and the EU unified import and export laws. Vogel said,

"This resolution is basically required to introduce a very effective mechanism in the EU. It is forbidden to use the level of forced labor manufacturing. Basically, it requires the French government to promote this position in the European Union.

Vogle said that the EU's existing proposal on this issue only proves that the goods are related to slavery in a wide range of legal procedures, and then seek to prohibit imported goods. However, she said that the French Senate tended to implement the ban on the "mechanism introduced by the United States". The ban assumes that the commodities made in Xinjiang involve slave labor. Vogel said,

"Therefore, the responsibility for proof is on the company who wants to export goods to the EU market, rather than human rights activists to prove that there is indeed a violation of human rights. They must prove that they have not used forced labor.""Products made by Uyghur forced labor that cannot enter the United States are entering the European market. This is why it is extremely important to pass such legislation in Europe. Pressure is very important. In order to have a real impact, all 27 EU members need to pass a unified legislation. "

It is also reported that the US Congress has recently proposed a two -party bill in Congress, which will give priority to the Uighurs who have escaped the persecution of China.

The bill will designate Uighurs and other ethnic groups persecuted by the Chinese government as a second priority or P-2, and speed up their ability to apply for shelter in the United States.

One of the sponsor of the Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act, from the Virginia Democratic Representative, Jenniferwkson, said, "The Uyghur and other ethnic minorities faced in the hands of the Chinese government. The persecution ignores it. "

In addition to Wickston, the Florida Republicans Maria Elvila Saracha, New York Democratic Democratic Personal Reagoli Micks, Virginia Democratic Democratic Democratic Democrat Representatives proposed the bill on June 7.

The title of P-2 is a Uyghur who has been oppressed by China for expressing political views and religious beliefs or participating in political, religious and cultural activities. Those who are designated will receive special humanitarian help and will be re -resettled and the US asylum procedures.

The bill also sought to protect Uyghur refugees from countries outside the United States, and preferentially considers the diplomatic efforts of the United States in countries that usually face huge pressure from the Chinese government to extradite Uighurs back to China.

On the occasion of this move, the Uyghur Human Rights Organization called on the international community to take specific actions to oppose the right to seriously violate the Muslim group of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

China's suppression of Xinjiang Uyghur and other Turkic minorities can be investigated. The Uighurs are detained, torture, sexual assault, forced labor, and the separation of Uyghur children from the parents from the prison in the "re -education" camp. It is reported by hand report.

In the statement, Micks said: "The United States cannot simply condemn Beijing's ethnic extinction and pat their backs." "We are responsible for morality and international responsibilities to provide those who try to escape from the Chinese government's atrocities in Xinjiang assistance.

"It is the right way to provide expanded refugee protection to Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, and it is also a clear way to prove that the United States is consistent with human rights and deeds on human rights issues."

Ruxian Abbas, director of the Uyghur Movement Executive of Human Rights Organization, said that the introduction of the bill is a key step in solving the dilemma of the Uyghur.

"As early as 2020, when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged that China was extinct for the Uighurs and committed harm to human beings, it should have happened. At least, the most important thing is to formulate a bill to help speed up to speed up it. Uyghur asylum cases that have lived in the United States for many years and have been waiting for case resolution for a long time. "

The President of the World Uyghur Congress Dorin Aisha said that the passage of the bill will be the "important milestone" of the Canadian government after accepting 10,000 Uighur refugees, and provides encouragement for Uighurs who escape from China to other countries.

In February of this year, the Canadian Parliament unanimously adopted a motion for the reorganization of Uighur refugees in Canada to respond to the Chinese government forcibly repatriated the Muslim group members to repatriate China because they may be persecuted in China.

The Canadian government re -resettlement with Uyghur from other countries, not directly from China, and the plan is expected to begin in 2024.
