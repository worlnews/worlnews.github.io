<p>Blessing</p>
<p><strong> A former Chinese government senior scientist told BBC that the possibility of leaking the new coronary virus from the laboratory should not be ruled out. </strong></p>
<p>As the director of the China Disease Prevention and Control Center, Professor Gao Fu played an important role in the response and traceability of the epidemic.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has denied any statement that this disease may originate from Wuhan Laboratory.</p>
<p>But Professor Gao was not straightforward. **</p>
<p>In an interview with the BBC Broadcast Four Podcast "Heat: Finding the Origin of the New Crown Virus", Professor Gao said: "You can always doubt anything. This is science. Don't rule out any possibility."</p>
<p>Professor Gao is a world -class virusist and immunologist. After retiring from the China Disease Prevention and Control Center last year, he is currently the deputy director of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.</p>
<p>Professor Gao also told the BBC that the Chinese government conducted some formal investigation on the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which may show that the Chinese government's attention to the theory of laboratory leakage theory is higher than its official statement.</p>
<p>"The government organized some things," he said, but his own department of China CDC did not participate.</p>
<p>We asked him to clarify whether this means that another government's department officially searched the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. The Wuhan Virus Research Institute is one of the top national laboratories in China. The laboratory is said to have spent several years studying coronary virus.</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied, "That laboratory has been inspected by experts in this field."</p>
<p>This is the first time that the official recognition has conducted a certain form of investigation, but Professor Gao said that although he did not see the results of the investigation, he "heard" confirmed that the laboratory was innocent.</p>
<p>"I think they concluded that they followed all the agreement. They did not find any improper behavior."</p>

<p>Wuhan Virus Research Institute</p>
<p>It is almost certain that the virus of the new crown epidemic originated from bats.</p>
<p>But how it was uploaded from the bat to us a more controversial question, there were two main possibilities from the beginning.</p>
<p>One is that the virus spreads to humans from the naturally of the bat, and may pass through other animals. Many scientists say a large amount of evidence shows that this is the most likely situation.</p>
<p>However, other scientists say that there is no sufficient evidence to eliminate the main possibility: the virus infection with people participating in research is to better understand the threat of nature virus.</p>
<p>These two may be at the core of geopolitical politics, a bunch of conspiracy theories, and one of the most political and harmful scientific debates in our era.</p>
<p>We explained this difficult but very important issue through interviews with some top scientists from all parties in the debate and a highly secure laboratory report from the streets of Wuhan to a highly secure laboratory in the United States.</p>
<p>At the time of January 2020, Professor Wang Linfa, a scientist in Singapore, visited the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. At that time, he was the honorary professor of the institute.</p>
<p>He told the BBC that a colleague at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute has always worried about the possibility of the laboratory leak, but she can rule out this possibility.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T01-33-51.000Z/_129875695_2gettyimages-643961442.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Shi Zhengli</p>
<p>Wang Linfa is a professor of infectious diseases professor of infectious diseases professors at the National University of Medicine, the National University of Singapore, and regularly cooperates with Professor Shi Zhengli, a professor of the same professional professor of Wuhan Virus Research Institute.</p>
<p>They are old friends and the top experts in the world studying Bat Crown Viruses. Therefore, they have won the nickname of Batman and Bat Girl.</p>
<p>Professor Wang said that Professor Shi told him that she was "insomnia for a day or two" because she was worried that "there was a sample she didn't know in her laboratory, but it contained viruses, polluted something, and then ran out" Essence</p>
<p>But he said that she checked her sample and found that they did not contain evidence that caused the virus that caused the new crown virus or any other virus sufficient to cause the epidemic.</p>
<p>He also said that Professor Shi or anyone in her team "could not" conceal the fact that they found the laboratory leak evidence, because they performed like nothing happened, including going out to eat and planned to sing karaoke.</p>
<p>The decrypted American intelligence now shows that several researchers at the Virus Institute are sick in the fall of 2019, and the symptoms are "consistent with the new crown virus and the common seasonal diseases."</p>
<p>But Professor Wang told us that he suggested that Professor Shi collected blood samples from her team in January 2020 to see if they have new crown virus antibodies. He said that she heard his suggestions that all the test results were negative.</p>
<p>Some scientists believe that the vast majority of evidence shows that the virus is spread to humans in a market in Wuhan. Professor Wang is one of them.</p>

<p>Wuhan China Seafood Market</p>
<p>There are far more things sold in Wuhan Wainan Seafood market than its name implies, including wild mammals. The market is related to many early cases, and these cases are people who work or shopping in the South China seafood market.</p>
<p>Although China's performance is obviously lacking transparency, these scientists have said that there are sufficient information, such as data from early cases and the environmental sampling of the Chinese market, which can exclude the possibility of laboratory leakage.</p>
<p>In fact, this definition claim exists from the beginning, the most obvious is in a paper in March 2020. This paper has become one of the largest reading and controversial scientific papers in the Internet era.</p>
<p>"Sars-Cov-2 (SARS-COV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome" is written by some of the most outstanding scientists in the field of virology and new diseases. The assumption is credible. "</p>
<p>It supports a view that this view is quickly popular in many media reports, that is, the laboratory leak is a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>But an author of the paper stated in the podcast that he is now doubting the credibility of the previous conclusion.</p>
<p>Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, has tracked diseases around the world for a long time, including China, where he has established close connections.</p>
<p>He is also a scientific consultant of Hollywood blockbuster "Infectious Disease".Although he still believes that the market is still the most reasonable explanation of the source of the new crown virus, and does not believe that the virus is deliberately designed, he does not think that all laboratories or research possibilities can be ruled out.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T01-33-51.000Z/_129875481_2img_3255.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Ian Lipin</p>
<p>He took the initiative to propose his theory, referring to another laboratory in Wuhan, which was managed by the Wuhan Disease Prevention and Control Center, which was only a few hundred meters away from the South China Seafood market.</p>
<p>According to Chinese news reports, the laboratory participated in the work of collecting thousands of blood and stool samples from wild bats. These studies are sometimes carried out without wearing appropriate protection equipment, which is obviously risk of infection.</p>
<p>"People who work there may be infected when collecting bats in the cave," said Professor Lipjin. When he participated in writing the paper in March 2020, he did not know the laboratory and his work.</p>
<p>Professor Lipjin pointed out that the South China Seafood Market is a further analysis of the origin of the virus -including the research on the evidence of raccoon dogs in the market recently -it cannot solve the origin of the origin.</p>
<p>He said that this virus may "originate from the market and is magnified in the market."</p>
<p>On the surface, Professor Gao's remarks about the leakage of the laboratory seem to be seriously inconsistent with China's public statement.</p>
<p>"The so -called 'laboratory leakness' is a lie composed of anti -China forces. This is due to political motivation and no scientific basis," said in a statement in a statement.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, the two sides may have more common points.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has been promoting a strange and unconfirmed third theory in propaganda.</p>
<p>It says that this virus does not come from the laboratory or market, but may be brought into the country through frozen food packaging.</p>
<p>The Chinese government said that it excluded the possibility of laboratory and the market, and Professor Gao's remarks could be simply regarded as a more scientific version of the position because he excluded these two possibilities. Both are based on lack of evidence.</p>
<p>"We really don't know where the virus comes from ... this problem is still not resolved," Professor Gao told BBC.</p>
<p>Scientists argue, sometimes the issue of fierce controversy is really no conclusion.</p>
<p>However, at least outside China, one thing is widely consistent: China does not do enough in searching for evidence or sharing evidence.</p>
<p>Although this seems to be a simple problem, it is by no means.</p>
<p>Where does the new crown virus come from?</p>
<p>The answer is very important to everyone who dies, to those who suffer from suffering, to those who continue to suffer.</p>

<p>I often ask about cryptocurrency seminars, once when I said that cryptocurrencies should not be used as currencies. I said at the time that the only reason to use it beyond speculation was to buy drugs on the Internet. The questioner retorted that the statement was too ridiculous, and the use of cryptocurrencies was far more than that.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency pursuers believe that claiming it is wrong to help criminal acts, because this technology itself is "neutral", so no illegal activities can be blamed for it. But this is not a fact at all: cryptocurrencies are a payment mechanism designed to avoid censorship. Cryptocurrency transactions will not receive fraud detection, anti -money laundering or suspicious activities as traditional transactions. Operation outside the system is the reason for its existence. Just see how the cryptocurrency industry runs, it will know that being used for crime is not its loopholes, but its characteristics.</p>

<p>There are many mosque in Yunnan Province (information picture)</p>
<p><strong> Recently, news from the Internet was reported that the Arab -style appearance of a mosque in Yunnan Province, China was forcibly demolished by the authorities. During construction, local Muslim residents came to try to stop and conflict with the police. </strong></p>
<p>[Video fragment] circulating on social media(https://twitter.com/accelflopping/status/1662427172903227397?s=20)It is shown that dozens of people are pushing a push with police officers with riot equipment and shields in the Naming Mosque outside Tonghai County, Yuxi City, Yunnan, trying to break through the police line. During this period, someone threw objects to the police.</p>
<p>Some people in the video background sound said, "That's how it is dealt with the people."</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that an unnamed woman at the scene said that the authorities tried to forcibly demolish some buildings. Want to destroy it? "</p>
<p>BBC cannot independently verify the factual details of the scene.</p>
<p>China's official news seems to be confirmed that the incident occurred last Saturday (May 27). Local police on May 28th <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_PRJaWAir5I9FctxLppmow">Report</a>It is said that "a case that seriously hindered the order of social management in Nagu Town, Tonghai County", and called on those involved in the case to "surrender" before June 6 to strive for "large treatment".</p>
<p>The conflict is accused of being related to the demolition of the mosque for the authorities. The local court made a judgment in 2020, saying that the reconstruction of the mosque was illegal and ordered the demolition.</p>
<p>According to the data, the Narcades Mosque was built in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty. It has been rebuilt several times for several centuries. The existing mosque was built in 2004. There are four mission towers and a dome, which can accommodate thousands of people at the same time.</p>
<p>The mosque was listed as the county's cultural relics protection unit in 2018.</p>
<p>The Washington Post quoted local activists that the authorities suspected that the authorities had cut off the local mobile network services at one time, and the local phone on Monday was transferred to a message mailbox.</p>
<p>Tonghai County Police said in a report on Sunday that the incident caused "bad social impact", which will severely crack down, and "encourage and protect" the public to actively report.</p>
<h3>"Religious Sinicization"</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T07-06-34.000Z/_129938133_gettyimages-1232857239.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>In recent years, China has stepped up its political controls on religious groups and individuals, and listed "in -depth promotion of Chinese religion Sinicization" as a clear requirement for united front work.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized at the National Religious Conference in 2021 that it is necessary to guide and support Chinese religion with the core values of socialism as a leader to enhance the recognition of the Chinese nation and the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>At the end of May, China launched an online information query system for Islam, Catholicism, and Christian faculty as certification management methods for religious faculty.</p>
<p>It is reported that the system has strengthened the monitoring of religious people in China.</p>
<p>In recent years, the official narrative of religious Chineseization has particularly emphasized the alert of "the danger of using religious penetration" and "religious demands with political intention".</p>
<p>After Xi Jinping came to power, he has always stated that he must "resolutely resist" that overseas forces use religion to infiltrate and prevent religious extreme ideological violations.</p>
<p>The most prominent and attracted international concern is the [processing method] for the Xinjiang Uyghur Muslims in the northwest(https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-48718848)Essence</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities have established a large number of "re -education camps" to "transform ideas" for Muslims, claiming to remove the penetration of extreme ideas of terrorism.</p>
<p>The UN Human Rights Report said that China ’s approach to Uighurs and other Muslim communities is“ serious violations of human rights ”.</p>
<p>AFP quoted DavidStroup, an expert at the University of Manchester, the University of Manchester, in the United Kingdom, saying that although these practices have a small impact on the community outside Xinjiang, many mosques have been "forced to be converted." In line with the official definition of Sinicization.</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia quoted a Chinese Christian Mr. King: "The Christian church cross is almost dismantled. The next step is to other religions. The mosques is demolished like a Christian church disassembling the cross. Now it is necessary to further rectify religion outside Christianity. "</p>
<p>The reader of Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" Sowe Ho left a message under the report: "Sinicization should be negotiated instead of request."</p>
<p>The Hui nationality is one of the 56 domestic nations recognized by the Chinese government, mainly Sunni Muslims. It is reported that there are about 10 million Hui Muslims in China, of which 700,000 live in Yunnan Province.</p>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence III: Why does scientists jointly regulate AI technology that can lead to human extinction</h3>
<p>May 31, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129750600_1.jpg"></a>Image source, getty images</p>
<p><strong> Experts including OPENAI and Google DeepMind have warned that artificial intelligence may lead to human extinction, but how can machines replace humans? </strong></p>
<p>Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to answer questions or generate text or even code according to the needs of users, has become the fastest -growing Internet application in history.</p>
<p>In just two months, its active users have reached 100 million. According to the technology monitoring company Sensor Town, Instagram spent two and a half years to reach this milestone.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129937053_8170a6fd-eb4b-403d-a91c-f8e20a055f54.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The emergence of the ChatGPT application has triggered a fierce debate on how to ensure the security of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>OpenAI's popularity developed by Microsoft's funding is popular, which has triggered a fierce speculation of artificial intelligence affecting human future.</p>
<p>Dozens of experts support a statement published on the PentaFETy webpage of the Artificial Intelligence Safety, saying that "reducing the risk of extinction caused by artificial intelligence should become the world with the risks of other society such as epidemic and nuclear war, which should be the world to become global Priority. "</p>
<p>But some people said that this concern was exaggerated.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129909169_52679ebf-69bf-420e-9cb5-d8293c6c1c07.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<h3>人</h3>
<p>Chatgpt, Dall-E, BARD, and AlphaCode (from prose, poetry, and jokes to computer code) and images (such as charts, photos and artworks), which are almost the same as human works, are difficult to distinguish.</p>
<p>Students use it to write homework, and politicians use it to write a speech. Democratic Representative, Jake AUchincloss, launched this resource in the US Congress.</p>
<p>Technology giant IBM said that 7,800 positions can be treated by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>If all these changes are overwhelmed, then prepare:</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The more advanced artificial intelligence, the more capable of replacing our work.</p>
<p>We are only in the first stage of artificial intelligence, and there are two stages that are coming. Some scientists are afraid that this may threaten human survival.</p>
<p>The following are three stages.</p>
<h3>1 . Weak artificial intelligence (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)</h3>
<p>Weak artificial intelligence is also known as artificial intelligence in limited fields, focuses on single tasks, and perform duplicate work in a series of functions.</p>
<p>It usually learns from a large amount of data, such as learning from the Internet, but only in a specific field of programming.</p>
<p>An example is the chess program that can defeat the world champion, but cannot perform other tasks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129938135_3.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Weak artificial intelligence can surpass humans, but only in specific fields.</p>
<p>This technology is used everywhere on smartphones. From GPS maps, to understanding your taste and proposed music and video program.</p>
<p>Even more complicated systems, such as unmanned cars and ChatGPTs, are weak artificial intelligence forms. They cannot operate outside the scope of the setting, so they cannot make decisions by themselves.</p>
<p>However, some experts believe that being programmed as a system with automatic learning functions, such as ChatGPT or Autogpt, may enter the next development stage.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129937206_a386a24d-dd44-4d04-b432-365b3aa6ca3a.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>

<h3>2 .</h3>
<p>When the machine can complete any intelligence task that humans can complete, artificially universal intelligence(Artificial General Intelligence)It will arrive.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129758642_4.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>General artificial intelligence means that machines have the same intelligence as humans.</p>
<p>It is also called "strong artificial intelligence".</p>
<p><strong> 6 months of pause </strong></p>
<p>In March 2023, more than 1,000 technical experts called on "the training of all artificial intelligence laboratories immediately suspended at least 6 months than the more powerful artificial intelligence system than GPT-4", GPT-4 is the latest version of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Other technology giants including Apple co -founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk wrote: "The artificial intelligence system with intelligence with human beings may be on society. It is deeply risky with humans. "Musk was one of the co -founders of Openai, and later resigned from the board of directors due to inconsistent opinions with the company's leadership.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129909163_openaigettyimages-1245391789.jpg" />Image source, getty images<strong> "Both smart and stupid" </strong></p>
<p>Carissavéliz, the Institute of Artificial Intelligence Ethics at the University of Oxford, signed the letter. However, she believes that the statement of the warning of the Artificial Intelligence Safety Center was too much, so she decided not to sign.</p>
<p>"The artificial intelligence we are currently developing is both smart and stupid," she told BBC's AndrewWebb. "If someone has tried ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence, they will notice that they have very significant limitations. "</p>
<p>Welz said she was worried that artificial intelligence would create error messages at a high speed.</p>
<p>"As the US election approached in 2024, they fired their artificial intelligence morality and security team like Twitter and other important platforms, and I was even more worried about this."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129437837_gettyimages-1250672931.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>The U.S. government acknowledges potential threats. The White House stated in a statement on May 4: "Artificial intelligence is one of our most powerful technologies in our time, but in order to seize the opportunities it brings, we must first reduce its risk."</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress has summoned OPENAI CEO Sam Altman to answer questions about ChatGPT.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129750604_5.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Sam Aldman</p>
<p>At the Senate Hearing, Aldman said that with the development of artificial intelligence, the government supervised his industry "very important".</p>
<p>Public Policy Researcher Carlos Ignaciogutiérrez explained to the BBC explanation that one of the huge challenges brought by artificial intelligence is that "no joint agency composed of experts determines how to supervise it, just like the between the government Climate change special committee (IPCC). "</p>
<p>This brought us to the third and last stage of artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3>3 . Super artificial intelligence</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129937058_9cdd4070-7e3f-4a58-9f16-838450c92f65.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>This is a theory. When we reach the second stage, we will quickly enter the final stage: "Super Artificial Intelligence". This is the case when artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence.</p>
<p>Nickbostrom, a philosopher and an artificial intelligence expert, defines super intelligence as "almost all areas, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills, far exceeding the best human brain intelligence" "" Essence</p>
<p>"Human beings must learn for engineers, nurses or lawyers for a long time. The problem of general artificial intelligence is ... it can continue to improve ourselves when we can't do it," Gu Tierez explained.</p>
<p><strong>Science fiction</strong></p>
<p>This concept reminishes the plot of the film "Terminator". In this movie, the machine launched a nuclear war that destroyed humans.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129909165_62a4a940-0ecc-4cde-9a7b-be404551ccc1.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger has starred in "Terminator".</p>
<p>ARVindnarayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, has previously told BBC that the sci -fi disaster scene is unrealistic: "The current artificial intelligence is not enough to make these risks a reality. Finally, it disperses people's right right right Pay attention to short -term harm of artificial intelligence. "</p>
<p>Although there are many controversy for whether machines can really get the kind of intelligence owned by human beings, especially in terms of emotional intelligence, this is one of the most worried things that those who think we are about to realize general artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Recently, the so -called "artificial intelligence godfather" Geoffrey Hinton warned that we may soon reach this milestone. Xinton is the pioneer of teaching machines to learn from experience.</p>
<p>"I think (machine) is not smarter than us. But I think they may be like this soon," he just retired from Google, 75 years old.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129750607_7.png" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>"Artificial Intelligence Godfather" Jeffrey Xinton</p>
<p>Xinton said in a statement that he issued to the New York Times announced that he regrets his work now because he is worried that "bad participants" will use artificial intelligence to do "bad things".</p>
<p>He gave BBC a general example of "nightmare scenes": "Imagine, for example, poor participants like (Russian President) Putin decide to give robotic capabilities and create their own sub -goals."</p>
<p>He warned that these machines may eventually "create a sub -goal such as" I need more power ", which will bring" survival risk ".</p>
<p>But Xinton said that in the short term, he believes that the benefits of artificial intelligence are much greater than risks, "So I don't think we should stop developing such things." He said.</p>
<h3>extinction or immortal</h3>
<p>British physicist Stephen Hawking issued a harsh warning.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-31T09-00-01.000Z/_129750606_6.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>

<p>Hawking</p>
<p>"The comprehensive development of artificial intelligence may mean the end of human beings," he told BBC in 2014, which is four years before his death.</p>
<p>He said that such an intelligent level machine "will develop itself and redesign itself at a faster and faster speed."</p>
<h3>nano robot and eternal life</h3>
<p>Futurist inventor and writer Ray Kurzweil is one of the biggest enthusiasts in artificial intelligence. He is an artificial intelligence researcher at Google and the co -founder of the University of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Kuzwell believes that humans will be able to use super intelligent artificial intelligence to overcome bi obstacles.</p>
<p>In 2015, he predicted that by 2030, because nano robots (very small robots) work in our body, they can repair and cure any injuries or diseases, and humans will achieve eternal life.Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Can nano robots make humans grow long or liveless?</p>
<h3>artificial intelligence management</h3>
<p>Gotoris agreed that the key is to create an artificial intelligence governance system.</p>
<p>"Imagine such a future: a lot of information that has a lot of information on the earth and a lot of information (because of Internet search), which can control us in a way we can't realize." He said.</p>
<p>"The worst scene is not a war between humans and robots. The worst thing is that we did not realize that we were manipulated because we share this planet with a more smart entity than us."</p>

To this end, people may actually think or assume that "tangible hands" can solve such "market failures" problems. However, from the current data samples and their research documents, the assumption that "the government can solve the market failure caused by the externality of R &amp; D activities" is difficult to establish, and even further mismatch of resources produces resources. So why didn't you solve this problem?</p>
<p>Before answering the above questions, let's first understand a basic economic concept: market failure. According to neo -classical economics, market failure refers to the distribution of free markets for products and services. In terms of vernacular, the existence of third -party factors in the free market intervention in transactions between consumers and producers, resulting in the price reached by both parties without real reaction to the value of goods or services. In this article, third -party factors are the positive and external nature of R &amp; D activities. This externality has led to some consumers benefited from the R &amp; D activities, but did not conduct economic compensation to producers providing the R &amp; D activities, which led to the price of producers' R &amp; D activities that could not truly reflect the real price of R &amp; D activities. In the end, the producer's R &amp; D activity income was less than the total research and development of society.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), the assistant minister of the US Department of Commerce, Thea Rozmankendler, said in the written testimony of the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday that in 2022, the Ministry of Commerce reviewed 5064 exports to China or re -exported to China. Application for license, about 26%of them were rejected or did not take action to return.</p>
<p>KFC said: "We are sure to bring our opponents to our opponents, the American sensitive technology, formulate policies and strategies to protect these technologies, and review the license application submitted by exporters."</p>
<p>At present, nearly 700 Chinese entities are included in export control by the US Department of Commerce "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美貿易黑名單增37實體-中國基因公司入列/a-64871562">physical list</a>". The Assistant Minister of the US Department of Commerce, Matthewaxelrod, the assistant minister of export law enforcement, said that since the Bayeng government took office, the Chinese company on the list has added more than 200.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>Technology stocks are founded</h3>
<p>With the tightening of regulatory policies, the market value of Chinese technology companies has continued to shrink, which has exacerbated the market's concerns about the slowdown in China's world's second largest economy, and investors' emotions are generally affected.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>Anti -monopoly and data security</h3>
<p>Since the end of 2020, Beijing has increased its supervision of Chinese technology companies on the grounds of antitrust and guarantee data security. In addition to being criticized and interviewed, many technology companies are fined to varying degrees. After 20 years of loose control, the Chinese Internet industry has been deeply damaged.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>Common features</h3>
<p>Some experts have noticed that mostly the controlled enterprises are capable of collecting a large number of user information and obtaining platform companies with absolute advantage in the market. Maximilianmayer, a professor of global science and technology policy at Bonn University in Germany, analyzed the Voice of Germany: "The purpose of this movement is to strengthen the supervision of large Internet companies and its data processing methods."</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>down the altar</h3>
<p>Not only did technology companies encounter severe damage, but the founders of these companies themselves also felt the power of the government's heavy punch. The first one was Alibaba's founder Ma Yun. In late October 2020, Ma Yun high -profile attacking the Chinese financial supervision system. Soon after, Alibaba's financial business -the listed plan of Ant Group was stopped by the Chinese regulatory agency. Ma Yun faded out of the public vision.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>Wealth Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Xi Jinping, a Chinese national leader, put forward the goal of "common prosperity", and the Chinese technology industry giants have expressed their full support. For example, Tencent and Alibaba will invest 50 billion and 100 billion yuan respectively to help "common prosperity." According to external analysis, the Chinese government uses suppression to promote technology giants to share their wealth with employees and consumers, and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in politics.</p>

<h3>dual pressure</h3>
<p>Under the dual pressure of China's reins tightening the "network security" reins and the United States held up the "accountability law of foreign companies", it was only officially announced that it was officially announced that it was officially announced by the China Internet -Ending Car Drops of the New York Stock Exchange at the end of June this year. "The first shot of large Chinese Internet companies from U.S. stocks. All in all, on the one hand, Chinese companies, which are listed in the United States, have to face strict review of Chinese regulatory agencies on the one hand, and on the other hand, they also face more rigorous risk disclosure requirements in the United States.</p>

<h4>2021 Chinese Science and Technology Enterprise: Internal and Exorganization Dilemma</h4>
<h3>blocked by the United States</h3>
<p>While "soft technology" enterprises encounter China's supervision, "hard technology" companies such as Huawei and DJI are more restricted from abroad. For many years, the United States has not only been committed to eradicating Chinese equipment such as Huawei in its country, but also trying to convince other countries not to buy related equipment. "Safety Equipment Act"(Secure Equipment Act)It is one of the latest actions made by the US government to combat China Telecom and technology companies.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Another example of tightening the restrictions on Chinese technology companies is to include Chinese artificial intelligence giants Shangtang Technology on a blacklist. The US government said that the company on the list provides support for China's military development. This week, the US Treasury Department also included a number of Chinese companies on the entity list, including the world's largest commercial drone manufacturer DJI innovation and multiple biotechnology companies. It is strictly forbidden to invest and export technology on the list Essence</p>

<p>The theme of the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday was "Counterattack China: Promoting the US National Security, Economic Security and Foreign Policy".</p>
<h3>U.S. discussing plans to restrict external investment sensitive technology</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Officer Paul Rosen said in the testimony that the government's plan to restrict US companies' foreign investment in specific sensitive technology is still discussing: "Our wish is to avoid US investment support and promote those national security that might help destroy us and it may help to destroy us and it may help destroy our national security. The advanced technology that enables Americans to be in danger to improve military power or intelligence capabilities.</p>
<h3>Will Bayeng continue to trade in China?</h3>
<p>Minister of Commerce Ginaraimondo said in March that the Bayeng government is considering a pilot plan to solve the risk of investing in China. She said: "There are many American pension funds and retirement funds to invest in China. Of course you don't want to do anything with accidents."</p>

<p>"The fuse of China's tough stance was a sanction order issued by the United States during the administration of Trump. -400 missile defense system is responsible.</p>
<p>However, the sanctions against Li Shangfu are just one of many disputes between China and the United States. The United States' restrictions on China in the field of chip technology and the continuous criticism of Xinjiang's human rights conditions have also made China dissatisfied. In August last year, Pelosi, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States, visited Taiwan. The spy balloon incident, China ’s position in the Russian and Ukraine War, and Taiwan’ s visits to New York and California recently (all made Sino -US relations Continuously tension).</p>
<p>The Pentagon stated that the reason for China to reject Li Shangfu's attendance of the Defense Minister's dialogue was exactly a term, and said that China has rejected the inquiry of the "more than a dozen leaders' meetings' inquiries' and the China -US dialogue at the more working level.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-31T14-20-00Z/63840458_401.jpg" />During the Shangri -La forum last year, China -US Defense Minister held a dialogue in Singapore. (Data map)</p>
<p>Bonnieglaser, a Chinese issue at the Marshall Foundation in Germany, said the status quo of the stopping of exchanges between China and the United States was disturbing: 'The Chinese obviously did not realize the risks hidden in the suspension of military exchanges between China and the United States. '"</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese side's rejection of US dialogue invitations, the President President Report published a comment that the owner of the Pentagon is anxious to see a Chinese officials sanctioned by the United States, which is really puzzling. The practice of refusing to participate in the Sino -US Defense Minister's dialogue is also puzzling. After all, it is very important for China to maintain the smoothness of dialogue channels with the world's number one military power. The comments entitled "End Silence and Restore Dialogue" wrote:</p>
<p>"The dialogue channel is closed, and it is meaningless to blame each other. Because, this can only lead to further upgrading of the tension, which is very dangerous to both parties.</p>
<p>Although in the next presidential election, it may be criticized 'weakness to China, but President Biden should still create prerequisites for the Sino -US Defense Defense Director. Li Shangfu, who has been sanctioned by the United States for purchasing Russian weapons in 2018, has now been promoted to the Minister of Defense. While maintaining sanctions against him, he seemed to have a dialogue with him.</p>
<p>In this way, Beijing also has one less excuse to not participate in substantial dialogue. Even during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union have always maintained a channel for military dialogue, because it is important to know how important the two sides know how to reduce the risk of "wiping guns and getting fire." For the same reason, China and the United States should immediately end the incurable situation. Otherwise, the possibility of misunderstandings around Taiwan or the South China Maritime Action will increase greatly. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/南海較勁美稱中國戰鬥機逼近挑釁攔截/a-65775811)The two competitors of China and the United States, for their respective interests, maintaining the smoothness of the dialogue channel should be the most basic consensus.

How is this memorial and its preparation process? The following is the follow -up report of the reporter Wang Yun.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/teahouse/tea-05262023155444.html"><strong> Column: What does the June 4th Memorial Museum show the June 4th 34th Anniversary? </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html">"June 4th" 34th Anniversary Memorial Hall condenses the spirit of the two generations of people's owners</a></strong></p>
<p>Yu Dahai said that I like to do small things. "I have done many things in the memorial hall, including pulling wires, installation of projectors, etc., including many exhibition boards in Washington last year. I did it myself". He traced this habit to the habit of being a child during the Cultural Revolution, during the Cultural Revolution, during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p><strong> The curator with a low visibility </strong></p>
<p>Yu Dahai was the curator of the June 4th Memorial Hall in preparation at the end of last year. Among the core preparatory groups of the Memorial Hall, there were Wang Dan and Zhou Fengsuo, the leader of Tiananmen Democratic Movement in 1989, and many people of the worker movement leader Lu Jinghua.</p>
<p>Different from these people, Yu Hai did not experience the movement in 1989. As early as the early 1980s, after graduating from the Department of Physics of Peking University, Yu Hai studied in the United States through the Li Zhengdao Scholarship. When the June 4th incident occurred, Yu Hai had taught at DartmouthCollege at the famous private university on the east coast of the United States.</p>
<p>But Yu Hai did not have a democratic movement from the outside world. After the CCP's army spread throughout the world in the early morning of June 4, 1989, it spread throughout the world, and in the sea, it was almost full -time in the sea to support Chinese democracy for a while to support Chinese democracy. In the 1990s, Yu Hai had engaged in research at the "Contemporary China Research Center" at Princeton University, and hosted overseas politics magazines such as "Voice of China" and "Beijing Spring".</p>
<p>Yu Hai's main business is financial investment, and he is not very often in the media's aforementioned and his own civil movement experience. But even if the overseas democratic movement experienced a low tide, Yu Hai never left the camp of democratic movements. In his own words, "the activities of the civil movement have never stopped for more than 30 years."</p>
<p>The preparation of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" this time, Yu Dahai's responsibility as the curator was responsible for administrative work, and he had to control exhibitions, finance and legal affairs.

<p>Wang Dan announced the establishment of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" in New York in January last year.(June 4th Massacre Memorial Museum)For this reason, the "June Fourth Massacre Memorial Museum Committee" was also registered for the establishment of the NGO.</p>
<p>11 years ago, Hong Kong citizens supported the Patriotic Democratic Movement Federation (branch association) to open a memorial hall with the theme of June 4 in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, but was repeatedly suppressed by the Hong Kong government. closure.</p>
<p>Wang Dan said that the closure of the Hong Kong June 4th Memorial Hall is the origin of the June 4th Memorial Hall of New York. "Then I think, such a big historical event should not have a memorial, and then start discussing with some friends. Just do it slowly. Everyone's ideas are consistent, and the preparatory committee is established. "</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee has a five -year plan that originally planned to use the first phase of the first phase of crowdfunding of 500,000 US dollars in the first phase of crowdfunding. But beyond everyone's imagination, the committee raised $ 500,000 in less than eight months. On this basis, the public appeals to the public, and then the donations in all directions come in, "Wang Dan said.</p>
<p>The deepest donation that impressed Wang Dan was a donation of 100 yuan in a domestic single mother. "In my opinion, this 100 yuan is similar to 10,000 US dollars. In China, I heard that she wanted to build a memorial.</p>
<p>According to Yu Dahai, of all the donations, the largest one is a 100,000 US dollars from a domestic friend. "In fact, it is also a student who has participated in the Democratic Movement of the Tiananmenmen. Later, he developed an industry in China. , But his eight -nine complex is obviously very strong. When he heard that this (preparation of the memorial hall) news, he took the initiative to contact Wang Dan and us. "</p>
<p>The first amount of funds of $ 500,000 was in place for seventeen months, which greatly promoted the speed of the commemorative hall. However, this has also greatly reduced the time of several members of the core preparatory team. Wang Dan said that starting from the beginning of last year, the core preparatory team has a preparatory meeting every two weeks, and there are regular meetings of the work team every two weeks. Wang Dan's personal time for public affairs is two -thirds of the preparations for the memorial. As the curator, Yu Dahai has almost half of the time for preparation.</p>

<p>Zhou Feng Suo is mainly responsible for the collection and finishing of exhibits in the preparatory group. His current residence is located in New Jersey and the border of New York City. After settlement here a few years ago, he began to display June 4th cultural relics in his basement, and often introduced the background of these cultural relics to friends from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Participating in the "June 4th Memorial" preparations, Zhou Fenguo said that he was both his personal behavior and the non -governmental organization "China Human Rights" representing his executive director.</p>
<p>At 5 am on June 4, 1989, Zhou Fengsuo was the last Tsinghua student who withdrew from the Monument of the People's Heroes of Tiananmen Square. There is also a high -speed oil printer used for sports promotion at the same time with him. "I just saw Tsinghua's classmates raising this thing, and I was very worried. I said, at this time, why should I raise such a heavy one? Things? Classmates said, we have to lift it back and continue fighting. "</p>
<p>After Zhou Feng locked in June 4th, he did "continue fighting" and never left the front line of the Chinese democratic movement. What he did not expect was that after 34 years, he actually saw this oil printed machine again. "Just like an old friend reunion, for me, it was an era of smoke and fire. At that moment, we lost. Then it suddenly returned. "</p>
<p>There are many people's efforts and relays behind the reappearance of the oil printer. Zhou Fenguo said, "This is why this memorial is so precious, and each piece of cultural relics are the representatives of many people who have not changed for many years."</p>
<p>Zhou Fengsuo said that there were more than 100 exhibits exhibited at the June 4th Memorial Museum of New York this time, of which more than 30 of them were real objects from Tiananmen Democratic Movement in 1989. Wang Dan emphasized that the current exhibit time span for more than 30 years, from the first half of 1989 to the Hong Kong counter -delivery of the Central Movement in 2019, because the Preparatory Committee believes that the Hong Kong Victoria Garden Party is actually a continuation of the 89th Democratic Games.</p>

<p>The former general secretary of the Communist Party of China Zhao Ziyang, who was forced to step down during the Democratic Movement of the Tiananmen Democratic Movement at the end of last year and the Democratic Movement of Tiananmen, was also one of the exhibits inscribed the "June 4th Memorial Hall" inscribed by the Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>This inscription was actually the last calligraphy work before Bao Tong's death. Yu Dahai introduced, "Mr. Bao Tong's words are well written, but you know if you see his inscription, you can almost see that his hands have a little tremor, that is, his body has been worse. Sex. "</p>
<p>On the eve of June 4th last year, Bao Tong published an article on Radio Liberty Asia for the last time, reviewing the details of June 4th. At the end of the article, he concluded that "'June Fourth" Tucheng is indeed an unprecedented revolution. A new era that is absolutely not restricted and completely loses the protection of civil rights. "</p>
<p>Today, this "new era" seems to be continuing. Wang Dan explained to reporters that the establishment of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" is of great significance to the world at the moment, because China is considered to form a challenge to the West and even human civilization under the rule of Xi Jinping. It should also be recognized the nature of the Communist Party of China. If you want to recognize the nature of the Communist Party of China, nothing can highlight the nature of the Communist Party than June 4th. He is essentially suppressing democracy and even suppressing democracy with violence. A regime. "</p>
<p><strong> For the younger generation </strong></p>
<p>Not only are the elderly people such as Bao Tong, and Wang Dan and other young people in the process of building the June 4th Memorial Hall, but also many young people. In the process of exhibition, collecting and organizing cultural relics, and organizing activities, more than ten young people participated. There are Chinese students studying in New York, as well as young people who work locally.</p>
<p>The museum grows in the sea. The memorial is also largely designed for young people. "Our Memorial Hall has held several democratic salon activities in New York several times. There are dozens of people come each time, and most of them are young people. "</p>
<p>Mr. Dong, 32 years old, arrived in New York from China last October. For security reasons, he was unwilling to disclose his full name. On the 30th anniversary of the "June 4th" in 2019, he went to Tiananmen Square alone, showed a commemorative tone shirt under the city of Tiananmen, and interviewed foreigners present. "Sin was sentenced to seven months in prison.</p>
<p>After arriving in New York, the preparation of the "June 4th Memorial Hall" was initial. Mr. Dong joined the volunteer team. "It is mainly helping Teacher Zhou (Zhou Fenguo) and they set up the venue, register for guests, maintain order, etc., all of them are very small jobs. But I think it is very meaningful. There was no such opportunity in China. "</p>
<p>Participating in the preparation activities, Mr. Dong finally stopped feeling lonely. "The mainstream environment in China is a small pink that we can see every day, but after coming to New York, I met such a group of friends who can like me. It is found that you are not alone, what you do is not a stupid thing most people seem to see it. "</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the white paper movement of resistance and unreasonable epidemic control in China at the end of last year, Mr. Dong also participated in the demonstration of the white paper campaign in New York. , Including young people overseas, did not lose the spirit of June 4th. In fact, the spirit of the June 4th is still in the hearts of each of us. "</p>
<p>He emphasized that this spirit only needs a fire to ignite it, or let more like -minded people stick to it, and let more people discover their expectations and desire for democracy.</p>

<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>Recently on platforms such as Twitter, Weibo, Netease and other platforms, a photo of a Taiwanese male policeman suppressed the woman with her knees, including the Chinese Consul General Xue Jian and the "Communication Media" of Zhongtong News Agency, all of which were transferred to related photos. The text reads "I can't breathe" means that the Police Police imitated the knees of the US police, and her behavior was vicious and cruel. Some of the self -media accounts claimed that women had died because they could not breathe.</p>
<p>Asian facts inspected the laboratory after interviews that the woman in the image was suspected of taking drugs. During the police arrest, she had a bad words and intended to attack the police. After being fell by the male policeman, she suppressed her back to handcuff her. Get up by himself and take the police car. The live video quoted by the news report is the same as the police saying. The case has nothing to do with "racial extinction" and the woman does not die.</p>
<p><strong> Deep analysis: </strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-31T18-23-00-04-00/000002.png" />The "General Media" of Zhongtong News Agency posted photos in Twitter, writing "I can't breathe" (I can't breathe "(pictured from the Twitter account from Tongtong Media) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05312023180757.html/pic1-4e2d901a793e65d74e0b300c901a50b35a92300d572863a87279767c5e0371677247-914d65875beb4e0a300c62114e0d80fd547c5438300d3002571653d681ea901a50b35a9263a872795e33865f.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-31T18-23-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a></p>

In addition to the woman in the photo, the woman could not breathe and died, and also pointed out that the woman was the aboriginal of the Paiwan tribe. Her parents were killed by the police last year. Now a family of three is completely destroyed. It is also called on Taiwan to stop "racial extinction" to the indigenous people. The "CBB News" account joined Twitter in January 2023. It often releases photos or videos that have not been labeled, accusing the Taiwanese police beating the original residents, and marking "#Taiwan" and "</p>
<h2>Race Extinction" and so on.Most of the Taiwan media reported in this case quoted the films of police -made women circulating on the Internet. Asian facts check the laboratory review of Lianhe News Network <a href="https://fb.watch/kSIVPEooUH/">Movie</a>At that time, the woman first refused to get on the police car and was suppressed by the male policeman. When the female policeman wanted to help the woman, the woman struggled and kicked the police officer. After the woman was handcuffed, the woman got up immediately, fighting the police to the middle finger and resistance. After the car, the male police officer took her into the police car; the male police suppressed the woman to get up, the process was about 35 seconds.</h2>
<p>Although the Taiwan media regarded this case as general social news reports, a large number of users forwarded related photos and short videos from Twitter, Weibo, Netease and other platforms, such as the "Smoke Twilight Cicada" Weibo video number A video was released at 3:54 pm on the 29th, and the Taiwan media reported that the incident was not quoted. The distribution, Xue Jian issued a post at 3:04 pm on the same day.</p>
<p>Asian facts check the laboratory, May 31st.

He couldn't breathe around his neck, we would press on his body, making him unable to get up. "</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>After verifying the original video and visiting the Taiwan police in charge of the case, we learned that the saying the so -called "Taiwan police kneeling neck suppression" and "women cannot breathe and die" are all unreal information; however, many Taiwanese media have already been After reporting and publishing the film, Chinese diplomats and official media still did not verify. They used a screenshot to "I can't breathe", and even used photos of the Freud case. Suspects.

<p>Musk's special plane flew to Austin, Texas, USA, where Tesla headquarters was.</p>
<p>This witty giant is one of the richest people in the world. He has ended his first trip to China for more than three years.</p>
<p>Tesla's vice president of foreign affairs, Tao Lin, posted on Weibo that Musk visited Tesla's factories in the suburbs of Shanghai last night and met with employees.</p>
<p>Musk met with the Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao in Beijing yesterday morning. Musk praised China's "vitality and commitment" and said "full of confidence in the Chinese market."</p>
<p>Musk and Tesla did not issue any statements on the trip to China, nor did they respond to the request of the French New Society.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the billionaire has a wide range of commercial interests in China and told Foreign Minister Qin Gang on May 30 that his company "is willing to continue to expand its business in China."</p>
<p>Musk's work in China has attracted the attention of Washington. US President Biden said last November that Musk's cooperation and technical relations with other countries is worth exploring.</p>

<p>Faced with China's recent provocations, Washington invited Beijing to conduct the defense talks on the sidelines during the "Shangri -La dialogue" and refused to confirm the decision. The reason why the military dialogue faces difficulties is clear. "</p>
<p>Austin said in Tokyo today that Beijing's decision is "regrettable". "You have listened to me many times and have the importance of dialogue between strong abilities, so as to manage crisis and prevent the situation out of control."</p>
<p>Austin said China recently "provoked and intercepted our planes and our allies' planes ... it is very worrying."</p>
<p>He also said: "We hope that they (China) will change their behavior, but because they have not changed, I worry that the incident that happened at a certain point may be out of control very quickly and quickly."</p>

<p>The archeological team of the National University of Malaysia (UKM) found a complete human bone and funeral utensils about 14,000 years ago at Gelle Tongshidong, Wangsheng County. This is the discovery of the second old -fashioned human archeological discovery of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Archaeologists discovered human relics and funerals about 40,000 years ago in Nya Cave near Miri, Sarawak. This is the oldest prehistoric mankind in Malaysia. Archaeologists discovered the remains of the "Perak" in 1991 in Linglong, Perak, and were the second old mankind in Malaysia at the time.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Malaysia Tourism, Art and Culture issued a statement on Wednesday (May 31) announced that the archaeological team led by Professor Zu Yisanda at the Institute of Malaysia World and Civilization of Malaysia Starting in November 2022 Before the Lan Danneng Kili Dam Project was launched, archeological rescue operations were launched in the scheduled area of the dam project, and these bones were successively discovered.</p>
<p>The statement says that the human bone is facing the southwest, with a curled posture, like the embryo in the mother. Funeral and interferete tools were also found around the bone. In addition, funeral items also include scoot stones, grinders, hand axes, and dandruff knife made of slate and quartz. These believe that these are related to the funeral ceremony at the time of burial.</p>
<p>The authorities are preparing to send the human teeth and some snail shells discovered to the Beta carbon annual laboratory in the United States to test with accurate radioactive carbon (carbon 14) to identify the exact years of these items. Bone will temporarily collect it in the State Cultural Heritage Bureau.</p>
<p>The National Energy Corporation (Guo Neng) will set up a cultural relic museum near Nengji Lam next to collect all historical relics discovered in the Nengli area, including the above -mentioned human bones.</p>

<p>The world's Fortune 500 companies in Japan Panasonic Co., Ltd. issued an announcement in the Panasonic battery (Shenyang) factory in China, announcing that it will stop production before May 31st, enter the dissolution and liquidation procedure, and no longer conduct any business activities. It shows that the company has ended its 29 -year business event in China and officially withdrawn from investment in China.</p>
<p>Public information shows that the Panasonic battery factory established in Shenyang in 1994 is mainly to develop lithium batteries. Its products have been sold to more than 50 countries in the world. The global market share of Panasonic batteries was as high as 30 %. It is understood that Panasonic Battery Corporation is setting up the factory, machinery and equipment jointly invested by the joint investment and construction of the Chinese cooperative party Northeast Battery Co., Ltd. to settle.</p>
<p>Cai Shenkun, a senior financial commentator, told this station that as the international industrial chain quickly moved out of China, their operating environment is getting worse and worse. He said: "For business and operators, the pressure will become more and more stressful. Now many companies are facing closure and bankruptcy. Just like Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei was once gold, and now I estimate that merchants have been difficult to succeed. Continuously worsening, there will be a large number of shopping malls idle and closed down. Now Guangzhou has made a bad example in marketization. "</p>
<p>Cai Shenkun said that after the formation of the new leadership team of the State Council, the economic situation will gradually recover, but the authorities have been emphasizing "struggle" and "security" in the near future. In addition to the decline in exports, domestic consumption shrinks. In this case, foreign investment has accelerated the evacuation, and the phenomenon of stopping and turning in domestic enterprises has intensified. He said: "Now the problem of economic facing is definitely a process of comprehensive review from politics to economic review. If it continues to be so tossing, there will be a large number of foreign capital outflows."</p>

<p>According to Japan's "Yomi Lisage News" reported on Tuesday (30th), Mitsubishi Motor was scheduled to resume production in China after May this year. Now it is postponed again, and the time to resume work is to be determined. A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motor said that the company is discussing when it will be restored in China with local partners, but it is irreversible to restore production.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Motor said earlier that because GAC Mitsubishi Motors' sales decreased by 58 % annually from January to March this year, from March 8th to May this year, it was discontinued in the Changsha plant in Hunan Province.</p>
<p>Not only Japanese -funded enterprises, Hong Kong -funded enterprises are also evacuating. On May 26, the notice issued by the Hong Kong -funded Minghai Dyeing Plant said that because of the global economic downturn and the domestic textiles and dyeing industries are extremely difficult, the factory is also unsustainable. After research and decision of factory management, the business will be completely stopped, and all employees will terminate the labor contract on June 30. In the report, Minghai's entire dyeing factory promises that the salary of the number of claiming with the employees will be settled, and the statutory economic compensation will be settled to all employees in accordance with relevant regulations.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-01T01-06-14-00-00/000182667_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Looking at the global electric vehicle battery market, the development momentum of Chinese battery companies is righteous. According to Sneresearch, in the global power battery market in 2022, the Ningde Times and BYD have developed the fastest. Among them, the Ningde Times took the lead and was far ahead. Last year, the global battery capacity was 517.9GWh, a year -on -year increase of 71.8%, while the installed capacity of a company in Ningde Times reached 194.6GWh, with a market share of 37%, and its production capacity increased by 92.5%year -on -year. BYD, also from China, is aiming at the second place with Korean battery manufacturer LG new energy.</p>
<p>Rhodiumgroup and Merics recently released a China direct investment research report in Europe showed that from 2016 to 2022, China's FDI on the global electric vehicle value chain increased from 605 million euros to 24 billion euros, turning three times. In the past five years, transactions in the field of electric vehicles accounted for 19%of all direct investment. In 2022, the proportion was 58%. Studies have pointed out that China's expansion in the field of electric vehicles has been concentrated in minerals and developed to build battery factories directly in important markets.</p>
<p>Looking at Europe, the world's second largest electric vehicle market that cannot be ignored, the prosperity of the electric vehicle market means that the demand for power batteries is strong. China ’s direct investment in Europe is transferred to the electric vehicle value chain, especially the battery field. According to Rhodium, China has invested in the construction of battery factories in Europe has become the main driving force for China's direct investment in Europe. Since 2018, Chinese battery companies have announced $ 17.5 billion in European investment. It is expected that in 2030, the production capacity of Chinese battery manufacturers in European Chinese battery manufacturers accounts for about 20%of the total European battery capacity. So far, most of China's investment in batteries is concentrated on battery modules and battery packages. At the same time, Chinese companies, including Zhongwei and Enjie, are also looking for opportunities in the upstream and downstream fields.</p>
<p>Rhodium research and analysis, Europe, as the second largest electric vehicle market after China, has relatively modern charging infrastructure and generous car purchase subsidies from the government, and intends to achieve carbonization in the field of road traffic. Furthermore, unlike Japan and South Korea, which are developed in the automotive industry, there are relatively few large -scale battery companies in Europe, and Europe has maintained open investment in Chinese investment. These factors have brought huge huge Chinese battery companies including Ningde Times and Hive Energy. Opportunity.</p>
<p>At present, the European Union is promoting the production of green technology through legislation to return to Europe. This may lead to two invested trends in the opposite direction: investment flows from Europe to the United States, and Chinese investment flows to Europe. Rhodium studies said that because the "reduction of inflation" and European energy prices have slowed down companies including Tesla and NorthVolt to slow down in the European battery plan and choose to consider the United States. According to Bloombergnef data, in terms of investment in lithium -ion batteries, the proportion of European total investment in global investment has been sharply reduced from 41%in 2021 to 2%in 2022. And Chinese companies have entered an effort to exclude Chinese battery companies in the United States. The Ningde Times slowed down its factory site selection plan in Clearona, Kentucky and Mexico. In this case, mainland Europe is more attractive to Chinese battery manufacturers.</p>
<p>Chinese battery manufacturers are not just a "unprecedented choice" choice in Europe, and they also ushered in their own opportunities in the EU's green policy. In March of this year, the European Commission announced the draft of the "Zero Industry Law". The battery technology was located on the eight strategic net zero technology list. The goal of the draft is that by 2030, the EU's strategic net zero technology production capacity is close to or at least 40%of the annual demand, that is, the reality of green technology, including batteries, to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Green Travel Agency T &amp; G evaluated the about 50 planned battery super factories (only 2GWh or more contains 2GWH), which predicts that 32 projects may be advanced. T &amp; G believes that in all announced construction projects, the production capacity of battery production was 286 GWH in 2025, 616GWh in 2027, and 1395GWh in 2030. Among them, companies with maximum production capacity include Ningde, Volkswagen, Freyr, ACC, and NorthVolt. About 58%of European battery production in 2030 came from European companies and 22%came from Chinese companies. T &amp; G's report said that in 2022, the European Union's lithium -ion batteries used in electric vehicles and energy storage have achieved 50%of European manufacturing. If the correct incentive measures are introduced and the published items can be launched, by 2027, 100%European Europe can be achieved on the battery battery cell, and 67%can be achieved on the battery positive activity material.</p>
<p>T &amp; G also evaluated and discovered the risk assessment of the 1.8 TWH production capacity plan of Europe to 2030 on the basis of February 2023. 16%of them, that is, 285GWH is in a high risk state, 52%is at medium risk , That is, if it is not taken, by 2030, the production capacity of 68%, 1.2TWH in Europe is facing uncertainty that is delayed, reduced, or failed to achieve. The assessment standards include the determined funds, the determined factories, construction and approval status, investment from European car companies or support from EU agencies, planned plans in the United States, and six standards for cooperation with American car companies. According to the report, China's dominant position on the supply chain of electric vehicle and the United States' "Reducing Aflation" is changing the rules of the game. In theory, Europe and the United States can cooperate with the battery supply chain, but in fact, the supply of professional talents, corporate funds, and raw materials is in a shortage state, which means that global competition in battery production is a zero -sum game.</p>
<p>In April last year, the Ningde Times obtained an annual production license of 8GWH annual production in Tulingen, Germany. In January this year, the Ningde Times launched the factory, which became the first production factory of the company outside China. Its preliminary preparation capacity is 14GWh, which means the annual output of 30 million battery cells. In the Ningde era, the president of the European region said that the Ningde era would invest 1.8 billion euros. The factory was produced on a large -scale battery cell in Western Europe and the battery will supply European car companies including BMW. BMW has scheduled a battery worth 7.3 billion euros from Ningde Times to 2031. In Ningde, it is also expected to obtain a 24GWH production license.</p>
<p>In T &amp; G's risk assessment, by 2030, 32%of European battery capacity was in a low risk state, and the 8 GWH production capacity of Ningde era was included in Germany. It can be understood that for Europe, this 8GWH is not only the production capacity of 8 GWH, but also 8GWh. Leaving aside other political factors, under the European Union's European Blueprint European Blueprint and the local battery incentive policy in the United States, Chinese battery companies have ushered in opportunities in Europe.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-01T01-15-13-08-00/29rattner-master1050.jpg" />This is the first time I have come to China for more than three years. When I woke up, I saw Beijing's abnormal blue sky. Forsythia and cherry blossoms are flourishing, and the whole city is shining.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is at least a metaphor for my visit to China this spring. At many levels, China is back. The office was crowded with employees and devoted it to a long day. Most executives are optimistic about their business. A group of exciting startups have continued to emerge, indicating that China will continue to become leaders in the field of innovation. In many past visits, the energy and power that excited me excitedly.</p>
<p>Yes, China is facing economic challenges, especially President Xi Jinping is still committed to maintaining the progress of the country's market economy. Generally, he seems to emphasize control, rather than growing. I am responsible for supervising major investment in China, and these signals are worrying.</p>
<p>However, although Western media show more and more doubts, I believe that China will continue to prosper. As our greatest strategic opponent, it will continue to use this prosperity to consolidate its tough gesture on a series of issues, from the South China Sea to spy balloon, and even unfair trade behavior.</p>
<p>Although China's response to the new crowns looks very poor, especially large -scale blockade, China's economic performance is far better than us. From the beginning of 2020 to the end of last year, the Chinese economy has increased by 14%after the adjustment of inflation, while my country's economic growth is less than 6%.</p>
<p>China's economic growth this year <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/04/11/world-economic-outlook-april-2023#Overview">expectations</a>It is 5.2%, and we are expected to be 1.6%. When we fight with more than 4%of the stubborn inflation rate, China's prices are likely to rise only by 2%this year. Therefore, its interest rate is kept at a low level, which helps encourage investment.</p>
<p>In all fairness, China's epidemic recovery momentum is weaker than many people's expectations. Its <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230522/china-youth-unemployment/">unemployment</a>The problem is also very serious: last month, the unemployment rate of youth from 16 to 24 reached 20.4%. This is largely because the economic growth rate is not enough to digest about 10 million university graduates entering the labor market each year.</p>
<p>During my visit, I could feel that Chinese officials seemed to be welcoming. There are very few American participants in the China Development High -level Forum similar to Davos, but the European business leaders gathered. Chinese officials have read the preparation of preparations in advance, constantly emphasizing their commitment to sound sound economic policies and an open attitude towards foreign investment and regulatory reform.</p>
<p>They positively cover up the obvious tension atmosphere. When the team visits investors and businessmen, I will mention almost every time in Chinese investment bankers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/26/business/bao-fan-china-banker.html">Bao Fan</a>Missing things are sometimes proposed by us, and sometimes our Chinese colleagues are proposed -they are justified. China's security work has always been strict, and this time seems to be more tight. I have more understanding of the ubiquitous Chinese surveillance, and I have camera and facial recognition technology everywhere. Even if you take a short train, you need to show your passport and scan when entering the station.</p>
<p>Compared with the past, Chinese investors and entrepreneurs pay more carefully and pay attention to every signal issued by the government, and worry that Xi Jinping may suddenly announce that the private sector has repeatedly intervened again and again. The importance of diluting the consumer Internet platform; investment in emerging industries such as energy transformation and artificial intelligence seems to be a priority.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>At least in some areas, China has achieved significant success. It accounts for 77% of the global battery capacity, last year <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-sales-2016-2023e">nearly 60%</a>The sales of electric vehicles come from China. Despite the U.S. tariffs, the solar panels produced by China <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/the-world-needs-more-diverse-solar-panel-supply-chains-to-ensure-a-secure-transition-to-net-zero-emissions">account for more than 80%of the world's global</a>Essence</p>
<p>After a few days, the sky in Beijing was restored to usual gray again, and my optimistic emotions I initially held in 2023 began to dim. Under the self -confidence I have always felt, I also realized a certain degree of uncertainty. This is mainly because many Chinese people feel the hostility from Washington, which in turn has led to some Chinese people's dislikes to the United States.</p>
<p>As Xi Jinping emphasizes that China is an autonomous superpower, the preferences of Chinese consumers seem to be changing. In the past, they favored foreign big names from Nike sneakers to BMW Motors. Today, they are turning to local brands such as Anta sports shoes and BYD Automobile.</p>
<p>My meeting in China is usually based on my team and my team. However, in this interview, our Chinese peers often reverse -at least once -ask us, what may do on the issues such as Taiwan and potential investment restrictions in Taiwan and potential investment restrictions. Some people claim that China is an innocent victim of American power.</p>
<p>These subtle differences are still large -scale branches to a large extent; at least from the interaction I experienced, the Chinese business community still desires investment in the United States and continues to trade with us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the trade restrictions implemented by President Trump and President Biden have had a significant impact. From furniture to consumer electronics, for those products that impose 25%tariffs in the United States, China’s exports are compared to 2017 <a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-imports-china-are-both-decoupling-and-reaching-new-highs-heres-how">decrease</a>More than 20%.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Limited to sell sensitive advanced technologies to China has also caused losses. Chinese experts acknowledge that the prohibition of purchasing the most advanced semiconductor will hinder China marching to the forefront of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It is worthy of praise that, in addition to toughness, the Bayeng government also extended an olive branch. U.S. Treasury Minister Yellen called for a "constructive contact](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1425)"-In fact, trying to achieve a win -win situation.We should support our human capital by increasing STEM graduates so that we can maintain technical advantages, attract talents from all over the world by adjusting the immigration policy, and leave our most promising foreign students.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that we should not deceive ourselves fantasies that China will be crushed by its own weight. For the United States and its opponents, the question is whether this confrontation must be destructive, or a future that is more prosperous and more prosperous and cooperate with each other.</p>

The picture shows the information of the information of his information in Hong Kong in September 2018</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Chinese media reported that the authorities were accused of suspected bribery and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/華興資本證實失聯董事長包凡正配合中國官方調查/a-64828236">lost contact in February this year</a>Bao Fan, the founder, chairman and chief executive of China Financial Group "Huaxing Capital", has been extended for three months. In addition, the jungle, chairman of the Huaxing Capital Hong Kong Securities subsidiary related to Bao Fan's case, was also informed to continue to be extended after 6 months of the reserve period.</p>
<p>The China Financial Media "Economic Observer" reported on Wednesday (May 31) that those familiar with the matter said that the restrictions of Chinese supervision institutions for well -known investors Bao Fan will be extended for three months from May 7, 2023.</p>
<p>On February 7 this year, Bao Fan was taken away by the official disciplinary commission of the Chinese Commission for Discipline Inspection and was left for investigations and was left to the unit. The specific case handling institutions include the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Commission and the Beijing Discipline Inspection Commission and other departments.</p>
<p>In response to Bao Fan's extension of detention, Huaxing Capital did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the group has stated that after the Chinese government will take Bao Fan away to cooperate with the investigation, it will postpone the annual audit report from April 3 and suspend stock transactions.</p>
<p>After Bao Fan lost contact in February this year, Huaxing Capital's stock price plummeted by 50%. Its stock price has fallen by about 10%this year.</p>
<p>Bao Fan is widely known in the Chinese corporate community and participated in a series of high -profile scientific and technological mergers and acquisitions in China, including the merger of "Didi" and "fast" of the taxi company, and the mergers and acquisitions of takeaway giants Meituan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T01-44-00Z/64828048_401.jpg" />Huaxing Capital is a well -known local financial institution in China.</p>
<h3>Why is the goal?</h3>
<p>Bao Fan was not the first Chinese billionaire who was forced to miss or was arrested. In the past few years, there are nearly many billionaires in China, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國為何打擊知名企業家/a-64860293">similar situations have encountered similar situations</a>Essence</p>
<p>Nicknamed Buffett, China <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中媒中国巴菲特郭广昌失联/a-18909735">Guo Guangchang</a>He is the founder of Fosun Group. He disappeared for several days in 2015. In addition, Chinese Canadian businessman <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/保密式审理后宣判肖建华获刑13年/a-62866004">Xiao Jianhua</a>He disappeared in Hong Kong in 2017. It is reported that his trial had begun in July last year and he was sentenced to 13 years. In 2020, the founder of Alibaba <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察马云被回国中国经济会好起来吗/a-65165744">Ma Yun</a>It also disappeared from the public vision for several months. At that time, the digital payment company Ant Financial was preparing to go public.</p>
<p>Wang Yaqiu, a senior Chinese researcher at Human Rights Observation (HRW), told DW in February this year that "the Chinese government has used the same approach to many people. We know the only reason for the disappearance of well -known entrepreneurs is because they are big people."</p>
<p>Other experts believe that the reason why Beijing cracks down on these entrepreneurs is that they need to ensure that their companies or business behaviors are in line with the CCP's priority.</p>
<p>Ni Weiping, the research and propaganda coordinator of the Chinese Human Rights Defender (CHRD), told DW in February this year that in Bao Fan's case, the reason why he became the goal of suppressing Monopoly of power, or excessive control over the Chinese technology industry in financing.</p>
<p>He said: "(China) the government is trying to curb the ambitions of the technology industry, hoping that these companies will succeed, and they also hope to ensure that these companies can develop under the party's firm guidance."</p>
<p>The outside world is worried that with the continuous development of the Chinese government's suppression of entrepreneurs, this trend will cause investors to lose confidence in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Chinese legal scholar Teng Biao said: "The Communist Party of China has been suppressing private enterprises for many years, and sometimes their policies will cause the entire industry to be suddenly hit."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) Michaelmcmahon, a former New York City police officer, was accused of being a Chinese spy and suspected of participating in China's "fox hunting operation" overseas, trying to forcibly repatriate the so -called "Chinese fugitives" in the United States. On Wednesday (May 31st), the case was tried in Brooklyn, New York. Mcma Hong argued that he did not know the private monitoring work he was engaged in, and behind the scenes was the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The US federal prosecutor said McMaho was suspected of pressureing Xu Jin (XU Jin, transliteration) living in New Jersey, asking him to return to China to face the allegations of bribery and misappropriation of public funds.</p>
<p>Chinese officials said that the object of being repatriated was a Chinese citizen who was wanted to have been wanted, but Washington accused the operation of being targeted at Chinese objections.</p>
<p>In addition to McMahong, two Chinese citizens Zhu Yong (transliteration) and Zheng Congying (transliteration) were also tried together. Prosecutor said that Zhu Yong hired McMaho to engage in monitoring in 2016. Zheng Congyue was the same as the conspirator and was accused of posted a intimidation note at Xu Jin's house in 2018, which reads: "If you are willing to Back to the mainland, spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be fine. "</p>
<p>American assistant prosecutor Irisachen said in the opening statement: "The victims and his family have endured many years of harassment ... This is the Chinese government forced to live abroad and returns to China in violation of its willingness to return to China. Part of the public move. "</p>
<h3>defendant: I do not know it is to work for Beijing</h3>
<p>McMahon's lawyer said that McMahon thought he was working for a Chinese construction company and assisting them in collecting debts.</p>
<p>"If he secretly do things for China, would he call the police and tell them? He didn't know, he didn't know ... he was working for China (government)." McMahong's lawyer said.</p>
<p>American assistant prosecutor Irisa Chen said that McMahon searched the name of the target characters on the Internet and met with a Chinese official for this, which shows that he understands that he is working for the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The lawyers of Zhu Yong and Zheng Congye also said that their customers did not know they worked for the Chinese government.</p>

<h4>big guys who have been "chased" by China</h4>
<h3>Five ministerial committees shouting</h3>
<p>On Thursday (August 23), the Chinese National Supervision Commission, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs jointly issued the "Announcement on Urgent Crime Criminal Cases to Surong the Cases of Criminal Cases" for the first time. "Overseas fugitives" issued an announcement of surrender. It states that "the case was punished by lightly before the end of the year" encouraged the relatives and friends of the fugitives to actively persuade them, and also encouraged the fugitives to expose others' criminal behavior, wearing sin, and encouraging others to "actively report and provide clues."</p>

<h3>Yang Xiuzhu</h3>
<p>One of the representative characters of "from wide treatment" was Yang Xiuzhu, the number one character on the "Hundred Red Tong", with the amount involved in the case of 250 million yuan. Former deputy mayor of Wenzhou fled in 2003, and was arrested in the United States in 2014 after turning in many countries. She returned to China on November 16, 2016 to surrender.

<p>Since Xi Jinping came to power, China has increased overseas pursuit, launched "fox hunting" and "Tianwang", and publicly released the list of "Hundred Red Persons" in April 2015. According to Chinese official media reports in June this year, the list of hundreds of people "52 people have returned to justice, and the remaining 48 people have not yet brought to justice." At the same time, the Central Government Pursuing Office issued an announcement that the relevant clues of 50 fugitives were disclosed (there were some rearrassment with the personnel in the "Hundred Red Tong").</p>

<h3>Shi Jianxiang</h3>
<p>Of the 50 fugitives mentioned above, No. 31 was Shi Jianxiang, the chairman of the former Kuaulu Investment Group. He was accused of suspected fund -raising fraud and fled to the United States in March 2016. Shi Jianxiang was influential in the entertainment cultural circle and served as the chief producer of "Ye Wen 3". After the incident, the old photos of Shi Jianxiang, Zhen Zidan, Huang Shengyi, Cui Yongyuan and others were circulated on the Internet, saying that this person's "circle of friends" was not ordinary.</p>

<h3>Guo Wengui</h3>
<p>The most famous of the "fugitives" is Guo Wengui. For a period of time, the rich Chinese who lived in the United States had a high -profile "breaking news" through the media and self -media to accuse a series of senior CCP officials. The Chinese police sent him "Red Tong" to him through the International Interpol. However, Guo Wengui's live broadcast continues to this day, and there are still many mysteries that are not solved around him.</p>

In 2003, Cheng Weigao was dismissed and was expelled from the party. According to Chinese media reports, Cheng Muyang applied for citizenship and refugee status in Canada, but was rejected.

<h3>Old father was regarded as a "bait"</h3>
<p>The victim of this case Xu Jin served as the municipal development department of Wuhan City before being accused of corruption by China. When he came to the United States in 2010, the Chinese government subsequently issued an international arrest notice.</p>
<p>Xu Jin's sister -in -law Liu Yan (transliteration) appeared in court this week that she came to her home twice in 2016 and told her that Xu Jin should return to China. She recalled: "I feel very scared."</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2017, Xu Jin still lived in China. Without knowing Liu Yan's address, he suddenly appeared in her home and told her that she had a "task" to persuade Xu Jin to return to China.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Irisa Chen said in the opening statement that Xu's father was used as "bait". The testimony Liu Yan said: "Can't believe the law enforcement department of the Chinese government will use an old man to achieve their purpose."</p>

<p>In July 2014, China announced the "Fox Hunting Action" plan that it wanted to hunt and repatriate overseas Chinese citizens who believed as fugitives. The target targets on the wanted list include Muslim minorities studying abroad, as well as overseas Chinese objections.</p>
<p>Beijing denies all the allegations about threats and forced repatriation, and states that the United States is slandering China's legal cracking down crime; <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/又有7人因猎狐行动在美国被起诉/a-63517697">the U.S. government has prosecuted a number of "Chinese agents in recent years of surveillance and harassment of the" Fox Hunting Action ".

<p>The Beijing side defended the "Fox Hunting Action", saying that it was part of the anti -corruption movement, and stated that its law enforcement agencies followed international law when they were abroad.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said that the trial was not a Chinese law enforcement officer, and said that these allegations were "just rumors and slander." He said through a statement: "Repatriation of corruption fugitives and recovery illegal income is a righteous cause widely recognized in the international community."</p>
<p>Safeguard Defenders, a human rights group headquarters in Spain, released a report last January that quoted government data estimates that since 2014, nearly 10,000 Chinese citizens have been forcibly repatriated](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/以精神病名義行打壓-人權組織批北京讓維穩凌駕人權/a-62817421)Essence</p>
<p>According to the report, through the "Fox Hunting Action" and "Skynet Action", China forced these locked targets to return to China against their wishes. The methods used include non -judicial means such as kidnapping, harassment and intimidation.</p>
<p>All 3 people in this case did not plead guilty about the allegations. If four crimes are established as an illegal Chinese agent and the follow -up state tracking, the defendant will face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

The price of Italian four -star hotels has increased by 44%, and Greece rose 47%.</p>

Before the epidemic, about 20%of the tour guide services provided by the attraction were explained in Mandarin. However, in February this year, the Bavarian Palace Management Department stated that only a few groups scattered a Mandarin tour.</p>
<p>Wolfgangarlt, general manager of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI), said that although China has relaxed restrictions related to the prevention and control of the epidemic, due to the high travel barrier, it is still unlikely that the tourist wave from China is unlikely to occur.

<p>Alde said that in addition to the factors of insufficient flights, it is difficult to obtain a visa. It is also one of the main causes of Chinese tourists to return to Europe. At that time, the Chinese epidemic was still rampant. Visa, and "sightseeing tourism" is not here.</p>
<h3>China Domestic Travel Fever</h3>
<p>Compared with overseas tourism recovery, it is not as good as expected. Since China ’s relief of the clearing policy, the trend of domestic tourism recovery is very vigorous.</p>
<p>"Nikkei Asia" quotes data reports from the Ministry of Transportation of China, during the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国五一假期创旅游高峰-一票难求寸步难行/a-65470912">May 1st Labor Day holiday</a>About 270 million people in China borrowed domestic travel by car, railway, aircraft and waterway, an increase of 163%from the daily average number last year. %And 4.2%.</p>

The volume of flight reservations is 50%higher than before the epidemic, which shows the popularity of domestic tourism in China.</p>
<p>Although these data have provided optimistic prospects for China's domestic tourism industry this year, analysts point out that even if the Labor Day is more than one day than in previous years, the average expenditure of passengers is still about 10%lower than in 2019.</p>
<p>FitchRating, a well -known US credit rating agency, may be related to factors such as a large number of low -income tourists, tourists, and rural areas that have occurred this year. In addition, the price of air tickets and hotels is much more expensive than 2019. The proportion of short -distance travel has increased with the cost of travel, which is also a major reason.</p>

A few minutes later, the government alarm sounded on the mobile phones of Seoul citizens, urging residents to "prepare to evacuate", and children and old and weak are preferred.</p>
<p>In half an hour on Wednesday morning, as the news of North Korea's launch rocket spread, the city with a population of 10 million was chaotic and panic. Then a wave of news was sent: South Korea's Ministry of the Interior issued a notice saying that the earlier alarm was "misunderstanding."</p>
<p>Anxiety quickly became angry and annoyed.</p>
<p>"They really messed this time," said Seoul, who woke up in the alarm, Li Yan (sound).</p>
<p>The Koreans have become accustomed to frequent provocation of North Korea. However, their country's way of dealing with major military attacks on Wednesday made them feel disturbed. As the tension of the Korean Peninsula intensified, their government caused confusion when using the public alarm system.</p>
<p>The chaos began at 6:27 in the morning, and North Korea launched a rocket from the northwestern end of the peninsula. For a few days, North Korea has been declare to the world that it is preparing to launch a rocket and will carry a self -developed military spy satellite into the track, although this will violate a number of UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-01T03-03-36-08-00/31skorea-evacuation-jwql-master1050.jpg" />A photo released by the Ministry of National Defense of South Korea shows that on Wednesday, the South Korean military picked up an object considered from the Korean spy satellite. South korean defense ministry</p>
<p>The rocket preset trajectory data released by North Korea shows that it will fly south, fly over the Korean Peninsula and China, and the waters in the east of the Philippines.</p>
<p>North Korea's rockets rarely fly south. In 2016, a satellite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/world/asia/north-korea-moves-up-rocket-launching-plan.html">Korean Rocket</a>When flying south, South Korea issued alarm to Baiyao Island near the northwest border of North Korea.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, when the Rockets were lifted two minutes, South Korea issued a similar alert to Bai Yimao Island, but officials were investigating why the same alarm was also sent to Seoul, although the Rockets would fly over hundreds of kilometers west of the city.</p>
<p>According to the Seoul Municipal Government, after the alarm of Bai Yan Island, the Ministry of the Interior asked the local government to decide whether to issue an alert. Officials from Seoul said they decided to issue alerts in the city to prevent it, even if they eventually withdrawn alarms.

<p>For Zheng Chengxi, 62, this confusing response made him annoyed. Zheng Chengxi said that she was hearing the mobile phone alert when preparing breakfast in the home in the center of Seoul, and then the loudspeaker broadcast. When she opened the window to listen carefully, she only heard that it was "real situation", not exercise.</p>
<p>"They should say what happened and where to go," Zheng Chengxi said. "Who would send such information to evacuate?" When she received a second alert saying that it was a false alarm, Zheng Chengxi said that she couldn't help cursing the authorities.</p>

<p>"I blurted out," These lunatics -don't they have one thing, can they do it right? "She said. "The government should tell you,‘ There is such a situation now. ’I just said‘ evacuation ’without my head, who knows how to do it?”</p>
<p>Koreans are deeply doubtful about the government's ability to deal with major disasters. Yin Xiyue's government has been widely accused of failing to prevent or quickly cope with the death of nearly 160 people in Seoul in October in October.(https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20221118/seoul-itaewon-crowd-crush/)Essence</p>
<p>Critics said that the response on Wednesday reflects the government's issues. The government has always advocated a strong stance on North Korea, but failed to ensure their safety to the public when the Nuclear nuclear threat is increasing.</p>
<p>"The Yin Xiyue government has a sense of crisis on the North Korean issue," said An Bingjin, a political scientist of Qingxi University in Seoul. "But in terms of letting the public accept this sense of crisis, there is no training. The chaos this morning fully reflects the new normal of the government's failure to understand and cope with North Korea."</p>
<p>Min Yungen, a college student in Seoul, is worried that if you issue an error many times, people may not be sensitive to the real emergencies. "I realize that we are not ready for the war," he said.</p>

<p>Yin Xiyue's office condemned North Korea's rocket launch as "serious provocation", saying that this was a long -range missile test disguised as a satellite launch.</p>
<p>North Korea confirmed the failure and fell into western western western seas of the Korean Peninsula after a second -class rocket had a failure. The country vowed to be launched again. South Korea is salvaging the residual films to collect clues about North Korean rocket technology.</p>

<p>Li Bingzhe, a researcher at the Far East Research Institute of Qingnan University in Seoul, said that North Korea is upgrading its nuclear threat by launching rockets to the south and trying to send military spy satellites into the track.</p>
<p>"North Korea has shown that its missile ability is enough to reach the distance it wants, but what it lacks is the ability to accurately guide the missile to the goal," Li Bingzhe said. "Military spy satellites can help provide this ability to North Korea."</p>
<p>Although some people are dissatisfied with the South Korean government's response to this launch, some people have said that in this case, they would rather be cautiously. 45 -year -old Li Zaixi (Yin) said: "Doing this and then being criticized, it is better than being criticized than nothing."</p>
<p>Li Zaixi said that after seeing the alert, he also saw a news report that the content was that North Korea warned that he would launch space, and then he fell asleep again. "If you hear the explosion and roar of the building, it may be too late to go anywhere now," he shrugged.</p>
<p>South Korea regularly conducts civil defense exercises during the Cold War. The sirens whistled, and the amplifier urged people to take refuge in the basement of subway stations, underground parking lots and large buildings. There are no vehicles on the street.</p>
<p>The country now has thousands of underground urgent refuge.Earlier this month, Korean government officials were held in civil defense exercises held in Seoul. Jung Yeon-JE/Agency France-Presse-Getty Images</p>
<p>However, these exercises have become the distant memories of many Koreans, especially after Seoul began to diplomacy with North Korea under the leadership of Yin Xiyue's former Ventaurus. The last air strike exercise in South Korea was in 2017.</p>
<p>With the intensification of the tension in the region, Yin Xiyue's government has been slow to restore civil defense exercises. On May 16th, South Korea held the first national civil defense exercise in six years, but only civil servants and school children participated.</p>

<p>The 36 -year -old Zeng Yanchuan lived on the 18th floor of a apartment building in Seoul. He said he participated in the May exercise, but he believed that the risk of North Korea's attack was very far away. He soon thought that Wednesday's alarm was not a big deal.</p>
<p>"It feels not so serious," he said.</p>

<h4>Expansion mechanism meeting</h4>
<p>The director of the African Union Office Mohammed Hassan Uld Labart told Peninsula TV that the expansion mechanism meeting held on Asia on Wednesday agreed to solve the new roadmap for Sudan crisis.</p>
<p>Ultra Labat added that the expanded mechanism emphasizes preventing external interference from Sudan affairs, promoting humanitarian assistance to the Sudan immediately through air, land and sea corridors, coordinating international procedures, and preventing any measures to reduce joint operations.</p>
<p>The enlarged African mechanism includes restoring political transitions that have been interrupted due to conflict.</p>

<p>On May 31st, after premium propaganda, North Korea launched the first spy satellite in the history of the country at 6:30 local time, but eventually failed and fell into the western coast of the Western Korean Peninsula. After the launch failed, the North Korean Universe Development Bureau made a explanation of the launch failure and the future launch plan to launch failed to launch through the North Korean Society. At present, South Korea is salvaging some of the wreckage.</p>
<p>The significant manifestation of North Korea's launching spy satellite is: pretending to be qi and leisurely launch, the purpose is to create the atmosphere and cognition of its own legitimate nuclear support; The issue of nuclear is still unconfident.</p>
<p><strong> Several important information of shooting "satellite" </strong> **</p>
<p>The first spy satellite in North Korea ’s launch of its national history has revealed several important information, including publicity, as well as strategies and diplomatic categories.</p>
<p>First of all, for the failure of the launch satellite, North Korea was released by the National Cosmic Development Bureau through the North Korean Central News Agency. It also explained a special situation from a technical perspective. The agency introduced: At first, the "Thousands of Malaysia -1" new satellite carrier rockets were flying normally. After the first stage of separation, the engine failed in the second stage and lost its advancement, resulting in falling in the West Sea of North Korea. The agency believes that the cause of the accident lies in the lack of reliability and stability on the new engine system on the "Thousands of Miles -1" satellite carrier rocket, and the fuel characteristics are unstable. According to reports, relevant scientific and technological personnel and experts are investigating the cause of the accident. After the specific serious disadvantages that occur when the launch satellite is arranged, relevant scientific and technological research measures will be taken as soon as possible. Two launch.</p>
<p>The above behavior seems frank and frank, but there is a basic fact that according to the UN Security Council's resolution, North Korea's launching ballistic rocket itself is illegal. Therefore, this time North Korea rarely gives a technical explanation to the launch failure, and said that it is necessary to continue to launch, that is, to create the atmosphere and cognition of the legal support for North Korea in the world, its techniques and motivations are not sophisticated. Moreover, repeated launch satellites itself is an effective publicity of the legalization of North Korea's nuclear nuclear.</p>
<p>But at the same time, North Korea was obviously lying in the time of the satellite launch. It turned out that the satellite launch time that North Korea publicly announced publicly was "within June", but later changed from May 31st to June 11th. Moreover, in order to prevent accidents during the satellite launch, maritime ships or planes. This time also notified the Japanese Maritime Security Agency in advance, but he did not announce it publicly.</p>
<p>This obvious flaw or a critical date of changes is not only a North Korean strategy, but also shows that North Korea is not confident in facing the external environment on the issue of launching ballistic rockets.</p>
<p>In addition, China's attitude is unavoidable due to the problem of the launch area near. South Korea's "Central Daily" revealed: North Korea's launch satellite itself is illegal, and AIAs of North Korea have expressed their favor. Because the launch area of the North Korean spy satellite is not far from China. If there is a problem of falling, it may affect China's maritime vessels or planes. Considering the current isolation of North Korea, North Korea may notify China privately, but because China does not agree with North Korea's development nuclear guidance, let alone the spy satellite launched this time, so North Korea finally notified the Japan Maritime Security Agency, Japan announced the ships and planes in the region.</p>
<p>In addition, given the geographical location of the lip and teeth of China and the Korean Peninsula, the sensitivity of North Korea's development of spy satellites to China is beyond doubt, and China's attitude will have great symbolic significance.</p>
<p><strong> North Korea Launch Certificate Certificate of Japan and South Korea Union is weak </strong></p>
<p>From another perspective, the satellite launch of North Korea's failed satellite also explains that it is actually weak to deal with the North Korea alliance.</p>
<p>The domestic launch of spy satellites, Japan and South Korea were actually chaotic at the time.</p>
<p>According to the Yonhap News Agency: After the news of North Korea ’s launch spacecraft came out, the Seoul Municipal Government sent a text message at 6:41 am on May 31 that the Seoul region issued an air defense warning at 6:32 to remind citizens to be evacuated. As a result, the capital caused the capital The people are chaotic. At that time, the US media reported that: North Korea's satellite launch failed, and Seoul entered the "panic mode". Later, the Ministry of Administration of South Korea issued a correction message at 7:3 that the Seoul region issued a work error in the early warning department. Later, the Seoul Municipal Government sent a security reminder SMS at 7:25, saying that the SMS of the critical disaster was sent to the crisis disaster due to North Korea's shooting.</p>
<p>On the 31st, the Seoul Municipal Government clarified the chaos caused by a disaster prevention SMS message on the 31st that the early warning information issued by the Ministry of Administration's Ministry of Administration's Ministry of Administration's Relevant Notification of North Korea's launching spacecraft was issued. The mayor of Seoul City in the afternoon acknowledged that the city had an excessive response to North Korea's launch satellite, but there was no "misunderstanding."</p>
<p>The situation in Japan is similar. The Japanese government once informed the people that North Korea may launch missiles in the direction of Okinawa Prefecture. At about 6 am, alert to Okinawa Prefecture called on the people to go to the building or underground refuge; To Japan. However, the Japanese Maritime Security Agency also said that suspected North Korean missiles had fallen and called on ships to be vigilant.</p>
<p>The chaotic display of the above Japan and South Korea, in terms of the Nuclear Nuclear, there are problems with the domestic social mobilization and management of Japan and South Korea. It is mainly due to the limited ability to control the situation. Once the war, this ability will be Even more doubtful. The alliance that is currently approaching the two countries has not seen how it can be effective in the DPRK. After leaving the United States, Japan and South Korea obviously cannot deal with the North Korean crisis, which can be reflected from the second test spy satellite that North Korea will soon conduct.</p>

<h1>Why is European food prices so high</h1>

<p>Description: From Britain to the European Union, food prices are rising at a record speed. Continuous inflation is squeezed with low -income families, and it also plagues politicians. The rise in prices may bring pressure on high interest rates to the central banks of various countries, thereby curbing economic growth.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-01T04-12-49-08-00/c01europe-foodinflation-master1050.png" /><strong> Why is the price of food in Europe so high? </strong></p>
<p>The cost of agriculture and energy is declining, but for consumers, the prices of basic products are still high.</p>
<p>Slice white bread is the most basic staple food. In April, the average price of a British bread increased by 28%over the same period last year to £ 1.39 (about 12 yuan).</p>
<p>In Italy, noodles such as noodles are an indispensable part of daily diet, and the price rose nearly 17%compared to the previous year. In the EU's largest economy Germany, the price of cheese rose nearly 40%over a year ago, and the price of potatoes rose 14%.</p>
<p>Throughout the European Union, the average food consumption prices in April rose nearly 17%compared to the same period last year, which slowed down from the fastest growth rate in 25 years last month. The situation in Britain is worse than neighbor Western European countries: the price of food and non -alcoholic beverages has increased by 19%, which is the fastest year of food inflation in the past 45 years. In contrast, the annual inflation rate of US food is 7.7%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-01T04-12-49-08-00/c01europe-foodinflation-02-master1050.png" />Last year, the EU's major food prices rose. Data as of April 2023. Source: EU Statistics Bureau by Rebecca Lieberman</p>
<p>Continuous food inflation is squeezed by low -income families, and it also plagues European politicians. (The Italian government held a meeting this month and discussed <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/italy-holds-summit-as-pasta-price-soars-12879115">Steading prices of pasta</a>The problem. .</p>
<p>At the same time, most of the past year, the main costs of producing foods, including fuel, wheat and other agricultural products, have been declining in the international market. Essence Considering the possibility of rising labor costs and the possibility of huge profits, food prices are unlikely to fall quickly. From a wider perspective, rising prices may also bring pressure on the central banks of various countries, which may suppress economic growth.</p>

<p><strong> What does it push up food prices? </strong></p>
<p>The price of a bread includes not only the cost of key raw materials, but also the cost of processing, packaging, transportation, wages, storage and corporate increase in price increases.</p>
<p>The UN global grain product price index, such as wheat, meat, and vegetable oil, reached the peak in March 2022 after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia. Ukraine is one of the largest food producers. The war disrupted the food and oil production of the region, and had an impact on the world, which exacerbated the [Food Crisis] in some areas of East Africa and the Middle East.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/02/us/politics/russia-ukraine-food-crisis.html)Essence</p>
<p>But the worst case is avoided, partly because of a agreement to export food from Ukraine. Since May last year, European wheat prices have fallen by about 40%. Global vegetable oil prices fell by about 50%. But there is still a long way to go: the Food price index of the United Nations April is 34%higher than the average level in 2019.</p>

<p>In addition to the price of commodities, Europe has also experienced a sharp rise in the cost of food supply chain.</p>
<p>Energy prices soared because the war forced Europe to quickly use new supply to replace Russia's natural gas, which pushed the cost of food production, transportation and storage.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Although the price of wholesale energy has recently fallen, retailers warn that consumers need to see the benefits of price decline for a long time -it may be as long as one year -because the energy contract is signed a few months ago, and it was signed a few months ago. It is likely to reflect higher prices.</p>
<p>The European labor market is tight, the shortage of positions, and a low unemployment rate, which forced employers including food companies to increase wages to attract workers, and in turn, it has pushed up the cost of corporate costs including the food industry.</p>
<p><strong> Is the price remained high? </strong></p>
<p>Consumers, trade unions, and some economists are increasingly doubting that to protect the profit margin above costs, companies may keep inflation at unnecessary highs. The European Central Bank stated that at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/business/company-profit-inflation-europe.html">corporate profits contributed to domestic inflation as much as greater increase in wages</a>, But it does not show whether there is any industry's profits.</p>
<p>Economists from the German insurance company and asset management company Oedto estimate that 10%to 20%of food inflation in Europe can be attributed to huge profits. "We see that some of the rise in food prices can not be explained easily."</p>
<p>However, due to the lack of detailed data on the profit and supply chain of the corporate corporate, the economic views have disagreed.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Some economists and food retailers point their fingers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/business/food-inflation-prices.html">Global Large Food Manufacturers</a>, They maintain a two -digit profit margin while increasing the price. In April of this year, Swiss giant Nestlé said that the profit margin is expected to be the same as last year, about 17%. At the same time, the company reported that the price will be raised nearly 10%in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Sublan said that he had expected food inflation to decline, even if he considers the cost of transportation and the price from farm to shelves.</p>
<p>In the UK, some economists have given different explanations. Oxford Economic Research Institute Economist Michael Sanders said in a report to customers in May that "greedy inflation" was not the culprit in a report given to customers in May. He said that the main reason for inflation rises is the rise in energy and other commodities.</p>
<p>He said that in the past year, the total profit of British non -financial enterprises (excluding oil and natural gas industries) not only did not rise, but declined.</p>
<p>British competition regulatory agencies also said that it did not see evidence of competitive problems in the food freshness industry, but it is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-update-on-action-to-help-contain-cost-of-living-pressures">strengthening the "survey of" living cost pressure "</a> 。</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Although the British <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65267367">milk price reduction</a>It is widely known, but in general, food prices are unlikely to decline recently.</p>
<p>Policy makers are paying close attention to the slowdown in price increase.</p>
<p>There are preliminary signs that the speed of food inflation -the annual price increases at double -digit -has reached its peak. In April, the EU's food increased for the first time in two years.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-01T04-12-49-08-00/c01europe-foodinflation-04-master1050.png" />Source: By Karl Russell</p>
<p>But next, slowing may be gradually.</p>
<p>British Central Bank President Andrew Bailey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/business/bank-of-england-interest-rates-uk.html">This month said</a>: "The time for food price in the entire system seems to be longer than we expect."</p>
<p>Throughout the European continent, some governments are intervention through the price of restricting basic foods, rather than waiting for economic debate about companies to make huge profits. In France, the government is promoting the "anti -inflation season" plan, asking food retailers to reduce the price of certain commodities by June. However, Treasury Secretary Bruno Lermel said this month that he hoped that food manufacturers would make more contributions to this effort and warn that if they refuse to return to the negotiating table, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/france-could-tax-food-industry-over-high-prices-finance-minister-2023-05-11/">may face tax punishment</a>In this way, all the unfair profits obtained at the cost of sacrificing consumers are recovered.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>These efforts may be helpful to some shoppers, but they cannot bring much comfort to Europeans. Food prices are unlikely to decline -may just slow down later this year.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The US House of Representatives passed the debt limit bill on Wednesday (May 31), and temporarily canceled the borrowing of the federal government in the next two years. Although there are still differences, most members of the Democratic and Republican parties finally support this bill, and the next step will be submitted to the Senate to vote.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives led by Republican Party submits this bill to the Senate with 314 votes in favor and 117 votes against the voting; , So as not to pay the bill without money.</p>
<p>Biden said after the voting of the House of Representatives that the agreement was good news to the American people and the economy, and said that he would urge the Senate to pass the case as soon as possible so that he signed it as a law.</p>
<p>This measure is a compromise reached by Bayeng and the Speaker of the House Kevinmccarthy last weekend, which was opposed by 71 hard -line Republicans. This degree of opposition is usually enough to prevent legislation, but with the support of 165 Democrats and 149 Republicans, the bill is passed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T04-23-00Z/65776587_401.jpg" />McCarthy, the president of the US Council, reached an agreement with President Biden on the debt limit.</p>
<p>Republicans of hardliners have hoped to further reduce expenses and make stricter reforms. Chiproy, member of the Freedom Caucus, said that the bill at best allows the United States to get "a vulnerability and gimmick and a 2 -year expenditure freezing."</p>
<p>There is a progressive group of advanced senators involved in the Democratic Party. In addition, additional work requirements: "For my conscience, I cannot vote for supporting the debt limit agreement."</p>
<p>The leaders of the Senate's two parties expressed their hope to pass the legislation before this week. However, there may be variables in voting. Some Republicans stated that they would vote for the amendment of the bill and slow down the bill process by procedure. Debate and voting may continue until weekend, which may complicate things.</p>
<p>If the Senate passes any amendment, it must be sent back to the House of Representatives to vote. Chuckschume, a major party leader and Democrat, seemed to exclude this possibility on the 31st: "We cannot return anything back to the House of Representatives, that's it that simple. We must <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美債危機攪局-拜登印太布局腳步大亂/a-65688655">avoid breach of contract</a>Essence "</p>
<h3>The negotiation of Biden and McCarthy</h3>
<p>After several weeks of difficult consultations and negotiations, Biden and McCarthy reached an agreement on US debt limits last weekend. Bayeng told the media in the White House on Sunday (28th), "This is a very important step forward." "The threat of the disaster breach of breach no longer exists, protecting the historic economic recovery that we get difficult to get. "And urged the two hospitals to pass the agreement.</p>
<p>Biden and McCarthy made a call on the 27th and finally reached an agreement. The content included: principle agreed to increase the limit of US debt for 2 years, but during this period of time, restrictions and reduced government's non -national defense expenditure, recovered new crown epidemic expenses wait.</p>
<p>After a 90 -minute call, McCarthy wrote in Twitter: "I just had a phone call with the president not long ago. After he wasted time and refused to negotiate for several months, we had reached a worthy of Principles. "In an interview with the media, McCarthy described that the bill" historically reduced expenses and major reforms, which would allow people to get rid of poverty, enter the labor market, and control the government's excessive expansion. "</p>
<p>Biden said in Twitter that the agreement represents some kind of compromise, "not everyone can get what they want," but he still keeps the key priority of the Democratic parties.</p>
<p>The temporary agreement reached by Biden and McCarthy can be smoothly in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国债务违约期限延长至6月5日/a-65752174">the final period of the default on June 5</a>Before the successful breakthrough, it is expected to avoid <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国债务上限如何影响全球经济/a-65661380">US credit rating is downgraded, possible economic recession, and the employment loss of millions of people</a>Essence</p>
<p>In this regard, Biden and McCarthy are both optimistic and believe that they can obtain the full support of the gentle faction between the two parties. However, the agreement still triggers the attack on the hardliners Republican and the progressive Democrats.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has always strived to maintain the budget expenditure in 2024. At the same time, it is required to apply restrictions in 2025 to exchange for a 2 -year debt limit to avoid unstable political issues affect the 2024 presidential election. On the other hand, the Democrats insist on It should increase the upper limit of the US debt without any additional conditions.</p>
<h3>What is the upper limit of the US debt?</h3>
<p>The U.S. Congress introduced the debt limit system for the first time in 1917 to regulate the national debt amount that the US Finance could bear. This measure means that the government no longer needs Congress to approve the issuance of each debt.</p>
<p>The public debt bill was passed in 1939 and 1941. Over the past 70 years, the upper limit of debt has been increased by 78 times, including 2011, when the United States failed to reach an agreement on the new upper limit at that time, the S &amp; P lowered US sovereign credit rating and triggered an increase in loan costs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国去年持美债呈12年来最低/a-64745260">In January of this year, US debt has reached a debt upper limit of 31.4 trillion dollars</a>However, the US Treasury Department has taken very measure to allow it to continue to provide funds for government activities.</p>
<p>Although the US federal government has not yet defaulted to the U.S. federal government, if it does not increase the upper limit of the debt, it will exceed June 5th, the last period of the default. The salary, social security payment, and medical subsidies such as veterans such as veterans and disadvantaged Americans will also be put on hold.</p>

<p>The Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman Tan Kefei said that the exchanges between China and the United States have not been interrupted, but "there is no principle of dialogue, and communication must not have no bottom line." He criticized: "The difficulty facing the current communication between the two armies is exactly the United States.

In 2018, he was sanctioned by the United States for assisting China imported Russian weapons.

<h3>UFO Public Hearing: NASA's Five Discovery of the Unknown Flight Group of NASA</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mike Wendling * BBC reporter</li>
</ul>
<p>6:52 am on June 1, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_129872124_gettyimages-72276225.jpg"></a>Image source, getty images</p>
<p><strong> The US authorities investigated about 800 unknown flight objects in decades. A researcher group stated that the phenomenon that was really unpredictable was a small part. </strong></p>
<p>The United States Space Agency (NASA) set up a group last year to explain the research on the institution's research on the so -called unknown abnormal phenomenon (UAP).</p>
<p>The definition of "Uap" is a witness that "cannot be determined as a aircraft or a scientific natural phenomenon".</p>
<p>The research team held the first public hearing on Wednesday (May 31).</p>
<p>This is a few of them that revealed.</p>
<h3>Many phenomena can be explained, and some are still a mystery</h3>
<p>"We have 50 to 100 new reports every month," said Sean Kirkpatrick, head of the ALL-DOMain Anomaly ResolutionOFFICE (AARO) under the AARO.</p>
<p>However, he said that only 2%to 5%of the entire database of these witnesses that "really may belong to abnormalities."</p>
<p>At this hearing, a video shot by the US Navy aircraft over the west of the United States showed that a series of light spots flew over the night sky. Military aircraft failed to intercept these objects at the time, and later found that it was a civil aircraft flying to a major airport.</p>
<p>Other witnesses are more mysterious.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png" /></p>
<h3>Background: What is the UFO public hearing?</h3>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The U.S. General Administration of Space held a UFO public hearing.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the U.S. Space Administration has conducted research on unknown flying objects for decades.</p>
<p>Richardgray, editor of the BBC Future column, reported that the phenomenon of unknown flying objects (UFO) has been stigmatized for a long time -many people do not think it should belong to the category of rational scientific research, but held This meeting clearly shows that the US Space Administration now wants to take this topic seriously, and also shows that the scientific community is becoming more and more willing to discuss the possibility of alien life.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the first public meeting of NASA on UFO research. The detailed reports will also be announced in July* The special group research UAP data established last year -UAP is defined as "the observed in the sky cannot be determined as a aircraft. Or scientifically known natural phenomena " * NASA research is different from the US Department of Defense's investigation of unknown air phenomena, the latter is a research action led by American intelligence personnel</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png" />A report from the Pentagon in 2021 states that the military pilots have witnessed 144 times since 2004, and only one of them has not been explained once. Officials do not want to rule out the possibility of objects from alien creatures.</p>
<h3>Privacy Rights into an obstacle to NASA Survey</h3>
<p>Kirka Patric also mentioned that the issue of privacy limits the investigation of the General Administration of Space.</p>
<p>"As long as we are willing, we can align the largest collection instrument at any time," he said.</p>
<p>"Many of our existing things are around the United States," he said. "Most people ... don't like we will collect instruments at your backyard."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_129951332_p0frj7v1.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Scott Kelly is a former astronaut and pilot with decades of experience. He told a story about visual myth.</p>
<h3>microwave oven and cartoon balloon</h3>
<p>The relevant data of UAP is often difficult to decipher, and it is easy to be interpreted.</p>
<p>David Spergel, chairman of the UAP team of the US Space Agency, mentioned that Australian researchers have intercepted a radio wave.</p>
<p>"Its structure is very strange, and people can't understand what's going on. Then they began to notice that many of them appeared concentrated at lunch time," he said.</p>
<p>It turned out that the high -sensitivity equipment used by the researchers received the microwaves they emitted when they were heated for lunch with a microwave oven.</p>
<p>Scott Kelly is a former astronaut and pilot with decades of experience. He told a story about visual myth.</p>
<p>He and deputy pilot were flying near the Virginia Beach, and his deputy pilot "was convinced that we had just passed an unknown flying object."</p>
<p>"I didn't see it. We turned back to find and found that it was a Simpson cartoon -a balloon."</p>
<h3>Study on the Influence of Starbing and Habits</h3>
<p>Spegel also said that civil aviation pilots are very reluctant to report to the incident because people are prejudice about flying saucer.</p>
<p>"One of our goals is to resolve these prejudices," he said. "Because for UAP, high -quality data is required to answer major questions."</p>
<p>Some scientists also face harassment on the Internet because of their work in this field.</p>
<p>"Harassing can only lead to more stigma in the UAP field, seriously hindering the scientific process, and damping the confidence of other people to study this important issue," said Nicola Fox, the scientific director of the General Administration of Space.</p>
<h3>NASA's practice has changed?</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T06-52-46.000Z/_129951335_p09ml2kz.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Do Americans believe that there are foreign customers? (The picture shows tourists from the Space Museum).</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the hearing on Wednesday is worthy of attention is that the practice of the General Administration of Space in the United States has changed. It took decades to reveal the truth about UFO for decades.</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing, the research team answered public questions. One question is "What are NASA covering up?"</p>

<p>According to the United States CNN (CNN), the US federal prosecutor has a recording of former President Trump in 2021 and acknowledged that he retained a confidential document of the Pentagon after leaving the White House, which involves a possible attack on Iran.</p>
<p>In the report of CNN on Wednesday (May 31), CNN mentioned that he had not heard of this recording, but quoted the description of multiple sources of unknown sources. According to reports, this recording shows that Trump, who is seeking the republican presidential candidate in 2024, knew that he kept confidential materials after leaving the White House in 2021.</p>
<p>Two sources told CNN that Trump's speech showed that he wanted to share the information, but he knew that the ability to decrypt the documents after the steplier was restricted. Trump has denied improper behavior. A Trump representative was unwilling to comment on the recording or published a specific remarks of Trump, saying that the investigation was due to political motivation.</p>
<p>Trump's spokesman said on Wednesday: "The leakage of the radical party behind this political persecution aims to intensify the tension and allow the media to continue to harass President Trump and its supporters."</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether Trump's reservation of the US government's records in January 2021 is illegal, and some of which are marked as the highest secret. The authorities disclosed in August that it is investigating Trump's deletion of the White House records because it believes that Trump illegally holds documents, including some documents involving intelligence collection and secret manpower- Essence</p>

<p>NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg visited Japan in early 2023. The title of the speech was "NATO and Japan: Face the new reality of security with strong partnerships".</p>
<p><strong> As the world's largest multinational military alliance, NATO (NATO) has become more high -profile in Asia since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year, causing the attention of the Indo -Pacific regional state. In May of this year, Japan officially confirmed that NATO will set up a liaison office in Tokyo in July, but at the same time clarify that Japan has no intention of applying to join NATO. </strong></p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately criticized NATO's move to destroy the stability of the area. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning responded to the news at the news meeting, "Asia -Pacific does not welcome camps to confront and does not welcome military groups." She emphasized that since NATO claims to be a regional alliance, it should not seek geographical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>However, NATO set the first formal contact place in India, only symbolic significance or had substantial strategic functions?</p>
<p>Stephennagy, a senior associate professor of Tokyo International Christian University (ICU), told BBC Chinese that provided more opportunities for Japanese and NATO member states to share information sharing, including emergency response on security challenges across the Atlantic and Indo -Pacific regions Plan: "This has a potential Taiwan Strait crisis, the Sino -Indian border friction on the Himalayan plateau, the problem of communication routes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and the spread of the large -scale killing nuclear weapons of Pyongyang."</p>
<p>Chen Yaohua, an assistant professor of Chinese research, told the BBC that Japan ’s assistant professor of research was in Asia that the possibility of“ Little NATO ”in Asia is low. The interaction between Japan and NATO is at least in the short term that symbolizes significance than substantial significance. "After all, NATO is far away from Asia, and it is unlikely to see the NATO army appearing in Asia, and the leader of NATO is the United States.</p>

<p>However, relevant persons commented that no matter how deep the tentacles of NATO in Indo -Pacific, China has caused China to be vigilant. The latter and Moscow will counter NATO, which will directly affect the direction of Sino -Japanese relations.</p>
<p>There are currently 31 member states in NATO, including 6 countries in the G7, including the United States and Britain. Japan, South Korea, and Australia are NATO's partner countries in India.</p>

<p>Kishida Wenxiong has been considered as a firm gentle school within the Liberal Democratic Party, but this year, three documents have been introduced to show that Japan will break through many post -war taboos, including further expanding weapons exports.</p>
<h3>How to generate NATO Tokyo</h3>
<p>The interaction between NATO and Japan became more and more frequent after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. In June last year, the Japanese Prime Minister Kishita Kishita attended the NATO Summit in Spain. In November, Japan officially joined the NATO Network Defense Center. At the end of January this year, Jensstoltenberg, the secretary -general of NATO, arrived in Tokyo and met Kishita Wenxiong. Last week, the Kyodo News Agency disclosed that Kishida was going to participate in the NATO summit held in Lithuania in July.</p>
<p>In fact, when Stoltenberg visited Japan at the beginning of the year, he discussed the idea of setting up a NATO -liaison office in Tokyo. He also issued a joint statement with Kishida Wenxiong after the meeting. In addition to criticizing Russia, the statement emphasized that he faced Beijing in the face of Beijing The rapid strengthening of military forces and expanding military activities have strongly urged Tokyo and NATO to cooperate in improving transparency and military control, disarmament, and anti -diffusion.</p>

<p>Japan is expected to increase defense expenses in the next five years. By 2027, national defense funds will reach 2%of the GDP in Japan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of May this year, after the plan to disclose the liaison office of the Japanese media was determined, the Japanese Foreign Minister Lin Fangzheng confirmed the news that the Prime Minister Kishita Tianshi immediately stated that Japan did not join NATO's plan. At the end of May, the Chinese website "The China Project" said last week that at the end of March this year, Olivier Rittiman, the president of NATO National Defense School, visited Taiwan and met with the president of the National Defense University of Taiwan. After the news was exposed, the latter confirmed a low -key confirmation that the Taiwan government did not respond.</p>
<p>NATO's activity in Indo -Pacific began to radiate to the Indo -Pacific region with Japan as the main axis. Professor Chen Yanhua believes that NATO and Japan's recent close interaction should be driven by the Ukraine War. For a long time studying Sino -Japanese relations, he told BBC that Tokyo judged that Beijing would learn the possible way of attacking Taiwan from the Ukraine War, while NATO judged that there may be Beijing support behind Russia. Therefore, Tokyo may think that "if Beijing can suppress Beijing, it can suppress Moscow, so starting from one year ago, Japan and NATO have begun to strengthen contact."</p>
<p>Su Ziyun, director of the Institute of Defense Strategy and Resources, located in the "Institute of Defense Security" in Taipei, analyzed the two levels of political and strategic cooperation between NATO and Japan.The focus of multiple yuan strategy is to expand the in -depth cooperation between the two parties in space, network and other spaces, and share information to improve early warning results. At the same time, you can also share the cooperation of advanced technology at the technical level to prevent various emerging online attacks. Su Ziyun said that this is a preparation made by the "Zero-Day Attack" to the purpose of improving the benefits of Deterrain Warfare.</p>
<p>Chen Yanhua also agreed that NATO cooperation with Japan should have long -term highlights in how the two sides deepen cooperation in the fields of "responding to network threats, destructive technology, and cracking down on false information." He emphasized that online defense is one of Japan's current economic security projects. At the G7 meeting earlier, Tokyo also specifically proposed that "Japan will definitely refer to the experience of Ukraine in the Ukraine in the Ukraine War in the Ukraine War."</p>

<p>NATO did not exist in Asia Pacific. The United States carried out military deployment through the so -called Pacific "island chain", which was a strategic pattern that continued to this day after World War II.</p>
<h3>Beijing's response</h3>
<p>Most comments believe that a major spindle between NATO and Japan is to open a military contest with China.</p>
<p>After NATO's confirmation of the contact office in Tokyo, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately slammed publicly on that day, and the wording was tough. Speaker Mao Ning said at a press conference that NATO continued to enter the Asia -Pacific and intervene in regional affairs in the east, which will inevitably undermine regional peace and stability and promote camp confrontation. Last week, Mao Ning again criticized Kishida Wenxiong's plan to attend the NATO summit this summer that the Asia -Pacific region was not the geographical category of North Atlantic.</p>
<p>In addition, the WeChat public account of the Chinese official media Beijing Daily, "Chang'an Street Knowledge", also issued a document in May to criticize that Japan is leading "NATO to the gate of China." In the article, the so -called "Chinese challenge" criticized NATO hype, which is called the initiator of the Russian and Ukraine conflict. "" ".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T07-59-39.000Z/_116746325_1ee99a67-a338-4c32-9fd4-520a7a3b3b72.jpg" />Image source, EPA</p>

<p>Dongfeng-21D ballistic missile deployed in China. The Pentagon believes that China has strengthened the anti -intervention ability in the first island chain through the deployment of missiles and space detection systems.</p>
<p>Sun Xingjie, a professor at Zhongshan University of China, said that the Hong Kong media "Ming Pao" said that the cooperation between Japan and NATO can be reminiscent of the British -Japan Alliance in the early 20th century, that is, Japan hopes to cooperate with the world's most powerful military group, and then I want to establish Japan's dominant position in East Asia during the changing period of Europe.</p>
<p>He believes that the actions that Kishida Wento wants to make the Japanese country normally obvious. The introduction of NATO into the Asia -Pacific "Cold War camp also brought the Cold War camp into the Asia -Pacific".</p>
<p>However, Sun Xingjie analyzed that Kishida's goal may not be achieved, because Japan's "normally nationally", which contained in military defense, actually involves the core of Japan and the United States. Seeing that Japan can be completely military autonomy and no longer be subject to the White House. In addition, with China's existing strong national strength, it will continue to prevent the ambition of Japanese military expansion.</p>

<p>2021 NATO Summit: NATO Bulletin lists China as a "systemic challenge" China counterattack refers to "the communiqué continues the Cold War thinking"</p>
<p>However, there are also comments that the Japanese cabinets, which have been in Japan for decades, have once pro -American or doubting the changes in the United States, which also affects the Japanese -American -China triangle relations. The Indo -Pacific Strategy of Beauty has been confirmed, and there are no signs of changes in the short term. And Abe's Kishida Wenxiong, who was promoted in one hand during his lifetime, also walked with Abe's foreign policy.</p>
<p>Based on this to observe the future Sino -Japanese relations, Professor Chen Yanhua told the BBC that in the future, Japan may "gradually get rid of the guilt shadow of the nation -launched country in World War II, which will undermine the current responsibility of international order and peace." He explained that Abe's previous Japanese cabinet tended to be ignored by international affairs because of the guilt of World War II, but after Xi Jinping came to power, China ’s diplomatic confrontation with the United States or the international community made Japan find a reason to be active to international affairs. Specialty, especially It is the network that surrounds China. "The historical characters of Japan and China gradually began to swap after World War II. But the purpose of this encirclement network is not to fight against China, but to deceive China."</p>
<p>Sun Xingjie criticized Japan to use the crisis of Russia and Ukraine's conflict to promote safety mobilization in the Asia -Pacific region. Initially, the "Ukraine Today, Tomorrow East Asia" speculation in Taiwan, and then speculation in territorial disputes between Japan and Russia. It is also a big problem.</p>
<p>However, Professor Naji, International University of Tokyo Christianity told BBC that even if Beijing will strengthen the cooperation between Japan and NATO, the economic connection between China and Japan is still deep, so it is expected that the relationship between the two countries will be alone because NATO will be established alone because NATO is established. The Tokyo contact office increased the tense situation. However, he believes that Beijing may respond to Japan by strengthening military cooperation with Russia in the surrounding area of Japanese territory: "This is also a strong message to Tokyo -on the issue of self -considers in Japan, Beijing and Moscow will work together to cooperate in cooperation and cooperation And put pressure on it.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Twitter Elon Musk, CEO Elon Musk, ended on Thursday (June 1) and ended the iron -style Chinese visit with a full schedule. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/秦刚会晤特斯拉首席执行官马斯克/a-65771877">Except for meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang</a>Musk also met with the Minister of Commerce of China Wang Wentao and the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Jin Zhuanglong, and was received by the high specifications of China throughout the process. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消息人士马斯克本周将访问中国/a-65763757">Become the focus of the media</a>Essence</p>
<p>According to the news released by Chinese official media, Musk said on Tuesday (May 30) when he met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang that he was opposed to decomposing with China.</p>
<p>The next day (31st), Wang Wentao met with Musk; according to Xinhua News Agency, Wang Wentao said that the deep integration of the Sino -US economy, and the two sides should strengthen economic and trade dialogue and cooperation under the guidance of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation. The "vitality and potential" of development is full of confidence in the Chinese market and is willing to continue to deepen mutual benefit cooperation.</p>
<p>Musk also met Jin Zhuanglong on the 31st. The two sides exchanged opinions on issues such as the development of China and the United States and the development of smart connected cars.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/电池的副作用宁德时代在德投资受审视/a-65549438)Chairman Zeng Yuqun has dinner.</p>
<p>Tesla did not respond to Reuters' comment requests, and Musk himself did not disclose specific conversation content to the media. Therefore, the outside world knows very little about the details of his talks with Chinese officials.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Musk's trip to China this week has attracted much attention from Chinese netizens; people call him "pioneer", "Ma Ge" and "global idols" in social media. Some users commented: "Musk is really great. If China can have people like Musk."</p>
<p>Previously, Tim Cook, President of Apple, visited China in March. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Starbucks ’s executive president Laxmannarasimhan also visited China this week; Compared with American entrepreneurs, Musk's visit to China has attracted more attention.</p>
<p>However, although the Chinese media became the focus, Musk seemed to have changed the usual high -profile style on Twitter. Before the interruption of this article, he did not publish any content related to China on his Twitter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T08-09-00Z/65768528_401.jpg" />Musk's private plane arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport on May 30</p>
<h3>Visit the Tesla Factory in China</h3>
<p>In addition to meeting Chinese officials, Musk also visited Tesla's electric vehicle factory in Shanghai on Wednesday evening; Reuters pointed out that he was welcomed by hundreds of employees locally.</p>
<p>"A very meaningful day!" Grace Ta, head of Tesla's public affairs in China, said in a Weibo article with photos.</p>
<p>Musk's trip was the first time since visiting the Tesla Shanghai plant in early 2020. Tesla built a super factory in Shanghai in 2019 and is the company's highest productivity automobile manufacturer. On April 9 this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/特斯拉首個海外儲能工廠落腳上海/a-65269257">Tesla announced in Twitter that it will open an energy storage plant in Shanghai</a>This will be Tesla's second factory in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In response to the prospects of Tesla's future in China, Chen Hongxin, an associate professor at the East China Normal University Enterprise Management Department, pointed out to DW that Tesla's production scale in the United States and Germany is smaller than in China. ; Tesla's goal of driving in China this year has reached 1 million, and the price of Tesla made by China is lower than the price made by the United States.</p>
<p>However, Tesla is currently facing many problems, including the weak demand in the Chinese market, and competition with Chinese auto manufacturers has continued to intensify.</p>
<p>Chen Hongxin believes that the overall automobile market in China is currently going downhill, but <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国一季度汽车出口超过日本-俄罗斯成为最大海外市场/a-65668908">new energy vehicle sales performance is still good</a>Essence As China's sixth -generation national environmental protection standards will be on the road on July 1, as environmental protection standards increase, the sales of China's gasoline vehicle market will be seriously impacted. Therefore, the outside world is still relatively optimistic about the electric vehicle market.</p>

<h3>Scholar: Release China Welcome Foreign Capital Signals</h3>
<p>Chen Hongxin told DW that Musk's visit to China was mainly because the Chinese government strongly invited at this time to represent its signal on behalf of it, hoping to clarify the recent <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国经济好景不再/a-65723945">China's poor economy</a>Essence "Everything that the Chinese government does has its meaning," he said.</p>
<p>Wang Liben, a special professor of Taiwanese college in Guangxi University in Guangxi University, told DW that foreign investment has been moving from China in the past 4 years. The Sino -US trade war also has a great relationship.</p>
<p>Wang Liben interpreted that Musk's interview this time is equivalent to declared to the outside world that these situations may end. "He comes to China, and if he can have a indicator of overtime, it will be helpful to attract foreign capital again in the future."</p>
<p>Chen Hongxin pointed out that Western entrepreneurs such as Musk have continuously released the arguments that cannot be decoupled with China, which is of meaning for their own companies and China, because China has a huge market.</p>
<p>"The result of decourse is to force China to do it by itself (this industry), and even in case of better and better, China can still go abroad to buy." Chen Hongxin believes that for such a large economy in China, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欲限縮中國晶片發展-出口管制有用嗎/a-65767213">the United States’s Sanctions</a>"Not necessarily the right method."</p>

<h3>European and American business community still has doubts about ChinaThe United States CNN reports that some high -level supervisors of some foreign companies have found that China is now a more complex business environment, which is characterized by <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國突擊美企上海辦公室-掀外商憂慮/a-65447816">crackdown on international consulting companies</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國加強反間諜-諮詢公司涉危害國安遭查/a-65557271">Geopolical tensions</a>And uncertain investment prospects.</h3>
<p>Such uncertainty has caused some companies to invest more funds in China. A survey of the British Chamber of Commerce last month showed that 70%of companies said that they took a "watch" attitude towards a long -term investment in China.</p>
<p>Nick Marro, the head of the British "Economist" think tank (EIU), said that the business confidence was "relatively vulnerable" because China recently ended a strict epidemic prevention policy.</p>
<p>"Recently, the blow to information providers has exacerbated this uncertainty," Ma Zhiang told CNN. "The company is increasingly uncertain where the government's red line is, and what measures they need to take to avoid violating regulatory agencies."</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China last month, said that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國修訂反間諜法-擴大國安執法權力/a-65447359">American business people are afraid of becoming the next goal of Beijing</a>Essence "Regardless of the government's intention, this is the information received (we)," he said.</p>
<p>Alfred Wu, an associate professor of the School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore, said, "the Chinese government is trying to find a balance between safety and development, but this will be difficult to achieve."</p>

<h4>Ukraine denied</h4>
<p>Kiev denied the responsibility for these attacks, and Mykhailo Podolyak said that these attacks were "internal organization" attacks.</p>
<p>Podoliak explained in an interview with the Peninsula TV station that the small drone attack launched from near Moscow also pointed out that, in view of the more and more drone attacks, Russia loses its control of its airspace.</p>
<p>Podoliak added, "We are happy about what Russia is happening ... war is gradually moving to Russia's land because they are not trying to solve problems in a peaceful way."</p>
<p>He added, "We see that the drone attack on Russia has continued to increase. At the organization level, these are internal organizations. Russia is losing its control of its airspace. From Ukraine, it was launched from the area around Moscow, which shows that Russia is not as powerful as it claims, and there is no powerful air defense system. "</p>

<p>According to sources, former Vice President of the United States <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/peng-si">Pence</a>He will participate in the 2024 Presidential Election to challenge his former boss and the intimate political allies Trump.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Reuters and Bloomberg reported that sources said that 63 -year -old Pence plans to officially announce the presidential campaign in Eva on June 7 through videos and speeches.</p>
<p>Pence is a firm social conservative. He has been supported by Trump during his tenure, but since the loss of Trump's election, Pence has become increasingly alienated with the former Republican President. Pence said that Trump encouraged thugs to attack the US Congress on January 6, 2021, causing him and his family to be in danger.</p>
<p>Trump has a huge poll leader among more than 10 Republicans who have announced the election. This movement may split the main opposition to the former president. According to the average polls of RealclearPolitics, Pence's average polls in the Republican camp on Wednesday (May 31) are less than 4%, while the average polls of Trump are 53%.</p>
<p>Pence continues to support Trump's many policies and shaped himself as a peaceful and consensus substitute. He also made a appeal to the gospel Christian groups more directly; in recent months, he has spent a lot of time visiting large churches across the country.</p>
<p>Whether Pence's campaign can succeed depends on whether he can attract enough supporters of the Trump policy; these supporters are disgusted with the remarks and behaviors of the former president. Burns, the governor of Indiana and the leader of the House of Representatives in the United States, will also test the appetite of the Republican party building in more and more voters to test the Republican party building.</p>

<p>China is equipped with an important part of autonomous driving -laser imaging, detection and ranging(Lidar, referred to as laser radar for short)The vehicle shipment of sensors is the first in the world, and after recently replacing Japan to become the world's largest car exporter, it is likely to maintain this position. In addition to the scale advantage of the world's largest automotive market, China lacks traditional internal combustion engine technology. With the entire industry entering the new era of electric and autonomous driving, it is more convenient for it to light up. Traditional internal combustion engine technology is dragging many Western cars.</p>

<h3>Rare genetic mutation, making her a woman who can not feel pain</h3>
<p>8:45 am on June 1, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T08-45-55.000Z/_129854076_headshot.jpg"></a>Image source, PA Media</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Joe Cameron's condition may lead to the development of new therapy.</p>
<p><strong> Jo Cameron is the only person in the world who has two genetic mutations in the world, which means that she can hardly feel pain and has a strong ability to heal. </strong></p>
<p>The researchers spent 10 years before discovering the role of these mutations. In 2013, the 65 -year -old man at the time had a regular hand surgery, which discovered a genetic mutation, which explained the reason why she was not sensitive to pain.</p>
<p>She told the BBC: "I had a handwritten arthritis surgery. I chatted with the anesthesiologist at the time. He said that it would be a very, very painful operation, and you will experience great pain afterwards."</p>
<p>I said, "I can't feel the pain." He came to me after the operation. He said, "You don't take medicine to relieve pain. This is very unusual."</p>
<p>When her anesthesiologist Devjitsrivastava, her anesthesiologist Devjitsrivastava referred her to the University of London (UCL) and Oxford University painter. The team of genetic experts collected tissue and blood -like to observe her DNA.</p>
<p>After six years of research, they discovered that the unknown FAAH-OUT gene mutations made Ms. Cameron, who lived in the Scottish highlands, had no pain, pressure or fear.</p>
<h3>What is the FAAH-OUT gene mutation?</h3>
<p>The FAAH-OUT gene is a member of a group of genes and has always been considered "junk DNA". But scientists are now understanding the importance of these genes in the process of reproductive ability, aging and disease.</p>
<p>In this case, researchers can determine which genes are related to lack of pain, which genes to eliminate anxiety and depression, and which genes help Ms. Qiao heal rapidly.</p>
<p>They found that the FaAH-OUT mutation "closed" the expression of the FaAH gene, which is related to pain, emotion and memory. The mutation also reduces the FAAH Enzyme.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiao's FAAH gene also has a mutation, which reduces the activity of the enzyme. This enzyme is a biocuk that makes a protein. It usually decomposes the "happiness" molecule called an Anandamide, but it cannot operate normally for Ms. Qiao.</p>
<p>Scientists also found that the two mutations owned by Ms. Qiao not only made her feel pain, but also related to healing.</p>
<p>"They are connected to some extent. Her cells can heal at a speed of 20%to 30%faster than ordinary people, which is amazing, so you can imagine the health potential of wound healing," Ande, deputy professor of the University of London, Andreiokorokov said. He is a senior co -author published in the research on the brain published in the neuroshi.</p>
<p>"This mutation deletes a part of the FAAH-OUT gene and close it. Ms. Qiao has another mutation in the FAAH gene. So far, we don't know who has these two mutations in the world."</p>
<h3>Why do we need to feel the pain?</h3>
<p>Pain is essential for protecting us from destructive and threatening life. The consequences of pain can not feel very serious.</p>
<p>For Ms. Qiao, who often burns her arms on the oven, she has to rely on the burnt smell of the flesh to know that her skin has been injured.</p>
<p>"We have worked with other patients, and they can't feel pain because of mutation of other genes, and sometimes they are seriously injured. Therefore, it is a good thing to feel pain, but sometimes pain will become chronic without any more. Useful, "Professor James Cox, an expert in human pain in the University of London and the author of the study, said.</p>
<p>During the growth process, Ms. Qiao didn't know she was different. She has never taken any painkillers.</p>
<p>She said: "I don't think this is unusual, because this is me. I have children. I have a husband who has been married for many years. They just think I have a huge painful ability."</p>
<p>Gene mutations also mean that she feels much faster.</p>
<p>She said, "When something hates happens, my emotions will respond immediately like others. But then, I think I can do something, and I start thinking about the strategy of getting rid of the predicament."</p>
<p>Professor Kokis hopes that these discoveries can promote new drug research to help pain management, wound healing and mental health.</p>
<p>He said: "Chronic pain is the most common health situation in our time. We urgently need new painkillers. By understanding how FaAH-OUT operates at the molecular level, we hope to develop new and better painkillers. "</p>

Earlier, the average value of the economist was the same as that of April, that is, 49.5.</p>
<p>According to the German Plan, Caixin's PMI reflects the atmosphere of small and medium -sized private enterprises. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/5月中国官方pmi不如预期-工业尤其堪忧/a-65779681">The day before, China's official manufacturing PMI was less than 50, which means that economic activities are in the contraction range</a>Essence The official PMI reflects the situation of large and state -owned enterprises.

<p>In addition, the manufacturing industry's faith index for the manufacturing industry in the new financial new survey fell to a low point in the next 12 months. This is mainly due to concerns about global economic prospects.</p>
<p>China's economic trends have inconsistent signals. In particular, only limited recovery after the end of the new crown seal control measures. There are still many problems in the real estate market. Many German companies, especially in the chemical industry, also feel the pressure of market downturn.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000000.png" />This year, from spring to summer, Asia is shrouded in the heat waves, high temperature events in many places in China have frequently spread. On May 29, Shanghai broke the centennial high temperature record, and women were prepared to go out. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06012023093944.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Agence France-France-France-France-France-France-France-France-France-A-Langk: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/GRN-06012023093944.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06012023093944.html/@@stream)Last year's extreme high -temperature incident memory was still fresh. This year, Asia is shrouded in the heat waves. In early May, the highest temperature of 44.1 ° C in northern Vietnam had a record of 44.1 ° C. On May 29th, the Shanghai Xujiahui Meteorological Station broke the century record. In the past May, the highest temperature record was 35.7 ° C, which appeared in 1876, 1903, 1915, and 2018. This year, it has been increased by 1 ° C.</p>
<p>The residents of Shanghai said anxiously that as soon as they went out, they sweated and instantly transitioned to the summer; netizens in Sichuan couldn't help respond, and Leshan was going to be cooked. As early as March, more than 10 cities such as Wuhan and Zhengzhou were higher than 10 ° C higher than the same period of the same period in previous years. Then in April, the highest temperature of up to 151 national meteorological stations in China reached or broke through the historical high temperature pole value. Spring.</p>
<p><strong> April of the hot watch </strong> **</p>
<p>Climate scientists are worried about "the worst April heat wave in the history of Asia", not just East Asia. From Southeast Asia to South Asia, it has also experienced the hottest April in history. High temperature; in mid -April, there were 48 meteorological stations in India, which was measured above 42 ° C, and more than 10 people died of heat stroke; Malaysia also issued heat wave warnings, and even ordered all outdoor activities in schools across the country.</p>
<p>"This year's high -temperature heat waves are not only reported early, but also repeatedly broke the records. It is mainly due to the continuous accumulation of surface thermal energy. The climate warming is getting more and more serious." Analysis, "High temperatures came early this year. This is a serious warning. High temperature is not only early. In fact, it will be postponed this year. In addition, there may be a stirring of the phenomenon of holy infant this year, so this year we will have one. In the summer with long and high temperature, the impact of climate warming will become more and more dangerous. "</p>
<p>The phenomenon of saints (El Ni (o, also known as El Niuno) refers to the phenomenon of high high sea temperature in the East Pacific of the East, and the anti -saint (Laniña, also known as La Nina) is the opposite, which means that the east Pacific East Pacific has a large -scale sea temperature bias Low phenomenon, the two are natural changes in the ocean and atmosphere, and are also regarded as the natural temperature regulator of the earth. Recently, Petteritaalas, Secretary -General of the World Meteorological Organization, said that a new round of holy infant phenomenon may lead to a new peak of global warming and increase the possibility of breaking the high temperature record.</p>

<p>In late April this year, the climate forecast model announced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) showed that the phenomenon of the phenomenon of holy infant was 62%in July, and it would jump to 85%at the end of the year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was also early warning of the phenomenon of saints on May 3, and the possibility of emerging from May to July was 60%, which increased to 80%from July to September.</p>
<p>Zeng Yuheng, a specially -appointed professor of the Marine Research Institute of Taiwan University, also noticed that the recent sea temperature of the Equatorial Pacific has continued to be warm. The research team he led was participated in the forecast of the international well -known IRI/CPC Saint -Infant Collection led by Columbia University. At the same time, he participated in the national weather of China The center -led Chinese multi -mode holy infant collection forecast system, "Now it has gradually developed towards the weak phenomenon of the weak, but it takes more than 3 months to continuously high temperature to confirm." He explained, "From the perspective of the current temperature, we are in the current temperature, we are in the current temperature. There will be weak holy infants in July. It is expected that there will be medium -sized holy infants at the end of this year. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000004.png" />Most of the world's main holy babies forecast models show that Saint Baby is brewing, and it is estimated that there will be a weak phenomenon in July.

<p>In the past three years, the world's longest continuous anti -sanctuary phenomenon has experienced the world. 1.15 ℃.</p>
<p>During the anti -sanctuary period, a large amount of low -temperature seawater in the lower layer of the Eastern East Pacific flooded, making the temperature of the sea surface lower than the normal level. Zeng Yuheng said that the cooling extent vary according to the strength of the anti -sanctuary. Generally speaking, it is possible to from 0.5 ° C to 3 ° C. Although anti -sanctuary will have some cooling effects, because global warming continues to increase the temperature of the earth, and Showing the trend of linear heating, at this stage, it is clear that the temperature decline of anti -sanctuary babies for three consecutive years is weaker than warming up."Anti -sanctuary phenomenon is like when we open the refrigerator, and suddenly feel that the surrounding temperature will be cold." Wang Zhonghe made this way. "Now warming makes the background temperature of the surrounding area higher, so when the refrigerator is opened, the cool feeling does not look like In the past, it was so strong that when it was closed, the feeling of heat around the surroundings was even stronger. "</p>
<p>In the early spring of this year, the anti -saint babies closed the "refrigerator door". What made people sweat was sweaty. The holy baby had not reported yet. Not only did the land frequently appeared on the ground, but the ocean was also extremely hot. This was not a good sign.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000006.png" />In the past three years, the cooling of the sanctuary in the past three years has not been able to keep up with the trend of warming the global warming.

<p>The information of the National Oceanic and atmosphere of the United States. In early April this year, the average temperature of the global marine surface rose to 21.1 ° C, exceeding the 21 ° C created in 2016, and there were moderate and strong marine heat waves in many places. Including the South Indian Ocean, South Atlantic, northwestern Africa, around New Zealand, northeastern Australia, and western America. Scientists believe that it is unusual in extreme marine heat waves at the same time in many places.</p>
<p>Zeng Yuheng said that in 2016, the strongest phenomenon of holy babies in the 20 years. The last time was 1997 to 1998, and in 2016, it also became the highest year of annual temperature in the world since it was recorded. This year, the holy babies have not happened. Continuously rising, this is not the natural fluctuation of the saints and anti -saint babies, mainly from human contributions, because the global warming trend has become more and more obvious in recent years. Ranking results.</p>
<p>The warning news of the ocean is becoming more and more strong, and Wang Zhonghe pointed out that the marine temperature monitoring data shows that since March 12 this year, the average surface water temperature of the global ocean has been higher than at any time since the record in 1982. It has so far. On May 25th, the water temperature of the marine watch was still 20.9 ° C. It has broken the high temperature record for 74 days, and there is no significant weakening trend. The situation is extremely unusual, which also means that the earth is entering the stage of accelerated warming.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000008.png" />The holy babies have not yet come, but this year's global sea temperature has continued to rise (black solid line), which is unusual. (Provided by Wang Zhonghe) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06012023093944.html/5.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000009.png" /></a><strong> The ocean swallows </strong> <strong> 7 billion nuclear bombs </strong></p>
<p>"The ocean is originally a very important heat -absorbing carrier." Wang Zhonghe dotted a potential crisis. "Now it seems that its ability to absorb heat is slowly decreased. We may reach the ability of the ocean to absorb the excess heat of the surface. Pay special attention. "</p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization alert, the ocean heat reached a new observation record in 2022. At least once the 58%ocean surface of this year has experienced at least once. Wang Zhonghe added that the new study of the journal of "Atmospheric Science Progress" in January this year shows that the heat absorbed by the global ocean 2000 meters in 2022 is 245 Zettajoules, which is equivalent to absorbing more than 27,000 million. The energy of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb is the highest calorie value in history, and it has reached a new high since 2019. In fact, since the industrial revolution in 1750, the surface has absorbed 440 Zeta Jiaoer energy, which is equivalent to 7 billion pieces of 7 billion pieces. Hiroshima nuclear bomb, the surface temperature rises rapidly, is an inevitable result.</p>
<p>Once Yu Heng reminded that the ocean has a great heat capacity, and the adjustment of the balloon climate plays an important role. The ocean temperature increases a little bit, which means that the energy accumulated on the earth has changed a lot. The global sea temperature continues to rise and cannot be relieved.</p>
<p>Ocean warming is intensified, and the disaster is not small. Wang Zhonghe inventory, in the past few decades, as the heat absorbed by the ocean increased, the temperature of the sea surface continued to rise, resulting in frequent marine heat waves. The intensity of typhoons and hurricanes was stronger. Continuously rising. In addition to the influence of the marine physical system, the marine ecosystem is also threatened. High temperature has caused many species to survive difficulties. In particular, coral reefs, which are known as marine tropical rain forests, have suffered a devastating large -scale albin.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T09-54-00-04-00/000010.png" />The rapid warmth of the ocean will not only generate a stronger storm, but also the ocean ecological crisis will also heat up.

<p>Nature magazine published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06083-8">a report</a>It shows that in countries that start to pay such fees, women's mortality rate has dropped by 20%, and the mortality rate of children under five years of age drops by 8%. This impact has been significantly obvious within two years after the project starts, and it has increased over time.</p>
<p>The analysis found that the decrease in the mortality rate is similar regardless of whether the funds are attached to certain conditions (such as asking children to go to school). It is better to cover more population or issue more cash projects.</p>
<p>Countries with poor health care conditions and high mortality have decreased the most.</p>

<p>In 2019, more than 8%of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, with less than $ 2.15 daily living expenses, and about half of the world's daily living expenses of less than $ 6.85. Poverty has potential impact on the stability, education, health and expectations of housing.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day">World Bank</a>It is estimated that in 2020, the new crown epidemic has caused 97 million people around the world to fall into extreme poverty, prompting more countries to start cash distribution plans. Of the 962 projects around the world, 672 were launched during the period of great popularity.</p>
<p>Researchers said that this new study tested the impact of cash on global mortality for the first time. From 2000 to 2019, they collected information about 29 African African countries, one North African country, four Asia -Pacific countries, and three Latin America and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p>They recorded more than 4 million adults and nearly 3 million children, and about 300,000 people died during the study. The recipient will get a cash of 6%to 13%per capita income of specific countries, usually less than $ 100.</p>
<p>Donors are often worried that the helping person may abuse funds to buy alcohol, spam, food or other non -essentials, but "data does not prove this", Audrey Petifer, a social epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina University Church Mountains explain.</p>
<p>In addition, the research results show that cash issuance may not only help women, but also help families and the entire community.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Tobias Bilstron said that Sweden had all the conditions to join NATO and called on Turkey and Hungary to immediately revoke opposition to this step.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the NATO member State Foreign Minister's meeting held by Bilstron at Oslo, "Sweden has fulfilled all the commitments we made at the Madrid Summit last year, including new counter -terrorism legislation."</p>
<p>He added, "It's time for Turkey and Hungary to approval Sweden to join NATO."</p>
<p>In response to a major requirement of Ankara, the Swedish Parliament recently adopted a new law to prohibit activities related to extreme organizations, especially the Kurdish Workers' Party, and Turkey regarded it as a "terrorist" organization. The law took effect on Thursday, 1st, and strengthened its counter -terrorism legislation.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg stated at the NATO member country's meeting held by Oslo, "I believe that Sweden will become our members, and we are trying to achieve this goal as soon as possible."</p>
<p>He added, "Earlier this week, I talked with President Rejuepa Tidi Erdogan. I will also go to Ankara in the near future to further discuss how we can ensure that we grant Swedish membership qualification as soon as possible ","</p>
<p>Stoltenberg confirmed that the information he conveyed to the President of Turkey was that Sweden became one of his members in line with NATO's interests. He also pointed out that he "believes that Hungary will also be approved to join the linked letter."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO after the war in Ukraine was launched in Russia, but was opposed by Turkey.</p>
<p>On June 28, 2022, Turkey, Sweden and Finland signed a memorandum of understanding of the three parties to join NATO. Earlier, they promised to respond to the cooperation requirements in the "anti -terrorism" issue proposed by Ankara.</p>
<p>However, after the Swedish authorities were allowed to burn the Gulan Sutra in front of the Turkish embassy in the capital Stockholm, the atmosphere between Turkey and Sweden was extremely nervous.</p>
<p>At the end of February 2022, the Turkish Foreign Minister Mev Lutal Chawos said that Sweden had a commitment to join NATO and pointed out that Ankara could not approve Stockholm's qualifications unless he fulfilled these commitments.</p>
<p>Joining NATO needs to be approved by all 30 NATO members, including Turkey.</p>

<p>"June 4th" has been in the past 34 years. Over the past 34 years, on this day, our friends overseas will meet together to commemorate the "June 4th". This is first of all because of our moral conscience. Although "June 4th" has passed 34 years, the murderer government is still sitting on the stage and continues to oppress the people. The CCP authorities are still blocking the memories of the "June 4th". It is forbidden to publicly hold mourning in the country. How can we gently put down the "June 4th" and no longer commemorate it?</p>
<p>We commemorate the "June 4th" overseas, not only for ourselves, but also for the people of millions of domestic people to express our common sorrow, common protests, and common beliefs. We commemorate the "June 4th", not only to mourn the hero that fell on Chang'an Street 34 years ago, but also to mourn countless injustice under the tyranny of the CCP for more than 70 years. A bloody massacre also protests the cruel suppression of the CCP's people over the past 70 years. What we require is not only to vote for the "June 4th", but also to completely end the one -party dictatorship to ensure basic human rights and achieve freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>We commemorate the "June 4th" because the "June 4th" is closely linked to today's world. Yes. Today, 34 years later, many people have forgotten the "June 4th". Many young people don't even know the "June 4th". The world does not seem to be able to afford the bloody picture 34 years ago. But we must point out that "June 4th" has not become the past, and "June 4th" and the world today are not unrelated. On the contrary, time makes evil appreciation. With the passage of years, the evils of the "June 4th" and its influence have become more and more fully displayed.</p>
<p>"June 4th" not only interrupted China's political reform, but also introduced China's economic reforms to astray. Under the fear effect of the "June 4th", China's economic reform will inevitably evolve into a feast of nobles. After the "June 4th", China's economic development will inevitably be regarded as the largest capital to maintain its own autocratic rule. Therefore, it is not surprising that the CCP authorities have not started political reform while deepening economic reform. It does not even become softer and more tolerant because of its huge economic success. On the contrary, the Chinese Communist regime has become more confident and more authoritarian and more concentrated than before, and no longer hide the light in international affairs, becoming more high -profile and more aggressive. Looking back at more than 30 years ago, the international communist camp collapsed. The United States became the world's only super strong, free democratic forces achieved the most brilliant victory in human history, and the optimism of history has ended the world. In just more than 30 years, we witnessed the amazing reversal of the political structure of the entire world. The rise of the totalitarian dictatorship has constituted the most severe challenge to the universal value of free democracy. The key to this huge change is the "June 4th". "June 4th" not only changed China, but also changed the world.</p>
<p>US President Biden said that Xi Jinping has repeatedly told him that the democratic system cannot be maintained in the 21st century. The autocratic system will dominate the world. Biden said we are experiencing a global struggle between an authoritarian country and a democratic country.</p>
<p>The "June 4th" has been in the past 34 years. Today, the world has fallen into a huge crisis, but the world is more surprised and sober than before, and recognize the serious harm of the Chinese Communist regime. Today, we commemorate the "June 4th" to continue to promote the banner of free and democracy, and all the people who cherish universal values all over the world, and invest in the ultimate battle of the Chinese Communist Party's autocratic system.</p>

<h3>2024 U.S. Presidential Election: The number of Republican candidates rose, and the election situation became hot</h3>
<ul>

<p>10:17 am on June 1, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129950213_trumphand.jpg"></a>Image source, getty images</p>
<p><strong> The competition nominated by the Republican presidential candidate in 2024 is heating up, and two long -term competitors have joined the candidate. </strong></p>
<p>Former US Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Governor Christie will announce the election next week to make the presidential campaign more crowded.</p>
<p>This will make the current leader, former President Donald Trump uncomfortable, and will inevitably make the campaign full of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The final winner may challenge the Democratic President Biden in the election of November next year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65135322">Trump was prosecuted as the first case of American politics for criminal prosecution for the "sealing fee" incident. How will this affect the 2024 presidential election? </a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-63649542">Trump "Rebumbing the Rivers and Lakes" in 2024 to run for the six uncomfortable factors of the President of the United States in 2024</a></p>
<h3>Mike Pence</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_127559479_gettyimages-1398904877.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>According to sources close to Pence's campaign team, Pence will launch a campaign in Iowa on June 7, which will cause him to make fire between him and his former boss.</p>
<p>For four years, he has been Trump's loyal deputy and served as the position of vice president. Until the riots of Congress in 2021, their relationship broke down.</p>
<p>Pence is the son of the Korean War veteran, and his conservative political career began at the host of the talk show.</p>
<p>He was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in 2000 and in his term until 2013. He claimed that he was a "conservative with principles" and was consistent with the Tea Party Movement.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2017, he served as Governor of Indiana. During his tenure, he passed the largest tax reduction bill in the state and signed a bill restricting abortion and protecting religious freedom.</p>
<p>63 -year -old Pence is a gospel Christian. In 2016, as Trump's campaign partner, he was considered to make effort to mobilize key voters.</p>
<p>He was calm and gentle, and was regarded as the spokesperson who exaggerated his president. But after he refused to help overthrow the results of the 2020 election, Trump accused him of lack of "courage".</p>
<p>The thugs who supported Trump attacked the US Congress Building in January 2021 and heard them shouting, "Turning Mike Pence!" It was reported that they were less than 40 feet (12 meters) less than the vice president.</p>
<p>Since then, the two have been keeping a distance, but Pence has been carefully avoiding the friendly voters of Trump.</p>
<h3>Christie</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129949572_christie.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>According to many sources, the former New Jersey Governor plans to announce the election at a city hall event held on June 6 in New Hampshire, where the first Republican primaries will be held.</p>
<p>After the failure of the president in 2016, Christie fidered with Trump, leading the transition team of the upcoming president at the time, and prepared for his debate with Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>But since the U.S. Congress riots, he has strongly criticized Trump.</p>
<p>In April of this year, the sharp words of Christie previewed the attack on Trump in the Trump in the city of New Hampshire. He said: "Donald Trump is a TV star, that's it. If he returns to the White House, things will change. It's bad. "</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2018, Christie served as governor of New Jersey. He was shadowed due to a political scandal involving a political scandal involving a bridge lane. This incident was alive to partly aimed at the political hatred of a Democratic mayor.</p>
<p>Before elected governor, Christie served as chief prosecutor of New Jersey in President George W Bush from 2002 to 2008.</p>
<h3>Ron Desantis</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_128629359_desantis.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Ron Desantis, Governor of Florida, has been working hard to follow Trump. He is regarded as the most capable of defeating Trump's candidates in frontal competition.</p>
<p>With the support of Trump, he won the governor's position and easily re -elected in more than 1.5 million more votes in the mid -term elections. This is the largest difference in the state in the state election for more than 40 years. During his term, the number of Republican voters in the state for the first time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65774908">2024 U.S. presidential election: the number of Republican candidates rose, the election situation became hot and heated</a>More than the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The 44 -year -old De Santis served as a lawyer after graduating from Harvard and Yale University, but he is still a newcomer in American politics.</p>
<p>He served in the U.S. Navy and went to Iraq. From 2013 to 2018, he was also a little -known House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But since he served as the governor in 2019, De Santis has increased sharply, and he has positioned himself as a enthusiastic cultural warrior.</p>
<p>He supports legislation to cancel the funding of diversified and inclusive projects, prohibit gender identification at public schools, prohibit transformation performances and gender care for minors, and restrict abortion and relaxation of gun laws. He was also trapped in legal disputes with Disneyland World Park.</p>
<p>The governor touted his political achievements as the "blueprint" of conservative leaders, and supporters said that he did not have so many drama effects to replace the former president who seemed to be nominated again.</p>
<p>Trump seems to be very concerned about this and attacks him almost every day on social media.</p>
<h3>Tim Scott</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129784138_gettyimages-1442811990.jpg" /></p>
<p>Senator Tim Scott has decades of political experience in South Carolina. He had nearly $ 22 million (£ 18 million) cash on his hand during the campaign in May, more than his competitors.</p>
<p>At the age of 57, he was the only black man who worked in the two houses of Congress. He has been working on the Senate on behalf of South Carolina since 2013.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott is the grandson of cotton field workers and the son of a single mother. He often talked about how his family "walk from cotton to Congress."</p>
<p>When he was running for 2024, he vowed to reverse this "retreat country" and revive the "great culture" in the United States.</p>
<p>He was very popular among colleagues, and soon received support from two senators, including John Thune, a Republican Republican person in the Senate.</p>
<p>But he was not the only high -level South Carolina Republican Republican Party who participated in the campaign.</p>
<h3>Nikki Haley</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_129845153_d4aa9f12932e582bf465c01caf31dc4810db17ea0_0_6000_33751000x563.jpg" />Image source, EPA-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock</p>
<p>Nikki Haley announced in mid -February that the president was the first major Republican candidate to compete with Trump.</p>
<p>The 51 -year -old Heili was considered one of the most promising young candidates for the Republican Party, but has maintained a low -key in recent years.</p>
<p>Heili was born in the Punjaik immigrant family next to South Carolina, and became the youngest governor of the United States in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2015, she called for the withdrawal of the federal flag from the State Congress of South Carolina, causing national attention.</p>
<p>Although she said in 2016 that she was "not a fan of Trump", she later accepted Trump's nomination and became the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. During the term of office, at a meeting of the Palestinian Special Envoy at the UN Security Council, she suddenly left the controversy.</p>
<p>Her campaign includes a compulsory psychological test of politicians over the age of 75, and emphasizes that the "new generation" US leaders need to be needed.</p>
<h3>Vivek Ramaswamy</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-01T10-17-56.000Z/_128865820_gettyimages-1471048738.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, 37, was announced in an interview with the Fox News Channel at the end of February and announced to join the election as a dark horse.</p>
<p>As an Indian American biotechnology entrepreneur without political experience, he is a frequent visitor to Fox host Tuckercarlson daily program. The show was the highest -wired news program in the United States.</p>
<p>The graduate of the Harvard and Yale University believes that the United States is in the national identity crisis due to the decline of faith, patriotism and eliteism.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2021, he operated a pharmaceutical company and then founded Strive AssetManagement with people. The company avoided the "split" environment, social and corporate governance (ESG) framework. And treat yourself as Berlaide(Blackrock)Waiting for alternatives of large companies.</p>

<p>Asa Hutchinson, who has been re -elected as the governor of Arkansas, announced the president in an interview with the US Broadcasting Corporation in April. A few days ago, Trump was charged with criminal charges in New York.</p>
<p>The 72 -year -old Harchinson said the case was "trouble and interference" and should promote Trump to withdraw from the election.</p>
<p>The former lawyer and businessman were the youngest federal prosecutors in the United States during the Ronald Ridan government.</p>
<p>He also served as a member of the House of Representatives in the United States, including the prosecutor in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, and the director of the Drugs of the Bush administration.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-25-00-04-00/000000.png" />The former Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army National Defense University, Liu Asia Video Screenshot of Liu Asia with the rank of General Air Force/CCTV</p>
<p>Former Political Commissar and the PLA of the Chinese National Defense University, Liu Asia, was spoiled by Xi Jinping. In this regard, there was a voice of sympathy and regrets at home and abroad. Some objections even thought he was a comrade -in -arms who fought side by side. The main basis was that some of the articles on the Internet that was talked about by Liu Asia on the Internet.</p>
<p>However, most of such articles signed by Liu Asia are replaced by names, and Liu Asia has clarified many years ago. More than a year ago, Zheng Cunzhu, an disagreement from exile in the United States, also issued a public statement to apologize for his deception: "In August 2013, I stole the names of Mr. Liu Asia, wrote and published" New Thinking of Political Reform- " - Liu Yaia's internal speech. At that time, the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China had just passed, and many people in China had expectations of Xi Jinping, a new general secretary Xi Jinping, but believed that he had to restart the drums and blows of Chinese political reform in the face of various resistance. , Had to go out of this strategy, stole the name of General Liu, and attempted to set off the turbulence of public opinion in order to blow a pool of spring water ... ... This approach is indeed a stolen act. It should be publicly apologized to Mr. Liu Asia. At the same time, he also apologizes to all readers who believe, forward, and comment. " But I have always believed that we must not oppose the Communist Party in the way of the Communist Party. You must not use lies to oppose lie. Otherwise, even if you defeat the Communist Party, you have become another Communist Party, as Nietzsche said: "People who fight with monsters, Be careful not to be a monster. When you stare at the abyss from a distance, the abyss is staring at you. "</p>
<p>What really represents Liu Ya's thought is not the pseudo -trustees of unknown origin, but the TV political film "Silent". On October 26, 2013, the one -and -a -half -hour television political film "Silent Silent" quietly "flowed out" on the Internet. The film was jointly launched by the three departments of the National Defense University, the Ministry of Political Defense, the General Staff, as well as the Institute of Social Sciences and the Institute of Modern International Relations (Think Tank of the Ministry of National Security). The film's interpretation of a series of events such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the changes in Eastern European, and the Middle East Jasmine Revolution, concluded that all the source of this is the use of unconventional means in the United States to subvert the shocking conspiracy of other countries. The film accuses Western countries led by the United States. In order to subvert China's current system, try to penetrate and interfere with the five fronts of politics, culture, ideology, society, and organizations. In recent years result.</p>
<p>Liu Asia puts "Commerce Silent" on the Internet. One is because through traditional media such as CCTV playback, it needs to go through a long -lasting review process. The other is that he has found that the "touch rate" of the Internet has surpassed TV. In an interview, he said: "Today's Internet has become the main battlefield of ideological struggle in the field of ideology. Western hostile forces attempts to use this' maximum variable 'to" reverse China'. The rumor and even 'soul chicken soup "compete on the Internet to speak on the Internet, and it is very confusing. To compete for the right to speak, we must pay attention to the profound changes in public opinion ecology and media patterns, and to enter the concept and means with the times." He uses this way to occupy the highland of the Internet.</p>
<p>Some commentators pointed out that Liu Yaia asked Qin Tian and other army to worship the nationalism. The second is that Liu Asia himself took another layer from the position of political commissar of the National Defense University, won one of the members of the Central Military Commission, and even became Xi Jinping's "Military Chinese Division".</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this TV film is too hard -in the film, the shadow Wang Qishan and Ma Kai and other senior officials in the financial field are the "subverting tools" of the United States -Ford Foundation -contact. This kind of t impartten means was related to Wang Zhen in 1989 that Zhao Ziyang and Soros's open foundation were related to the US agents, which was almost the same. After watching the TV film, many leftists called on the background of the "American spokesperson" in the background of the Chinese party and government organs. At that time, Xi Jinping was an alliance with Wang Qishan to use Wang Qishan to govern the economy and rectify political opponents, and it was naturally unbearable to this "provocation". So, five days later, Xi Jinping ordered the entire network to block the "Silent".</p>
<p>** Taking China's future to Liu Asia is the defect and moral timidity of intelligence.</p>
<p>"Silent" is Liu Asia's name, but it has played a reaction, allowing Xi Jinping to be quite afraid of this ambitious "Confucian general". Although Xi Jinping fully accepted Liu Asia's thought in the film, he also buried the foreshadowing of Liu Asia. Just as Qin's national owner accepted Shang Yang's reform, he executed Shang Yang's five horses.</p>
<p>Former Professor of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China who lived in the United States, Cai Xiafa, said: "Liu Asia, the second Ren Zhiqiang!Liu Ya's calamity foreshadow a greater catastrophe." She also said: "Constitutionalism, freedom, and democracy are Mr. Liu Asia's clear concept, It is just limited by the environment, and expressing the strategy. "Perhaps, the" red second generation "background with Liu Asia makes her feel the sadness of rabbit fox.</p>
<p>The writer Murong Xuecun sent a different view on Twitter, thinking that Liu Ya and Xi Jinping were a group, and they were Douli. Cai Xia immediately said: "You want to be Xi Jinping's accomplice?" Murong Xuecun responded, "This should not be asked. They have no half dime with me. Fall, do you have to call for them? Political prisoners are high honors. High -dry treatment, living in a high -dry ward, even the high -drying high -drying, not suitable for a cup of high -drying, is not suitable for a cup. "</p>
<p>I praise the views with Murong Xuecun. How to look at the "June 4th" is a ruler that determines whether a person recognizes the value of democracy and freedom. So, how did Liu Asia evaluate the "June 4th"? I wrote such a detail in "Liu Xiaobo Biography": In May 1989, as a military writer, Liu Yaia and the secretary of the Chinese Writing Association, Jin Jianfan, attended the International Writing Society in Marstrich, Netherlands Fifty -three Congress. At a time, students occupied Tiananmen Square to protest the demonstration. The International PEG decided to support China's democratic movement and warned that the CCP authorities must not suppress the people by force. When the chairman of the International Writing Association read out the resolution, Liu Yaia refuted loudly and led a group to retreat, and immediately announced that the Chinese Writers Association withdrew from the International Writing Conference. It was this source of origin that the International Writing Association accepted the independent Chinese pen created by Liu Binyan and Liu Xiaobo as its members. After the "June 4th" massacre, Liu Asia's book of the time of President Wang Zhen suggested that he had to prevent problems. He must control public opinion and education. There must be no another "June 4th", nor can the "June 4th" students grow into opposition in the future.In April 1992, Liu Asia visited Taiwan with a dual identity (writer and soldiers), creating a precedent for members of the Communist Party of China to visit Taiwan. The Taiwan Communist Party received a grand reception. Of course, they did not value Liu Yaia, who was just a school -level officer at the time, but the special identity of his son -in -law of Li Xiannian, who was former chairman of the CPPCC. At that time, Hao Baicun, a big man in the Kuomintang army, passed on two sentences: "First, as long as the mainland party and government and military personnel go to Taiwan, the first one will invite Liu Asia. Second, after Liu Laitai, I will see it. No, I will see it through the person arranged by him. "</p>
<p>After the "June 4th", the CCP's senior management no longer did not have the reforms or enlightened factions in the sense of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Zhu Rongji was not, Wen Jiabao was not, all senior officials who were placed by Xi Jinping were not. This is a common sense. If you do n’t even admit this common sense, you still look for good people and saviors at the senior management of the Communist Party of China, just like looking for diamonds from the pit, and you can only find nothing in the end. In the words of Su Xiaokang's comments: "They are just another 'brother kiln wall', and Liu Asia is just another Bo Xilai. In contrast, Liu Zhiyu is a small witch. ... It is said that he is the main role of challenging Xi and even military coup in the military. I feel that he can think of it? Is he not that can be reduced to another 'showcase rebellion', although he is also a 'prince' (驸 …… …… …… …… …… …… )? If he uses military common sense -he really understands the war, just because he has read a few Western military sciences? "</p>

People familiar with the matter revealed that recently Xu Yan was charged with the crime of inciting subverting the state power more seriously than the provocation. The analysis believes that the Chinese authorities want to warn the West through Xu Yan's case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/ec-05222023080320.html"><strong> Yu Wensheng couple is accused of provoking the official threatening lawyer, do not assist in assisted </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/ec-05102023074124.html">Rights Protection Lawyer Yu Wensheng's disappearance of family members has been forced to abandon his own lawyer</a></strong></p>
<p>Xu Yan's representative lawyer went to the Shijingshan Detention Center in Beijing on May 30 to ask the parties. Wang Qingpeng, a lawyer in the United States, quoted sources as saying that at that time, the National Security rejected lawyer Xu Yan's meeting.</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng: "Xu Yan's lawyer went to meet on May 30, and Shi Jingshan guarded the public security. The public security refused on the grounds of the news. The National Security Bureau of the Beijing Public Security Bureau that came over later told the lawyer that the lawyer could not meet because Xu Yan's case added a new crime: Inciting the crime of subverting the state power, this crime requires the approval of the reconnaissance organs to meet. However, no document is issued to the defense lawyer. "</p>
<p>Xu Yan's husband Yu Wensheng was sentenced to four years for "inciting subversion of the state power" and was released last year. During Yu Wensheng's detention, Xu Yan spoke for her husband through various channels, including meeting with foreign officials in Western countries and often interviewed foreign media.</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng: "This has been related to her many years of lawyer Yu Wensheng's lawyer. There is another thing that after the lawyer Yu Wensheng served his sentence, Lawyer Xu Yan and Yu Wensheng were accepting international human rights agencies, especially the Democratic State Consulate in China. During the invitation to the discussion, the authorities had revealed the persecution of their couples. In addition, their couples and the authorities did not contact their national security and did not meet. The authorities were not good at monitoring their couples, so they arrested and persecuted. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-36-00-04-00/000001.png" />Wang Qingpeng (pictured) believes that Xu Yan was charged with the seductiveness to rescue her Yu Wensheng and the meeting with Western diplomats. (Wang Qingpeng is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-06012023100831.html/m0601gf-1.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-36-00-04-00/000002.png" /></a>** Teng Biao: Destiny of the severe properties of stubbornness.</p>
<p>It is understood that Xu Yan was the first victim's family member who was arrested and held criminally responsible. Wang Qingpeng said that the information issued by the Chinese authorities is very clear.</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng: "This time, the lawyer of Yu Wensheng was arrested and said that the authorities sent a signal to the family members of 709 lawyers: if you do n’t accept it, you must catch it. It is also the CCP authorities calling to the Western society: You dare to care about China's human rights, we will arrest the people you care about and see what you dare to do!"</p>
<p>Teng Biao, a lawyer in the United States, said that the nature of inciting subversion of state power is far more serious than provoking, and Xu Yan's destiny is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Teng Biao: "This charges are obviously a very serious political charges. The authorities will have a lot of space. If it is light, it can be judged for one or two years, and the longest can be judged to 15 years. And private remarks may be regarded as evidence. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-40-00-04-00/000000.png" />Protestant of Ten thousand people in Radakh![] [] <a href="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-40-00-04-00/000001.png"></a>](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023140232.html/@@images/image)Picture intercept the video uploaded by the people uploaded by the people of Ladaka</p>
<p>Me: There is another point, I wonder if you noticed that the incident of the Internet violent respected incident has aroused the most response, or the most powerful protest is the people in the Himalayas. They rally, march, and emotionally shouting emotionally. Essence Not only Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhist believers, Ladaka has many Muslims, as well as Christians and other religious believers. In other words, not all protesters are Tibetan Buddhists. The historic Ladaka is also a sensitive area itself. It is a sensitive area between China and India today. There are tens of thousands of rallys for Radakhs to protest against the Dalai Lama's stain. Such a large -scale protest is said to have not been in the history of Radakh. This phenomenon should not be ignored.</p>
<p>The significance of geopolitics in the Himalayas is important. In fact, China is very concerned, and China is very concerned about the pickups of the Aima. The "Belt and Road" has long studied Himalayan. I have read related books and articles. China and Nepal, China and India, China and Bhutan and so on. In these areas connected by the border, the influence of Jiawa Rinpoche is quite large. So, have you noticed this before?</p>
<p>What I have observed is that Sina Weibo, which was previously in China, was particularly fierce for the demonization of Jiawa Rinpoche. The click rates of various scolding various comics were hundreds of thousands or more. Ranking is third. But when it was rushing up, it suddenly cooled down, and now it has been cooling. Why is this? In Chinese social media, if the topic of politics is a hot topic, it is impossible to be a hot topic, let alone a sensitive topic related to the Dalai Lama. So I saw that Sina Weibo on April 15th began to cool down, and on April 17th, it was particularly obvious to cool down. These two times are the days when the Ladaka people are protested on a large scale. A protests in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>The Tibetans of Ladaka are different from Tibetans in exile Tibet. Tibetans in an exile community in India are refugees, while the Tibetans of Radak are Indians and have India identity. I also noticed that the Radak authorities have passed a decision to announce that some of the media in India's media and some big coffees. If they do not make public apology to the Garva Rinpoche, which are stigmatized, Radaks will not allow them to enter Waldling them to meet to travel and so on. Is Radak doing so is related to the influence of His Holiness in the Himalayan region over the years? We can see that at each French conference held by His Holiness, the people from Himalayan are the most, and Radakh's traditional costumes are very eye -catching. Last summer, the new crown epidemic in India relieved, and His Holiness went to Radakh and lived for more than a month, and had a good relationship with Radakh's Muslims.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-40-00-04-00/000002.png" />His Holiness Dalai Lama held a three -day law meeting in Lingcheng Lingcheng in Radakh in July last year. (The picture intercepted itself) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023140232.html/66708rfa535a5ba21-002.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T10-40-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Friends: I feel that there are two views of the Dalai Lama in the world: one is to look at the Dalai Lama as a person, and if a person will make mistakes. But the Dalai Lama represented not only individuals, he represents God, this is the second view. And not just a god, but also a perfect god in people's minds. Politics, culture, army, etc. can not explain or solve such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama is recognized by the people of the Himalayas a year than the year a year. In fact, it is not just the people in the Himalayas. I have recently attended several gatherings of Western Buddhists. There are many people. They may be suspicious when the stigma of the Dalai Lama was just occurred, but they observed and understood. After that, they thought that the Dalai Lama was not wrong, and it was innocent. In this way, the Dalai Lama really became a Buddha. After becoming a Buddha, he would not die. Even if the flesh is dead, the spirit will not die.</p>
<p>In fact, India has a lot of worries, and they are worried that they are afraid of the Buddhism of the Himalaya, and they are afraid of this. India has a director of a strategic research institute, Radakians, and he does not like the Buddhism of the Himalaya Tibetan biography and wrote a book. Indian political decision makers and military decision makers have this concern. If the Buddhism of the Himalaya Tibetan biography, all the Himalayas such as the border areas such as India, Darwon and other border areas, and some border areas in Nepal will become more and more Tibetan Buddhism, and the power of Buddhism may allow India to India. Feeling trouble. Therefore, some of the decision makers in India have such considerations, that is, the Himalayan region should not be tibetan Buddhism, but they did not consider the stigma of the Dalai Lama this time may bring another effect. Those media in India have no strategic considerations. They may not like the Dalai Lama, mainly because they don't like the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, but they have not taken into account what they will stimulate in the Himalayas after a distorted report. The response, they did not expect.</p>
<p>In fact, people in the Himalayas have not been as close to Tibetan Buddhism in the past. They did not know what religious believers they were, whether they were Hindu or Tibetan Buddhism. As the Tibetans exiled in India for longer and longer, gradually, Rinpoche has increased more temples and monks. After Cheng, there were more monks who returned from the temple from the temple to his hometown. After decades, Tibetan Buddhism has achieved results in India. Some Indian decision makers are unwilling to see it, but they have no way. Since they say that people in these areas are Indians, they should give these people the same rights as all Indians.</p>
<p>This time, the stigma of the Dalai Lama, Indian politics will find that the side effects of the words from the perspective of political perspective are too great. This is not only the case for the Indian government, but also the same to the Chinese government. What happened now? The Himalayan area and the Tibetan community in exile have been unified in a sense, and they believe in the Dalai Lama very much. The Dalai Lama has indeed become a Buddha.If you look at the Dalai Lama as a person, if the Dalai Lama is indeed a problem, it will not be God or Bodhisattva. But the Dalai Lama has no problem, no mistakes or even no crime, so this stigma of him is unacceptable!The Tibetans need not say. People in the Himalayas are also unacceptable. Why do you attacked me? Why do you abuse my religion? This will inevitably arouse a strong anti -effect.</p>
<p>Whether it is some Indian politicians, some media people, or many people in China, they really do not understand the power of faith, and they do not understand the psychology of faith. These people now make a person they should not mess with. If this person does something wrong, then his divinity will disappear. But this person did not do wrong at all, then his divinity would double. We can see: If any country, if you want to eliminate a religion, you will give him freedom and he will slowly weaken, but if you oppress religion, especially in a society like India If you do it, religion will be stronger. Today, a Western scholar and I talked about this incident and these topics. He said, "This is a gift from God to you." He believes in God, so he said that. Of course, Tibetans are very painful and believers are very painful. We saw that Tibetans and believers publicly expressed this pain. We have also seen that the Dalai Lama is not human now, but God. Hand Thousand Eyes Guanyin Bodhisattva)!</p>
<p>Hahaha. So the biggest problem is here. Politicians consider this today and consider that one tomorrow. Today, it slipped to the side tomorrow, and the news was also a hot spot and was quickly covered by another hot spot. But Tibetans and people in the Himalayas have been talking about and will not end.</p>
<p>From the perspective of political science, those politicians are unwilling to treat a person as God. But now many people's minds are the Dalai Lama as a martyr, He Becomes AMartyr (he becomes a martyr)!He had nothing wrong, but he was oppressed by many forces. But they were unwilling to see someone like him as martyrs and gods. Especially those who treat him as an enemy are even more unwilling. Because the Dalai Lama becomes a martyr, it will be an eternal existence. From the perspective of political science, those people have failed and 100 % failed. Just as Jesuswas First Martyr (Jesus is the first martyr), the same is true of the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Me: You said so well!I feel like this too. That's it. Garva Rinpoche was originally the Guanyin Bodhisattva in our minds. The Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhists regard the His Holiness as the Guanyin Bodhisattva, and at other others, they think of the His Holiness as a person, and he is an old man. In this incident, some people say that the elderly dementia and the elderly are the elderly. Degenerate and so on, and so on, take it for granted. You are so right that after being stigmatized and demonized, Jiawa Rinpoche has become a martyr like Jesus. Jesus suffered, Jesus was crucified, martyrdom, this image was extremely deep and inextricable. Garva Rinpoche has become a bodhisattva that saves sentient beings in this world in the way of being hurt by the world. Now the stains of these people perfectly perfect the image of the Guanyin Bodhisattva of the His Holiness. (Serial)</p>

<p>Because the long -term disputes with the train operator and the government in terms of salary and other aspects failed to resolve, the British Railway Driver Union held a new round of strike on Wednesday (May 31).</p>
<p>The strike will affect 16 railway companies. In addition to May 31, the British Train Union will also hold a strike on June 3. During the strike, only about 40%of the train will run, and some areas are completely shut down. In addition, the British railway, maritime and transport workers' national alliances will be held on June 2. During the strike, about 50%of the railway lines will be closed.</p>
<p>British media analysis believes that the high inflation rate is one of the important reasons for this round of strike. In this way, employees protest the rising cost of living, especially in the field of public services, and wages are far from catching up with high inflation. At the same time, the government's economic and social policies have not been continuously implemented. A few months ago, the staff of the British railway system had held large -scale strikes, with nearly four -fifths of railway services stopped, and railway services in most regions of Scotland and Wales were paralyzed.</p>
<p>Britain is in the summer semester this week, and strikes will have a serious impact on people who travel. In addition, on the June 3rd, the FA Cup finals, the English Yearseid Race Competition and other events will be held, and strikes will have a serious impact on the travel of people watching people.</p>
<p>Mick Huilan, Secretary -General of the British Railway Driver Trade Union, said that the development of the railway system is related to the future of the country. Railway staff does not want to bring inconvenience to passengers because of strike. Strikes and other actions.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) According to the official website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the director of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with JenSplötner, German Prime Minister Foreign Affairs Consultant in Beijing. The press release quoted Wang Yi as a comprehensive strategic partner, China and Germany must not only stabilize the development of bilateral relations, but also contribute to jointly responding to global challenges.</p>
<p>Wang Yi emphasized that China will comprehensively promote Chinese -style modernization, adhere to high -quality development, open to the outside world, and share opportunities and win -win cooperation with countries. He said that in the face of the current instability of the international situation and increasing uncertain factors, China and Germany must work together to organize the seventh round of consultation between the Sino -German government and send positive signals to Europe and the world.</p>
<p>The press release stated that Pulutner said that he was full of expectations for the new round of Germany and Chinese government consultations, and will jointly step up various preparations. He also said that the foundation of Germany and China is stable, and the German side will continue to adhere to a Chinese policy and point out that the world's polarization is an inevitable trend. Together with the challenges of turbulent uncertainty.</p>
<p>The two sides also exchanged views on issues of common concern in Ukraine. Pulutner also held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing.</p>

<h3>Isn't it news?</h3>
<p>The news of the German Chancellor Foreign Consultant's visit to China is a small foreign news in China. The important Chinese official media such as Xinhua News Agency and "People's Daily" all reported on the form of the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs's drafts.</p>
<p>In contrast, Putener's trip to China has not received the attention of German media at all. By the time of the draft, the information did not appear in the media reports, and the German government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were not mentioned during the official release of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Inquiring about the Voice of Germany, the German Prime Minister's House replied that "in principle," in principle, he did not make a statement on the working -level talks. "</p>
<p>The main task of Pulutner's trip is to prepare for the German -Chinese government consultation in Berlin this month. In the context of Germany and China relations, the German government's expectations of the consultation mechanism for this 2011 to start in 2011 are relatively low -key. In June last year, Putener and Wang Yi's predecessor Yang Jiechi held a video call, and German officials did not post any information.</p>
<p>As a consultant to diplomatic and security policy of German Prime Minister Shulz, although Putena was one of the "Schildez's most important consultants" by the German media, this position is a "behind -the -scenes" role in German politics. Publicly expressed opinions. Pulutner often visited Sharz, including Lightning visit China last November, but in news photos, he generally only appeared in the back row of Shulz.</p>
<h3>The first visit to China during his tenure in Germany</h3>
<p>The last time Pulutner became the target of the German media, or last June. At a seminar organized by the German Foreign Policy Association (DGAP), his speech was considered to be too friendly to Russia by some critics, which caused some controversy. At the same event, Putener also mentioned China that China and Russia should not be classified as the same type, but at the same time, they should be alert to the role of China and Russia actively playing the spokesperson of the southern south. "They are not such spokespersons." Essence</p>

The school resolutely denies that the school sent teachers to go to the river to pick up the cobbled campus, saying that the teacher went to the river to be a personal behavior. I don't want to rule out the possibility of the school's true possibility, but why is it so local to prevent interviews with reporters? What are they afraid of? Woolen cloth?"</p>
<p>But there are also voices that maybe reporters' behavior is improper first.</p>
<p>Weibo user "Yuanyue Pelicans" said: "Will reporters first provoke the local person to maintain order to obtain eyeball manufacturing news? Hu Xijin still likes to play black and white!"</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The German Federal Statistics Bureau, located in Wesbarden, reported that in 2022, a total of 1,68,545 applicants from 171 different nationalities obtained German citizenship, a record high. This increased by 28%over the previous year.</p>
<p>Among the people who joined German nationality in 2022, 29%came from Syria, with an average age of 24.8 years and two -thirds of men. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2014, many people left their hometown and then found a new home in Germany. Before citizenship, they stayed for 6.4 years in Germany.</p>
<p>Among the citizers last year, the Syrian topped the list, followed by Ukraine, Iraqi and Turks.</p>
<p>"Syrians who have obtained German passports almost only six years. That's because they can show excellent integration." Janschneider, an independent research expert of integration and immigration expert committee, told Germany.</p>
<p>"In fact, we can expect the number of people this year to increase further." Schneider said, because the Social Democratic Party said(SPD), Green Party and Liberal Party(FDP)The middle left -wing ruling alliance formed has formulated a comprehensive plan to change and simplify the nationality law.</p>
<h3><strong> The threshold for naturalization in Germany is still very high </strong></h3>
<p>At present, naturalization Germany requires language skills(B1)The stable income must be lived in Germany for at least eight years.</p>
<p>Those who want to be a German citizen not only need to pay a fee of 255 euros, but also need to submit identity documents and pass the German citizenship test-including 33 German customs, society and legal issues. In addition, applicants must declare their support for democracy and German Constitution (Basic Law).</p>
<p>Anyone who has no chance to apply for citizenship with criminal criminal criminals, and it is not possible for applicants who have no income or savings or relying on the support of the state.</p>
<p>However, there is a shortage of labor in the German economy, from IT experts and medical staff to food waiters. Experts in the labor market estimate that Germany will need 400,000 immigrants each year to narrow the expanding talent gap. At present, the government's technical immigration plan only attracts 60,000 people each year.</p>
<p>The German government believes that the fundamental change of nationality law may inspire more people to go to Germany and allow people who have lived here to better integrate into society.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T11-03-00Z/64027858_401.jpg" />The reform of nationality law will bring great changes</p>
<h3><strong> Three main changes in the reform plan of the Nationality Law </strong></h3>
<p>The national law reform proposed by NANCY FAESER NANCY FAESER will make dual nationality and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国将大幅简化和加快外国人入籍程序/a-65676241">the citizenship of non -EU citizens is easier</a>There are three main changes:</p>
<p>The time for applicants for citizenships in Germany has changed from eight years to five years. If the applicant can show a special integration, this will be shortened to only three years.</p>
<p>At least one of the parents has lived in Germany for five years or more, and children born in Germany will automatically obtain German citizenship.</p>
<p>Multi -nationality is allowed. So far, only those who meet the following conditions can usually retain their original passports when obtaining a German passport: the EU and Swiss citizens, from those countries that are not allowed to abandon citizenship, such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Morocco; and in their own country Refugees who are threatened by persecution; Israelis can usually be allowed to have dual nationality.</p>
<p>Schneider believes that for some of the 1.3 million Turkish people living in Germany, "dual passports are likely to be a incentive measure for naturalization."</p>
<h3>What are you going to change in the reform of the German Nationality Law?</h3>
<h3><strong> Voice of the Reform of Nationality Law </strong></h3>
<p>The number of new citizenship records has sparked another protest storm of critics, especially from the largest opposition groups, China Right -Wing CDU and the Kyoto League(CDU/CSU)Essence The parliamentary group spokesman Thorstenfrei told the World News: "The Minister of the Interior Fisher's plan increases risks and allows more people who have not fully fused." Requirements for obtaining German passports.</p>
<p>Schneid said that although today's unable to predict whether the Federal Parliament will approve the government's reform bill, it can be expected that "the citizenship application will increase significantly." He said, "The case of many citizenship office has accumulated a lot of citizenship application materials."</p>
<p>At present, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧洲各国的入籍门槛高低不同/a-63976043">about 6 million foreign citizens have lived in Germany for more than 8 years. </a>Immigration expert Schneider pointed out that if the shortest residence period of the citizenship requirements is changed to five years, most of them will meet the conditions of citizenship.</p>

Some people in the Republic of China on the mainland told this station that the move violated the Constitution of the Republic of China. So, can mainlanders enjoy the same rights in Taiwan?</p>
<p>[<strong> Taiwan Executive Yuan: "The people of the mainland are also the people of the Republic of China."(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-05262023110227.html)</strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/10-05252023162022.html">Taiwan Executive Yuan Order: Mainlanders do not have the nationality of the Republic of China</a></em>*</p>
<p>In August 2018, a mainlander's Kaohsiung riding a bicycle around the island was killed by electric shock because of street lights, and his family requested a "national compensation". The first trial of the Taiwan court quoted the letter of the Ministry of Justice in Taiwan in 1993, "The people of the mainland are also the people of the Republic of China", and the "Regulations on the People's Relations of Taiwan and the Mainland"(Referred to as the "Cross -Strait Regulations")和《国家赔偿法》相关无禁止大陆地区人民请求国家赔偿之规定，裁定向遇难者家属赔偿新台币463万元。</p>
<p>然而，台湾的行政院近期通令各部会，依《国籍法》之定义，中国大陆人民不具中华民国国籍、非属中华民国国民，自不享有或负担中华民国国民之权利义务。凡旧函释与此抵触者，应自即日起停止适用或不再援用。</p>
<p><strong>大陆人是否为中华民国国民？学者：户籍所在为依据</strong></p>
<p>台湾东吴大学法律学系教授暨公法中心主任胡博砚对本台表示，《两岸条例》第2条规定，关于大陆地区居民的定义并没有牵涉到国籍，只有户籍的问题。该法规范是基于宪法增修条文的授权，以此特别规定做解释，这是行政院的逻辑脉络。</p>
<p>“《入出国及移民法》不只有‘国人’与‘外国人’分法，把台湾人、外国人、大陆地区居民、港澳地区居民以及无国籍人士，各种状况都纳入。行政院函文把不同的状况都写得清楚，以后发生争议的可能性不大。”胡博砚补充说明。</p>
<p>国立政治大学法律学系副教授廖元豪告诉本台，此判决“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”，就算是行政院函释也不敢违背法律，称“大陆人是外国人”，而是强调“大陆人不是中华民国国民”。但是大陆人有“两岸条例”规定，本来就不是以“国民”处理。</p>
<p>廖元豪进一步解释，核心的公民概念是“国籍加户籍”，有一种是“无户籍国民”，大陆以及港澳人士即属此类，《两岸条例》把中、港、澳居民与一般无户籍国民区分：“目前的法律是用户籍来区分。大陆人民户籍登记在大陆，台湾地区人民就是户籍登记在台湾。两个户籍只能选一个，如果台湾人跑去大陆登记户籍，台湾就会予以注销，就称为‘大陆人民’。”</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T11-11-00-04-00/000001.png" />The National ID card of the Republic of China is one of the conditions for Taiwan to certify the nationality of the Republic of China (screenshot of Wikipedia)</p>
<p><strong> Is the interpretation of the Government Court's letter of interpretation as a legal Taiwan independence? </strong></p>
<p>According to the Chinese State Council spokesman Zhu Fenglian, on the 31st, he said in response to the relevant response, "The mainland and Taiwan belong to the same China, and the compatriots on both sides of the strait are Chinese. No matter how the" Taiwan independence "split forces are renovated and unscrupulous, Taiwan cannot change Taiwan. fact".</p>
<p>Hu Boyi explained to the legal level that in the Constitution of the Republic of China, the identification of nationality has not been determined. At present, the legislation is only limited to the "Taiwan region of the Republic of China". The use of legal interpretations has not directly involved constitutional issues. It may be that the legal Taiwan independence may still have a distance for Taiwanese people. "</p>
<p>Liao Yuanhao pointed out that all laws in Taiwan looked at the "mainlanders" separately. Even "nationals" did not have the rights and obligations of the people. Because they were not set in Taiwan, they were given different treatment. mainlander."</p>
<p>Liao Yuanhao: "There are two meanings of the Government Institute. One is purely political declaration. Mainlanders are not nationals, both sides of the strait are not relatives; secondly, the election is coming soon. How can it be said that it is not 'national'. But the interpretation of the court's letters has no effect on reality, cases or all rights and obligations, so the Kuomintang did not respond fiercely. "</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>"I think Taiwan's approach is wrong. It violates the Constitution of the Republic of China. Because the Republic of China belongs to the mainland regardless of history and region." Wei Yanling from Zhejiang said in an interview with this station that Taiwan was just because of 1949 because of 1949 The Civil War of the KMT failed, and the government moved to Taiwan. Taiwan was only a temporary base of the Republic of China government.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked, whether he was looking forward to the one -day issue of the Republic of China in the future, Wei Huiling said, "I look forward to it, I think this is very likely. Because as long as we change in mainland China, mainland China will definitely return to a return to one Democratic China must be the Republic of China. No country can replace it. "</p>
<p>He said that he would not feel lost about the announcement of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, but this is definitely a wrong way. If "Mr. Jiang" is still alive, he will definitely not support it.</p>
<p>Hu Boyi said that he can understand that the so -called "Republic of China" people are unacceptable emotionally, but the Constitution is not determined to "inherent territory". If in the past explanation, I am afraid that even some people in Russia and some people in Russia may become China. People in mainland China.</p>

However, the methods of the tankers tracked by the Times not only did this. They used cutting -edge positioning deception technology to make them look in one place, but they were actually elsewhere.</p>
<p>These three tankers pretended to sail west in west of Japan in at least 13 voyages. But in fact, they are transporting oil to China in the dock of Russia.</p>
<p>These tankers are part of the so -called "Dark Fleet". The word is not strictly defined. It refers to various types of ships that blur their positions or identification logos to avoid the supervision of government and business partners. They usually participate in petroleum from Venezuela or Iran, and these two countries have also been hit by international sanctions. The recent surge in the number of "Dark Fleets" appeared in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and West tried to limit Moscow's oil income by sanctions.</p>
<p>"We are seeing this kind of deception is unusual and complicated and clever," said David Tannan Bam, who had served as a sanctions and compliance officials in the U.S. Treasury, said that he refers to the tankers confirmed by the Times. "From all aspects, this is definitely an act of avoiding sanctions."</p>
<p>So far, few people can prove the real location of the ships pretending to be in other places. However, the analysis of Shipping data, satellite images, and video fragments on social media from publicly obtained the Times help clearly determine that these oil tankers are not in their claims.</p>
<p>These tankers are likely to sell Russian oil to China to China at the upper limit of the price higher than the sanctions. Because China and Russia do not accept these sanctions, these oil tankers do not have violations of regulations due to positioning deception or carrying oil.</p>
<p>However, these oil tankers still have the motivation to deceive: they need insurance companies to underwrite for them. Without insurance, they cannot receive business in most major ports. The only insurance companies with economic capabilities are mostly in the West, so they are constrained by sanctions. If the oil tanker underwritten by the insurance company is Russian oil with higher prices than the upper limit of sanctions, Western insurance companies will violate the sanctions regulations, so the policy must be terminated.</p>
<p>"Judging from the amount involved, this is a big problem," Samil Madani said. He is the co -founder of Tankertrackers.com, who tracks global shipping, and is the earliest person to let the Times notice the suspicious tankers. "Oil worth about $ 1 billion used Western insurance, but did not attract attention. In order to continue to obtain the Western policy, they were using deception."</p>
<p>In addition to the three oil tankers transported oil, the Times reporter also discovered three other ships to locate and deceive. Their actual location is outside the Russian coast, but it is not clear what they are loaded.</p>
<p>All six oil tankers are underwritten by the US Insurance Corporation, the US Insurance Association. The Times provides the company's titles of these tankers, and the actual voyage details when they are positioned and deceived.</p>
<p>Daniel Tedoros, chief operating officer of the US Casino Association, wrote in an email responding to the Times that due to the requirements of law and privacy, he could not comment on any potential investigation. "If there is a violation of sanctions, the insurance will fail," he said.</p>
<p>In order to protect the insurance company and let it be exempted from the time that the ships that violated the sanctions inadvertently, the United States also formulated the so -called <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/929506/download?inline">Security Port Questions</a>Essence US Casserture Association <a href="https://www.american-club.com/">Website</a>The list of regularly updated customers show that until May 30, the company is likely to still underwrite the six tankers.</p>
<p>Since the Times provided the company with evidence of deception, the information on its official website has changed at least one change. The company's website has shown that the insurance provided for the "Khitan Phoenix" will expire in February 2024, but the expiration date has suddenly been recently advanced to June 2023. The U.S. Casino Association is unwilling to comment on the reasons for the change.</p>
<p>The 13 voyages of the three known oil tankers who were known to transport crude oil began in the Port of Koshino in Russia, although they pretended to be near the Japanese coast. Satellite and social media images and customs data show that these oil -loading docks are crude oil -specific docks of the Eastern Siberia -Pacific Petroleum Pipeline System (ESPO). They removed these crude oil in China.</p>
<p>A sanctions on Russia began in December last year, and it was only crude oil at first, and later it included fuel oil and other products. Specifically, the price of crude oil must not exceed $ 60 per barrel to limit Russia's income from oil sales.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The price of crude oil transported by these tankers is not public, but according to the analysis of customs and export data, the average price of ESPO crude oil is about $ 73 per barrel, which has been much higher than the upper limit. This shows that the price of oil transported by the tanker is higher than the price limit. This behavior alone may cause the US Casino Association to violate sanctions, but security port clauses make this insurance company unlikely to be punished.</p>
<p>Although the total number of oil tankers in violation of the price limit is unclear, U.S. officials have insisted that sanctions have played a role. "The upper limit of the price is achieving its dual purpose: while restricting Russian oil income, Russia's oil will continue to enter the market to maintain market stable and sufficient supply," the US Treasury spokesman told the Times. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/business/economy/g7-biden-oil-price-cap-russia.html">Some analysts think</a>There is a problem with the price data cited by the US government, and the upper limit is not as effective as it looks.</p>
<p>In order to perform positioning and deception, the tanker can use military -grade equipment or software currently available from the market. This technology makes it possible to manipulate the location of the ship. The report is broadcast through the automatic recognition system (referred to as AIS) installed on the ship with a specific radio frequency broadcast to convey the ship identification number, location and routes to other ships, ground stations and satellites.</p>
<p>Although the positioning and deception technology is very complicated and clever, it will be traced when the ship uses it. Among them, strange geometric figures include the AIS data of the ship. Experts believe that this may sometimes may be positioned to deceive software attempts to imitate a shipbuilding ship.A more severe warning was issued in April this year. Ofac <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/931641/download?inline">Warning</a>It is said that the positioning of the positioning around Koshino is likely to be related to Russia's evasion of sanctions. The office suggested that American companies, including insurance companies, use "maritime intelligence services" to find suspicious activities.</p>

<p>Maritime compliance experts said that it may be difficult to find positioning deception in a large number of ships, but the warnings of OFAC are very specific, which reduces the scope that insurance companies should pay attention to. "Now they have reason to know that this behavior has happened. If they do not take action, they will risk unsatisfactory risks," Tannan Bam said.</p>
<p>The executive of the US Casino Association, Tadros, was unwilling to disclose the specific tools used by the company to try to identify the deception behavior, but he said that the company relies on "a powerful system and control framework, including tracking services."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The Times found that the warning signal also exists in the data provided by the ship tracking website. A navigation of the "Khitan Phoenix" shows several obvious abnormal phenomena, revealing that the tanker is being positioned and deceived.</p>
<p>In addition to tracking AIS abnormalities, OFAC also suggested that insurance companies investigate the company's history of ships in high -risk areas to discover the act of evading sanctions. The agency warns that shipowners may try to avoid review by using "complex business structures", including "the practice involving shell companies."</p>
<p>Tannan Bum said that the good time for insurance companies to find a warning signal is to issue policies or renewal periods for the tanker.</p>
<p>"These are common and standard practices, and what should be done by‘ understanding customers ’," he said. "This is a chance to see if this is a bad apple in advance."</p>
<p>According to the information on the website of the US Casino Association, the policy of the six tankers was continued in February this year. Previously, three of the tankers had been located and deceived when they were transporting Russian oil.</p>
<p>Experts say the characteristics of these ships should be questioned. Most of them were owned by empty shell companies less than three years ago, and several of them were established after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. These companies are run by Chinese people, registered in Hong Kong, and only have an old ship I bought recently.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"Although these factors themselves are not necessarily a problem -and it is quite common -but add them together, they describe a type of ships and companies worth further investigating," Washington analyzed the analyst of the global security threats of non -profit organization C4ADS, Cai Yizhao (Sound) Say. She also said that if these tankers are also being proclaimed, they "meet the common activity model of evasion of maritime sanctions."</p>
<p>The Times reporter visited the Hong Kong address given by the shipowner of these oil tankers and found that only the person in the office was the common feature of the empty shell company. Four of them did not reply to the letter from the request sent by the Times to the Times.</p>
<p>Another oil tanker "Ginza" in Russia(Ginza)The spokesman of the shipowner told the Times through an email that the ship was carried by vegetable oil. The company did not know that the AIS signal of the tanker had a positioning and deception. The spokesman also said that the company lacked technical knowledge of identifying deception.</p>
<p>These use of positioning and deceiving oil tankers in the United States show that this approach is not limited to Russian oil. The Times found that five of the six tankers were pretended to be elsewhere when they visited Iran or Venezuela, or when the ships obtained from these countries were transferred from the ships at sea, pretending to be in other places. At least two ("Khitan Phoenix" and "Eternalpeace]) have crude oil, which may violate sanctions on Iran or Venezuela.</p>
<p>The Ginza also falsified his whereabouts last fall, pretending to be near the Oman coast. The Times found the real location of the ship from a video of a crew on Instagram: the tanker was near the port of Iran. Satellite images also show that it stops at a berth of loading petrochemical products. The spokesman of the shipowner said that the company did not know about this behavior.</p>
<p>The US Treasury spokesman told the Times that as far as Russian crude oil is concerned, if an American entity learns that it is underwriting for the upper limit of the price, it must cancel the insurance policy.</p>
<p>According to the [One Report] published by the Labor News Agency Daily(https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1144635/Dark-fleets-biggest-shipowner-Gatik-Ship-Management-loses-Western-insurance-cover)Earlier this year, the website of the US Casino Association showed that the company no longer underwritten at least 15 ships owned by a Indian company. It is reported that the Gatik Ship Management Company has a fleet of 50 newly purchased oil tankers to engage in Russian oil trade. The US Casino Association refused to explain to the Times to explain the reason for this decision.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-01T11-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />The International Atom Energy Agency (IAEA) is expected to meet a few days later to review the progress of the rest of the concerns.</p>
<p>IAEA stated in its quarterly report that it is estimated that Iran's concentrated uranium inventory has reached more than 23 times the upper limit of the 2015 nuclear agreement.</p>
<p>As of May 13, Iran's concentrated uranium inventory is estimated to be as high as 4744.5 kg.</p>
<p>The upper limit specified in the 2015 nuclear agreement is 202.8 kg.</p>
<p>The report also said that the nuclear agreement restricted Iranian concentrated uranium purity of up to 3.67%, but Iran continued to exceed restrictions.</p>
<p>The Iran Nuclear Agreement was fragmented due to unilateral exit in the United States in 2018. The efforts to restore the agreement have been stagnating since last summer.</p>
<p>It is believed that the uranium inventory with a concentratedness of 20%of Tehran was 470.9 kg, an increase of 36.2 kg from the last (February) report; the amount of uranium inventory of 60%of the purity was 114.1 kg, an increase of 26.6 kg from the previous.</p>
<p>The concentrated uranium concentration of nuclear weapons needs to be 90%.</p>

<p>"At 6 o'clock in the morning on June 4th, with the students withdraw from the students, passing through the Xi Chang'an Street and the sixth port. The gate of Zhongnanhai and near Xinhua Gate, the three martial arts tanks chase the student team from behind high -speed. One person died, more injured, and five of them were sent to the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, the remains of the students who were in office. At about 10 am that day, when they entered the school gate, I saw five deadly dead desks on the teaching building. The remains of the body, the blood on the desk and the ground are all bloody blood. I and the young teacher Liu Suli, who are young teachers in Tiananmen Square, kneeling in front of the five remains crying, and never forgotten.

The book is because of the massacre.</p>
<p>Wu Renhua said: "I spent countless times, cracked the number and code of various troops, and collected relevant officers and soldiers to chat records. They found that the number of martial arts troops was 250,000, and nineteen troops, including 14 Army Group Army, very amazing scale."</p>

<p>Wu Renhua believes that the truth must be complete, and they need to trace the harm. In response to the 490,000 officers and soldiers, he verified more than 3,000 members of the Beijing Martial Arts forces through the Internet and Google. The first regiment of the first regiment of the Tianjin Police Zone Tank No. 106 Tank Tank Tanks, the first regiment of the student.</p>
<p>Wu Renhua said: "Finally verified, very exactly, at the time I cried in front of the computer.</p>
<p>I have read so many bloody scenes in ancient books. Many people include losing their legs in the six mouths, Fang Zheng, student of the School of Sports, and the mother of Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin repeatedly that they must find members of the No. 106 tank. Why do you rush into the student team from behind? Is the driver acted without authorization or the chief command? I know the record in the book. Luo Gang and the deputy head of the first division of Tianjin and Jia Zhenlu, the deputy head of the first division, I can't forget their names. I announced the number of Wu Yanhui on Twitter, did it be the second hand No. 2 of the tank No. 2, No. 106, the first and first battalions of the first division of the first division?

<p>In the thirty -four years of 1964, why did some people in China about the troops that happened in Tiananmen Square "no memory" or "dare not remember"?</p>
<p>An important leader of the 1989 Democratic Games became one of the 21 official wanted criminals after June 4th. Zheng Xuguang, who served two years in prison, described it deeply on the show.</p>
<p>He mentioned that after the June 4th massacre, each unit fully inspected, and most of the cities survived within the system. They served as administrative, enterprises, and institutions. Everyone must explain that after the death of Hu Yaobang in 1989, what does it have to do with this movement: "Have you been on the street? Do you know what other people are? What are you? What do you do before martial law? Do it? What do you do after shooting in June 4th? "</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang said that the authorities were distinguished in three stages, such as June 4th and the streets after the streets and martial law. During the mourning period, it may be treated on the streets, and the crime of fighting against martial law is one equal. It is another situation to resist that after the clearance. Many unit leaders are unwilling to let everyone suffer, and it will make you just say that you don't talk about others.<strong> Forced to the official statement </strong> <strong><em>* </em>* Kind person who has gone to exempt from "flat chaos" accomplice </strong></p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang said: "I believe many people say they don't remember, have not seen it, they have passed, even if they are liberated or passing the level. If there are no other people's proof, you may say that you have not participated in this circumstances. You are afraid of others to report you. "</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang mentioned that more importantly, the oppositional turmoil and calming riots against the party and the government must be expressed. I believe that in such an environment, there are very few oppositions. Because there is no public office, there is no public office, and the salary is not available. Most people expressed their resolute support.</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang said: "The result of support is that 'thugs hit and killed the PLA are a kind of turmoil. Most of the participants are unknown truth and are used by a few bad guys. The bad guys need to be severely punished'. To say, you have to repeat day after day, year after year. Sometimes you have to be investigated. Is it like the three types of people, rebels, and smashing elements like the Cultural Revolution? Do you participate in the turmoil of the Bayi or nine? What attitude is it? This is what you are transferred and promoted in the system, and all kinds of things are related. "</p>
<p><strong> The official through collective fear </strong> <strong><em>* </em>* reconstructs historical narrative </strong></p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang said: "China has a strong culture of shame. It is difficult to say that I was because of cowardice. I said losing their minds for various reasons. It is indeed used by bad people; even very radical students finally claimed to be innocent, and the party was right. Even in recent years, the Chinese economic development has been very accurate. People are chaotic. As a whole narrative, the official narrative is relatively rigid; there is another mainstream narrative of the people in the people. Under the pressure at that time, it was forced to deny itself and deny its companion. Finally, it completed a conversion to a conversion. . I can say that if it was a national protest movement in 1989, a national rebellion movement was experienced after 1989. "</p>
<p>Wu Renhua also mentioned that there were middle school students who turned over the wall to read his book. After understanding the truth, he asked his mother, and his mother lied that it was nothing. Students asked their mother, not studying at university in Beijing in 1989, how could they not know anything? The mother was forced to admit. Under the autocratic system, the truth will have great political consequences.</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang also said that June 4th was a very painful and embarrassing memory. After the 1986th generation, many would rather not mention it. Not only is it painful, it is embarrassing to answer your child. Do you support or oppose? So don't say it is good. This is always a mental trauma that needs to be cured. As for the generation of birth after 1989, there are diverse channels, and there are networks to turn over the wall.</p>
<p><strong> The CCP conducts a June 4th cognitive operation at home and abroad through foreign propaganda </strong> ****</p>
<p>However, Wu Renhua mentioned that the Communist Party of China has used a lot of resources to launch a large -scale publicity and overseas social media for the history of June 4th. Many young friends thank him for digging the truth.</p>
<p>When it comes to the recent popular ChatGPT network chat robot, Zheng Xuguang said that he tried to ask with traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese, but he got different results. Asked in Simplified Chinese, all the Chinese officials said to the June 4th.</p>
<p>Zheng Xuguang mentioned that Deng Xiaoping used the "storm" when he met the commander of the martial force, deliberately avoided the words of counter -revolutionary riots in Beijing when he cleared the field. In addition, the official attitude can be seen from the leadership of the leadership. When Yang Shangkun died, he tried to fade as much as possible. Li Peng's prosecution returned to the reappearance of "riots" in the 896th qualitative "riot".</p>
<p><strong> Scholars call for the establishment of the "June 4th Studies" </strong> <strong> jointly tap the historical truth to fight forgotten. </strong></p>
<p>In response to the question of whether there is any hope for the 89th Democratic Games, Zheng Xuguang believes that the senior executives of the Communist Party of China who were responsible for that year have passed away, and the martial law troops are old. Until death.</p>
<p>Wu Renhua believes that China can only face June 4th only when the political system changes have occurred. In the first year of the so -called June Fourth Pingzhong Storm in 1999, the Central Military Commission of the PLA had plans to celebrate and recognize it, and was rejected by the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. Chinese officials are very clear that it is not worthy of publicity.</p>
<p>Wu Renhua said that the June 4th Movement was more important than the May 4th Movement, but there was a lack of "June 4th Studies" at home and abroad. The truth of June 4th has no conclusions. I hope that more schools and teachers and students will invest in the "June 4th Studies" research.</p>

<p>Description: After a few weeks of fierce confrontation, the US President Biden and the Republican Parliament Speaker McCarthy finally reached an agreement on the upper limit of US debt last weekend. The House of Representatives passed the debt limit bill to avoid breach of contract on Wednesday evening with a voting result of 314-117. China has been one of the largest debt countries in the United States for many years. Once the US debt is default, it will undoubtedly affect China's interests, but China is also the largest strategic competitor in the United States. Political observers warn that China's long -term geopolitical interests may benefit from the dramatic confrontation that the United States has increased debt limit for several months.</p>

In addition, the container transportation index, air transport index, and electronic component index continue to show weakness, all lower than the trend level. The report believes that the positive and negative indicators are half, which increases the difficulty of predicting short -term trade prospects.</p>

They beat the front door. They walked to the backyard and looked in through the glass door. In the end, they posted a piece of paper and left to a former Chinese government official and his wife hiding inside.</p>
<p>The paper reads: "If you are willing to return to the mainland for ten years, your wife and children are fine."</p>
<p>These people are Chinese agents or unknown pawns, and have become the core issue of a milestone case in the Brooklyn Federal Court on Wednesday. This is the first trial related to the "Fox Hunting Action" in China. The country's authoritarian government claims that this is a global action against fugitives. See.</p>
<p>The three defendants were Michael Mcma Hong in New Jersey, a retired New York Police Police Officer, and later became a private detective; Zhu Yong (Yin) from Queens, also known as Jason Zhu; and Zheng's Zheng Smart (sound). The government said that Zheng Congying was one of the faithfuls and provided addresses by Zhu Yong and McMahong.</p>
<p>Everyone is accused of serving as an illegal agent in China, tracking and conspiracy of cross -state. They will face a maximum 10 -year imprisonment.</p>
<p>Ovilles Shel, director of the US -China Relations Center of the Asian Association, said that the lawsuit is expected to last two to three weeks, and people will see China's means of controlling overseas remarks through litigation.</p>
<p>"This is not just a trial of a few people," he said. "We can take the opportunity to understand how this control system in Beijing operates."</p>
<p>Case <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20201029/china-harassment-fugitives/">announced</a>Later, the Federal Investigation Bureau director Christopher Lei said it was "China's persistent and extensive illegal acts" and "our attitude that we refused to tolerate".</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the trial was aimed at Xu Jin, former official of New Jersey. Assistant Federal Prosecutor Elisa Chen said in a statement that Xu was in the CCP in about 2008 and moved to the United States about two years later. She said that China tried to let him return, and he repeatedly refused, so in 2016, the Chinese government tried to use illegal means to find him.</p>
<p>The indictment stated that Zhu Yong hired McMamon to find his residence for this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-01T11-52-49-08-00/31china-investigator-01-lbcm-master1050.jpg" />On Wednesday, Zhu Yong (right) left the Brooklyn Federal District Court, and he was accused of hiring McMahon. Jefferson Siegel for the New York Times</p>
<p>McMamon's lawyer Lawrence Lerstberg said in a statement that his client was a "hero police" who was awarded, and he did not know that he had been working for China. Mcma Hong argued that he was hired and was told that the person had misappropriated millions of dollars from a Chinese construction company. Lestberg said that McMahon retained detailed records and notified the local police when monitoring in New Jersey.</p>
<p>"If he secretly acts on behalf of the Chinese government, will he contact the police and tell them?" Lestberg asked.</p>

<p>Zheng Congying's lawyer Paul Goldberg said that his client never saw him before he was sued. Kuang Zebin, a man who drove to New Jersey in 2018, pleaded guilty last year and was expected to testify in court. Goldberg argued that Zheng Congyue quickly realized that he was involved in a mistake and returned to remove the paper the next morning.</p>
<p>"His participation in this matter should be less than 24 hours," he said.</p>
<p>Zhu Yong's lawyer Kevin Dong said that his client met at a recruitment fair in Wuhan, China to ask him to help track a debtor in the United States. He said that because Zhu Yong couldn't speak English, he found a lawyer, and the lawyer hired McMahon.</p>
<p>"My client is also a victim," said Kevin Dong. "He was used."</p>
<p>The indictment described the action plan, that is, the Chinese government asked Xu Jin's 80 -year -old father to fly to the United States to persuade his son to come back -or at least reveal his address.</p>
<p>Xu Jin's wife and sister Liu Yan (Yin) On Wednesday, in April 2017, an unusual thing happened in her home in Shitshis, New Jersey. One night, she was walking the dog, and her teenage daughter called to say that Xu Jin's father was in their house. Xu Jin's father lived in Wuhan, and Liu Yan had only seen him three or four times.</p>

<p>Liu Yan said that the family knew that Xu Jin was wanted, but those things "he didn't do it." They suspected that his father's accident appeared part of the plan to find him. She arranged for Xu Jin to meet them in a shopping mall the next morning, not in his house.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said that Mcma Hong monitored their meeting and later received the address of Xu Jin.</p>
<p>"Because of McMaho, the Chinese government finally knew where the victim lived," Elisa Chen said.</p>

The graduates of students and long -term employment are dynamically cleared.</p>
<p>The "Action Plan" did not announce the number of graduates of 2023 college graduates in Henan Province, nor did it disclose data such as the number of zero employment families in the province and the number of long -term unlimited graduates. On January 4 this year, a news from Xinhuanet reported that Henan college graduates will reach 870,000 in 2023. Henan is the third -ranking province in China.

<h3>The raising of young people's unemployment rate soaring</h3>
<p>Although Chinese officials have said that the employment situation has gradually recovered and maintained overall stability since this year, but official data also shows that the unemployment rate of young people has continued to soar. On May 16, the national urban survey rate of urban surveys in April issued by the National Bureau of Statistics of China was 5.2%, but the unemployment rate of labor survey in the age of 16-24 was 20.4%, an increase of 0.8 percentage points over the previous month.

<h3>"Dynamic clearing zero" again?</h3>
<p>After the announcement of the employment of college graduates of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, the method of "zero -employed family graduates and long -term unable employment graduates dynamic zero" 's promises have attracted particular attention. In recent years, the "dynamic clearing zero" policy has almost become synonymous with the new crown epidemic prevention and control policy advocated by Chinese leaders Xi Jinping and the strict implementation of the Chinese government. At the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/京沪等地爆发街头抗议-上海示威者习近平下台/a-63905404">Chinese protests that broke out of young people as the main force and rare against dynamic zero policy</a>Essence In December 2022, Chinese officials canceled most of the relevant policies, and the "dynamic clearing zero" anti -epidemic prevention policy quietly withdrew.</p>

<h4>Under the struggle between the economic pressure and the people, China has abandoned the clearance policy</h4>
<h3>China announced the new ten articles</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of December 7, 2022, when many citizens were lining up as nuclear acids in the past, China officially announced the new ten of the prevention and control of the epidemic. In addition to not mentioning "insisting on dynamic dynamics and clearing zero", those with asymptomatic infections and light cases generally take home isolation, and no longer check the negative proof and health code of mobile nucleic acids across regions. China has bid farewell to the long -term persistence zero -clearing policy, and began to gradually implement the path of "group immunity" through relaxation of epidemic prevention measures through the infection of Omeko virus.</p>

<h4>Under the struggle between the economic pressure and the people, China has abandoned the clearance policy</h4>
<h3>Optimized epidemic prevention 20 can not be implemented</h3>
<p>On November 11, less than a month ago, China ’s“ Qing Lingzo Emperor ”and Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chunlan also emphasized at the meeting of the State Council’ s joint prevention and control mechanism that Article 20 of China ’s recently introduced epidemic prevention and control measures are not relaxing to relax. It is not "lying down". We must unswervingly implement the spirit of Xi Jinping's speech, and unswervingly adhere to the general policy of "dynamic clearance". Due to the so -called optimization of epidemic prevention and control, some of the contents of Article 20 and the total contradiction between the general principles of "dynamic clearing zero" are not reconciling, the problems of "layer" in "layer" during epidemic prevention still cannot be truly resolved.</p>

<h3>Urumqi fire caused the public to be more angry about clearing the zero policy</h3>
<p>On November 24, a fire broke out in Urumqi, which has been closed for more than 100 days in some residents who had been closed for more than 100 days. Strict epidemic prevention measures have led to the unable to escape from the people in the building, and the firefighters have not been able to get over obstacles for a long time. Officials said that the fire caused 10 people including children and the elderly. The incident eventually became the fuse of anti -clearing zero, anti -seal control, and anti -government protests. For a long time, the endless phenomenon of preventing epidemic prevention caused by the Qing Zero policy has aroused widespread dissatisfaction. For many people, more terrible than virus is isolation, discrimination, control, and some of the abuse of power.</p>

<h3>Official propaganda leads to the fear of the public, and the escape of workers</h3>
<p>Although the research on the new crown and the experience of overseas anti -epidemic has proven that Omeckon's strain, which dominated for more than a year, has a low pathogenic force, and the mortality rate has been lower than flu. Chinese officials still insist on getting better at the beginning of resistance. The "dynamic zero" general policy of the effect and Xi Jinping's personal decision -making is to show the superiority of the Chinese system and the correctness of the highest leaders' decision -making. To this end, Chinese officials still vigorously promote the harm of Omekor Rong, and refer to the control of the epidemic and control overseas as "lying flat". Due to the lack of real information, after more than 200,000 employees, Zhengzhou Foxconn had an epidemic, and tens of thousands of workers escaped from the factory to return to their hometowns to prevent infection and dissatisfaction. The factory production faced a huge crisis and the iPhone reduced production. Later, the employees who were recruited were suppressed by the authorities due to the riot of treatment.</p>

<h3>"Dabai" power is small</h3>
<p>In the early days of Chinese anti -epidemic, medical staff in white conjoined protective clothing were called "the most beautiful retrograde". With the implementation of local organizations and police officers, and the police also put on such protective clothing for nucleic acid testing, disinfecting, monitoring, transferring infected people, and densely connected persons, and "big white" became synonymous with these people. There are more and more negative reports and complaints about "Bai Bai" using violence, and some even call them "White Guards". In the new ten articles, the infected persons and close personnel can beolate at home, no longer forced isolation, and shall not expand the high risk zone at will, and shall not adopt various forms of temporary control and control. People's heart.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the new one, some netizens reported to him to report the good news under the Weibo account of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang. In the early days of the Chinese epidemic, Li Wenliang's first alarm was "commanded", but he was called the epidemic whistle. After his dying, the people spontaneously mourned him and expressed grief. Weibo users wrote under his account, "Winter has passed, you see it", "Doctor, we survive, we will be free."</p>

<h3>Promoting the vaccination of the new crown virus vaccine for the elderly</h3>
<p>Once the new one is really implemented, this scene in Beijing may not appear again. After the announcement of the new regulations, the number of air tickets and train tickets on the tourism platform surged. Many people look forward to traveling or visiting relatives and friends during the Spring Festival. Due to Omekor's highly contagious, foreseeable is that China will soon have a wave of infection. In the past year, China's epidemic prevention has been mainly placed on "clearing zero". The vaccination has stagnated. Only 40%of the elderly over 80 years of age have been vaccinated. Therefore, protecting the elderly groups. "Promoting the vaccination of the new crown virus vaccination" is imminent. This is also one of the biggest challenges facing China after giving up the clearing policy.</p>

<h3>Welcome to China's relaxation of epidemic prevention</h3>
<p>Although when there was an epidemic in Shanghai in March this year, experts advocated "coexisting with the virus", but the senior management still decided to seal the city "clear zero". The two -month -old sealed city not only had a huge impact on the lives of the people, but also put a lot of pressure on the supply chain of all walks of life, and the import and export of China's economic pillar. In recent months, it has continuously closed control and exacerbating the trend of downward foreign trade. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated that more than one -third of Germany's plans to expand production and increase diversification due to China's prosecution policy and other reasons. Most of the German economic circles have been relieved to the new policies of China ’s introduction to prevent epidemic prevention.</p>

<h3>"Dynamic Cleaning Zero" ended the hope of returning to normal life</h3>
<p>In order to turn the way to turn the new crown policy, China has recently asked experts to come forward to propagate Omekor's disease low pathogenic. At present, there is no evidence to indicate that the new crown has sequelae and so on. Worried. The Chinese government has always refused to approve Western vaccines for people to fight. At the same time, it is emphasized that domestic vaccines are also good for preventing severe illnesses and death. After the announcement of the new policy, many people in China have changed from previous hoarding foods to drugs, ready to welcome the advent of the infection. Some experts say that 90%of the event will be infected with Omikon, but how long it takes for group immunity, no experts have come to predict. However, the TV picture that people who do not wear masks on the World Cup audience have made the Chinese people see the hope of returning to normal life.</p>

<p>Ukraine Agricultural Policy and Food Minister Soliski said that the export volume of food and oil in Ukraine this year is expected to be 46 million tons, which is one -third from last year, of which grain exports will be reduced by 40%.</p>
<p>According to the news released by the Ukrainian agricultural policy and the official website of the Ministry of Food on Wednesday (May 31), at the EU Agricultural and Fisheries Commission meeting held in Brussels, Belgium from May 29th to 30th, Soliski said, " The main risks facing exports include some EU countries to continue to take measures to restrict imports from imports of imports from imports of imports, as well as the Black Sea Grain Corridor at any time.</p>
<p>Solisky called on the European Union and Ukraine to cancel the restrictions on export restrictions on Ukraine to find sustainable solutions. I hope that when the EU makes relevant decisions, they can respect the contact national agreement between Ukraine and the European Union and the European Union. Market principles and rules.</p>
<p>The European Commission announced on May 2 that from May 2nd to June 5th, four agricultural products including Ukrainian wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower seeds were temporarily restricted in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovak. , But can continue to use these countries to transport them. After the measures came into effect, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Slovaks promised to withdraw unilateral measures for Ukraine agricultural products.</p>
<p>After the Ukraine crisis was upgraded, a large number of agricultural products were unable to transport them due to the Black Sea port. Under the mediation of the United Nations and Turkey, a large number of Ukrainian agricultural products were transported to other regions via Eastern European countries. Because the subsequent problems such as logistics have not been solved, a large number of Ukrainian agricultural products can only be sold in Eastern European countries, which has impacted local agricultural prices, causing protests from many farmers in Eastern Europe. The Polish and Hungarian government decided on April 15 to prohibit imports of grains and some other agricultural products from Ukraine to protect their own agricultural products. The ban was originally valid until June 30. Slovakia and Bulgaria also took similar measures.</p>

<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said on Thursday (June 1) that Moscow could not stop Ukraine from joining NATO. At the same time, before the Wilsus decisive summit that was about to be held in mid -July, there was differences between NATO member states about Ukraine joining.</p>
<p>"All NATO member states agree that Moscow does not oppose NATO's rejection." Stoltenberg told reporters. At this time, the foreign ministers of NATO member states gathered in Oslo, trying to eliminate any signs of discomfort before the summit. Stoltenberg said: "We are advancing forward, and NATO member states agree to Ukraine to join."</p>
<p>NATO agreed in Ukraine to eventually join the alliance in 2008, but leaders of various countries have not yet taken advancement measures, such as providing Kiev's Action Plan for Member State, which will formulate Ukraine's official joining the timetable for NATO.</p>
<p>NATO leaders intend to send strong support information to Kiev at the Vilnis Summit. However, only six weeks left from the summit. In order to reach a consensus on the specific plan provided by Ukraine, the pressure of NATO member states was increasing.</p>
<p>Although Kiev and its closest NATO member states in Eastern Europe called for specific measures to promote the franchise process of Ukraine, the United States and Germany and other Western countries have closer to the alliance that may be closer to the war with Russia <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北約秘書長挺烏入會-德國防長還不是時候/a-65393175">are cautious</a>Essence</p>
<h3>Zelei: Ukraine is ready to join NATO</h3>
<h3><strong> Accept Ukraine as a member of the war, NATO will start war with Russia </strong></h3>
<p>Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrieliuslandsbergis said Kiev suffered twice in 14 years waiting for NATO to answer. He said: "Now that we really sit down, how will Ukraine be close to NATO and when they become a member of NATO to find a very specific answer."</p>
<p>His appeal was responded to Estonian Foreign Minister Margustsahkna. Chachnes urged NATO member states to provide a clear way to enter NATO for Kiev, and provide a strong security guarantee for it after the war, so as not to leave any "gray zone" to make Russia organic. Chakner said: "Ukraine needs to join NATO to find a clear road and next action plan."</p>
<p>Stoltenberg also called for a security -guaranteed framework for Kiev to prevent Russia from taking military operations against the country again.</p>
<p>Other NATO member states such as Germany and Luxembourg emphasized the risk of NATO's urgency to make Kiev join.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65794032/65780119"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T13-20-00Z/65780119_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese) After nearly a hundred days of trial, the Dreson Supreme Court sentenced the left -wing extremist Lina E. and their three places for many years. The judge said that LINA E. was charged with criminal gangs and sentenced to five years and three months in prison. The other three men in the same case were sentenced to two prisoners in two, five months to three years and three months, respectively.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the evidence showed that the defendant launched multiple serious violence attacks on members of De Dongtuylingen and Saxon and other places from 2018 to 2020. College student Lina E. was regarded by the court as the leader of this criminal gang. Prosecutors said that the attack was injured in total, and two of them were facing danger of life.</p>
<h3><strong> Use a wooden stick and hammer to attack the extreme right molecule </strong></h3>
<p>At the end of 2019, the left -wing extremist led by LINAE. The well -known bars gathered by Eisenach, who were polarized, and hit an extreme right person with a stick and hammer. A few weeks later, they launched an attack on the extremely right person again, causing this person to fracture and other pains in many places.</p>
<p>The judge's judgment on LINA E. was lower than the prosecution's eight -year imprisonment, and during the trial, Linae. It has been two years in prison. The prosecutor also suggested that the other defendant sentenced to three years and nine months in prison. The defense requested to consider the sentencing of LINA E. for only attempt to be injured and theft.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T13-20-00Z/65779344_401.jpg" />A large number of police forces were deployed outside the court due to worrying about riots.</p>
<h3><strong> Protesting rally in front of the Drester court </strong></h3>
<p>When the court was sentenced, the defendant used a folder to cover the face, and some folders wrote "Release All Anti -Fascians". Hundreds of supporters were applauded by the defendant at the seat.</p>
<p>When the verdict was read, some people shouted the left -wing slogan. The trial judge Hans Schlüter-STAATS requested to keep quiet so that he could read a reason for sentencing. He said that anyone who wants to listen to torture can stay in court. At this time, some people shouted to the judge, "You are all friends of fascism." The judge defended the German judicial system, and emphasized that over the years, the court has judged a large number of right -wing extreme violence cases.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T13-20-00Z/65779360_401.jpg" />Outside the court, nearly a hundred Lina E. supporters held a rally.</p>
<h3><strong> Trial length of evidence contradictions </strong></h3>
<p>Most of the prosecution evidence comes from the testimony of a gang member. Johannesd, a 30 -year -old stain witness Johannesd. He said that he had participated in the planning process of a series of attacks. In February this year, this person has been sentenced to 18 months of probation. Because the person was sentenced to light, there were rumors that he made a good confession to Lian E. and contradictory in order to obtain a light sentence.</p>
<p>To the extent, the attack operation has been planned in advance. This is the focus of disputes between the two parties in the trial. Because the reason why LINA E. was fixed as the criminal gang criminal is based on the left -wing gang who had conducted special training for the attack.</p>
<h3><strong> The trial of LINA E. is very political sensitivity </strong></h3>
<p>This case has a very high political sensitivity: the lawyer of the defense and the left -wing extreme camp of LINA E. Homesy City Leipzig believes that they have been regarded by the authorities and the media as a scapegoat. In addition, Linae. Supporters also believed that the judicial authorities opened the Nazi criminals and did not have a strong blow. On Wednesday, the active elements of the left -wing extreme camp held a demonstration in front of the Dresden Court and called on Saturday to hold a large -scale protest assembly in Berlin and Leipzig this Saturday. Police believe that violent conflicts may occur.</p>
<p>Professor Hendrik Hansen, an expert on extremist experts at the German School of Public Management, believes that many media do not know enough about the risk of extreme left -wing forces. He said to the Voice of Germany: "This trial is very successful. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/莱比锡骚乱继续-多名警察受伤/a-54824436">In Leipzig, the left -wing extreme forces are developing and growing with the situation of secret communities, and the methods they use have never had before.</a> "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-01T13-20-00Z/65780201_401.jpg" />After nearly a hundred days of trial, the judge read the judgment.</p>
<h3><strong> "Planning meticulous attack" </strong></h3>
<p>Hansen said: The gang headed by LINAE. It can be qualitatively characterized as a criminal gang, and it is not an exaggeration to be defined as a terrorist gang. He said: "The attacks implemented by the gang carried out meticulous planning in advance, and also adopted corresponding technical means, such as disposable mobile phones. In order to implement effective gang collaboration, they specially conducted training. Some people were responsible for right. Attack targets are conducted on the spot reconnaissance. There are very detailed division of labor inside the gang. "</p>
<p>Hansen said that when the gang was planning to attack, the purpose was very clear, that is, to make the attacking target be seriously injured and even cause it to death. "The definition of terrorism is to use political motivation -based violence to cause panic in people or specific groups."</p>
<h3><strong> lina e. </strong> <strong> Who is it? </strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the last day of the trial and expressed his gratitude to his relatives and friends in the auditorium, LINA E. only made an oral statement in court once. In a trial in October 2022, LINA E. tells her growth process: she grew up in Casel City, and once hoped to become a social worker who took care of the vulnerable youth. Extreme right -wing forces are radical.</p>
<p>Case is located in Heisen, in the central and western Germany. The state has a large -scale extreme right -wing forces.</p>

<p>So far, the violent attacks against the new Nazi have not found the LINA E. DNA at the scene of the new Nazis. However, at least the attack was indirectly related to LINA E., because the DNA of LINA E. Living partner Johann G. was found here. At present, this person is still absconding with the case.</p>

<p>The UAE issued a statement on Wednesday (May 31st) that the "United Maritime Power" (CMF) led by the United States had been withdrawn two months ago; the main goal of the Multi -National Maritime Unit is to maintain the safety of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The statement of the UAE Foreign Affairs Department is to respond to a report from the Wall Street Journal. It is reported that on May 30, with the title of "Iran's seizure of the tanker, the United States was asked to protect the Persian Gulf Safety", it was said that on April 27th and May 3rd, Iran was detained near the Strait of the Hormuz. UAE officials are "disappointed" by the response to the United States, asking the United States to take strong measures to "deter Iran".</p>
<p>The UAE Foreign Ministry said in a statement that this report is a "wrong description" of security dialogue between the UAE and the United States. The UAE has always been committed to peaceful dialogue and diplomatic contact, and uses it as a means of common goal to promote regional security and stability. The statement states that "after continuous evaluation of effective and security cooperation with all partners," the UAE withdrew from CMF two months ago. The UAE is committed to maintaining navigation safety in the sea according to international law.</p>
<p>The UAE's statement did not specifically talk about the dispute between Iran and the United States, nor did it explain why the withdrawal from the CMF. But the CMF commander Hawkins said: "CMF still contains 38 partner countries, and the UAE is one of them."</p>
<p>Founded in 2001, CMF is a multinational joint mechanism led by the United States. The headquarters is located in the Gulf National Barin, where the Fifth Fleet Command of the United States is located.</p>

What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Today, the deterrent of the United States is in the Russian and Uchta War and the Taiwan Strait crisis.</p>
<p>Professor Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard University and former assistant defense, published a comment on the influential international scholar review platform "PROJECTSYNDICATE" on May 2nd. It is pointed out that the stability of geopolitics depends to a large extent on deterrence. But how do we prove that deterrence is effective?</p>
<p><strong> Dilemma of deterrent </strong></p>
<p>For the Russian and Ukraine War, since December 2021, US President Joseph Biden warned Russian President Vladimirputin that Russia would face severe sanctions if he invaded Ukraine. However, these warnings were not effective. Putin threatened the use of nuclear weapons and did not have a deterrent effect. The United States and NATO allies military aid Ukraine has continued to increase, and the Russian army had heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Is the deterrent failed? Joseph Naisa believes that this question is difficult to answer. Because the Russian and Ukraine War showed that reducing risks is not the choice of the second choice (not this), but often the issue of degree. So far, Western countries have provided weapons to Ukraine, but they have been reluctant to provide long -range missile systems or modern fighters. Putin has not attacked NATO countries to assist Ukraine's supply line, indicating that both sides have scruples. In other words, deterrence is not completely used, but there is a dilemma.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the situation of the Taiwan Strait. Johnaquilino, commander of the United States India Command, pointed out at a speech and discussion held at a lecture on the National Committee of the United States and China Relations on May 23 that he hoped that Chinese President Xi Jinping would learn from the Russian and Ukraine War and in the issue of Taiwan's martial arts. Think about it. Because there is no quick decision on this war, it will cause great devastating blows at the cost of blood and wealth.</p>
<p>Aquilino solemnly said that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense gave him two tasks: first prevent this conflict that invades Taiwan. If the task fails, the United States will be ready to fight and win.</p>
<p>Prior to this April 18th, Aquilino stated at the Military Commission of the House of Representatives in the House of Representatives that China's threat to Taiwan was moving towards the wrong direction, and the United States was ready to deal with any emergencies. For him, what is the timetable is not important. If the Minister of Defense gave him this task today, he was responsible for avoiding conflict today. If the deterrent fails, the United States has the ability to fight and win. Therefore, deterrence is the primary task.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T14-25-00-04-00/000002.png" />Aquilino, commander of the United States India Command, said that he would deter the opponent first, and then defeated his opponent if it failed. (Picture of the U.S. Indo -Pacific Command) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-06012023113418.html/image.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T14-25-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Find clues in history </strong></p>
<p>The question is, how can the United States guarantee that deterrence is effective? Once the Taiwan Strait crisis occurs, will the deterrence of the United States occur in the situation similar to the Russian and Ukraine War?</p>
<p>Joseph Nai pointed out in the article that the United States has refused to disclose whether it will defend Taiwan for many years. He said that he visited Beijing during his time as the Assistant Minister of Defense, and the reception official asked him if the United States would fight for Taiwan. He said no one knew. However, he mentioned a period of history. In January 1950 before the Korean War, US Secretary of State Deanacheson did not include South Korea into the US defense in a speech. But half a year later, the United States participated in the Korean War. Therefore, he warned the other party not to test the United States on the Taiwan Strait issue.</p>
<p>Joseph Nai said that history reminds us that the success of deterrence may be difficult and affected by many factors. If you want to play a role, Credibility is very important, that is, to make the other party believe that deterrence is not empty, and will be fulfilled by action. The situation in Taiwan shows that the changing environment will test the effective deterrent strategy of the United States for many years.</p>
<p>The deterrent of the United States will play a role in the Russia -Ukraine War and the Taiwan Strait crisis, which may be able to find clues from the practice of American history.</p>
<p>American deterrent theory and practice are mainly divided into two categories: punishment by Punishment and deductivity deterrence.</p>
<p><strong> Punishment deterrence </strong></p>
<p>The so -called punishment deterrence refers to a punitive action to the invaders or enemies to prevent it from launching offense or aggression. To pass clear information, warn the invaders will bear serious consequences once crossing the red line. There are three historical events.</p>
<p>First, the Cold War. Punishment deterrence is an important part of deterrence and nuclear strategy between the United States and the Soviet Union. The nuclear deterrence between the two superpowers emphasizes that the opponent's hostile action will face devastating revenge, thus producing a deterrent effect. Although many agent wars occurred during the period, the United States and the Soviet Union had no positive conflict.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gulf War (1990-1991). Before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the United States proposed a serious warning. After the invasion occurred, the United States -led joint forces adopted a punitive military blow to Iraq, re -founded the Iraqi army, forced them to withdraw from Kuwait and restore regional security.</li>
</ol>
<p>Third, anti -terrorism war. Powering deterrence is used to respond to the behavior of terrorist organizations and supporters. For example, the United States takes military operations on base organizations and Taliban organizations and punishs through the hunting and execution of terrorists. The United States conveys clear information, regardless of the horror behavior of the End of the End of the End of the End of the End of the End of the End of the End of the End of End.<strong> Refusal deterrence </strong></p>
<p>The so -called refusal deterrence refers to the possibility of preventing the enemy's adventure by showing the strength or active defense, preventing the enemy's adventure, and reducing the outbreak of conflict. There are three historical events.</p>
<p>First, the Cold War. Refusal deterrence is an important part of the United States and its allies in the deterrent strategy. By showing strong military forces and determination, the Soviet Union and its allies are prevented from taking offensive operations, including the establishment of a strong defense system, joint military exercises and deployment of military power. During the period, limited wars in various places continued, but the world situation was basically controllable.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the issue of Taiwan, by showing military strength and adopting active defense measures in the United States, the United States has rejected China's martial arts against Taiwan, including the freedom of navigation in the Taiwan Strait area, strengthening patrols near the Taiwan Strait, and holding joint military exercises to provide military assistance to Taiwan to provide military assistance to Taiwan. Wait, and pass clear information to China, any action against Taiwan will face serious consequences. As Joseph Nai said, on the Taiwan issue, the changing environment will test the effective deterrent strategy of the United States for many years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Third, the Korean Peninsula. The United States has adopted refusal deterrence to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and missile capabilities, including improving sanctions on North Korea, strengthening military deployment and conducting joint military exercises, and preventing North Korea from adopting military provocation. The deterrence of the United States for the former has not been effective, but the situation on the Korean Peninsula has basically maintained a controllable situation.</p>
<p>Overall, refusal deterrence is preventive defense, mainly for normalization. The punitive deterrence is mainly special objects, with strong targeted and attacking force. Each has its own emphasis, play a different deterrent effect, and often uses the effect of adding a multiplier.</p>
<p><strong> Double deterrence </strong></p>
<p>In terms of the Russian and Ukraine War, the United States assisted Ukraine at the same time with punitive deterrent and refusal deterrence. Powering deterrence is mainly reflected in the implementation of economic sanctions and political isolation against Russia, preventing Russia from continuing to violate international law and subverting regional stability. With the continuous defeat of the Russian army on the battlefield, the effectiveness of the United States' punitive operations will become increasingly obvious. In terms of refusal deterrence, the United States provides weapons and equipment and training to Ukraine, which not only improves the U -military defense capabilities, and thus defeats the Russian offensive, and even turns into an attack, which may reverse the war.</p>
<p>Last year, the United States proposed a new "National Defense Strategy", positioning China as the "most important strategic competitor" and the challenge of step -by -step force, and prioritized China's challenges in the Indo -Pacific region, and then Russia's threat in Europe. According to this principle, the United States' punitive deterrent to Russia is still dominated by economic and diplomatic means, and will not be promoted to the military field. Military assistance to Ukraine is still limited to the scope of refusal deterrence. If it is necessary to take enthusiasm for countermeasures, NATO will bear more responsibilities. The United States can concentrate military strength against China.</p>
<p>As long as the Ukrainian army maintains a stable combat rhythm and moves to attack, the double deterrence in the United States can work, and Russia may have weakened from this.</p>
<p>In terms of the Taiwan Strait, the United States mainly adopts refusal deterrence to prevent China from moving against Taiwan. But its content has changed from last year. Aquilino publicly pointed out that the task of India -Pacific Command is to prevent conflicts by performing "integrated deterrence". If necessary, make a good preparation for fighting and winning.</p>
<p><strong> Integrated deterrence </strong></p>
<p>"Integrated deterrence" clearly wrote in the "National Defense Strategy" and "Indo -Pacific Strategy" released last year. As the cornerstone of the United States, it will play a guiding role for a long time, mainly for China's threats. It emphasizes that with the support of reliable and effective nuclear deterrence, through the development and integration of all forces, such as the development and integration of all forces such as the fate, the theater, the conflict area, the power tools of other countries, and the allies and the partnership, the deterrence effect is The</p>
<p>I. Integration in the field of combat, integrate deterrence from the field of traditional land, sea and air combat into the field of networks, space and cognition; In the whole process of the war, to maximize the deterrent effect; 3. The integration of state forces, make full use of all military and non -military means to form a overall deterrent force with the power of the whole government; The geographical boundaries of each theater, strengthen the dynamic deployment and integrated use of combat forces to achieve the deterrent effect of global integrated operations; 5. Integration within and outside the region, a powerful and complementary alliance network from the United States to build collective forces in the region and outside regions.</p>
<p>In particular, the United States regards security alliances and partnership networks as the biggest asymmetric advantage. Taiwan is included in one of the targets of connecting to the network in the United States. Maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is also listed as a key task for the United States to strengthen the security of the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p>It can be said that "integrated deterrence" is more comprehensive and fundamental than punitive deterrent and refusal deterrence. Japan is the first country to promote and collaborate in the United States "integration deterrence". Taiwan cannot analogize. But as long as the United States and Taiwan Association defense goes forward, the deterrent of the United States to China will increase one point.</p>

<p>The South Korean government will quickly promote the comprehensive rectification of the "Alert Alert Release System" to cope with North Korea's further provocation.</p>
<p>Yonhap News Agency reported on Thursday (June 1) that Seoul City on Wednesday (May 31st) Early morning <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230531-1399806">North Korea launched military reconnaissance satellites</a>Published a "alert alert" and sent relevant content to the citizens <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230531-1399808">emergency disaster SMS</a>Essence Subsequently, the Ministry of Executive Security sent a text message to the public that it was a "mistaken alert." Seoul Mayor Wu Shixun had apologized for confusion on this matter on Wednesday, but there are still opinions that it is too late to condemn the sending alarm SMS and the content is not specific enough.</p>
<p>According to reports, the South Korean government initially identified that the relevant person in charge of Seoul City took excessive response measures to take measures in advance. The system will be maintained during the system rectification, but the focus will be focused on quickly and accurately transmitting information.</p>
<p>A senior official of the South Korean government said in an interview that the State Adjustment Room will investigate the Ministry of Administration and Seoul, and then discuss improvement of countermeasures. The core person of the Presidential Office of South Korea said that it is necessary to rectify the system in a timely manner, based on the "six principles" to truthfully pass the warning and alarm information to allow the people to respond calmly.</p>
<p>It is reported that the government will use Japan's "J-Alert" as a reference example. The content of the disaster text message sent by the Japanese government on Wednesday through this system is "missile launch, missile launch. Suspected North Korea launched a missile, please go to buildings or underground."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The World News published a signature comment pointed out that the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/歐盟談對中貿易去風險而非脫鉤/a-64445854">"de -risk" strategy</a>The current attitude of Germany is too naive and has not realized that the global power relationship has been transferred.</p>
<p>Especially for China, "Germany is still trying to take a steel wire between maintaining economic relations and 'risk'. However, we need to adopt a more practical attitude to contact the lessons brought about by the Russian war and the new geopolitical pattern." The author believes that Germany is "too optimistic about China and challenges reality." Comments:</p>
<p>"Federal Prime Minister Shulz said that the Group 7 Group will work hard to ensure that people can continue to invest in China and the supply chain, while products continue to be sold in China. However Others) Territory, expanding their own influence, and using oil and gas pipelines as the Ukrainian war on pressure should be a warning.</p>
<p>Economically interweaving cannot protect a country from political pressure or military aggression. If a country threatens the territory, people must be treated seriously. China is threatening to annex Taiwan. Taiwan is the most important production base in the global semiconductor industry. When a country put economic pressure on the German allies -such as Lithuania and Australia, we must realize that this method may also be used on our heads at any time.</p>
<p>It is unrealistic that economic relations do not need to bear temporary and severe interference -German's thoughts. Although Shulz's statement reflects the desire to reduce dependence, he did not recognize the international climate. Holding a naive mentality in risks may make Germany and its allies more fragile in the face of political pressure and economic control. "</p>
<h3>How can the German Foreign Minister visit China for "correction" for Macron?</h3>
<p>"In order to form a more effective strategy, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7联合公报政策方针不是为了伤害中国/a-65684805">the Group 7 must take the initiative</a>Essence A comprehensive risk means re -evaluating economic relations between Germany and China and Russia, and considering their geopolitical ambitions and human rights records. This requires the diversification of the supply chain and reducing the dependence of key industries. Risks also need to invest in domestic capabilities, investment innovation and development of alternative economic partners. In addition, Germany must give priority to cooperation with like -minded countries and alliances that advocate common values such as democracy, human rights, and rule of law. "</p>
<h3>Beijing is waiting for Europe</h3>
<p>"Berlin Daily" published an analysis article pointed out that Beijing's senior management is focusing on promoting cooperation with Europe, and French President <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马克龙中国在寻求乌克兰和平中可以扮演重要角色/a-65235895">Macron's visit to China</a>It provided a favorable opportunity for Beijing: "From the perspective of Beijing's geopolitical perspective, Europe is a key combination of geopolitics in the 21st century. China is very clear that in Europe, the country is also in a strategic competition with the United States in a strategic competition in the United States Just like the competition in Indo -Pacific and other regions. However, the power of Beijing is a realist. Therefore, we must realize that how to determine the future of Europe in the future will also affect China to achieve realization to the realization of China. The space of its global strategy. "</p>
<p>The article takes the European Belt and Road project as an example. It pointed out that the EU's existence of China in Southeast Europe is very unhappy and sacrifice the infrastructure plan "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟推出全球门户-欲与一带一路比高下/a-59988624">Global Portal"</a>Competition. In the near future, China has repeatedly emphasized that it does not seek to become the world, but to seek peaceful development and win -win. The article wrote:</p>
<p>"The decision makers of Beijing are delaying time, waiting for the EU to endure the world with a new and realistic vision, and take the global changes of the polymer world as an opportunity. This is also to avoid conflicts in the future. During this period, China It will turn to other regions. The BRICS community has become an alternative option in the West, and its attractiveness is increasing. Asia, Africa and South America have made an application for emerging applications as an example. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-01T14-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Latard said at a banking conference held in Hanover in Germany: "We are close to the cruise height, but we have not yet arrived, which means that we need to continue to rise, but the speed is no longer so fast."</p>
<p>The latest data released today shows that due to the cooling of energy prices, the inflation rate in the euro zone in May has dropped significantly to 6.1%, but this number is still much higher than the 2%target set by the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>Lagarde said, "The inflation is still too high."</p>
<p>Lagarde pointed out that in order to suppress inflation, the European Central Bank took action at the "fastest speed ever", and has increased interest rates by 3.75 percentage points since July last year.</p>
<p>She said, "The real question is: How much do we need to raise?"</p>
<p>According to Lagarde, although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has soared in the recent decline, higher salary requirements are now an important driving force for inflation.</p>
<p>Recently, labor in Europe has called for salary increases to help make up for the rising cost of living. Ragard said that this was "particularly obvious" in Germany, the largest economy in Europe, and in recent months, the German union has also achieved a significant salary increase.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank will announce the decision of the next monetary policy on June 15, and observer is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two major economies of China and the United States is becoming more and more tense, and it affects many business companies with business. Some companies like technology giants Apple (Apple) transferred some of the production source to India. Some decided to actively do a good job, which also prompted Elonmusk, chief executive of electric vehicle giant Tesla, decided to go to China.</p>
<p>China is the largest market outside the United States, accounting for 22 % of Tesla's turnover. China is also a vital part of the supply chain of electric vehicle manufacturers, accounting for more than half of global output. As long as China adopts any export control, data security, and restrictions on sensitive technologies, it will directly affect Tesla's profit and market share.</p>
<p>In early 2021, China banned Tesla electric vehicles from entering China's military facilities and residential areas. This scope expanded further in 2022. Tesla must also make a lot of guarantee for driving information collected by its electric vehicle built -in camera. These are good examples.</p>
<p>Musk's private jet arrived in Beijing, China on May 30. This is his first visit to China for three years. Musk's visit to China this time said: "The interests of the United States and China are actually intertwined, just like a one -sided twin, and the shadow is inseparable."</p>
<p>Musk also made it clear that his company did not support economic decoupling or destroying the supply chain. He also praised China's "vitality" and said that he was "completely confident" in China's vital market.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-01T14-57/000000.png" />The picture shows Tesla's hegemony in Shanghai, China. (Bloomberg)</p>
<p>In this visit to China, in addition to seeing the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang, Musk also met with the Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong and Wang Wentao, Minister of Commerce, and had dinner with the chairman of the battery supplier Ningde.</p>
<p>After Musk arrived in Beijing, Tesla's stock price rose more than 4 % on Tuesday (May 30). The stock has also climbed up to $ 200 per share since March. Although Tesla still faces fierce competition from Chinese competitors such as BYD.</p>
<p>However, it is undeniable that the billionaire in Beijing was indeed welcomed by almost the same level as foreign political leaders and had talks with several ministers. According to Chinese diplomats, Musk explicitly stated to Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang that his group hope "continues to develop in China".</p>
<p>According to Chinese business, in the talks with the Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao, Musk "strongly praised China's vitality and development potential." He also "is full of confidence in the Chinese market" and said that he "eager to continue deepening mutual benefit cooperation."</p>
<p>Tesla's Chinese business strategy has succeeded in business at this time and played a vital role. In the current macro market, the electric vehicle market is fiercely competitive. In the past year, Tesla has significantly reduced the price of its models six times. Tesla also builds another battery factory in Shanghai, hoping to reduce costs while increasing production.</p>
<p>Not only that, since buying a social platform for Twitter last year, Musk has caused many shareholders to complain about it because of distraction, which has led Tesla's stock price to retreat. Although he recently announced that he would pay the new CEO of Twitter, Musk still had many things to deal with SpaceX and Twitter in SpaceX. Therefore, he is extremely important for Tesla.</p>
<p>The FidelityInvestments, which helped Musk ’s $ 44 billion, publicly stated that today’ s Twitter value is only one -third of Musk's buying price. On the other hand, France also threatened that if Twitter does not follow the "European Digital Service Law" that takes effect at the end of August this year, France will prohibit Twitter in the entire European Union. In other words, there are so many things that Musk is annoying.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-01T14-57/000001.png" />Musk (wearing white clothes) boarded his private jet on May 31 and took off from the Beijing Capital International Airport. Later, he visited Tesla Shanghai Super Factory in the early morning of June 1. According to the "Flying Changquan" APP, on the morning of June 1, his private plane had left Shanghai Hongqiao Airport to go to Austin Bergst Romor Airport, USA. (Agence France -Presse)</p>
<p>This also means that Musk must ensure that his flagship company Tesla can go smoothly. In other words, Tesla's business in China must be successful. As Sino -US relations continue to be tense, the whole situation may reach the critical point, and Musk's concerns are largely understandable. Although Musk did not dance like the opening of the Shanghai -level factory in the Shanghai -level factory in 2020, and completed the visit within three days, his trip to China was believed to be holding only successful and not failed to fail.

<p>Recently, Malaysia has reported that Thai durian exporters went to Pahang Roube to acquire Cat Shan King Durian at a high price, and then sold them to China in the name of "Thai Cats and Kings". The Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture calls on Rauban fruit farmers not to let Malaysian famous durian into products in other countries.</p>
<p>Durian fruit farmers need the government to increase the durian export permit to prevent large Malaysian large durian exporters monopolizing the trade and suppression of the purchase price of China. Fruit farmers said that it is forced to allow Thai merchants to acquire Matshan Kings, because China has not yet approved the entrance of the Malaysian durian fresh fruit, and the bidding of Thai merchants is also higher than the general purchase price of Malaysia.</p>
<p>According to information circulating on social media, the price of Thai merchants is about 30 % higher than the purchase price of Matshan King in Malaysia. However, Thai merchants stated that they could not wait for the durian to fall to the ground before picking up, and it must be cut into a durian that has not been dropped.</p>
<p>Due to various factors such as water, the durian cut from the tree is often about 10 % heavier than the durian that falls on the ground, which means that fruit farmers can get more than 10 % of the income than the original acquisition price. Therefore, many durian fruit farmers are willing to cooperate with Thai merchants to "harvest" durian.</p>
<p>Chen Hongzheng, deputy minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Grain Safety, on Wednesday (May 31), pointed out on Facebook that the government has noticed the incident of foreign merchants after the acquisition of Malaysian durian to China. He said that the Ministry of Agriculture is actively applying for the export permit for durian fresh fruits to China, and he hopes that Malaysian Durian fruit agriculture can patiently wait for the application results. "Because this matter involves the bilateral trade agreement and technical negotiations of the two countries (Malaysia). I call on fruit farmers to be patient because it takes time to deal with it."</p>
<p>He pointed out that if the durian exported to the legitimate trade pipeline, the fruit farmers not only could not obtain the maximum benefits, but they may also turn the brand of the Malaysian Catshand King into a brand of other countries, which is equivalent to marrying people. "I believe everyone doesn't want to see such a situation."</p>
<p>Chen Hongzheng said that Malaysia Durian has a competitive advantage of high -end quality in the international market, and believes that fruit farmers have a lot. He understands the problems and challenges faced by Fruit Nong, and his office will follow up the matter to ensure that fruit farmers' planning is fully guaranteed.</p>

The "New Citizen Plan" of China Non -Government Organization has recently released the "2023 Children of the Chinese Migraphic Population", revealing the living conditions of the current children of the migrant population in China. What kind of challenges are this huge minor group in different cities in China?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/tebiejiemu/mingongchao40/mg-10192021101804.html"><strong> post -wave: Children lost on the starting line </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/nu-10172018105147.html">"Left -behind Children" Family Status: There are less reunion problems</a></strong></p>
<p>According to the definition of the Convention on Children's Rights, children refer to the population under 18. If you don't look at the numbers, it seems difficult to imagine that the number of children of the migrant population in China has reached 138 million, accounting for nearly half of the total number of Chinese children (46%). In other words, one of the two Chinese children is a child of the flowing population.</p>
<p>The latest report of the "New Citizen Plan" "2023 The Status of Children of China Popular Population: Facts and Data" conducted a detailed study of this. The source of the data includes the 7th National Census of the National Bureau of Statistics, the "Chinese Population Census of 2020" and The description and analysis of the Chinese children's population in the past population surveys and survey data, as well as the "2020 Chinese Children's Popularity: Facts and Data" jointly released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the United Nations Children's Fund, and the United Nations Population Fund.</p>
<p><strong> Together!Together? </strong></p>
<p>As a child, living with parents seems to be righteous. But for the children of China, it is often difficult to be with parents.</p>
<p>According to the report of the "New Citizen Plan", in 2020, 108 million children cannot live with both parents, of which 89.22 million are children affected by population flow. Many of them have become left -behind children, and they are far away from parents working outside. There are more than 6 million left -behind children in Henan Province alone.</p>
<p>At the same time, children who can migrate with their parents only account for half of the total number of children in the flow population (51.5%). In those cities with more restrictions on the residence of foreign populations, this relocation rate is even lower. In 2020, the migration rate of children in Beijing was only 22.5%, Shanghai was only 25%, and Guangzhou was 27.6%.</p>
<p>There are also children of some flowing population who return to the city after their parents enter the city. In 2021, 920,000 in China returned to their hometowns alone, most of them became left -behind children.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000002.png" />Children (Associated Press Information Map) in the school of a school of migrant workers (information map) [![] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/wy-06012023141816.html/ap091112073357.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Different challenges </strong></p>
<p>For left -behind children, their challenge is that they cannot be with their parents and lack their parents' affection, guidance and help in the growth period. Children who moved in different places with their parents still face many challenges.</p>
<p>The "New Citizen Plan" in 2022 The "2022 Chinese Popular Population Children's Status" has focused on analyzing the situation of relocated children to study, showing that 80%of them can admit to public schools and 20%of private schools.</p>
<p>However, when these relocation children enter public schools in different places, they often encounter unfair treatment. Li Qiang, the founder of the non -profit organization "Labor Observation" in New York, said that if Chinese relocated children are entering local public schools, they generally pay a sponsorship fee that local residents do not have to bear. The husband and wife earn less than 100,000 yuan a year, and you need to work overtime, and then a child will sponsor one or 20,000. "</p>
<p>Li Qiang pointed out that China ’s discriminatory regulations on migrant children’ s discrimination are also reflected in the financial subsidies that only local residents can enjoy. Pay by fiscal, but not allowed foreign workers to enjoy. "</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang, currently in the Netherlands, is from Shenzhen. In this city where foreign migrant workers gather a lot, Lin Shengliang, who has a wide range of connections, is often begged to help the enrollment qualifications of foreign workers' children. "Many people around me are the case and they are painful. , I think they seem to be abducted, very painful. "</p>
<p>In Lin Shengliang's opinion, the conditions for their children to enter public schools for ordinary foreign workers are relatively harsh. "You have to pay social security, and there must be a lease (rental) contract to study in public schools. In schools, if you want to go to a private school, you have to charge it. The teachers of private schools are not good enough. "</p>
<p>Shenzhen has been implemented at least ten years ago to implement the "points enrollment" approach, and unified points for Shenzhen household registration and non -Shenzhen household registration children who meet the conditions of Shenzhen City. , Getting scoring rankings, high ranking priority enrollment. This approach seems to break through the barrier between the household registration and the non -household registration, but whether this approach is scientific and fair, there are still many questions from the outside world.</p>
<p>According to the 2013 report of the Chinese Official Media People's Daily, Chu Zhaohui, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Education and Science, believes that this integral system is a negative policy. Division of other categories of education targets during the compulsory education stage is the infringement of the right to educators' rights. In essence, it is also illegal.However, the fairness here does not seem to have obtained general recognition, and people can still see complaints that cannot get fair education rights in social media.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chinese non -governmental organization "New Citizen Program" recently released the Chinese migrant population scale diagram in the "2023 Chinese Migrant Population Children's Status" (screenshot of the new citizen plan) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/wy-06012023141816.html/capture.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-01T16-02-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> Work is also discriminated against </strong></p>
<p>Not only do you not get fair, but the minor children of these migrant workers will also be discriminated against.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang said that in Shenzhen, half of the work does not have discrimination, but enterprises and institutions related to the government will have regional regulations, such as grid staff, school administrative logistics personnel, hydropower gas companies and other units. Children who will recruit Shenzhen local hukou.</p>
<p>Li Qiang observed that this phenomenon is nationwide, but the degree of locality is different. "For example, the security guards assist the preparation of civil servants' work. This kind of work generally recruit children of the population of local villages and towns. It is difficult to find this kind of job. "</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang said that no matter whether to go to school or employment, these practices for migrant workers have been failed to be fair. "Taxpayers are equal. They have made so many contributions as foreign migrant workers. Tax."</p>

<p>Moody's prediction of International Credit Institutions predicts that because of the impact of expected inflation and rising interest rates on family finances, the British economy will have a "mild recession" this year.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that a report released by Moody's Wednesday (May 31) states that the British economy is expected to shrink 0.1%.</p>
<p>The Bank of England pointed out in May that Britain will escape the economic recession this year; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also canceled the forecast of Britain's economic recession this year. Although Moody's report is not as optimistic of the two, it is slightly stronger than its previously estimated British economy to shrink by 0.4%.</p>
<p>Moody's report also predicts that the increase in the British core inflation rate "increases the chance of further interest rate hikes." It is expected that the Bank of England will raise interest rates by 25 basis points again this year, and the benchmark interest rate will reach a peak of 4.75%; the British monetary policy will be tightened in the next few years and put pressure on consumption and investment.</p>
<p>In addition, the report states that Germany will also suffer "gentle decline", but the country's economy will not shrink in 2023. Britain has become the only country that has been predicted to have shrinking this year among the advanced economies of the G20 (G20).</p>
<p>Former US Treasury Minister Larrysummers pointed out in a television interview on Thursday (June 1) that the Brexit Brexit (Brexit) and crown diseases have exacerbated economic problems in the economy, and the situation is compared to other than others. Big powers must be serious.</p>
<p>Samers described Brexit decisions as "historic economic errors", saying that Brexit reduced the competitiveness of the British economy, brought down pressure to the pound, brought upward pressure on prices, limited imported goods, and limited imported goods, and restricted imported goods, and it limited imported goods. Limit the supply of labor in some ways. These factors pushed their inflation.</p>
<p>He said that Britain has no choice now, and can only insist on the issue of interest rate hikes to the end. If two years later, Britain will not enter the economic recession, he will "feel very surprised."</p>

(Reuters society)</p>
<h4>C3.AI (New York Stock Exchange code: AI)</h4>
<p>As one of the darlings of the artificial intelligence boom, C3.AI released the prediction of disappointment of investors to the fiscal year of 2024, which caused C3.AI's stock price to decrease significantly in overnight trading. C3.AI's stock price not only fell 9 % when the market was closed overnight, but also fell 22.22 % to $ 31.12 after the market.</p>

<p>The actual number released overnight is: quarterly turnover of $ 72.4 million, non -GAAP operating loss of $ 25.3 million, and free cash flow of 16.3 million US dollars. Except for the same turnover as the forecast, operating losses and cash flow are inferior to prediction.</p>
<p>C3.AI said in the performance report: "Now people have generally believed that the market for artificial intelligence applications throughout the enterprise is much larger than that of experts before, and the growth rate is much faster than previously predicted. In these ten Over the years, C3.AI has been at the front end of the enterprise artificial intelligence market.

C3.AI is expected to be between 70 million and $ 72.5 million in the next quarter. From the perspective of the middle point, this is roughly the same as the $ 71.6 million generally predicted by Wall Street analysts. The C3.AI is expected to have a loss of non -GAAP operations in this quarter from 25 million to 30 million US dollars. This prediction is also unable to surprise investors at all.</p>
<p>As for the annual results as of April 2024, the executives are expected to turn on the turnover between $ 295 million and $ 320 million; comparing the intermediate value, it should increase by about 15 than the previous fiscal year of 15 years. %, But it is slightly lower than the $ 317 million generally predicted by Wall Street analysts. C3.AI is expected to have a loss of USAP operating losses throughout the year from 50 million to 75 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Although the C3.AI executive said that the company is still expected to achieve its previous goals, that is, to strive for non -GAAP profit at the end of fiscal 2024, 11 analysts in Tipranks seem to be excited because of this. There are only three of them rating "buy" to C3.AI shares, four ratings given to "holding", and four rating of "selling". The average target price of the one -year period is only $ 21.50.</p>

<p>Malaysia shows that if the European Union can treat Malaysia's palm oil products fairly, Malaysia is willing to re -consider restarting free trade negotiations with the European Union. The authorities stated that the stopping of free trade negotiations between the Malaysia and the European Union has nothing to do with the laws and regulations of the EU discrimination against palm oil products.</p>
<p>Malaysia Vice Prime Minister Farira told the Malaysian media in London on Thursday (June 1) that some of the free trade negotiations between Malaysia and the European Union shouted because of the "unparalleled forest product regulations" issued by the European Union in December 2022 Stop, this is actually inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>Fedela is also the Minister of Malaysia and the Minister of Industry. He said that Malaysia and the European Union began to negotiate free trade in 2010, but after seven rounds of negotiations, they have been put on hold in 2012. In other words, the two sides have not continued to negotiate with free trade, which has nothing to do with the EU's "non -destruction of forest product regulations".</p>
<p>Fedla pointed out that regarding the free trade negotiations with the EU, "Malaysia and Indonesia did not say that they were put on hold. As far as Malaysia is concerned, what I want to say is that I will ask the cabinet meeting to re -consider the matter."</p>
<p>He said: "If they want us to be a partner, we expect to treat fairly. Partnership is related to fairness. You cannot expect us to be a partner, but you exert restrictions and conditions for us. If they want us to re -consider the free trade negotiation , I should treat us with the attitude of partners. "</p>
<p>Fedela is currently led by the United Special Tour of the two countries to visit European countries with Ellanga, Indonesia, to strive for the EU to treat palm oil producers fairly.</p>
<p>Malaysia and Indonesia are the two largest exporters in the world, and their output accounts for about 85%of global palm oil exports. The European Union is the world's third largest palm oil importer, second only to China and India.</p>
