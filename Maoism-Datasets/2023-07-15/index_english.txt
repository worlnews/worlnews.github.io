First, the stock market plummeted. In 2022, the S & P 500 index fell 18.1%throughout the year, setting the largest decline since the financial crisis in 2008. You know, in the 15 years from 2008 to 2022, the S & P 500 index was only one year (2018) fell (negative 4.4%), and all other years rose. The stock market is often called the barometer of the forecast economy, and the significant decline in the stock market reflects the pessimism and concerns of most investors in the market for the future of the US economy.

 "The Yellow River walks around the East China Sea, and Wanli writes into the chest and arms." Looking at the vast history of human economic development, there are always the magnificent and magnificent efforts that are not restricted to the times, meticulous, and magnificent. , The long -term power of the subtle way. In the past ten years, the "Belt and Road" initiative has been successful for a long time. By effectively improving the quality of infrastructure along the line, it has significantly reduced the trading costs of trading in the region, and then made positive contributions to the overall economic growth, and creatively enriched globalization. The connotation of the times; in the process, the "Belt and Road" initiative through optimizing the allocation of resource allocation not only did not deteriorate the risk of debt, but potentially boosted the debt repayment capacity of countries along the route. We carried out empirical research based on extensive data. The model results showed that from 2014 to 2022, the comprehensive quality of infrastructure along the “Belt and Road” increased by an average increase of 2.5 percentage points, which promoted the average decline in bilateral trade costs along the line by about 0.55 percentage points, which increased the development of developed developed along the line, respectively. Economy, emerging markets, and development of GDP growth in the economy of 0.50, 0.41 and 0.61 percentage points. While the impact of debt risk is not significant, the growth effect of the “Belt and Road” is strong and powerful in the future.
The quality of transportation and infrastructure along the “Belt and Road” can effectively reduce the cost of trade. Historical documents, changes in trade costs effectively explain why many countries around the world are difficult to form an export comparative advantage or trade competitiveness in the trade chain. Specifically, trade costs are usually regarded as trading costs between bilateral trading countries in empirical analysis of economics. Frankel & romer(1999)、Feyrer(2009)Studies by economists have shown that a country's effective reduction in transaction costs can improve the effectiveness of resource allocation in transaction activities, thereby further enhance the country's export competitiveness. At the same time, countries with better economic conditions often maintain lower transaction costs in trade activities. Regarding how to reduce transaction costs, mainstream economics puts forward specific policy suggestions on the three aspects of information costs, institutional costs and transportation costs. Based on the "Belt and Road" initiative, our research mainly focuses on transportation costs. It is believed that the improvement of infrastructure construction can ultimately reduce transaction costs in four aspects: First, the liberalization and convenience of infrastructure services can directly and indirectly reduce trade activities in trade activities. Information costs; second, the improvement of infrastructure will save significant logistics costs; the third is that the improvement of infrastructure quality can reduce the additional risks in the process of trade and transportation; the fourth, the facilitation of infrastructure will enhance the economic linkage and closeness of trading countries. In order to prove our logic, we estimate the impact of the improvement of the quality of transportation infrastructure on the cost of transaction for the country and regions of the “Belt and Road”. We carried out Taylor's expansion and variable replacement based on GravityModel, regarding the cost of trade as the explanatory variable, and the quality of traffic infrastructure (comprehensive national railway line, road line, shipping line, and aviation transportation lines along the "Belt and Road". , Light, comprehensive calculation estimation estimation) is regarded as interpretation variables. At the same time, the physical distance between the countries and regions along the Belt and Road ", the cost of customs clearance, whether it is neighbor, whether to use a common language, whether there is a colonial history, whether it is a complete inland country, and whether to enjoy the trade concession under the same trade agreement under the same trade agreement As a control variable. Through the linear (OSL) model estimation, it is found that the average quality of the traffic infrastructure of the trading countries along the “Belt and Road” has increased by 1 percentage point, which can reduce the trade cost of bilateral trade countries along the route by 0.20 percentage points. It is estimated to be estimated (Appendix 1) through non -linear (ML) models, and it is found that the average quality of traffic infrastructure of the trading countries along the “Belt and Road” increases by 1 percentage point, which can reduce the trade costs between bilateral trading countries along the route by 0.22 percentage points. Combined with the actual situation, according to the comprehensive infrastructure quality data of the World Bank (2023), from 2014 to 2022, the comprehensive quality of infrastructure in the country along the “Belt and Road” increased by 2.5 percentage points (Figure 1). Therefore, our model estimates bilateral trade costs along the line The average decrease of about 0.55 percentage points.

On the 13th, when the Hollywood Councilor Union announced that it would strike, the screenwriter union was also protesting outside the Netflix Los Angeles office.
(Voice of Germany Chinese) The important actor in Hollywood announced that it would be held on Thursday (July 13). Earlier that day, the final term of the "American Corporation and the United States Federation of Radio and Television Afftra" and the capital "Film and Television Producer Alliance" (AMPTP) reached an agreement. After a few hours after the contract expires and the negotiation breaks, the leadership of the actor union voted for a strike.
The executive director of SAG-AFTRA, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said at a press conference: "Strike is the last means." Starting at 7 am on the 14th), the strike began.
Shortly after the actor announced the strike, Hollywood's screenwriters gathered out of Netflix's office protest and shouted, "Pay for your actor!"
The actor union and the screenwriter trade union strike, and Hollywood will break the first double strike for more than 60 years.
Actors will join the screenwriter strike ranks 
This is the first time in the Hollywood film and television industry in the past 63 years, which may lead to a shutdown in film and television production. In May of this year, more than 11,000 movies and TV screenwriters strikes, interrupted a series of production systems for large -scale production.
As the actor will join the strike, Hollywood will perform the "double strike" for the first time since 1960. The members of the union seemed to attach great importance to the strike; on the 13th, the starring actor of "Oppenheimer" film officially announced a few hours before the union announced, leaving the premiere of London.
What happened to the negotiation process? 
On Wednesday (12th), in order to avoid the full stop of the industry, the trade union and the management conducted a final negotiation under the involvement of the mediation. Earlier, the actor union has stated that if it fails to reach an agreement before the Midnight (Greenwich Standard Time) at midnight (Greenwich Standard time), a strike will be held.
The actor union's statement stated: "After more than 4 weeks of negotiations, the film and television producer alliance ... still unwilling to reach a fair agreement on the issue of the perfection of the actor union members."
The film and television producer alliance advocates that the union has proposed a "historical significance" salary and later dividend increase, as well as measures such as the upper limit of pensions and the upper limit of medical insurance payment, and was disappointed with failure to reach an agreement. "This is the choice of union, not our choice."
The front-line stars such as Jennifer Lawrence and MERYLSTREEEP have expressed their support for the strike. This strike means that actors will not be able to promote new films, or participate in activities such as the Comic-Coninternational: San Diego next week.
The Sag-AFTRA union represents about 160,000 actors, television and radio hosts, and other media professionals.
The U.S. Council Conference held a press conference on the 13th.
What are the demands of actor? 
The trade union requires streaming media to provide higher compensation and claims to increase salary in response to inflation.
In addition, in addition to the salary of the actors, the works they starred in the Internet or cable TV will also get later dividends; however, the streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney+are not disclosed. The reward of the actors is uniform.
The actor also requested that for the use of artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/ai威脅堪比核戰東西方態度不同/a-65776612)There should be guarantee measures to ensure that the actors' digital images will not be used without permission.

Description: Biden reiterated his commitment to Ukraine and European allies, and once again evoked people's memories of the Cold War. However, the analysis believes that in the face of a weakened Russia and China that is more confused and more influential, today's geopolitical reality is more complicated. Doug Mills/The New York Times President Bynden arrived at Helsinki on Thursday to attend the press conference. At the meeting, he talked about "this critical moment in history. At this turning point, the whole world is concerned."

 President Biden and his national security team have been advocating since taking office. It is easy for people to compare this era with the Cold War. This is misleading and is excessive simplified to complex geopolitical moments.
The differences are indeed obvious: technology and financial interdependence is never before the United States and its Cold War opponent Soviet Union have never had it. This dependence has made the increasingly fierce and dangerous decline in the United States and China relations become more complicated.
Biden's consultant often argued that Russia was not the Soviet Union. They said that although Russia has nuclear weapons, its conventional military capabilities have now been severely weakened in Ukraine.
In the Soviet era, the United States felt that it was necessary to fight an ideological struggle around the world. In the new era, it is fighting against China's efforts to expand its influence by using its economic and technical power.
Despite this, the echo of the Cold War is getting louder and loud. This week, Biden himself also joined the hustle and bustle. Its allies will defend Ukraine and other European areas in Europe.
Biden never made it clear that the United States must once again "bear the burden of struggling in the long and dark" -This is the famous description of the Cold War in President Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. At that time, the Cold War had entered the most dangerous stage. But Biden's information is essentially the same.
"Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken," he said. "Today, tomorrow, no matter how long, we will defend freedom."
 Last month, the funeral team in Pleibra, Pleibra, the southeast of Ukraine, and Ukraine soldiers carried the coffin. Mauricio lima for the new york times
Sometimes, Biden's words will associate with the past at this moment -he compares Lithuania to fight for freedom with the struggle with Ukraine -but those who work with him said that his current dynamic analysis is that the potential is that the potential is that the potential is that the potential is that The power is very different.
"Fundamentally, there is still a challenge of aggression," said in an interview with President's national security adviser Jack Shalvin on Thursday's last stop Herxie. "Still need to come forward to defend sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom, and democracy.(Back To the Future)These elements will also appear. "
There is no clear statement during the summit, at least not publicly stated publicly, it is another main difference between 30 years ago: the support of the two parties for continuing to fight against Russian aggression is uncertain.
During the Truman government to Bush's ruling, the two major American parties are committed to defeating the geopolitical opponents of the United States, even if they have argued in strategy and whether they should be involved in local conflicts. It's not clear now. During the NATO Summit held in Vernus, regardless of the closeness of the Foreign Minister and assistant of all allies, when the current funding is used in the late summer, whether the US Congress will start to slow down the assistance to Ukraine.
They also asked that the two major Republican presidential candidates -former President Trump and Florida Governor Ron De Setis -how much the voice of the United States' involvement in war will possibly become popular among the wider people. Essence
"Americans are worried that Europe will be burnout," a senior European official who asked for anonymous European officials said during the Vilnis Summit. "We are worried that the United States will be burnout. Everyone is worried that Ukraines will exhaust their ammunition and air defense forces."
On Thursday, Bayeng was asked at the press conference with Finnish President Sharle Nonito. He responded that he "overwhelmed U.S. people to" overwhelming support for Ukraine and NATO. But then he said something unpopular: "No one can guarantee the future, but this is the best bet that anyone can make."

If the main melody of Biden's trip this week, it is that the West should be prepared for a long -term and high -cost confrontation. This confrontation will require intelligence and military forces to reach unprecedented cooperation and integration levels.
"At this critical moment of history, at this turning point, the whole world is watching us. In order to create a better future, will we make important efforts?" He said at a press conference. "Will we unite and support each other? Will we stick to our direction?"
Buried in the NATO bulletin is the cornerstone of the long struggle in order to welcome dawn. NATO has formulated a plan to increase national defense budget, but in NATO set the minimum military expenditure standard to 2%of the domestic GDP of each member country nearly ten years, Most of the richer Western European countries have not yet reached this goal Essence (The smaller former Soviet Union to join the Republic of the Soviet Union is better.) NATO has a plan to realize truly integrated military strategies, including the specific method of integrating network defense and increasing the production of conventional artillery shells. Few people think that Europe will need this again Cannonball.
However, officials said that the reality is that these changes are just the beginning. If the West and Russia have entered a state of hostility for several years or decades, these changes are not enough. Stoltenberg, who agreed to extend the term of NATO Secretary -General last week, acknowledged this reality in an article in the "Foreign Affairs" magazine.
"Even if the war is over tomorrow," he wrote when talking about Ukraine's conflict. "There was no sign that Putin's greater ambitions had changed. He regarded freedom and democracy as a threat and hoped to establish a great country to dominate neighboring countries. The world of behavior. This keeps him from fighting with the values and international law of NATO. "
In the context of this summit, there is also another factors that make it different from the Cold War era: China.
In the bulletin issued by Vernis, the risk of supply chain relies on suppliers such as China and other suppliers is widely discussed. This is a issue that NATO has rarely considered in the past.
Russian President Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Moscow in March. The photos were released by the Russian official media. Grigory Sysoev/SputnikMoreover, when Xi Jinping has so many more directly affecting China's future problems, he may hesitate whether he has to oil on another conflict with the United States. These issues include the impact of cutting off the supply of high -end computer chips that Chinese officials often complain, and Washington may impose new restrictions on the West's investment in key technologies (including artificial intelligence).

Of course, during the Cold War, there was no discussion about these issues, because there were almost no trade between the United States and the Soviet Union and did not produce any products relying on the other party.
"Fundamentally, the Cold War is not a particularly useful analogy," Shatin said. He listed the degree of "economic connection with the economy, the nature of technological competition, and the necessity of cooperating in global challenges across national borders. "" ".
"These are the fundamental driving factor that is fundamentally different from the current US -China relations and geopolitics and the Cold War."

 On Thursday, when John Kerry, a special envoy of President Bayeng, was about to go to Beijing and restarted the discussion between the two countries with the worst pollution in the world, Republicans had difficulty to him and criticized him for weak positions in China.
At a tense hearing held by the House of Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Republicans criticized Kerry for not doing enough to persuade China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, several parliamentarians also tried to depict Kerry as a negotiation with the largest economic opponent in the United States to place Chinese interests above the United States.
Crey is expected to arrive in China on Sunday for a three -day climate dialogue. He told Councilor that he believes that the Chinese government must reverse the use of the use of thermal power plants, which is one of the reasons for China to become the world's largest pollution country. However, he also expressed his appreciation for China's wind, solar energy, and other renewable energy deployment than the sum of other countries around the world.
Kerry said that although China and the United States have tensions on trade, human rights, and other issues, it is still significant to find a way to find a way for the two countries to reduce global emissions.
"China is the world's largest economy and the world's largest discharge country," Kerry said. He insisted that if the United States refuses to hold talks with China, it will be "the most serious diplomatic and political malfeasance."
As the Republican and some Democrats compete for a tough word for China, this hearing highlights the dilemma in the process of seeking cooperation with Beijing. There are almost not much initiative on the problem of faster action to reduce carbon emissions.
"What did the United States do on the question of forcing China to reduce emissions?" The Republican Republican Republican member Natanier Moran asked.
Kerry opposed the saying "forcing". He did not talk about what the United States would directly use (or there was no way) forced China to change the route, but he said that what the two countries really needed dialogue.
He also pointed out that parliamentarians are considering a bill similar to Europe, taxes and other products exported to countries such as China without strict climate law. "This has been promoted in legislation, because I think everyone is frustrated by the current situation," he said.
Republicans said that although China acknowledges that global emissions must be reduced, given that it has been investing in new thermal power plants, they expressed doubts about whether Kerry can talk about results.
"We have not seen them really come up with any mature solutions that can match the United States," Molan said.
Scientists claim that if China's emissions continue to rise, it will surpass the United States in the middle of this century, becoming a country with the most gas -emitted greenhouse gas since the beginning of the industrial age. All pollution brought by industrialization has led to an average heating of the earth 1.2 degrees Celsius.
Scientists say that the heating of 1.5 degrees Celsius is a threshold. If this number exceeds this number, the impact caused by drought, heat, wildfire, flood and other climate changes will exceed human adaptability.
China is listed as a developing country in the United Nations climate institution, which is another problem mentioned by the hearing. Because it is a developing country, China has decided to reduce emission reduction at a slower speed than the United States and Europe. China also believes that it should not bear the same financial obligations as the United States and Europe to help poor countries deal with climate impact.
China has stated that its emissions will continue to grow before 2030. It claims to achieve neutralization of atmospheric carbon emissions in 2060. President Biden promised that the United States would reduce emissions to half of 2005 at the end of the decade and stopped increasing carbon emissions in 2050.
"How exactly is the world's second largest economy who declare to you and the world that he is a developing country and wants you to give them preferential treatment?" Dezhou Representative Michael McCell asked.
Kerry said that he agreed to the Republicans' point of view that China should be regarded as a developed country, and this issue will be re -evaluated next year.
Various personal attacks also appeared at the hearing.
The Florida Republican Republican member Brian Master told Kerry that his "extreme left radio agenda cannot represent the United States of America."
Another Florida Republican member Kuri Mills sarcastically thanked Kerry for taking the time to take his "private plane".
Kerry said that Mills's remarks were "very stupid". He said that he had no private planes and traveling for commercial flights.
Scott Perry, a Republican member of the Pennsylvania, showed a chart that he claimed to prove that the world has not warmed. This prompted Kerry's view of the conclusion of the member of the lawmaker and the conclusions of the world's scientists "shocking."
Perry refuted "they are all liar as you, sir", which attracted the two parties' surprise.

 On Thursday, two institutions of the World Health Organization announced their research results on Asba sweet This is an artificial sweetener, which is used in thousands of sugar -free products, such as sugar -free soda, gum, yogurt and energy drinks.
The international cancer research institution under the WHO lists Asba sweet substances that may cause cancer. Another organizer committee of food additives said that there is no convincing evidence that there is a connection between Asba sweets with human cancer, and people can still safely consume such sweeteners in a safe amount.
The WHO experts stated at the press conference that this statement does not mean that Asba sweet will definitely cause cancer, but calls for more research on its health impact.
Dr. Francisco Blanca, director of the Nutrition and Food Safety Department of the World Health Organization, said that the World Health Organization does not recommend that the company withdraws from Asba sweet products and will not urge people to completely stop eating Asba. "We just recommend that the intake should be moderate," he said.

How many Asba is too much? 
According to the World Health Organization, it is safe to consume up to 40 mg of 40 mg of 40 mg per kilogram of weight per day. Taking sugar -free soda as the measurement standard, according to estimates, this means that a person weighing 68 kg needs to drink more than a dozen cans to exceed this limit.
US Food and Drug Administration (Referred to as FDA) The daily safety limit is slightly loose. It pointed out that people can consume up to 50 mg of Asta sweet per kilogram of weight per day.
A FDA official said that scientists at the agency are not worried about the use of Asba's sweetness under the conditions of "meeting".
The official wrote: "The International Cancer Research Institution has recorded the sweetness of Asba as‘ may be carcinogenic to humans ’, which does not mean that Asba’ s sweetness is actually related to cancer. ”
In view of the wide range of usage of sweeteners, several experts said that consumers do not have to worry about eating asiana's sweet cancer risk. Dr. Dell Shepade, a Cleveland Clinic, said that "daily intake does not" reach the daily sweet intake of Asba. "It's not so easy to get so many Asba sweets."
International Cancer Research Institutions believe that there may be carcinogenic substances?

The International Cancer Research Institutions recorded Asba Sweet as a "may cause cancer to humans", this category includes More than 300 viruses, chemicals, occupational exposure, etc. Some pickled vegetables , The engine exhaust gas, some types of human papilloma virus, and the work of dry cleaning belong to this category.
The newly selected Asba sweets into such limited evidence shows that this artificial sweetener is related to human liver cancer. There is no sufficient evidence that it can cause other cancers, and experts do not know the carcinogenic principle of this sweetener. The organization also found that the evidence related to animal cancer is limited.
In contrast, alcoholic drink It belongs to the most serious category, that is, "human carcinogen". International cancer research institutions will also pollute air pollution, tobacco and processing meat Line as human carcinogens.
"The bigger difficulty is that, like other additives, there is no enough scientific evidence to determine that Asba's sweetness is indeed carcinogenic 'or' not carcinogenic '," professor of nutritional science and policy of Nutrition Science and Policy of Tavz University Expert Darish Mozafarian said.
New York City Commemorative Slong Katelin Cancer Center Clinical Scientist and Medical Oncologist Neil Ayanger said that in the problem of reducing the risk of cancer, people should first consider other factors that may be more likely to cause cancer, such as obesity, drinking and alcohol Smoking.
How much do we know about other sweeteners?

There are many types of artificial sweeteners on the market, and their chemical structures are different. There are not many data about these sweets on healthy for a long time.
Joanni Slavin, a professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota, said that there is no clear result about which one is "the most beneficial".
WHO This spring said that artificial sweeteners such as Asba Sweet, Sweetan Sugar, Sinosaccharide, and Sodium Sodium may not have a fat reduction effect, and it may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and overall mortality after consumption. Calm -alcohol -alcohol glycol alcohol has recently attracted attention due to its possible connection with cardiovascular disease, although the relevant evidence is not concluded Essence
Some health experts suggest that although difficulty It may be very high, but artificial sweeteners should be gradually eliminated in diet. "If they have no benefits, they are not necessities in their diet, and they will not bring real benefits. Why should they be consumed?" Said Marine Nestle, a professor of nutrition, video research and public health in New York University. Essence
But sugar itself also has hidden health hazards. Any food that continues to raise blood sugar may bring problems, especially when you have diabetes or other metabolic disorders. American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention It is believed that it is often related to sugary drinks (such as ordinary soda) and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity and other health problems.

The picture shows the German Prime Minister Salz met with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang in Berlin on June 19.
(Voice of Germany Chinese) The German government announced the first "China Strategy](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国政府推出对华战略合作但减少依赖/a-66221218)", Set China as" partners, competitors and institutional opponents ", and seek cooperation while calling for Risk of reducing dependence Essence For this strategy for China, experts have proposed different analysis Essence
Zsuzsa Annaferenczy, a former European Parliament Political Consultant and Assistant Professor of Donghua University in Taiwan, believes that this is a tough, clear and detailed strategy that exceeds her expectations. She told DW that Germany, as an important member of the European Union, has a pivotal position in China. "Because this is not only Germany's own policy of China, but also affects How the EU responds to China "".
Feng Risha believes that this shows that Germany's strategy of "Europeanization" in China is "European", and Germany wants to align with the EU in response to China. She said, "Only when a member state cooperates, the European Union can successfully deal with China." The Russian and Ukraine War also let Beijing see that Europe is united without unprecedentedly, and Beijing should be prepared. She added that how this tough strategy has played a role in reality and whether it will be implemented in place. It remains to be observed.
Wu Qiang, an independent scholar of Beijing and a lecturer at the Department of Political Science, Original Tsinghua University, also held a similar view. He told DW that this document was in NATO Summit In the context of the background, it can be regarded as the "tacit understanding" of German and NATO member states. It not only emphasizes that Germany and China relations should be based on international order, but also mentioned human rights and Taiwan issues.
Wu Qiang pointed out that how to deal with China is not only a problem in Germany, but also a problem in the entire democratic world; this strategy, as a model for the democratic world to China, can imagine its difficulty. He believes that after 500 days after the Russian and Ukraine War started, this strategy "the way to get along with the interaction between the democratic world and China" gave the world a answer that was relatively clear, but still relatively clear and strongly demonstrated -the West and the West and the West and and Between China is a managed and controllable relationship.
He commented that the three aspects of competition, cooperation, and confrontation between the "Teaching and War Code" in Germany all showed possibilities. "This is a model with a perfect realism in principle. The rest is how to perform."

On July 13, 2023, the German Federal Cabinet passed the first strategy of relationship with China. According to the document, Germany will continue to communicate and cooperate with China, and at the same time, it should "reduce the dependence of key areas." The German government will increase the sensitivity of society to the risk of China, strengthen exchanges with enterprises, and remind enterprises to do a good job of risk control. The document also emphasizes that it is unacceptable to unilaterally changing the status quo of the Taiwan Strait. The upgrade of military conflict in the Taiwan Strait will affect the interests of Germany and the European Union.

is not equal? 
Compared to the affirmation of this strategy, Jürgen Hardt, a foreign policy spokesman of the German opposition Christian Democracy (CDU), believes that the content of this strategy is not perfect.
Hart told DW that Germany should take this opportunity to understand the common position of allies in the face of Chinese challenges and reach a consensus on "how to deal with trade relations with China." If North America, Europe, Britain, Japan and South Korea can unite the front, it will be difficult for China to ignore the voice of the free world.
In addition, Hart believes that the West should use its influence on Beijing to do more things, such as using German economic power to encourage China to abandon the practice of not in line with fair trade.
For example, Chinese state -owned company has recently acquired part of the equity of the Hamburg Port Pier "If China can invest in the Western world, such as buying part of Hamburg Port, why is it impossible for European German companies to buy part of the port of Port China?" He believes that if China does not allow Hamburg Port to buy part of Shanghai Port, China It should be forbidden to buy part of the Hamburg Port. "This may be the specific result of this strategy. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's office is opposed."
Feng Risha said that in the relationship with China, the EU cares about "reciProcity" and fairness, and this strategy mentioned the word "equivalent" 6 times, which does reflect this.
Hamburg Port "Blessing Land" to attract Chinese capital is a blessing or a disaster? 
China's response 
The German News Agency reported that major German business groups generally welcomes the strategy and supports the government's positions that are not "decoupled" with the Chinese economy. The German Industry Federation Chairman SiegfriedrussWurm admits that German companies have also felt the increasingly tense relationship between the West and China in recent years, but China, as the world's second largest market, is still an important economic partner in Germany.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also responded on the 14th, "The lines of the so -called‘ institutional, interests, and values ’spokesmanship with values and ideology are moved against the trend of the times, which will only exacerbate the division of the world.” He also pointed out that "in fact, the consensus between China and Germany is far more than differences, and the cooperation is much greater than competition. The two sides are partners and not opponents."
Chinese independent scholar Wu Qiang pointed out that there are many coincidences in interests between China and Germany However, as long as it involves politics and human rights, the differences between the two sides will grow bigger and bigger. He believes that this strategy for China has not covered up. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock even said that in 2020 China -Europe Investment Agreement Inconsistent, "this is huge for China" and it will also disappoint the Chinese leadership, "because it does not realize Li Qiangyou said (what it wants to achieve)."
Feng Risha believes that after the strategy is disclosed, China may criticize the German side "unfairness" and "the essence of China." She pointed out that the strategy of China showed that "China has changed", so the relationship between Germany and China is also necessary. In this strategy, cooperation with China is still the basic element; although the two sides have a political difference in politics, in order to truly contact China, Germany must work together, so China should not interpret it as offensive.
German Foreign Minister Berbque went to Beijing to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in April.
All 
This strategy emphasizes that Germany should expand its relationship with Taiwan and warn China not to take any force invasion of Taiwan. However, the "One China Policy" is still the basis of Germany, and Germany only has formal diplomatic relations with China.
Feng Risha said that this strategy mentioned the length of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, which surprised her, but also made a "useful" reiteration and fixed tone of the dental relations.
She pointed out that China continues to "wrongly claims that cooperation with Taiwan has violated the" one China principle ", and the strategy once again puts the cooperation between Germany and Taiwan into the framework of the" One China Policy "and declares from the highest level. "One China Policy" sets the boundaries and refuted false allegations from Beijing, reiterating Germany and Taiwan exchanges The foundation and rights.
Germany's strategy to China also mentioned the Taiwan Strait issue (schematic diagram).
The spokesman of the CDU said that any invasion in China will completely change the relationship between Beijing and the West, and Chinese leaders will not take the risk of damage to the trade relationship: "The reason why the Communist Party's dictatorship can exist It is because they have promoted the economic development of the country. If not, the Chinese government will harm the foundation of its power. I think they will not do so. "
In response to the repeated diverse human rights issues between Germany and China, scholar Wu Qiang said that Germany is alerting to "China's aggressive () trend in the world"; Feng Rusha further pointed out that although Beijing has always refused to discuss human rights on the grounds of "internal affairs", But Germany is playing a leading role as a bargaining chip to promote important issues that EU pay attention to human rights such as human rights through this strategy. She believes that this strategy shows that "because Germany is closely related to China, (so the German) federal government has special responsibilities in maintaining human rights and maintaining European economic interests."

Ant Group was fined 7.1 billion, Ali's stock price rose up, or was the normalization of supervision? 
July 14, 2023 Image source, getty images
On July 7, the three main financial regulatory bureaus of the three main financial regulatory bureaus of the three main financial regulatory bureaus of the People's Bank of China, the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the Ant Group and its institutions were fined 7.123 billion yuan, and their "mutual treasures were mutually treasures. "business. 
At the same time, it was also punished. Tencent's "Tenpay" was warned that it confiscated 566 million yuan in illegal income and a fine of 2.427 billion yuan.
In November 2020, the Chinese fintech giant Ant Group originally planned "the largest IPO in history", dramatic and shocking messages followed, causing public opinion uproar. In the past three years, China's regulatory layers have made strong supervision and rectification of domestic financial technology giants.
The penalty decision was issued for less than an hour, and the Ant Group announced that "sincerely accepts, resolutely obey it, and will further consolidate the level of compliance with the control level."
The above -mentioned financial regulatory agencies also stated that they have promoted the rectification of financial business in the platform enterprise, and the focus of work has been transferred to normal supervision.
Ant listing: pricing out of pricing or the largest IPO in history, China and the United States to highlight the risk of Chinese enterprises to go to the sea China Management and Control Internet Giant's anti -platform economic monopoly China Anti -Monopoly: The rapid expansion of Internet giants leads to dense strikes 
Why was punished 
There are seven Alipay "guilt" given by the regulators, such as violating consumer financial information protection management regulations; violations of financial consumer rights protection management regulations.
The Zhejiang Provincial Securities Regulatory Bureau also proposed that Ant violated the relevant provisions of fund sales, publicity, and archival management in terms of fund sales; violations of the management of personnel management and internal control of fund sales institutions.
The reasons for the penalty of Tencent's Tenpay are similar.
Ant and Tenpay have carried out personal consumer financial products such as "Huayan", "Borrowing", and "Metropolitan Loan". In recent years, such products have been repeatedly criticized in China, accused of encouraging excessive consumption, and increasing financial systemic risks.
These products use fast approval, unsecured, high quota, cash rebate and other methods to attract consumers to use.
For consumers, it is easy to fall into the consumer financial trap under the flood of online loans. For example, the Chinese media reported that a Nanjing college student applied for 56 online loans within a year and was unable to repay. Under the pressure of debt regulation, he chose to live light.

For the entire economy, online micro -loan business companies have pushed a lending loan far beyond their own contributions through high leverage, and pushed up high systemic risks.
At the end of 2020, China's regulatory layer announced the new regulations, and strictly limited the leverage used by online micro -loan business companies. For example, financing through non -standard forms must not exceed 1 times of net assets, and financing through standardized form must not exceed 4 times more than 4 times ; For another example, in a single joint loan, the proportion of small loan companies that carry out online small loan business shall not be less than 30%.
Earlier, ants did not meet this request. Before the rectification, the Ant Group pushed the joint loan model, which was based on the two subsidiaries and financial institutions (banks, trusts) jointly funded loans, of which the Ant subsidiary contributed a small amount according to the agreed proportion.
In 2020, Ant disclosed in the prospectus published before it was listed that in the first six months of that year, the total proportion of financial institutions for lending or realized asset securitization was about 98%. In this way, ants have leveraged nearly 2 trillion yuan in joint loans through 36 billion yuan in assets, but they only bear less risks.
The business logic behind it is that the ants are inferred in traffic, and risk control through customer data. In this way, more than 100 Chinese commercial banks have taken the Ant's large ship. The regulatory layer is worried that once the ship is overwhelmed, it will cause unbearable economic consequences.
In contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in the world, credit card receivables and personal consumption loans are less than one trillion yuan.
After being punished, the stock price rose sharply 
Chinese financial scholar Tang Ya wrote that the Ant Group's punishment means that "platform rectification" has entered a normal stage; Yellen's visit to China means that Sino -US relations have entered the platform period from large landslides. Both things have the same inherent clues- "Song", so even if the data of CPI and PPI this week are miserable, the market does not have a negative response.
As far as individual stocks are concerned, even if the Ant Group is not listed, Alibaba, which is highly related to it, is eye -catching in the US stocks. After receiving the ticket, Alibaba responded to 9%.
The operating logic of the capital market is generally "fulfilling expectations". Although ants are punished, they are interpreted by the market as "the sky is empty."
The consulting company Techmoat partner Jeffreytowson is very optimistic about the development of ants. He said that as the supervision issues that mainly affect domestic payment business and credit business have been resolved, ants will usher in the development prospect of "dream -like". Moreover, Alipay is advancing internationalization. Ant's technical services also have a good position in the B2B contract.
In fact, after the ants were stopped, Alibaba's stock price has been hovering at a low level. Even after this rising, it is not half the issue price of its issue price.
In this round of rectification, it is not only for Ant Group, but also consumer financial products launched by major Internet platforms such as Tencent, Baidu, JD.com, Bydium beating, Meituan, Didi, etc.
However, there are also opinions that this round of rectification originated from a speech by the actual controller of the ant at that time.

In 2011, Jack Ma stripped Alipay from Alibaba Group on the grounds that Alipay's financial license was required to return to domestic capital.The "pawnshop thought" he called means that traditional financial business requires mortgage to issue loans, and digital finance uses big data to directly issue loans after credit rating. He criticized traditional finance as "pawnshop thought" and "harmed many entrepreneurs".
Jack Ma also criticized that the "Basel Agreement" is an elderly club. The agreement refers to the international bank agreement that requires a certain proportion between the capital of various countries and the total assets of the risk of risks to reduce credit risk.
One week after his speech, the State Council of the State Council of the State Council of the State Council held a special conference on a special meeting and pointed out: "The current rapid development of fintech and financial innovation must deal with the relationship between financial development, financial stability and financial security ... Incorporate supervision and effectively prevent risks. "
On the same day, the media in charge of the Central Bank of China reproduced scholars' articles that some large technology companies did not need to accept prudent supervision at the beginning of their establishment, but later absorbed public deposits in disguise. The scholar named the Ant Group, saying that he had received a lot of financial business licenses, and could carry out a similar deposit and loan business as a bank.
In less than a week, the regulators interviewed Ma Yun and stopped the ants to go public. At the same time, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the central bank jointly issued the "Interim Measures for the Management of Online Small Loan Business (Draft for Soliciting Opinions)".
The above measures have strictly restricted the leverage used by online micro -loan business companies. The meaning of ants is very strong, and it has guided companies such as ants. Since then, the Wall Street Journal reported that the ants listed on the market were stopped by Xi Jinping himself. In addition, during the epidemic, Ma Yun was almost dormant abroad, and even public opinion worried that the Chinese economy began to "enter the country and retreat"?

ants whether to go public again 
As the boots land, does the Internet industry go out of the regulatory period and return to normal?
Another signal is that two days after the ticket was released, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang presided over a platform for a platform for a platform for a platform for the platform economy to provide a new space for the expansion of demand. Public services provide new support.
The above -mentioned "Four Xin" new fares have discussed many discussions among Internet practitioners. However, from the capital level, the valuation of Internet companies is not as good as before, and the market confidence has not been repaired.
In this situation, if the ants do not seek to go on the market, it will be valued for geometry?
Two days before receiving the ticket, the Ant Group opened a round of equity repurchase and used its own funds to repurchase the equity of no more than 7.6%from the existing shareholders.
According to the repurchase plan, the corresponding valuation of the Ant Group was 567.1 billion yuan, while the valuation of the IPO in 2020 exceeded 2 trillion yuan, shrinking to a quarter of the time.
"I don't think the decline in valuation will hinder the listing of ants because it is already a different company," said Singapore's research institution Aequitas Research. "
"In addition, many other technology giants have also experienced significant adjustments in the past two years, not only the ants. As regulatory dust is settled, investors can be more convinced that ants will not face regulatory disadvantages in the short term," he explain.

 In the past ten years, "strategic autonomy" is a word frequently mentioned in the EU's important official documents and member states leaders in public.
It is generally believed that the "strategic autonomy" emphasized by Europeans refers to Europe to maintain independence in Sino -US competition and not choose the side station easily, and to become an important one to represent European interests, European values and European power in the global order Essence However, why the European Union emphasized "strategic autonomy" in the past ten years, this problem has not been well understood.

The two of them appeared at the conference hall of a hotel in Jakarta and shook hands in front of the Chinese flags of China and the United States.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release on Friday (14th), advocating the most important thing is the "Return to Bali Island". In November last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the US President Biden met at the Bali venue at the Bali Summit in Bali of the 20th of the G20; Wang Yi said that the United States should reflect on the relationship between the relationship between the two sides into severe difficulties, which prompted the two parties to take Battle Battle Battle.

Bringsken: I held an important talks with President Xi Jinping 
Qin Gang is absent due to health reasons 
This is the second time that Brintken and Wang Yi met within a month. Brinken visited Beijing in mid -June , Became the first US Secretary of State, who visited China for the first time in the past five years. He met Xi Jinping, Wang Yi and foreign ministers Qin Gang at the time.
The ASEAN meeting was originally scheduled to be attended by Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. But the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that due to Qin Gang's "Health Reason" , Wang Yidai attended.
After visiting China, US Treasury Secretary Yellen also visited Beijing last week Essence In addition, the American Climate Special Envoy Cry also has a trip to China. However, so far, the United States has not yet realized resumed dialogue with the Chinese military The key goal, and dialogue is considered the key to avoid confrontation.
For a period of time, the relationship between the two largest economies of China and the United States has become increasingly tense because of a series of problems. These problems include China's increasing attitude in the Asia -Pacific region and the comprehensive restrictions on the implementation of advanced semiconductor exports in the Asia -Pacific region.

Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line 
The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be in the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.

Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.

Brinken told Wang Yimei that he would investigate the hacking emissions email * Yellen ended a press conference before visiting China: This trip helps stable US -China relations US State Department spokesman Miller(MatthewMiller)Said that Brintken and Wang Yi met with a series of bilateral, regional and global issues, frank and constructive discussions, including differences and potential cooperation areas. Brinken emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.

Brinken clearly stated that the United States will promote the vision of freedom, openness, and rule -based international order with allies and partners.
 
Chen Wenjia, a senior consultant of the National Institute of National Policy in Taiwan, said in an interview with this station that Taiwan is an important indicator of the United States to realize the opening and freedom of the Indo -Pacific region, and it is also an important base for curbing the expansion of China's hegemony. For China, it has repeatedly emphasized that Taiwan is the core of its core interests. "Obviously, Taiwan highlights the strategic position in the Sino -US game."
American climate special envoy Kerry is about to visit China 
After Blint and US Treasury Secretary Yellen successively visited China, Johinkerry, a US climate, will also visit Beijing on the 16th. Before the visit, Kerry said at Congress Hearing that climate issues were one of the many issues that Bayeng government tried to cooperate with China. He emphasized that the United States will not make any concessions.
Political commentators Cai Shenkun told this station that the Bayeng government now also hopes that US -China relations will ease, and don't be too intense. However, Chinese hacker attacks the emails containing the US government agencies in multiple organizations. Blingken is responsible and needs to show attitudes. And Wang Yi had touched the United States during the past period of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Lord, and the recent meeting seemed to see that his attitude was soft.
"Now China's domestic politics and economy no longer allows the crazy image of the past five years, and must maintain contact or restore a certain relationship with the United States. Otherwise, China's political and economic environment will only be more severe." Cai Shenkun commented.
China's urgent desire to reach the "South China Sea Behavior Guidelines" Island Reef Militaryization Doubt 
In addition to meeting with Blint, Wang Yi also attended China-ASEAN on the 13th(10+1)Foreign Minister Club. According to a press release issued by the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, China promised to adhere to the "Declaration of the South China Sea" and strive to reach the "South China Sea Conduct" as soon as possible to better maintain the peace and stability of the South China Sea. The press release said, "China and ASEAN are always neighbors, partners, and brothers and sisters."Chen Wenjia pointed out that 7 years ago, the international court rejected the claim of the so -called South China Sea's "Nine Section Line" in the South China Sea arbitration case, which was more beneficial to the Philippines and other countries. However, in the past 7 years, the relevant ruling cannot be effectively implemented, and China still has room for operation.
Chen Wenjia: "China will use the South China Sea Code of Conduct, the first as a restraint, and the second to strive to negotiate with the South China Sea Sound of the country. After all, sovereignty and economic and economic benefits are very important for China. Safety attracts ASEAN. China will inevitably increase the "Belt and Road" economic lure ASEAN countries. In this area, it not only involves geopolitical security, but also includes geographical interests. "
Cai Shenkun also believes that the focus of the US India's strategic transfer strategy is an imminent problem for China to reach the "South China Sea Conduct" with ASEAN countries. Most Southeast Asian countries are unwilling to have a stiff relationship with China, so the key is whether Chinese seniors are willing to make concessions on the South China Sea issue.

Two organizations associated with the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Friday (July 14) that the sweetener Asba sweet is "possible carcinogenic substances", but consumption is still safe at the aggregated level.
Reuters reports that Aspartame is one of the most popular sweeteners in the world. It uses it from Coca -Cola sugar -free soda to Mars ’Extra chewing gum and other products.
The WHO Independent Expert Group evaluates whether there is any evidence to indicate that a certain substance has potential harm, and another expert group evaluates the real risk of the substance.
The Secretary for Nutrition and Health and Development of the WHO Headquarters in the Geneva headquarters, before issuing a statement of the two expert groups, trying to help consumers understand the seemingly contradictory position of the expert group.
"If the choice faced by consumers is, I should drink cola with the cola with a sweetener, and I think the third choice should be considered -that is to drink boiled water."
The International Cancer Research Agency (IARC), headquartered in Lyon, issued a statement saying that Asba is sweet as a "possible carcinogen." The so -called "Possible Cancer" refers to a certain substance that can cause cancer.
IARC's assessment does not consider how much Asba's sweetness is needed for a person to consider; and the amount of intake is the Food Additive Joint Expert Committee (JECFA) under the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) (JECFA) The expert group considers.
After a comprehensive review of the Food Additive Joint Expert Committee, it was announced on Friday that no convincing evidence showed that the sweetness of Asba was harmful, and it continued to recommend that people's daily intake of Asba was controlled. Level below 40 mg.
This is consistent with the level set by the Food Additives Joint Expert Committee in 1981, and regulators around the world have similar guidelines.
Several scientists who did not participate in the evaluation believed that the evidence that Asba sweets were linked with cancer were weak. The Food and Beverage Industry Association said that the assessment of the WHO Independent Expert Group shows that Asba is safe, for people who want to reduce sugar in diet, Asba is a good alternative choice.

 709 lawyer Wang Quanzhang was forced to move, and the public security continued to harass at home for various reasons. It was forced to move 13 times in the past two months, which caused a large report on international media. Li Wenzu Twitter Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd 07102023150148.html/@@stream In the 2015 "709 arrest", many rights protection lawyers and democrats were imprisoned. Although these arrested people have been released from prison in recent years, the authorities have not stopped their suppression of them.
Recently, Wang Quanzhang, a lawyer in the 709 case, continued to be suppressed and persecuted by the authorities. According to Radio Free Asia, from 2015 to 2021, the Wang Quanzhang family has been forced to relocate many times. In the past two months, they have been forced to move frequently in Beijing. The whole family is exhausted. The residence was not only disconnected from the water, the grass -roots public security also smashed the door at night, rushing into the house to provoke, challenging the landlord to disassemble the door of the rental house where they lived. Wang Quanzhang's wife, Li Wenzu, was interviewed and said that the child was sick because of being frightened and was forced to separate from his parents, and was created physically and mentally. Wang Quanzhang also revealed that after the power -offs, the camera on the door was covered with a spray gun. In an interview, Wang Quanzhang pointed out that not only is the family being power out of power, but also a large number of unknown people are blocked outside the door. They do not allow the supplies to come in. There are even minors among the harassing people. He said that once the supplies are interrupted, the next life will be in succession, and he does not know how long he can hold. In addition to Wang Quanzhang and Li Wenzu, Li Heping and his family in Beijing have also been expelled from violence, and have been forced to move 8 times so far. Not only that, the Li Heping and Wang Qiaoling family were also prohibited from exiting by the authorities in the name of "possibly endangering national security."
As we all know, the Chinese Communist Party has always continued to suppress the basic rights of domestic democratic people, but after the sentence is full, they have oppressed their lives, so that the rights protection lawyers and objections cannot live in the society normal, and even threatened their minor children. Rarely. Especially after the Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong came to power, taking a new approach to objections including 709 lawyers, not only used the case of unjust cases to attack them, but also let them go in life and completely defeat their will to fight. This kind of " The idea of not allowing people to survive is a new model of the CCP's persecution of human rights. This is a very dangerous signal that must attract great attention from the international community and governments. Overseas democratic movements have also launched support a few days ago. The co -scholarship believed in Beijing Mayor Yin Yong, Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong and Beijing Public Security Director Yuan Yanjun, calling on the authorities to stop the political persecution and relocation of the two lawyers Wang Quanzhang and Li Heping of 709 cases Wang Quanzhang and Li Heping. And side control.
In recent years, the issues of human rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and other places should not be ignored by the outside world and international human rights agencies, but the international community should not ignore the human rights situation in Mainland China that is accelerating. According to the British "Guardian" report, the NGO of New Zealand's "Human Rights Evaluation initiative" (HRMI), headquartered in New Zealand, has been monitoring human rights performance of various countries since 2017. According to the latest reports, China is the worst human rights record in the world on many indicators. In terms of arbitrarily arrests, only Kazakhstan scores lower than China. It is no exaggeration to say that China is the worst country in global human rights. For example, Yu Wensheng, a lawyer who was released from prison last year, was invited to meet with his wife Xu Yan in mid -April. More than a month later, the family members officially received the notice of the authorities. The two were arrested for alleged provocation. In the more than a month when Yu Wensheng's husband and wife were disappeared, their sons have been strictly taken care of, not allowed to contact others, friends want to visit, and their parents take care of them are also blocked. This connected persecution mode has a mean means. The Chinese Communist Party's intensified suppression of human rights should attract enough attention and attention in the international community.

Many media reports that when Western countries are working hard to deal with inflation, China is facing a tightening of currency (schematic diagram).
(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Many media recently reported that when Western countries are working hard to deal with inflation, China is facing currency tightening Essence However, China People's Bank of China Vice President Liu Guoqiang refuted this statement on Friday (July 14).
"There is no shrinking at present, and there will be no in the second half of the year." 
According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, Liu Guoqiang stated at a press conference at the News Office of the State Council that compared with the high inflation scene of other countries, China's prices are relatively smooth and in recent months. There are obvious differences in tightening, and there is no deflation in the second half of the year.
According to Chinese official data, China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to zero in June, which not only set a new low since February 2021, but also touched the deflection division point. The Wall Street Journal states that since the past two quarters, many economic indicators in China have continued to fall in downturn, and the property market has been in traffic. It has been in sharp contrast to the rapid rebound of economic rebounds that appeared due to the "clear zero" policy before. It has also begun to become weaker, which triggered China is about to fall into a shrinking dilemma Essence
The British "Financial Times" reported that the French Foreign Trade Bank (Natixis) Chief Asia-Pacific economist Alicia Garciaherrero said that China's domestic demand is indeed weak and the market is very negative.
China's economy has continued to weaken, the unemployment rate has soared, and the market mood is sluggish (diagram).
However, Liu Guoqiang emphasized that China's economy has long been better for a long time The fundamentals have not changed. The current challenge is the normal phenomenon in the process of economic recovery after the epidemic. He expressed optimism about China's economic prospects, saying that economic cycle and residential income, and consumption have begun to improve, and with the appearance of the policy, the supply and demand gap will be further failed. He expects that the CPI is expected to gradually rise after August, and the overall trend of CPI in China is expected to be U -shaped throughout the year; the price level of the year will fall first and then rise, and it is expected to move closer to 1%at the end of the year.
The Wall Street Journal pointed out that Liu Guoqiang's remarks explained that China will continue to relax monetary policy.
On the 17th, China will announce the data of GDP in the second quarter (GDP) data, or can provide more clues about China's economic conditions.
Why does the outside world say that China "retracted the trend"? 
Financial experts of Barclays believe that China has fallen into a "difficulty in a shrinking atmosphere." Linking means that prices generally fall, leading to a spiral development of sales, salary and investment comprehensive decline, which brings catastrophic consequences to the economy.
"Financial Times" analyzed the cause of Chinese shrinking on the 13th. It is reported that China and other countries are also seeking loose currencies and fiscal policies to cope with the negative impact of the epidemic on the economy. The Chinese government conducted measures such as bonds and low interest rates from 2020 to 2022. In terms of fiscal stimulus measures, it is targeted at infrastructure expenditure and enterprises to reduce tax reduction and reduce the proportion of social security in the salary of people's salaries, as well as other other social security ratios, and other other social security, as well as other Avoid unemployment measures.
Under the epidemic, Chinese economy is asthmatic 
In contrast, the United States has launched a larger -scale fiscal and currency stimulus plan, allowing consumers to directly receive subsidies and unemployment relief funds.
The report also pointed out that strict, long -term epidemic prevention and control policy It also allows China to unemployment rate soaring Caused serious damage to the household's balance sheet, and the collapse of the housing market also hit the price of commodity, which reduced the price inflation of producers. In terms of public departments, many places in China local governments are in debt dilemma ; The private sector has overcapacity and weak consumer demand But unwilling to invest.
According to the report, if such a trend of shrinkage leaves a deep impression, it will further curb investment in corporate investment, while consumers will reduce expenditure because they are worried that work is not guaranteed and housing prices will continue to decline, and the consumption recovery will further lose their motivation.

Drai Xue said that the union is still willing to negotiate, but provided that the production company "is willing to respect our work and make normal dialogue with us."
The actor's strike will begin at midnight on Thursday time in Los Angeles. One hour after the strike was started, the actor will gather outside the US streaming giant Netflix headquarters to protest. After that, the strike actor will be transferred to ParamountpicTures, Warner brothers and Disney companies to protest.
The "Alliance of Motion Picture and TelevisionPropers" (AMPTP) on behalf of the Hollywood company (AMPTP) expressed his "regret" to the SAG-AFTRA union decision. " Thousands of people who rely on the Hollywood industry are in economic difficulties. "
The three -year contract signed by the American Television and Broadcasting Artist Federation with Hollywood Corporation expired at 11:59 pm on Wednesday. The two sides agreed to extend the contract to June 30 to continue negotiations. However, the two sides have differences on a series of issues, including salary and artificial intelligence, which leads to the breakdown of negotiations.

Fukushima nuclear waste water: In the face of scientific data, local residents are still afraid of "invisible enemies" 
July 14, 2023 Image adding text,
Fishermen from Fukushima County are concerned that the discharge of nuclear waste water will extend the stigma of local fisheries.
In a place where the Fukushima first nuclear power plant that has been scrapped on the east coast of Japan, in a laboratory called "Tarachine", Kimura loves to wear white coats and white gloves to cut a fish. 
Miss Kimura and her volunteer team collect fish samples from the waters around the nuclear power station four times a year. The devastating tsunami in 2011 drowned the reactor, causing radioactive leaks. A few months later they established this laboratory, and since then, they have been doing this work.
It's just that Miss Kimura is not a scientist -all female members in this non -profit laboratory she led by her are not. The laboratory's name "Tarachine" is taken from the term "mother" in ancient Japanese. Miss Kimura said that after that tsunami, the shocking local residents opened this laboratory to figure out what to eat for their children was safe. Because it was difficult to find information about radiation risks at that time, they asked technical experts to train them, learn to detect radioactive substances and record readings, while raising funds and starting themselves.
This is a decision that may have never thought of a nuclear power plant accident that may occur after being devastated. Now, 12 years have passed, and they have found it again that it is difficult for them to believe in the Japanese government because the government insists that it is safe to discharge processed radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean.

BBC reporter Shaimaa Khalil see the processing of the Fukushima nuclear power plant (English video)
Earlier this month, Japan got green lights that started pumping through wastewater. These water used to cool the melting reactor, with more than 1 million tons -equivalent to 500 Olympic standard swimming pools. Now it has accumulated more than 1,000 tanks, and the reserves are full. Water needs to find local emissions.
Japan's nuclear power regulatory agency has approved the TEPCO company to operate the power station for drainage. Rafaelgrossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the two -year evaluation of the supervisor found that the plan meets international standards The processed wastewater "can be ignored on the radioactivity of people and the environment." Although neighboring South Korea has also given similar evaluations, some Japanese foods are still prohibited. China and Hong Kong have also announced similar ban Essence
However, residents living in Fukushima and surrounding areas do not believe in this statement.

Volunteers of Tarachine laboratory collect samples from the waters around the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station.
"We still don't know how to deal with pollution wastewater. This is why we oppose emissions," Miss Kimura said. She also said that many local families are worried about the emissions of these wastewater.
Tokyo Electric Power Corporation has been filtering water to remove more than 60 radioactive substances, but water will not be completely free of radiation. It contains 碳 and carbon-14, which are radioactin of hydrogen and carbon, which cannot be easily removed from the water. However, experts say they will not constitute danger unless a large number of intakes, because the radiation level they release is very low. This is why the filtered water will pass another treatment phase before being excreted -dilute it with seawater to reduce the concentration of residual substances.
The Japanese government said that by the end of the filtering and testing procedures, these processed water will not be different from the water released by nuclear power plants around the world.
"Invisible enemies" 
But in Fukushima, the opposite of these facts is fear. Here, radiation is called "invisible enemies", and people often cannot forget its existence.
After the disaster, the government announced that it was 30 kilometers (22 miles) around the nuclear power plant as the restricted area, and more than 150,000 people were evacuated. Although it has changed a lot, many blocks are still empty and empty, and the long -abolished house roof and windows are covered with green plants. The shop's signboard has faded, but the metal fence and the yellow warning line are still blocked on the empty narrow streets.
Even the existence of the "Tarachine" laboratory proves the fear of the community's invisible enemies, even if they have been guaranteed, this is not the case.

Nakamura Ai detect sample radiation in the laboratory.
In the main laboratory, one volunteer is cutting cabbage, and then measures the gamma radiation, and another volunteer is processed before testing the water sample. In the corridor, there is a bag of dust samples, a vacuum cleaner used from nearby families. In the innermost room, food samples should be dried before radiation testing. On the wall, charts and maps in nuclear power plants and surrounding waters are marked with the degree of radiation and the scope of spread with various colors.
These women will collect samples and detect various materials sent by locals. "Some families bring us rubber (testing)," Miss Kimura said. "In Japan, we will use toothpicks and rubber as gyro. The government will not consider testing these. The level of radiation. "
The laboratory will detect radioactive substances in various samples, such as 锶 -90, 氚, and radium-134 and 137, and track its content level for many years.
"We will upload all discovery to our website and let everyone find it," Miss Kimura said. "We have been able to confirm that in the food we test, the radioactive substances gradually decrease. If they discharge waste water, it will eventually reverse the status quo achieved under the power of nature."
She regards this controversial plan as a big step back. She said that the disaster in 2011 still had "lingering emotional trauma", and this decision was to unveil these scars.
Experts said that this two -year plan is a necessary step in the long and expensive cleanup process. In order to scrap the power plant, radioactive waste in the melting reactor must be removed. To do this, we must first discharge the water of the melted power station after the 2011 tsunami was discharged.

The processing nuclear waste water has already kept more than 1,000 storage tanks.
In March, the person in charge of Tokyo Electric Power Corporation Ono Express to the Associated Press They now start to fully understand the degree of destruction inside the reactor. He said that the most urgent task was to start drainage safely to clean up the area around the power station. They also need to free up space for more water, because the fuses need to be cooled continuously.
"The real problem is not the actual physiological effects of radiation, but our fear of it," said molecular pathological expert Gerrythomas. She has cooperated with Japanese scientists to study radiation and provides suggestions to international atomic energy agencies.
She said that shortly after the disaster, nuclear issues began to quarrel with each other, and science was ignored. In order to appease the people who shocked and fear, the government spared no effort to show that they had taken all necessary prevention measures.
"Politicians all want to prove that they are cautious, and they care about everyone. But in fact, the information that people receive is, well, this thing must be very, very dangerous."

fear 
Now, this fear -and dislike -it is difficult to get rid of.
To make matters worse, it also affects its livelihood. Fishermen said that the water discharged water will damage the product reputation they caught, causing the price to fall, resulting in worse in the industries that are already in a difficult situation. They said that since the disaster, the fisheries here have never fully recovered and still rely on government subsidies.
In the nuclear power plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corporation officials pointed to two fish tanks -one is a bimwatefish in ordinary seawater, and the other is the same as the water radiation level of marine wastewater. He said that the fish was closely monitored -although the concentration of the ingules in their bodies at the beginning would rise, but then it became stable; and then when the fish returned to the standard seawater, it would be excreted from the body.
"I am a radiation expert, so I know that the impact of the human body and creatures is very small," he said, "We are all concerned about the same thing -radiation, this is why we are so anxious. I hope this data and images can Make people a little more assured. "
For Takahashi, the three generations of the family, this is far from reassuring: "We oppose this, we have seen negative effects. We have seen the contractor say that we will not buy Fukushima products."

Takahashi (left) said that this fear has affected the business
For him, this is a vital interest. While supervising the dock workers to remove a barrel of barrels of fish cleaning and preparing to sell the market, he said that he would not give up his family business.
He said that, compared with the disaster in 2011, their business was a lot worse: "Counting all small fishing boats, we are now 300 million yen (one year). In the past, we earned about 700 million yen each year ( About 3.9 million pounds; $ 5.1 million). "
He was worried that the situation would become worse once discharge of waste water, because both China and South Korea have announced the import ban.
When asked if the full scientific demonstration was sufficient to overcome this kind of concerns, Mr. Yamakama acknowledged that "no matter how we pack it, we cannot control the reputation." We also said: "We believe that our efforts will one day calm these disputes."
"I know that we have lost people's trust -it takes time to recover it."

The Japanese new Rockets "Epson S" engine exploded during a combustion test, and no one has been found to be injured due to this explosion.
Xinhua News Agency reported that the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK) television station and Kyodo News said that at 9 am on Friday (July 14) at 9 am (at 8 am in Singapore time) Qiutian County's Neng Rocket test site was conducted in the second -level engine burning test of Epsilons Rockets. The explosion occurred after a minute after the test began.
The screen played by NHK TV shows that the flames and fragments of the test site are four shots, the thick smoke is soaring, and the roof of a nearby facility is overturned.
According to reports, around 9 am, some people heard the explosion sound at a place where the rocket test field was counted on behalf of the Rockets. Local police said that no one has been found to be injured due to the explosion. JAXA is investigating the cause of explosion.
The "Epson S" is developing as a improved version of the small solid fuel rocket "Epson". The "Epuson" Rockets failed in the launch last October last year because the rubber membrane in the fuel box was damaged and blocked the fuel supply management.

 As the White House continues to promote the plan to implement new restrictions on the US investment in China, artificial intelligence and semiconductor companies involved in China.(https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230711/biden-china-diplomacy/)The efforts to alleviate the tension between the United States and China may be damaged.
The trip to China, the US Treasury Minister Yellen, has ended last Sunday. She Four days in Beijing The core topics discussed with senior Chinese officials include these restricted measures.
The Ministry of Finance attempts to reduce the scope of restrictions, only the number of strategic significance -has a highly strategic significance -private equity and risk capital investment in the field as the goal. The Ministry of Finance also tried to alleviate China's domestic concerns, that is, restricting investment is equivalent to technical blockade for the purpose of harming the Chinese economy.
Nevertheless, any restrictions are expected to anger China, making new communication channels that the world's two major economies are trying to recover for the first test.

"They will focus on our investment policy," said Mark Sobel, who had long been an official of the US Treasury, said that he is now the US Chairman of the official forum of monetary financial institutions. "Chinese people have problems with us, and both parties have a clear understanding of the tension between relationships."
US -China relations have recently fallen to the lowest point in the past years. Chinese spy balls float over the United States, Washington has more strictly restricting its export of technology on China. During the Russia and Ukraine War, Beijing maintains partnership with Moscow and China has continuously threatened Taiwan. These problems have exacerbated tensions.
In recent months, the Bayeng government has been striving to prevent the further deterioration of relations between the two countries, which has regarded it as a potential threat to global peace and stability. In addition to Yellen, Secretary of State Brills has visited China last month, and President Bayeng's climate change special envoy Kerry also will go to Beijing on Sunday Essence
However, when the two countries tried to set the "bottom line" for the US -China relations, the new restrictions on investment in the United States may make the two parties relative to upgrade.
New restrictions seem to be basically determined a few months ago. But considering the unstable relationship with China, the Bayeng government seems to have postponed their introduction. U.S. government departments are also continuing to controversy some details. Once the restrictions are proposed, private enterprises will have time to comment on it, which may affect the implementation of the measures.
Even though the Bayeng government decided to further postpone the announcement, it will face the increasing pressure from Congress. Members are considering a wider restriction on investing in the United States in China.

Congress and other people with supporting restrictions complained that the current approach allows US capital to flow to China to provide funds that eventually pose a threat to US national security. The U.S. government has prohibited US companies Sell some advanced technologies directly to China, and whether there is a potential security risk of Chinese companies in the United States Examine Essence However, the U.S. government does not know much about the capital flowing to China and has no control.
"China has pushed its strategic goals to unprecedented dangerous degree to use, guidance, and manipulating the greed of the West," the former chairman of the US -China Economic and Security Review Committee established by Congress Roger Robinson Said at the meeting.
The officials of the Biden government spent a lot of time weighing the scope of investment restrictions last year. Officials have contacted with corporate executives to solicit their views on restrictions on measures. Industry groups and venture capitalists actively lobbyed, opposing extensive prohibition of investment in China, saying that it would disrupted important business relations and eventually damaged the US economy.
The Biden government seems to have developed a narrow -range measure, including requiring companies to report more information about investment plans in China to the government, and at the same time prohibit some military or monitoring applications Investment in sensitive areas.
At a hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee in May this year, Paul Rosen, assistant minister of the Ministry of Finance, who is responsible for investing in security, said that the government is "working hard to develop narrow scope and clear goals" to restrict investment in some countries that may affect the country. Safe sensitive technology.
Those who support and criticize investment restrictions acknowledge that the greatest significance of restrictions is the impact of future supervision. They said that the new regulations themselves are unlikely to have much impact on China's technological development in the short term, because China does not lack investment funds.

Permons' Institute of International Economics, a very senior researcher at Nicholas Radi, said that in direct investment in China, US funds accounted for less than 5%in 2021 and 2022. The investment in China's venture capital and private equity companies to China has dropped sharply in the first quarter of this year, from about $ 35 billion in the highest at the highest at 2021 to about $ 400 million, Lady said.
He said, but China's total domestic investment in the first quarter of this year reached $ 1.5 trillion. He added that the US venture capital and private equity investment in China "even not even (the total investment) of the investment".
Nevertheless, the new regulations may create a precedent for investing in private enterprises to China, which is of great significance. They may become a tool for US officials to ask for help when US -China relations are tense, or they may also form policy policies for developed democratic countries in the next few years.
At the Seventh -way Group meeting held in May this year, US officials discussed the possibility of coordinating such policies with close allies. A report issued by the Strategic and International Research Center this year states that both South Korea and Taiwan have their own investment restrictions. Taiwan's regulations have specific restrictions on investment in mainland China in accordance with the type of technology, including prohibiting investment in high -tech industries.
China also introduced its own external investment restrictions in 2016. The government guides Chinese companies and families not to invest in U.S. real estate, or even not invest in football clubs. Instead, they promote their stocks engaged in aircraft production, heavy equipment manufacturing, artificial intelligence, network security, and other overseas companies in other strategic industries.
The US Department of Finance is likely to be the government department responsible for implementing new restrictions. Yellen has always been worried that if the design is improper, restricting measures may destroy the traditional investment environment in the United States.
advertiseA senior official of the US Treasury Department said that Chinese officials have heard the reasons for the United States to adopt the practice of restricting investment, but it is unclear whether China recognizes these reasons.
Chinese officials are also paying attention to the various export restrictions released by the Biden government to the types of advanced chips that can be transported to China. Biden Government Considering new measures , It may strengthen Chinese enterprises through cloud service Get the restrictions on cutting -edge artificial intelligence capabilities. The restrictions announced by the US government last October have banned Chinese companies from buying such products directly.
Former US Treasury officials Sobel said that despite such extensive differences, the United States and China still have no choice but to continue the dialogue.
"We stayed with them on the same boat, which meant that we had to talk and get along with them -whether they were satisfied with us," he said.

In Helsinki, Biden said: "The United States is committed to protecting Finland and committed to protecting NATO. These commitments are as strong as rock."
(Voice of German in Chinese) US President Biden Bynden visited Finland, the latest member of NATO on Thursday (July 13). When he spoke with Finnish President Ninito, Biden said that Russian President Putin "had lost" the Ukrainian war, Moscow's resource shortage and fell into economic difficulties.
"Putin has lost this war." Bayeng said at a press conference held in Helsinki, "he has no might to win the Ukrainian war."
Biden added, Ukraine "will be added to NATO" Putin will eventually realize that the continuing war does not meet the interests of Russia, but also said that "no country can join NATO in the process of war."

 On Thursday, Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeng met with China's highest diplomat Wang Yi during the regional summit held in Jakarta, Indonesia. When the two countries tried to ease the tension, this was the latest in a series of diplomatic meetings between the two countries.
The talks between Brinken and Wang Yi involved regional and global issues. The US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that this includes "peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait" and called the discussion "frank and constructive."
Miller said: "The meeting was part of the United States' continuous efforts to maintain open communication channels in order to clarify the interests of the United States on extensive issues and manage competition responsibly by reducing the risks of misunderstandings and misjudgment."
The Chinese government did not immediately issue a statement on the meeting.
The talks was held at the Southern Asian National Alliance Foreign Minister meeting. Previously, US Finance Minister Jennite Yellen conducted a four -day visit Blingken visited Beijing last month. This is the first time that the Secretary of State of the United States has visited China for five years. President Biden's climate change special envoy John Kerry It is scheduled to arrive in China on Sunday Essence
The United States said that he hopes to set up a "bottom line" for the US -China relations. At present, the relationship between the two countries has fallen to the lowest point in decades. Due to the trade restrictions on China's advanced technology, the emergence of Chinese reconnaissance balloons over the United States, the continuous support of China on Russia, and the differences in Taiwan, the tensions of the two countries have intensified.
The two countries are still unstable in eased relations, and the incident on Wednesday highlights this- US officials said Within a few weeks before Brinton went to Beijing, Chinese hackers invaded the e -mail account of the Minister of Commerce Gina Raymond and other officials of the State Council and the Ministry of Commerce.
If Bayeng Government announced New orders, Chinese companies that restrict US investment involving quantum computing, artificial intelligence and semiconductor, the relationship between the two countries may be further nervous.
U.S. State Department officials said that in terms of China's online spy activities on US officials, enterprises and citizens, Brinken reiterated from Wang Yi to US concerns. The official also said that the two sides also discussed China's role played in the crisis of the Finfindini in the United States Essence
The meeting held in Indonesia in Indonesia highlight that Southeast Asia has become an important part of the Bayeon government and China competitive strategy. Washington has always emphasized its security commitment in the region and tried to provide more economic incentives to shorten the distance between the region and the United States, but it is difficult to lead to China's dominant position in trade.

Although the United States countered China's territorial claim in the South China Sea, some Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, including Indonesia, showed an unwilling attitude to fight in Beijing.
Indonesia said last month that the location of joint military exercises with other ASEAN countries will be changed from China to the South China Sea controversial seas that claims to have sovereignty. ASEAN is a regional group composed of 10 countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.
According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, earlier on Thursday, Wang Yi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and talked about promoting the "democratization" of the process of multilateralism and international relations.
The day before the meeting, NATO just ended a summit The focus is on frustration of Russia's war in Ukraine and emphasized the threat of China.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier this week that due to the "health reasons" of Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, Wang Yi replaced him to attend the ASEAN meeting.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Qin Gang's last public appearance was to meet with Vietnam Foreign Minister Pei Qingshan in Beijing on June 25.

 Photo: RFA AUDIO-LINK: https: // Woohoo. Hair dye .org/mandarin/column/labor communication/good place -07142023091237.html/@@ stream This year's "May Day" is the first Labor Day after the new crown epidemic control. After the holiday, many workers saw the long vacation and returned to the factory to work at first glance. The boss posted a notice, announcing that the enterprise could not stop the business. The workers of Xin'an Electric Factory, Xixiang Street, Baoan District, Shenzhen encountered this sudden attack. Hundreds of workers saw the notice before they realized that the social security that the factory had not paid over the years may be gone. The workers who are at a loss launched a strike It is required to pay social security and provident funds.
It can be seen from the video sent by the workers on the Internet. At the strike site, some workers asked the staff of the Baoan District Government. If the workers negotiated with the enterprise to reach an agreement, whether the government can help implement it. But the government official said that it was not negotiating but a lawsuit. The government provided a free lawyer.
Workers want to negotiate negotiation to solve the problem, but government officials encourage everyone to go to lawsuits. Is there too much judicial resources in China? Is it really free to be free lawyers? Or is the finance paid for the taxpayer?
Xin'an Electric (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. Established in 1985, it mainly produces coffee pots, cans, beer machines, mixers, massagers, air fresh machines, etc. The company has won the honor such as the Baoan District Government and the Labor Bureau awarded the honor of "Top 100 Processing Trade Exports", "Advanced Enterprises of Labor Management" and "Integrity AAA Enterprise".
According to the website of the Shenzhen Municipal Government, less than a month before the strike of the workers of Xin'an Electric Factory, on April 13 this year, the Xixiang Street Trade Union in Baoan District held Fourth Congress Essence It is reported that the conference "summarizes the work of the past five years, deploys the tasks of the next five years, and mobilizes the majority of employees in the streets to keep in mind the original mission, firm ideals and beliefs, the cause of the loyal party, and serve the employees." Huang Shibin, vice chairman of the Baoan District Trade Union, asked Xixiang Street Federation of Trade Unions to "improve political standing, strengthen theoretical armed forces, and lead the majority of employees to listen to the party and go." Li Jinyu, the chairman of the new Xixiang Street Trade Union, said that he will "lead the party's twenty spirit as the leader, forge ahead, really work hard, gather the magnificent power of the workers' class, strive to create a new situation in Xixiang Industrial and Workers, and compose the development of Xixiang New chapter ".
Song Dedong, Secretary of the Party Working Committee of Xixiang Street, requires the Xixiang Street Federation of Trade Unions to "adhere to the party's leadership, always adhere to the correct political direction, and continuously enhance the principles and systemicity of trade unions; extensively consolidate the power of employees' struggle", and "close contact Serving employees and the masses, continuously enhance the sense of gain, happiness, and security of employees.
So, in reality, Xin'an Electric Factory has not paid social security for workers for so many years. During this period, did the union ask to the boss and ask for reissue? Does the union on behalf of the workers to the Social Security Fund Management Department to file a complaint? Did the workers ask the union for help before the strike? After the strike, did the union negotiate and negotiate with the boss on behalf of the workers and coordinated with the Social Security Fund Management Center?
According to the official account of the Propaganda Department of the Baoan District Committee of Tencent, the official account of the Propaganda Department of the Baoan District Party Committee "Binhai Baoan"](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210704A02S9K)Reported on July 4, 2021, "Xinfeng Electric (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd." (Xin'an Electric (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. Sister Factory, also belongs to the Xin Made Group owned ) Yes Shenzhen Municipal Party Construction Demonstration Enterprise Essence It is reported that "under the leadership of the party branch secretary Hu Changjun, Xinfeng Electric Party Branch has formulated a special learning plan, regularly organizes party lessons, holds knowledge competitions, and organizes party members to visit Changsha, Shaoshan, and Jinggangshan, Jiangxi to visit and learn to allow allowed to allow Party members really feel the story that happened on the hot soil ". "Regulations on the Management of Housing Provident Fund" Article 20 stipulates that the unit shall pay the housing provident fund on time and in full, and shall not be paid or pay less after the deadline. For units with difficulty in paying housing provident funds, they can be discussed by the employee congress or trade union of the unit, and are reviewed by the Housing Provident Fund Management Center. After the benefit improves, increase the payment ratio or repay the redemption. Article 38 stipulates that if the provisions of these regulations are violated, if the unit shall not pay or pay less housing provident fund overdue or pays less, the Housing Provident Fund Management Center shall order the deposit within a time limit; if it shall not be paid overdue, the people's court may apply for enforcement.
So, Xin'an Electric Factory has not paid the housing provident fund for so many years. Has the Shenzhen Baoan District Housing Provident Fund Management Center fulfilled their duties in accordance with the law and ordered the enterprise to pay for or apply for the court for compulsory implementation?
Xin'an Electric Hong Kong parent company Xin Made Established in 1969, opened the first factory in Shenzhen in 1979, expanded to 4 factories in China in 2007, and started in Indonesia in 2019. New Made is a global institution " Responsible Commercial Alliance "Members, promise to abide by " Code of Code of Conduct of Responsible Commercial Alliance " And get British SEDEX Institution Smeta Certification. When I started investigating this case in May this year, the website of the Hong Kong Trade and Development Agency's website New Made Page marked that the company was certified by TüVSüd in Germany. This certification requires customers to strictly abide by the latest global industrial chain law in Germany, and to infringe on human rights and workers' rights Zero tolerance Essence
So, can the Chinese trade union use the global industrial chain law, including Germany, to introduce the pressure of international brands to urge enterprise employers to respect Chinese workers' rights?
Please listen to me on this case with the conversation with the staff of Xixiang Street Union, Baoan District Provident Fund Management Center, and Xin'an Electric (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. Hong Kong parent company "New Made".
P.S. Post -note:
After talking to Xin Made's staff, I immediately pursued an email to list the fact that his subsidiary Shenzhen Xin'an Electric was suspected of violating the right to infringe the rights of workers in Chinese law. Causes the risk of losing order. By the release of this issue, I still did not receive a reply. However, the New Made page of the Hong Kong Trade and Development Bureau has no German TüVSüD certification mark, and the social security of the workers of Shenzhen Xin'an Electric Factory has also completed the repayment.
Here are the leaders of trade unions at all levels in China to spend time to engage in formalism. The party goes ", such big words, empty words, and slogans flying all over the sky. It is better to try to use the global industrial chain legislation of European countries such as Germany and Norway, Germany, France, and other European countries to leverage international brands to pressure to factory owners and improve Chinese workers' rights and interests.

Reuters information picture Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibao/kejiaowen/gt2-07132023095653.html/@stream The Chinese college entrance examination scores and the number of colleges and universities have been announced one after another, and netizens have set off a discussion on the "cold" of military academy enrollment on social platforms. A graduated college student told this station that many wealthy families are unwilling to apply for military schools. Although there are many benefits to applying for military academies, why are more and more young people and parents lacking interest in military academies?
Beijing 武 武 Chinese netizens said they are unwilling to enter the battlefield The PLA's recruitment in the second half of the year pays attention to the normalization of science and engineering college students to cooperate with Taiwan military exercises? Some media from the media recently sorted out the enrollment of this year's military academy. According to the admission scores of the military academy announced one after another, Ningxia admission scores of the University of Defense Science and Technology ... lower than last year, but in the case of a significant reduction in the scores, it is still still reduced. In the first batch of enrollment, there were insufficient students, including the National University of Defense Science and Technology, known as the Tsinghua University of Defense in the army.
The reporters of this station called the Admissions Office of the China University of Defense Science and Technology, the Admissions Office of the University of Naval Engineering, and the Admissions Office of the Dalian Shipping College to try to understand the enrollment of the military school, but no one answered the phone. The official did not make a statement.
Online discussions are constantly. Du Wen, a self -media person, said: "The national college entrance examination burst in advance ... Before filling in the college entrance examination volunteer, everyone was very enthusiastic about promoting the military academy and said that high -scoring students in our country gave up Tsinghua and Peking University and chose to apply for military schools. Report to the motherland. Now these students choose the enthusiasm of the military academy!"
Another self -media person, Yang Jun, spoke in Douyin: "Which universities in the country to go to school without money? Military Academy; which institution in the country is the only college that is free to distribute clothing in the country? Military Academy; Which college is the college that issues tuition fees and distributed a subsidy every month? Military Academy; which college is the only college in the country in the country? . You said that you are admitted to the military school incense? But the military academy encountered Waterloo for two years of enrollment in 2020 and 20121. "
Regarding the decrease in the college entrance examination scores of the Chinese Military Academy mentioned by the media, this station cannot independently confirm it, but there are indeed many military academies on the Internet of China.
Some students' parents leave a message on the Internet: The war launched by Russia allows the people to see what cannon fodder is. Multi -contributed!Some messages: Who wants to let the children go to the battlefield? There are also messages: Leek is getting worse and flicker.
(Network screenshot) A freshman Zhang, a graduate of Shanghai Fudan University, told this station that many rich families in China are not willing to apply for military academies and be teachers and doctors in the country. Many of them can only reduce the threshold for enrollment. She told this station on Friday that this is the status quo of China and a trend: "People in the military school in the country are in China. In recent years, first, first, the surface is that the rich people in China have not allowed their children to take the teacher to take the teacher. When a teacher, the military school is a soldier. Second, another reason is that the rich people now do not let their children do as domestic doctors, because it is too hard, the return on investment is very low. On the one hand, the risk of war in the past two years is relatively high. "
Yang Haiying, a professor at Shizuoka University in Japan, believes that the small number of applicants for military academies is related to the unwillingness of students' parents to go to the battlefield. He said to this station: "Eighteen or nine years old, young people at the age of 20 are only children, baby's baby. How can they let them go to the front line? No one will let them go as cannon fodder. Coupled with the military The training of the college is very bitter. How can we study the troops of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army? Let the farmer's children go to the front line, and the Red Second Generation Red Three Generations will not be on the front line. This is a constituent issue. "
** The enlistment is the lifelong system.
Xiao Song, who is familiar with the rules of the army and is unwilling to disclose the name, told this station that once he entered the gate of the military academy, even from the starting point of the military career, he could not leave his life in his life. The atmosphere of the war, as parents, do not want their children to die on the battlefield. She said: "I have been a military academy to be a soldier, because they are first recalled because they are fighting, retirement will be recalled, and veterans will be recalled. There is this rule. We are doing a credit system. One of them is during the military service period. If you ca n’t eat hard, you will be punished if you leave the army. This one will be implemented since 2018. It is also punished by an additional credit system. This number increases year by year. "
Xi Jinping, a Chinese leader showed on the billboard behind the Chinese soldiers, "can win the battle and excellent style". (Reuters) 
Feng Chongyi said that even if a rational scholar analyzes the opportunity to start war, it is difficult for China to win, but the authoritarian regime will not consider the problem rationally.
Some netizens said that the major of military academies who were dissatisfied with or unattended files were mostly the first choice for the United States Air Force fighter aircraft when the Taiwan Strait started war.

US Treasury Secretary Yellen will visit India and Vietnam in the next week to seek to strengthen the relationship with these two increasingly important partners and enhance economic elasticity through a diversified supply chain.
Comprehensive Reuters and Bloomberg reported that a senior official of the US Treasury officials said on Thursday (July 13) that Yellen visited July 13th to 19th. Indian officials held a meeting and then attended bilateral talks in Vietnam.
A senior official of the US Treasury said that Yellen's visit aims to emphasize the need for diversified and elastic supply chains in various countries. This is not "targeting China" or a plan for the United States to decompose with China. Yellen returned from Beijing on the 9th to Washington.
The official said Yellen will continue to promote the reform of multilateral development banks at the G20 conference and speed up low -income national debt restructuring. Western leaders estimate that multilateral development banks can release as many as US $ 200 billion (about S $ 264.1 billion) for additional loans that have been implemented or under review.
The U.S. Treasury hopes that the World Bank will establish a mechanism to provide more resources for countries that meet global challenges such as climate change, and hope that the World Bank will explore subordinate sovereignty and ultra -sovereign acts, instead of providing loan options to the state government.
Yellen will also urge all official bilateral creditors including China to accelerate debt restructuring. Officials of the US Treasury Department said that the recent progress of debt issues in Zambia is encouraged, but debt restructuring of other countries needs to accelerate the pace.
In addition, the US Treasury Department said that Yellen will focus on "Youkan Outsourcing" in bilateral talks in India and Vietnam, that is, by expanding the relationship between a trusted partner and a trusted partner, we will take measures to establish a more flexible supply chain.

However, related photos show that the "blue sky and day full of red flag" in front of the Forbidden City was disappeared.

Because we will raise the national flag every day, we will only be collected until the afternoon closed, and then we will raise it early in the morning. "
Scholars: A cross -strait exchanges are worried that young people are affected by freedom democracy 
As of now, the mainland committees in charge of cross -strait affairs in Taiwan have not responded to the incident.
Wu Se, a researcher at Taiwan's Cross -Strait Policy Association, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and pointed out: "This shows that there are contradictions between the two sides of the strait, China has always had this ostrich mentality. Communication on both sides of the strait should let each other see the most authentic level. China is worried about their people or those who come to communicate. Those who come back to Taiwan will be some of the brainwashing of the Chinese Communist Party. "
Wu Si Zhi said that since the cross -strait has gradually recovered personnel exchanges after the epidemic, Taiwan will not force Chinese people to go to Taiwan to highlight Taiwan as sovereign independent countries. thing. However, Beijing has long claimed that Taiwan is part of China. It is really fraud, so that Chinese tourists are particularly careful about totem, "national flag", and government agencies related to Taiwan's sovereignty, and are afraid to touch the political red line. This shows the gap between the people's consciousness and political value on the two sides of the strait, and is the so -called cross -strait exchanges "unique"?
China has a summer summer camp to open various cross -strait youth exchange activities. China National Taiwan Affairs Office and other units held the "Cross -Strait Youth Summit" in Beijing on the 12th. The Taiwan Central News Agency reported that more than 200 students from more than 10 universities in Taiwan participated in the above activities, and the Vice President of the Kuomintang Lian Shengwen also videos to attend the meeting. Chinese officials emphasized that Xi Jinping's "important speeches" of youth exchanges on both sides of the strait encouraged young people on both sides of the strait to create the future.
Mainland Council: Taiwan will not believe "those beautiful lies" 
When asked if he was worried about whether Taiwanese students were proclaimed by Chinese politics, Zhan Zhihong, deputy chairman and spokesman of the MAC, said on a regular press conference on the 13th: "Those beautiful lies, our young people will not be the young people will not be Believe it. But we will still remind repeatedly that like the Strait Forum held a while ago, we first reminded that this is a carnival, united front, large united front activities. "

(Photograph of data photo, reporter Xia Xiaohua) ![] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-14T11-24-00-04-00/000003.png) Zhan Zhihong said: "(China) arranged a series of official speeches at the beginning. I think this is not a model that young people in Taiwan, especially in Taiwan. A kind of communication. "
Recently, cross -strait folk exchanges have been heating up. The Ma Ying -jeou Foundation invited 31 Chinese college students and doctoral students to visit Taiwan on July 15, and 6 other non -student workers will be accompanied. After the MAC approved the 37 people, the Ma Ying -jeou Foundation requested three personnel such as Li Yan, the director of the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Office of Peking University to go to Taiwan.
Mainland Council: The application for the application does not match the horses that strictly harmed the group before the election of the Taiwan election 
After the epidemic, Taiwan has not yet opened tourists in mainland China to enter the country, and mainland personnel must apply through projects.
Zhan Zhihong said that since the beginning of this year, some Chinese personnel applied for cases to go to Taiwan in Taiwan, which involves digging or stealing in Taiwan's high -tech industry; there are also some invited units to contact travel agencies to indicate the price of the number of lives in Taiwan according to the number of stays in Taiwan. This is obviously profitable behavior. Instead of going to Taiwan to communicate; even found that some Chinese personnel applied for medical treatment in Taiwan, but they did not really go to medical treatment and sightseeing everywhere. More seriously, some mainland visiting delegations applied for professional exchanges, but the interviewed institutions were charged at the head.Zhan Zhihong also called on Taiwanese industry players and invited units to be responsible and reiterated that they would strictly investigate the horses of the group.
Wu Si Zhi said that the situation where the application of the name of the application of Taiwan did exist. People who went to Taiwan to communicate in Taiwan should be a person who had been selected and reviewed to have a certain purpose. China has set this year to be the first year of the Taiwan plan, the "one country, two systems" Taiwan plan, and only half a year left from the Taiwan election, which is more politically.
Scholars: Taiwan has legal tools to gradually restore cross -strait exchanges 
Taiwan scholar Zeng Jianyuan was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that cross -strait exchanges frequently before the epidemic, and it is necessary to open mainland tourists to Taiwan after the epidemic, but the Taiwan government is worried about affecting the election: "for example, (issued) political contributions, and the impact of Taiwan elections affecting Taiwan elections. Connecting, etc., should be a place where the land committee is doubtful. The interference affecting the election should be more concerned about the MAC. "
Zeng Jianyuan said that in recent years, relevant legislation involved in safety, reverse osmosis, and anti -theft of commercial secrets in recent years is more complete and strict, and the ability and tools should be capable of prevention. Taiwan has gradually opened tourists around the world, and the government should also have a rhythm to return to normal cross -strait exchanges.

German Foreign Minister Belbak, a visit to Wang Yi, visited
(Voice of Germany Chinese) After 83 weeks of negotiations , the German government finally announced the first "China Strategy" Essence
"Daily News": Shawrtz emphasizes cooperation 
"Daily News" as follows The
The file of the file "All tones are neither new, nor are you talking about it Essence What policies for Germany's most important trading partners have always been like a steel wire, which will continue. Prime Minister SteffenhebestReit, the chief news officer of Shawrtz, said at the news meeting that announced the Chinese strategy: "First of all, we are willing to continue to cooperate with China. In the process, we will not ignore difficulties 'issues' '' Essence
"After the document was announced, the first sentence in Schildez's first Twitter was exactly the same: 'We will continue to cooperate with China in the economy and climate-obviously very important to Salz, and reiterate the same again. The partnership of Asian giants, despite the difficulty.
It is also necessary to fight for climate change, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs led by Belbak also knows. Just here (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) people show human rights issues more clearly. "
The article finally wrote that this Chinese strategy "" leaves a lot of interpretation space. In this way, how is the correct way to deal with Beijing? The wrestling power will continue. "
"Times Weekly": China has changed, and the policy of China must also change 
"For decades, Germany's policy of China to China is first to promote economic policies. Now, the coalition government has announced its position: 'The German government worriedly see that China has worked with the interests of the one -party system and strives to impact the impact on international order. For example, the status of diluting human rights'.
The Chinese government will not be willing to read such words. Although Belbak introduced China's strategy to praise China's reform as 800 million people to get rid of poverty, then immediately condemned the Hong Kong Government's use of a reward of 1 million Hong Kong dollars to escape from foreign political objections. "
This article on the "Time Weekly" online version considers "The document involves all criticism in bilateral relations, some of which seem vague, such as what exactly does the" risk "in the field of trade policies and investment? On the question, the document clearly wrote: 'China has changed', 'and the political decisions made by China forced us to make changes when dealing with China. "
The intensity of geopolitical conflicts has not yet entered the vision of many companies
"Nande will": It is best to call it "question list" 
"This strategy is not compatible with the scale and intensity of Chinese ambitions. It fails to identify the durability of China to change the world plan Essence It largely ignores the fundamental conflict of ideology, and this conflict determines all areas of China relations. It underestimates the existence of Germany, which has been affected by a problem, that is, the future world order is dominated by the United States or China. Before expanding the topic of the supply chain or lawyer's license, if there are some clever considerations, it should be greatly beneficial. "
As a result, the article believes that this China strategy should be named "a list of problems in the field of economy and trade" Essence However, in addition to criticism, the federal government at least honestly defines 'economic trade' as the core of Germany -China relations. In the final analysis, this is consistent with reality. All the policies for China can only be controlled by the economic leverage. If you want to change this direction, you must know the interests of Beijing, that is, the European market and the technology here. "
The first security strategy after World War II announced in Germany 
China Experts: Geopolical Conflict forced restrictions on free trade 
Chinese affairs expert and Professor of Politics at Trier University, Sebastian Heilmann Explanation of the Time Weekly "World economic cooperation and division of labor, which is promoted by geographical strategies and internal affairs, is currently undergoing profound changes. From rare earth, semiconductor, photovoltaic board, and pharmaceutical materials, the security of supply guarantee is pushed in multiple economic fields. To the front desk, geopolitical conflicts forced new rules to introduce and restrict free trade and open markets. The free trade and open markets have been defined by the EU as the "highest wealth" in the past few decades. The open globalization era will end. In my opinion, the intensity of geopolitical conflicts has not yet entered the field of vision of many companies. "

 The German government approved the first national strategy to China on Thursday, defining China's Asian superpowers as "partners, competitors and institutional opponents", and called for a significant reduction in maintaining a value of hundreds of billions of dollars while maintaining hundreds of billions of dollars. Dependence on Chinese goods.
This new policy requires export control and reviews investment in Chinese German companies to protect the flow of sensitive and proprietary technologies. But this policy does not specify how Berlin will review China's investment in Germany. This is a problem recently caused A lot of concerns.
The government led by German Prime Minister Shuerz passed the 61 -page document on Thursday. Previously, due to the differences in the toughness of the three -party ruling alliance in China, the document undergone several months of discussion and delay. The strategy echoes the European Union's policy theme of "risk" to China.
The German government said reducing the dependence on Chinese manufacturers and consumers will eventually boost the country's economy.

"We don't want to decompose with China, but we hope to minimize our own risks. This includes strengthening our European economy and reducing dependence," said Germany Foreign Minister Anna Lena Belbak. "The more we expand the diversification of trade and supply chain, the more tough our country is," she added.
The strategy has adopted a tough position for China. Compared with it, the government led by former Prime Minister Merkel has regarded China as a huge growth market for German goods.
This has promoted the establishment of a close relationship with China, and there are millions of in Germany jobs Relying on China directly, there are more indirect dependence. Invest in China in China](https://rhg.com/research/the-chosen-few/)Nearly half from Germany, nearly half Part of the supply chain of German manufacturing companies also depends on China.
However, the supply chain problem caused by the new crown epidemic exposes the degree of dependence of Germany and Europe on Chinese goods. The processing minerals necessary from drugs to green technology are all -inclusive. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year has also triggered concerns about China that may use this economic dependence, just as Russia treats Germany's dependence on its natural gas export as weapons.
Under this strategy, the geopolitical risks of companies that will be required to carry out business in China are "more powerful internalized" to avoid using government funds when crisis. The government has stated that incentives are introduced to encourage German companies to diversify business outside China.
The policy also requires re -evaluation of export guarantees to ensure the protection of sensitive technologies, and emphasizes that Germany intends to formulate a list of technical lists for network security and monitoring, and implement export controls on these technologies.

"We have clearly realized that protecting our own economic security is in line with our national interests," Berbak said. She also said that Germany cannot repeat Russia to cut off the mistakes when cutting off the supply of natural gas in Western Europe and needs to "pay more than 200 billion euros to get rid of dependence."
On Thursday, the Chinese government refuted the policy's description of the policy through the Berlin Embassy, insisting that Germany was a Chinese partner rather than an opponent.
The embassy stated in the statement that "resolutely oppose interference in China's internal affairs, distort and discredit China, and even damage the core interests of China."
Whether enterprises and how to support this policy are still unknown. Some medium -sized enterprises and families Enterprise Represents Geographic risks have complicated their business in China, but industrial leaders such as BASF and Volkswagen have greatly increased their efforts to invest in China.
"Volkswagen will continue to invest in China," Berry, president and board of directors of Volkswagen Group China(Ralf Brandstätter)express.
"China is a dynamic growth market and the driver of key technological innovation," said, saying that China "is crucial to the global competitiveness of Volkswagen Group and even the entire German automotive industry."

This strategy will be submitted to the parliament, and it is expected that parliamentarians will debate to this when the parliament is re -held in September.
Germany introduced last month the first national security strategy Call for "strong" national defense and other related policies. But this overall strategy does not include China. After all, China enjoys the important position of Germany's largest trading partner. Last year, the bilateral trade volume of the two countries was close to 334 billion US dollars.
The strategy shows that Berlin has no intention of changing its opposition on issues of sovereignty in Taiwan. "The status quo of the Taiwan Strait can only be changed through peaceful means and methods recognized by both sides. Military upgrades will also affect the interests of Germany and Europe."
Hu Yongkong, Executive Director of the Institute of Merkato China(Mikkohuotari)He said that it has been more than a year since the decision to take a strictest stand in Russia, which has decided to invade Ukraine. The strategy of China to China is the latest measure to re -adjust foreign policy in Germany.
"Looking at China from the perspective of risk -oriented is a big step in different directions," said Hu Yongkong. "This is a major change for Germany."

At the same time, Taiwan's exports in June fell by 23%year -on -year, Vietnam fell 11%, and South Korea fell by 6%.
According to the Wall Street Journal, economists believe that global trade has been softening in recent months, because of how many reasons. On the one hand, Western consumers no longer spend money on electronic products and home as during the epidemic period.
On the other hand, with the implementation of the central banks in various countries to curb inflation measures, increase interest rates, borrowing costs soaring and squeezing consumer and corporate expenditures, suppressing economic growth and global trade, and the slowdown in trade will continue.
At the same time, the major economies promoted the reshaping of the global industrial chain, bringing more factories back to the local area, and further impacting the prospects of global trade.
Some economists predict that trade will not be recovered until later this year, depending on the decline of major economies.

 The world -renowned writer Milan Kundera was shot on October 14, 1973. Agence France-Presse/Archives Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yatabaODao/junshiwaijiao/jw-07142023713.html/@stream The world -renowned writer Mirankundra died in Paris, France on Tuesday. His life experience of "Prague Spring" and other times against the trend of the communist dictatorship, and his literary works and political concepts have deeply affected the Chinese generations in the last century.
Why do we nostalgic in the 1980s? Looking back at the wave of liberalization in the 1980s -to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the 64th According to the Czech News Agency, the famous writer Milan Kundera died in Paris, France on July 11 at the age of 94.
Kundera has been nominated for many times before his lifetime. Although he has never won the prize, he has already become a legend in the world's literary world. In 1929, Kundera was born in Buruo, Czechoslovakia. In his youth, he studied composition from the Czech Outstanding Composer Paul Has. During his studies at the Prague Academy of Fine Arts, he wrote a sensational novel "Jung". This novel was published during the "Prague Spring" in 1967, and was later banned. He himself was also banned from publishing any new works, but never stopped writing.
In 1979, Kundera published a novel "Laughs and Forgotten" in France, and won the "Midi Award" for the important French literary award. This book describes the fate of intellectuals of different stratums in the Czech Republic by the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia before 1968. In the same year, the Czech government canceled his nationality. Since then, Kundela has officially started the life of France in exile. Forty years later, it was not until 2019 that the Czech government returned the Czech nationality to Kundera and his wife.
Kundera was expelled from the party twice in his life. The first time was because of his "personalist tendency", and the second time was because he advocated political reform.
On April 6, 2023, Milan Kundera's hometown of Milan Kundela Library in the hometown of Milan. (Agence France -Presse) Hu Ping, editor -in -chief of Overseas Political Publication "Spring of Beijing", said in an interview with this station that most of the novels of Kundela's novels were treated with the background of Communist countries, which is one of the reasons why he was generally loved by Chinese readers.
Hu Ping: "The story he (Kunderra) tells our story. At that time, there were few works in the entire international told of our story, all of which were other people's stories. The stories he told, the main characters were thoughtful and knowledgeable. , Can attract the interest of the same identity. "
In 1984, once Kundera's book "Unbearable in Life" was published, it caused a sensation around the world. In 1987, the translation of the book was introduced to China.
The book "Unbearable in Life" was adapted into the movie "Love of Prague" in 1988. In the movie, one of the leading doctors of the leading actor Thomas, Thomas, was threatened by blatantly laughed at the authorities, but he resolutely chose the former in the face of truth and intimidation, even at the cost of losing a decent job. On Douban, which is harsh on the scoring standards, the novel "The Light of Light in Life" and the movie "Prague Love" still obtained high scores, and its influence covers several generations of Chinese.
"New York Times Book Review" once pointed out: "The real work of this writer is to find an image for his country's catastrophic history in his life."
Hu Ping believes that although Kundela's work has entered China in the 1980s, it did not cause widespread attention and discussion of society until the 1989 Democratic Games. Therefore, after the tide of learning, the public found the consensus on political concepts from the works of Kundela: "Before the mainlanders read the works of Kundera, they had a considerable understanding of communism. Therefore, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they It is more to resonate from the work of Kunderla. "
Chen Kuide, Executive Chairman of the Princeton Chinese Academy, told this station that in the era of communism in Eastern Europe in the last century, Kunderla had a fierce debate on the issue of democracy and freedom with the name of the Czech drama writer, Václavhavel. After the "Spring of Prague", the former chose to exile, while the latter stayed in the Czech Republic to continue fighting. He believes that this also had a certain impact on young Chinese young people who were also fighting for democracy and freedom at the time.
Chen Kuide analyzed: "As a writer, although his (Kunderla) literary achievements are quite high, he is not the mainstream. Everyone thinks that during the Czech Republic's important transformation period, his role offsets Harveil's mainstream intellectuals Influence."
Chen Kuide believes that Kundera's life should not be "kitsch", which means that he can focus on thoughts and not be wrapped in political trends, and advocates that people have the power to "absence" in participating in the political movement. However, under the communist autocracy, I want to completely get rid of the influence of politics too much: "Some people quoted Kundera 'Do not kitsch. As an excuse, as an excuse, as a spiritual support. "Reporter: Jingwei Responsible Editor: He Ping.com editor: Ruizhe

According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Fang was defending the plan at the ASEAN meeting on Thursday, saying that China said "no scientific basis."
As China announced its mood of marine sovereignty in the region, the relationship between China and Japan became nervous, and Lin Fang talked about this topic when he met with Wang Yi.
According to a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Fangzheng was "expressed strong attention to China's increasingly more military activities near Japan and military cooperation between China and Russia."
Wang Yi said that he hoped that Japan would "establish objective rationality to recognize China" instead of regarding it as a threat. He said: The Japanese positioning China as the biggest strategic challenge and rendering China's "threat" is seriously inconsistent with the reality of Sino -Japanese relations. He said, "China is open to the two sides to maintain contact, economic and trade exchanges, and humanistic exchanges."

With the continuity of heavy rainfall, once the water level of the Huangjiang Dam in the upper reaches of the Linjin River, the water level of Nan Dam and the water level of the South Dam of Lianchuan County, Gyeonggi -do, South Korea will inevitably rise rapidly. Li Xiaozhen said that the South Korean government will work hard to cooperate with relevant institutions to stabilize the risk of water levels over the flood limit.
Because the contact channel of the South Korean DPRK is in a state of stopping, the unified department cannot send notifications. It can only be issued by the media to make a request to avoid sudden flood discharge to North Korea.
Li Xiaozhen said that the South Korean government will properly handle occasional incidents through public media channels and other Banmen store liaison channels.

 On January 9, 2023, US President Biden and Mexican President Obrador (second from right) at the welcoming ceremony of the National Palace of Mexico. According to the latest data, in the first four months of this year, Mexico became the largest trading partner in the United States, surpassing Canada and China. Agence France-Presse Picture Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaODao/jingmao/sc-0714202311818.html/@@stream In the past ten years, China has been the largest trading partner in the United States, but according to the latest data, in the first four months of this year, Mexico has replaced China as the largest trading partner of the United States. What does this change mean for the future of the United States and China?
China ’s exports in June fell 12% year -on -year, the biggest decline in the innovation crown epidemic * China's import and export data performance is poor by depreciation stimulation to stimulate exports to exchange foreign currency and failure 
Does Mexico become the largest trading partner in the United States to be decoupled? 
Dallas Fed, a senior commercial economist, Lusistorres, a senior commercial economist, published an article on July 11, saying that in the first four months of this year, Mexico had replaced China and became the largest trading partner of the United States. In these four months, the trade volume of the United States and Mexico was US $ 263 billion. The United States' trade with Mexico accounted for 15.4%of the US imports and exports during this period. The second and third -ranked trade with Canada and China accounted for 15.2%and 12%, respectively.
The current affairs commentator Lan Shu believes that under the current circumstances, the trade volume of the United States and China is constantly declining, but it cannot be called a "decoupling" that breaks the extermination of economic trade. He said: "Although decoupling is a topic that the United States is often talking about, the entire Western country, especially the allies led by the United States, precisely define this process as 'to risk'."
Louis Torres' article pointed out that "in 2018, the US -China trade began to decline after the Trump administration levied new tariffs on China's imports. The data released by the Department on July 13th, in the first half of this year, China imported and exported to the United States 2.25 trillion yuan, a decrease of 8.4%.

According to the latest data, in the first four months of this year, Mexico has replaced China as the largest trading partner in the United States. (Reuters picture) "Risk Risk" or "Development"? 
Lan Shu believes that the future trend of the economic and trade relations between the United States and China depends on the trend of the Chinese side after that: "This process of risk will eventually cause decoupling, which depends to a large extent on the CCP. If the CCP. Now it is constantly creating tensions in the Taiwan Strait and in the East China Sea, and in the end, it is likely to cause a decourse effect. "
U.S. Treasury Minister Yellen said in a recent visit to China that the United States does not seek "decoupling" with China, but is implementing the policy of "de -risk" and "diversification". On the other hand, the Chinese official media and People's Daily have published comic comments on July 14, saying that "de -risk" says that "just put on the" new clothes 'for "decoupling', it is the new bottle of old wine, change the soup for soup, or change the soup. The trick of changing medicine. "
Luo Mingzhu, an entrepreneur from the California Bay Area, has been engaged in foreign trade for many years. She told reporters that in her opinion, the decrease in trade volume of the United States and China is also related to China's lack of a true market economy. Under such circumstances, whether it is seeking "de -risk" or "decoupling", the trade quota of the United States and China will continue to decline: "How can there be any market economy in China, it has always been the party economy and the party. It said that you can do it, you can't do it. And this (China foreign) trade and various cooperation with international cooperation cannot last long. , In China is such a particularly harsh economic environment. "

 Uyghur women and children in the square in front of the Aidili Mosque in Kashgar City on the square of Agence France-Presse Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jieduxinjiang/xinjiang-07142023105609.html /@@ stream Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, welcome you to interpret Xinjiang with me. The long -established Kashgar Ai Tihill Mosque is open to tourists, but it is not open to the believers. It is understood that the local government has begun to sell tickets to tourists, but Uighurs will not be allowed to pray in unless special day. In addition, police from many towns told Radio Liberty that a prison in Xinjiang released at least 26 Uighurs prisoners' bodies before Eid in late April this year. According to the "Human Rights Observation" of the Human Rights Organization, the Xinjiang telephone search plan is aimed at Uighurs. The Chinese police database also marked the "Gulan Sutra" as a potential danger of harmful national security. In this episode, we will understand the truth of the incident together.
Officials from the ancient city of Xinjiang said that the Chinese authorities have begun to sell tickets to tourists to visit the Tipilian Mosque, which have a long history of Kashgar. Over the years, in addition to some holy days and for propaganda, the Chinese authorities have been banned from praying there by Uyghur Muslims there.
Since 2016, the Chinese authorities have severely suppressed the religion and culture of Xinjiang Uighurs in order to eliminate religious extremism that China is considered to be behind the scenes behind the scenes.
Regarding the information about the issuing visse of the mosque, it was first circulated on the vibrato of the Chinese short video platform, and then the Uyghur was circulated on Facebook. It also appears in the marketing information of a travel agency in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The information states that tourists must pay a ticket for 20 to 40 yuan (2.75 to 5.50 US dollars) based on age and enter free of charge over 65 years old.
Sources said that the authorities allowed a small group of elderly believers to pray during the Ramadan and other Islamic Holy Days, or when they arranged politicians in other parts of the world, they left the impression that the Uighurs were not banned from praying. Essence
Those who saw recent social media about tickets sold on tickets believed that the Chinese authorities had turned the Etitim Mosque into a museum.
Kashgar police told Liberty Radio that the mosque was open to tourists, but it was not open to believers, and it was recommended to contact local travel agencies to learn more. An official who is unwilling to be named according to the convention said,
"I'm not sure how much money each tourist pays, but I am convinced that people are allowed to enter the mosque. But no one is allowed to pray because the mosque sells tickets to tourists. However, government organizations pray in the mosque. Only these people can pray to pray . This situation has been five or six years. "
According to Uighur Human Rights Projects of the U.S. Rights Protection Organization, as many as 16,000 mosque (about 65%of all mosques) have been destroyed or damaged due to government policies. Other mosques have been closed but still retained, and some famous mosques are still open but monitored.
These measures are part of the purpose of eliminating a larger -scale suppression action of Uyghur religious customs. At the same time, about 1.8 million -dimensional utensils and other Turkic minorities are arbitrarily detained in detention centers and prisons.
In May 2022, when Michelle Bachelett, a former senior commissioner of human rights affairs visited the mosque, Yima bought it to buy Tima and told her Essence
When asked why the worshipers in the mosque were so small, buying Titima said that believers were busy with work, and some people changed their views.
The neighborhood committee paid the Uyghur to perform dance outside the mosque, obviously to show that everything was ready before the visit of Bachelet.
The Bachelet's Office released a report in August 2022, which recorded the torture, forced labor and other serious violations of Uighurs and other Turkic minority ethnic minorities.
Over the years, foreign tourists have noticed the lack of prayers in the Etitim Mosque. One of them posted a tourist blog on the oil pipe that showed that thousands of believers prayed in the mosque from 2011 to 2016, but in 2019, there was no one.
The Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of the World Uyghur Congress Turkan River Alawin said that according to Islamic doctrine, it is never allowed to collect money from those who enter the mosque (including tourists).
He told Liberty Radio: "If tourists say they are willing to donate to the mosque, they will do this. Mosque is just a place to worship Ala. Therefore, we say that we use half of the mosque as a picnic farm and the other half as the prayer field. Deceived. "
In addition, police from multiple towns told Radio Liberty that a prison in Xinjiang released at least 26 Uyghur prisoners' bodies before Eid in late April this year.
Radio Free Asia contacted 10 police stations in Bachu County, Kashgar, and confirmed that the Tumu Schusk Prison Authority had returned the body.
Sources said that five of the prisoners were the elderly and died of heart disease and lung disease, and another prisoner died of diabetes.
A resident of Bachu County said that many people died of hunger because prisoners secretly fasting during Ramadan, and according to the prison regulations, they could not eat during breakfast or after sunset. Officials from Radio Free Asia did not comment on the incident.
In June, a source told Radio Free Asia that the prison authorities released dozens of people's bodies before marking the Islamic festival ended by fasting, including his brother's body.
In order to obtain more information, Radio Free Asia then contacted 10 policemen from 10 towns, including officials from Sériqbuya, Awat Township (AWAT) and Chongqurchaq. Essence
When Radio Free Asia contacted the police station in Awati Town, Bachu County to ask the distribution of corpses on the eve of Eid, a police officer said that he knew the distribution of 18 death prisoners, but he refused to disclose his identity or his family members of his family. Any information.
He said: "We know the incidents and situations of their death because they are under our supervision, but I can't share more information. I believe the number of deaths is 18, but I can't disclose their identity."
The police officer did not disclose whether the prison authorities transported the corpse directly to the family members of the deceased, the police station or the general.
Radio Free Asia had previously reported that other corpses were sent to the police station before transferring to their family. This process was carried out under the supervision of officials and police officers of the county, villages, and people's committees. In addition, the authorities monitored these families for several weeks.China has severely criticized the rights of Uighurs, which mainly violates Muslims, including forced labor, including forced labor. The U.S. government and several Western parliaments have announced that these infringements constituted ethnic extinction or anti -human crimes.
A police officer in Sedy Boya told Radio Free Asia in April this year that the prison authorities transported 5 corpses to his police station, most of them were 70 or 80 -year -olds, and they were already sick. He was sick. explain,
"It seems that most of them died due to ineffective treatment."
Police officers also confirmed that one of the corpses was the body of Abdini Cadill.

The other three other death prisoners bought Memettursunmetniyaz, Haji ’AHUN, and his wife Mehpiremhan.
Buy Tuniaz is a Uyghur motorcycle repairman who was jailed in early 2017 because he completed the pilgrimage (Muslims headed to McCaria in Saudi Arabia) in early 2017. A member of the local neighborhood committee responsible for returning his corpse told Radio Free Asia in a report in May that he bought Tuniaz in prison and his body was transported back to his family.
A person familiar with the matter told Radio Free Asia in a report in June. Hatmakers Hagi Ahong and his wife bought Hepipiham is a resident of Bachu County. 10 years in prison and detained in Tumutuk prison.
In addition, according to a recent report released by human rights observation, the Xinjiang police relied on a list of multimedia documents containing 50,000 "violence and horror" to question Uighurs and other Turkic Muslim residents.
One of the surveys of this headquarters in New York is that the Uighurs only need to store the Gulan Sutra on their mobile phones to lead to police interrogation.
Human rights observation stated in a statement that using this list is another example of China ’s“ abuse of monitoring technology in Xinjiang ”.
Human Rights Observation Wang Songlian(Virtual money)He said that the police used the list to compare the data received by the authorities of Urumqi, the residents of Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, and said in an interview with Radio Free Asia. ,,
"In essence, these applications on people's mobile phones are checking this list and searching for other information. I think what happened in Xinjiang is very important for the future of China, and it is also very important for the government to use these systems. What is the relationship between technology and human freedom? This is why we have been working hard to piece together these puzzles. "

 The Dalai Lama delivered a speech at the 88th Chinese birthday celebration held by Mahayana Garden Tenzin Jigme Taydeh/Tibet page(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-07142023105716.html/@@stream)Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, Tibet sends out to invite you to look at Tibet with me. On the 88th birthday of the Dalai Lama, Tibetans and Tibetan groups of exiles held various activities to celebrate. The spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism expected him to live in his 100s. At the same time, the Tibetans under the CCP's rule also wisen in the birthday of the Dalai Lama in various vague forms. The Dalai Lama also said recently that Chinese officials hope to contact him on Tibet, but there is no specific explanation when Chinese officials and how to contact them. In this episode, we will learn more about the situation together.
On July 6, the Dalai Lama celebrated his 88th birthday in the residence of Dalilan Sara, India. This Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader and the people who participated in the celebration announced that he was healthy and expected to live 100 years old.
"Today, you celebrate my 88th birthday, but when I look in the mirror, I feel that I still look only in my 50s. My face does not look old, and there is no wrinkles because of age. More importantly , My teeth are still intact, so nothing I can't eat or chew. "
The Dalai Lama's real name Ramton Pearl, also known as Tenzin Jiacuo, said: "According to my own dream and other predictions, I expect to live in more than 100 years. So far, I have been serving others, I am determined to continue this. Please pray for my longevity on this basis. "
The celebrations held at the temple courtyard near the Dalai Lama's residence, including the relatives of the Dalai Lama, a member of the Tibetan government, and the chief minister of Himahar, the Indian Hippal Pradesh, who later attended the Dalai Lama, Library.
The birthday of the Dalai Lama coincides with who to determine his successor.
Tibetans said that according to Buddhism's belief in the principle of reincarnation, they have the right to do so. They believe that the Dalai Lama chose the reincarnation body by itself. This process has happened 13 times since the birth of the first Dalai Lama in 1391.
However, in China in 1951, which was strictly controlled by the Western Autonomous Region, said that in accordance with Chinese law, only Beijing can choose the next spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists.
A report released by the Global Tibet Organization International Tibet Network in 2022 states that the Chinese government intends to appoint a puppet leader to replace the Dalai Lama after the death of the Dalai Lama, so as to have the opportunity to consolidate the control of the region.
The Beijing authorities accused the Dalai Lama of supporting terrorism and trying to split Tibet out of China. Although the spiritual leader is promoting a policy policy called "Intermediate Road". Great culture and religious freedom, including strengthening the language rights of ethnic minorities in accordance with the provisions of the Chinese Constitution.
The Dalai Lama said in a speech to the crowd in Dalai Sala, "I was born in Tibet. My name is the Dalai Lama, but in addition to working hard for the Tibetan cause, I have been for the well -being of all sentient beings. Work hard. I have done my best, I do n’t lose hope, nor does I have weakened my determination. I am not angry with anyone, and I am not angry about the Chinese leaders who have adopted a harsh attitude towards Tibet. In fact, Chinese history It has always been a Buddhist country. Many temples and temples I saw when I visited this land are proof. "
The Chinese government tried to erase the Dalai Lama and its laws from the Tibet Autonomous Region, so the Tibetans there celebrated the Lama Lama's life in a vague way.
They shared the poems and praises of the Dalai Lama online, and circulated pictures of the hat that Dalai Lama worn in a popular photo in various online information groups. The number "88" appeared under the hat. A Tibetan living in the area said: "The Tibetans are carried out religious activities in a creative way to celebrate the birthday of His Holiness." He refers to the way of chanting and hanging prayer flags.
The exile Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner also thanked friends for their support.
The Dalai Lama said in a four -minute birthday video: "On the occasion of my birthday, if you, my friends, can keep your heart and live a kind life, you will be happy, so you can directly be able to be directly. Or indirectly help everyone around you. "
Senior government officials, including US Secretary of State Brosky, gave birthday blessings to the Dalai Lama. Brinken said that this day was a good day for the Tibetan community.
"The benevolence and humility of the Dalai Lama inspired many people from all over the world, and I admire his continuous promise to peace and non -violence. Today, let us reflect on his sympathy and tolerance information, We reiterate that we are committed to protecting all people's human rights, including human rights in the Tibetan community. The United States is unswervingly committed to supporting Tibetans' language, culture and religious identities, including the ability to freely choose and worship religious leaders without interference. "
Indian Prime Minister Modi wrote on Twitter: "Talk to His Holiness Dalai Lama and give him sincere greetings to him on his 88th birthday. Wish him health and longevity."
In addition, Dalai Lama, the most important spiritual leader of Tibet, revealed that Chinese officials have sought to contact him with "formal or informal" to discuss Tibet issues.
The Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama, Dalai, Exile India, recently delivered a speech to the local journalist when he was about to set off to New Delhi, India's capital New Delhi in Ladakh.
"I am always happy to talk. Chinese officials now realize the tenacity and courage of the Tibetan people, so in order to solve the Tibetan issue, they want to contact me. I am also ready."
The Dalai Lama celebrated his 88th birthday on July 6, but did not specifically explain when Chinese officials and how to contact. He said that the Tibetans did not seek independence and decided to continue as part of the People's Republic of China.
Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told Liberty Radio in an email that the discussion was "open." He said,
"But any such talks can only be about the future of the Dalai Lama, not the so -called" Tibetan issue. Dalai Lama must abandon the split country's claim, stop splitting the activities of the motherland, and use the actual actions to obtain trust in the central government and the Chinese people. "The Dalai Lama said, "Now that China is changing, Chinese officials hope to formally contacted me formally or informal."
On July 9, the Dalai Lama met with the US delegation organized by the Tibetan office in Washington Office in New Delhi.

Attending the meeting, the Tibetan Government Tibetan leader of the Tibetan Government, headquartered in Dallanala, Bian Ba Ren, and the Tibetan Minister of Administrative Central News and International Relations, Norjin Zhuoma.
There is controversy with the Dalai Lama's diplomatic meeting. When Uzra Zeya visited the Dalai Lama in Dalai Lama in Dalai, in May last year, Beijing protested that Washington interfered with Chinese affairs.
Regarding this visit, the Chinese Embassy in India expressed Beijing's opposition on Twitter. Embassy spokesman Wang Xiaojian said in the tweet,
The United States shall recognize that Tibet is part of the commitment to China with actual actions, stopsing the interference in China's internal affairs by issuing Tibet, and does not provide support for the Dalai Group's anti -China split activities. "
Tibetan Administrative Central Spokesperson Dan Zeng Lei(Tenzin lecture)Tell Liberty Radio, such a response is very common in China.
"Whenever US officials or any dignitaries meet with the Dalai Lama or Tibetan administrative central Tibet leader, the Chinese government always has hostility, so this is not a new thing."
The spokesman denied China's statement on the division of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan administrative central government, and quoted the intermediate road policy of the Tibetan administrative center. Stability and coexistence based on equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. "

 The China Securities Regulatory Commission is China's financial regulatory agency, the picture shows the headquarters of the committee. Wikipedia
According to Reuters, China financial regulatory agencies invite some top investors around the world to discuss China's investment environment next week. The meeting was organized by the China Asset Management Association (AMAC), but neither the association nor the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to Reuters' inquiries.
Sources said that the invited investors include private equity companies (PE companies) and their investors or limited partners (LPS), including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds.
The purpose of this meeting is to encourage these investors to continue to invest in China. Its background is that global investors and banks have warned China's economic prospects that the Chinese economy has recovered weakly after the epidemic, and Sino -US relations have fallen into a trough.
The report also pointed out that the Chinese government has made severe crackdown on private enterprises for several years, and it is forcing many investors to re -consider the Chinese strategy. In January this year, Canada's third largest pension fund -Ontario -Public Teacher Pension Program (OTPP) said that it will suspend future direct investment in Chinese private assets.
Some people in the industry have pointed out that the Chinese government has adopted a series of practices for private enterprises and foreign -funded enterprises, including cracking down on the grounds of security, strict supervision of the scientific and technological industry, etc. Now trying to launch a charm offensive and try to persuade foreigners to come back. But maybe it's too late.

 Yi Gang, President of the People's Bank of China, at the National People's Congress on March 10, 2019 Information of the Associated Press Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhao/gx -Gx 071420222222.html/@stream After more than three months of being announced by the Central Bank of the Central Bank, more than three months after being announced by the second session, the appointment of the new party committee secretary was facing the fate that he hoped to land safely. And he has never obtained Xi Jinping's completely trusting reasons. There are many opinions. At that time, whether the US government's "June 4th Green Card" issued by the aesthetics of China was Yi Gang's "political pollution", it is worth discussing.
In this column's last article, "US Treasury Secretary announced the appointment of the new president of the People's Bank of China? The meeting of the US Treasury Secretary of the United States and Pan Gongsheng, the US Treasury Secretary of Beijing, has been introduced to Beijing a few days ago, marked that Yi Gang, who is still the governor of the central bank, has already paid the right and waits for the place. Although Pan Gongsheng officially replaced Yi Gang's "administrative leader" position of the Bank of China, and restored the expected realization of the central bank's head and government "one shoulder". The earliest time to wait for the end of August this year, because a "full process democracy of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress was required "The process, but Pan Gongsheng was announced as the deputy president's administrative title after the Party Secretary of the Central Bank. The purpose was obviously to show the difference between Pan Gongsheng and his central bank secretary Guo Shuqing.
Five years ago, Guo Shuqing was announced at a meeting of the administrative position of the central bank's first deputy governor of the central bank while being announced as the secretary of the central bank. The secretary of the party committee and deputy president, responsible for work within the scope of the party committee's duties(Personnel, administration, party affairs and reform, etc.)Yi Gang is responsible for the comprehensive work of the central bank. At the meeting, it also emphasized that in accordance with the "People's Republic of China and the People's Bank of China of the People's Republic of China", the People's Bank of China implemented the president responsibility system. The president leads the work of the People's Bank of China, and the vice president assists the president to work. Guo Shuqing also stated on the spot that "fully supports Comrade Yi Gang to fulfill the duties of the president."
It can be seen that the purpose of appointing Guo Shuqing for the Party Committee of the Central Bank 5 years ago was to implement the same "dual head system" as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the central bank. Now the purpose of appointing Pan Gongsheng as the party committee secretary of the Central Bank is the opposite. The "dual head system" that has been implemented for 5 years has been restored to "a single long system" or "one shoulder" of party and government "one shoulder."
When it comes to the "dual head system" that the CCP ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been implemented for a long time, it must be mentioned that it has been hidden for 20 days. The reason is still not sure that the yin ditch is just Qin Gang, who is just a new crown, and the new crown.
According to French and Guangxi's latest report: Qin Gang, a Chinese Foreign Minister, who attended the ASEAN Foreign Minister in Jakarta today (July 14), met with the Sri Lanka Foreign Minister Sabri and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Lu in Beijing on June 25 After Dengke, he disappeared. The Chinese wall rumored that he was interviewed with a female host of the Phoenix Satellite TV involving a spy case and was interviewed by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Some web reminds said that the rumors about Qin Gang's two -sided women's spies were covered with the news of the Chinese Rocket Army Commander and Deputy Commander of the Chinese Rocket Army.
The Hong Kong Ming Daily reported on July 13: "A few days ago, (a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) when asked if Qin Gang was healthy, he replied‘ I did n’t hear it ’. The newspaper said, "If Qin Gang is really rumored, it is also a serious case of infection with the new crown virus. After all, people who are recruited are still unable to recover for more than two weeks."
In short, if it is just a new crown, there is always a day of rehabilitation, but if it is indeed a gap, the possibility of returning yang in the officialdom of the Qin Datong is very small.
Regardless of what Qin Gang will be in the future, anyway, since his gods have so far, Qi Yu, secretary of the party committee secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, could not do it. The deputy minister of the Central Organization Department was born. Prior to Qi Yu, the party secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was produced in the business cadres in the ministry-such as Wang Yi from 2013 to 2018, so when he encounters a temporary situation of the minister, he can be represented by the minister.
Looking back, Pan Gongsheng, the new party secretary of the central bank, and Yi Gang, who was temporarily retained by the post of president.
As we introduced in the previous article in this column, if it is considered from the "international background", now Secretary Pan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank, has only done a one -year "post -doctoral" study abroad. The "internationalization" of the short -term training class of the college is not only a doctorate in the United States, but also Yi Gang, who was not only a PhD in the United States, but also a lifelong professor of universities in the United States. The background of Yi Gang's former American university professor made him not completely assured that Xi Jinping was completely assured. If the truth is cut, then Yi Gang is really wronged.
We might as well compare the new party members of the Communist Party of China in October last year in October last year. 49 years of Xi Jinping, 40 years of Li Qiang, 48 years of Zhao Leji, Wang Huning 39 years, Cai Qi 48 years, Li Xi 41 years, Ding Xuexiang 39 years. Yi Gang's party is 44 years.
In other words, only the seven new members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Seven New Central Committee have only three party age than Yigang. As for all members of the 20th Politburo, the party age of most people is shorter than Yi Gang. As for Yi Gang's public resume, he did not specifically indicate that his party joining the party was in 1979 because he was unwilling to be remembered that he was the history of his "underground party staying in the United States".
Yi Gang's official public resume said that he studied at the Department of Economics at Peking University from 1978 to 1980; from 1980 to 1986, he was a PhD in economics from the University of Hamlin University and the University of Elino University of Elino University of Elino. ; From 1986 to 1994, he served as an assistant professor and associate professor in the Department of Economics of the Indiana University in the United States, and received a lifelong faculty in 1992. In 1994, he returned to China to jointly set up the establishment of the China Economic Research Center of Peking University. Mentor; entered the officialdom of the Communist Party of China in 1997 ...
In late March five years ago, Yi Gang officially took over the news of Zhou Xiaochuan, that is, external media reported that "the" American "Yi Gang took over Zhou Xiaochuan's Chinese monetary policy and stabilized", saying that it was "once in the United States in the United States Yi Gang, who has been studying for 14 years, has been elected as the President of the Central Bank of China that Chinese monetary policy will remain stable. "Regarding the origin of the so -called "June 4th Green Card", the "1992 Chinese Student Protection Act" can still be found on the Baidu website in mainland China. ACT of 1992, referred to as "CSPA") is a California Democratic Democratic Democratic Democratic Democrats of the United States Federal Representative Southern Perosi It is proposed and aims to give all the bills of permanent residence rights of the People's Republic of China that arrived in the United States before April 11, 1990. "
This bill provides a "green card for heaven" before all Chinese citizens who have legal identities or legal entering the United States in the United States before April 11, 1990. As long as you apply for permanent residence on July 1, 1993, those who stay in the United States, short -term or return to mainland China will not exceed 90 days in a row, and will be regarded as continuous residence in the United States. They all have the opportunity to obtain the "June 4th Green Card".
Mainlanders such as visiting relatives, sightseeing, visiting and negotiating business, as well as illegal entry, and the "June 4th Green Card" army who directly benefited from directly and indirectly, far more than 80,000 people.
In the future, some people accused of saying: "June 4th Green Card" at that time, public -funded students, visiting scholars, including other self -funded international students and visitors. The considerable part of them was the darlings and vested interests of the Communist Party. In a harsh political environment, he fiercely obtained the advantages of interest competition before he stayed in the United States. After receiving another vested interest of the "June 4th Green Card", the next pursuit of interest goal is that you should not have trouble with the Chinese government in the future. Decently returned to China to invest and purchase and purchase industries, or "leaves return to root", and so on. The few of them have become senior officials of the Chinese Communist regime after returning home.
Five years ago, after Yi Gang became the governor of the central bank, the author discussed Yi Gang's identity in the United States with the old consciousness of Yi Gang still stayed in the United States. One of the saying is that the first two years of the "June 4th" incident already had American faculty, and the time to obtain a green card may be before the "June 4th" incident. But another statement was that most of the Chinese students in the United States held a visa of J1 exchange scholars. Yi Gang was one of them. Therefore, if it is not because of the "June 4th" incident, such people cannot directly obtain a green card after learning in the United States, unless they apply for political asylum.
The person holding this statement believes that because the J1 visa has the requirements for returning to China for two years after learning, the Chinese government uses this visa to control public students. According to the US government's regulations, J1 holders must not stay in the United States after their studies(But you can have a year's internship period)Essence Therefore, except for the special circumstances (such as the governor of the Minister), other people cannot transfer H1 or apply for a green card directly.
The article "Yi Gang: Scholarship: Scholarship, World Feelings", which was published on the Beijing University: "22 -year -old Yi Gang was pushed to the forefront of the times. In 1980, he became the first public funding of the 77th Peking University Economic Department. Students studying in the United States have since started their more than ten years of struggle in the United States. "
Therefore, no matter how it is changed in the future, the status of Yi Gang was a Chinese public student with a J1 visa that year.
The aforementioned analysts believe that after the "June 4th" suppression in 1989, no one in the United States was willing to return to China in the United States. At that time, for some students, the urgency was not in the application of green cards, but whether J1 returned to the country to get free. At the end of 1989, the proposal of Nancy Pelosi obtained high votes in the two courts of Congress, but the Bush administration at that time rejected the proposal. Bush played a slippery head and announced the exemption of the service clause of the J1 Chinese students to return to China by the government's administrative order. Green light.
In this way, in fact, before the passing of the "Chinese Student Protection Act in 1992", Yi Gang has obtained a government permission to work legally in the United States. The next "1992 Chinese Student Protection Act" passed, for Yi Gang, who had found opportunities in the United States, it solved the problem of the green card schedule. If his wife did not work at the time, he took the green card directly.
In addition to the problem of getting a green card in what ways, Yi Gang was appointed as the President of the Central Bank of China 5 years ago, and the criticism of the internet in the wall also concentrated on his son's affairs.
At that time, some foreign media comprehensive walls broke the contents of the net text, saying that "Yi Gang's son Yi is not‘ general ’, and the US million home industry pays it once.” The detailed content is that some netizens will make all the names, identities, and occupations of Yi's wife and son make all the names, identities, and careers of the wife and son. Although Yi Gang's 30 -year -old son is called Yi, his net worth is by no means "general". Last year (referred to as 2017), he was accused of buying a unit in Seattle at $ 1 million. Essence
According to the information released by netizens at the same time, it is easy to be born in the United States. He studied at Carnegie Mellon University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. He had a lady in the latter and worked in Microsoft and Amazon.
At that time, netizens also disclosed: In addition to the above -mentioned Seattle units, it is easy to be accused of holding two streets and an apartment in Boston Chinatown, Massachusetts Boston Chinatown and Connecticut, respectively. The latter is valued at $ 2 million, and the former's market value is believed to be even more amazing.
As for Yi Gang's wife, Guo Jingping, the relevant reports at the time quoted the news that she and Yi Gang also graduated from the University of Illinois in the United States and took the master's degree in economics. The "Thousand Talents Plan" of China's high -level talent introduction plan is returned to Beijing. It was a senior management of China Investment Co., Ltd.; CIC is mainly responsible for operating China Sovereign Fund. Guo left China Investment in 2011 and switched to China International Finance Co., Ltd. (referred to as Zhongjin).
From this content, it can be seen that Yi Gang first returned to China by himself, and his wife obviously stayed in the United States to accompany his son. It was not until his son was successful in the United States that he turned to "return to China."
Netizens refer to Yi Gang as the director of the Foreign Exchange Administration of the Central Bank in 2009, responsible for the supervision of foreign exchange business. Guo Jingping joined the CICC Branch as the general manager. He was accused of operating European and American funds and asked questions: "According to the provisions of civil servants, the relationship between relatives involves the relationship between relatives involving relatives At the time, the civil servant should avoid, Yi President, have you avoided it? "

North Korea's latest long -range missile testing has enhanced its ability to crack down on the United States, allowing the Kim Jong -un government to have greater chips in the game with the American Biden government.
Bloomberg reported that North Korea fired a new type of intercontinental ballistic guidance on Wednesday (July 12) in North Korea (July 12). The flight time is longer than any other intercontinental ballistic missiles in North Korea, and its design seems to be able to carry multiple nuclear weapons effective loads. This increases the possibility of avoiding the target of the warhead to escape and hit the target.
According to the analysis of George Williamherbe, a part -time professor at the Montere International Research Institute, the video released by North Korea seems to show that this missile has the ability to stabilize itself during flight, which implies that it may be designed to carry how many A warhead.
When North Korea launched the missile for the first time in April, it intends to bring it multiple warheads. Herbert pointed out that this week's test seemed to imply that this missile had multiple warheads and re -entered the aircraft (Mirv).
He said: "The second test is obviously smooth, indicating that the overall design is successful, not just a good luck."
North Korea's National Television released a video test. However, it is unclear whether this missile can defeat the anti -missile system and whether the warhead can complete the return of the atmosphere and achieve the goal.

China -Europe Train is a star project on the "Belt and Road" in China (information picture)
(Voice of Germany) "China -Europe Train" freight line As a Chinese official, the signature project that promoted the "Belt and Road" globally, under the personal care of Chinese leaders Xi Jinping, and operated from March 2011. The first Chinese and European trains arrived from Chongqing to Duisburg Port, Germany Essence It adds a new channel for logistics transportation between China and Europe, although it is slower than aviation, but it is significantly faster than that of sea transportation.
According to data released by the Chinese official media "China Network", in the first half of 2023, the China -Europe trains have cumulatively opened 8641 columns, sending more than 930,000 standard containers, and reaching 216 cities in 25 countries in Europe. It is equivalent to an average of more than 48 columns per day and 5,200 standard containers between Central Europe.
"Is it lucky?"(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/报告全球化逆行-中欧班列仅用不到25运能/a-62538081)One of the WeChat mini programs that provide overseas warehouse collection services. Starting in early 2023, a series of disputes that occurred in the relevant service party and customers including "Genting Logistics", including "Genting Logistics", have covered a layer of shadow for the reputation of the China -Europe trains and the positive image they promoted. Essence
Beautiful first and then disappointed 
"Is it lucky?" In the advertisement, it clearly promises that "double -clear taxi taxes are delivered to the door"
2022 under the strict new crown control measures "Is it transported?" Through WeChat Mini Program provides customers with railway and aviation logistics transportation services from China to Europe. Use a very attractive ultra -low -price offensive with "sending a big promotion in Europe, 6 yuan/kg of general goods, 14 yuan/kg of sensitive goods, and 1 kg, missed one year". Various Chinese media and self -media advertisements such as "Dezhong.com" and "Love Dutch Platform" have attracted a large number of overseas Chinese customers who cannot return to China due to new crown control measures.
The operating model of "is it transported" is to allow users to send products to Europe to a receiving address in Tangxia Town, Dongguan. Then they arranged their logistics customer service staff to re -pack and organize the goods for users, and they were mainly sent to the designated address of Europe through the central European trains.
At the beginning, everything was beautiful. Customers, including Ms. A and Ms. B, they placed orders in 2022, and they also obtained the goods sent from China after waiting for about 30 to 40 days after waiting for about 30 to 40 days. Due to a pleasant experience, Ms. A, Ms. B and other customers continued to place orders. However, since April 2023, more and more customers of "have you transported", like Ms. A and B, found that their goods have not been completed in China as they are written in the logistics tracking information, and they have successfully completed customs declaration and entered Europe. Instead, it quietly disappeared somewhere along the "China -EU trains".
"Where can my parcel be transported?" 
According to the Voice of Germany, there are about thousands of European Chinese who cannot receive the goods in accordance with the service contracts that are "carried out". Essence The affected Chinese have formed a number of rights protection groups including "the victims jointly work together", and the largest single group members have more than 430 people. The first problem for most people to join the rights protection group is: Where is my package shipping?
The fact is that many customers still have no information related to the whereabouts of the goods. At the same time, many customers received the name of the mailbox, including "LLCW", and registered in Google Gmail's email, saying that the customer signed the "Confidential Agreement" with the intermediary and made up to thousands of affiliated accounts located in Estonia and Lithuania. After the extra cost of the euro, the company behind this email Voluntadjw S.L. is responsible for sending the "transportation" to the customer.
According to the news of the Voice of Germany, the core content of the relevant "confidentiality agreement" is that the middlemen Voluntad Jw S.L. As Party A, it discloses all information to Party B's customers, and Party B shall keep confidential. The draft party Voluntad JW S.L. pointed out: In view of the fact that Party B's goods belong to "three -free products, storage, transportation will bring huge risks to Party A, so Party A requires the information to be kept secret. If there is violations, Party A has the right to "destroy and sell" Party B's goods in overseas warehouses.
Customers are required to sign part of the "confidential agreement"
Ms. C also received a notice from Voluntad JWS.L. company requested to recover additional freight. But like many of the rights protection organizations, they do not agree with such requirements. Ms. C clearly pointed out that the advertising promotion released on Chinese social media such as "is it transported" is the "China -Europe All -Delivery Railway" service "Double Clear Tax Palentry Delivery". Nowadays, when the cargo does not complete the "door -to -door" transportation, the carrier requires the payment of additional fees to complete the contractual obligation. There is no legal basis at all.
In addition, the rights protection organization also questioned the legitimacy of the "confidential agreement" requested by Voluntad JWS.L.. Because the customer obtained the confidentiality agreement for the first time, there is no information on Party A. It is required that the client will sign an agreement and return it before providing Party A's information. "Is it transported?" The rights protection organization believes that this is equivalent to a agreement that signed an unknown subject to ask users to "eat a dumb loss", which is "naked and intimidated". 'Is it lucky?' The part of the fraud chain. "
Ms. B is a member of this "fraud chain". Although the value she sent by herself was only less than 3,800 yuan, she considers that after repeated, she paid about about 500 euros of subsequent freight funds to Voluntad JWS.L.. But from then on, you can only receive the "please wait patiently" information from the middlemen. The original commitment was not fulfilled within one week. Now she is waiting for the police in Germany, where she is waiting for more than a month.
The reason for the retention of the cargoRegarding the reasons for the retention of the goods, the explanation given by the official on May 17 was the explanation given by the official on May 17th that the parcels shipped before the end of March encountered overseas warehouse inspections and said that "this year's inspection is very strict", but "please rest assured that everyone can rest assured , Our company's parcels do not have a prohibited product, do not worry about random opening inspections. In the end, everyone will get a complete package. " 
However, according to the information controlled by Germany, "Is it transported?" It was announced in early May that the recent "most goods were checked overseas", and they received a large number of complaints and reports in the industry and commerce, public security and other departments after normal transportation, which led to the company, which led to the company, which led to the company, which led to the company, which led to the company. The venue "is investigated by the industry and commerce and public security departments every day. Employees have successively resigned." And need to face the negative public opinion of major social platforms, "make customers seriously lose. The company can no longer operate", so it is decided that "no more investment in the company." "Is it transported?" At that time, the customer's accusations were "not in line with the actual situation" about the customer's "no actual delivery, and the case of selling customers' goods and selling costs, rolling freight running roads, etc.".
Soon after, the intermediate business also conveyed the news of the bankruptcy stopped to the customer to the customer in late May, and pointed out that "is it transported?" "Is it unable to obtain independent certification with the middlemen's statement. However, it is certain that in the face of customers who sent goods before the end of March this year, "Is it transported?" In the past few weeks, or even a few months, it only conveyed that the goods were checked overseas to be inspected overseas. information. Many customers did not receive any relevant information at all, resulting in unknown customers in concerns and rumors to report complaints and reports through multiple channels. In addition, the representative of the rights protection organization also emphasized that the time span of the inspection and inspection of the inspection of the inspection of the inspection of the inspection is from February to May, which involves countless different time and batches of goods, and no possibility of audit may be subject to audit. Essence
In the letter from the middleman LLCW, most of the goods issued by customers are "three -free products", that is, no production date, no quality qualification certificate, and manufacturer products. In addition, customers cannot provide the CE certification of importers' completion tax, brand export authorization, and the EU's CE certification of product quality. Therefore, it is impossible to do related treatment after the goods are checked. However, the representative of the rights protection organization is that most customers send the items sent by themselves or gifts, or for the goods purchased in China through legal channels. There is no reason to identify all three products. Moreover, the LLCW party neither inform the sender's accurate identity or corporate information in the email, nor can it provide authoritative inspection documents to prove that the authenticity of the information cannot be proved at all.
"Is it transported?" Who is it behind? 
Oklogi Limited's registration information in Hong Kong shows that the director is Lin Yizhou
According to the information held by Germany, the actual controller of the Voluntad Jw S.L. Company behind the LLCW middleman is called Lin Yizhou, and the domestic residence of China is Qingtian County, Zhejiang. After the customer signs a confidentiality agreement with the company, it will be asked to pay an account called Oklogilimited in Estonia and Lithuania. Oklogilimited is a company registered in Hong Kong with a registered share capital of only 10,000 Hong Kong dollars. Lin Yizhou is the director of the company. The results of the "lucky" rights protection group showed that Lin was a Chinese businessman in Spain and the actual controller of "Is it lucky".
Local business registration information shows that Voluntad JW S.L. is a company registered in Barcelona, Spain on May 29, 2023. Its legal person is named Linyeqing. The rights protection organization pointed out that this person should be Lin Yizhou's relatives. At present, most of the goods sent since February have also reached Spain. What Ms. B cannot understand is that since the current security organization has investigated a large part of the deserved goods, it is now a cargo cabin in Spain. And there are many local Chinese in the victims. Why did no one go directly to the cargo compartment to find out?
One might be that the victim is not clear about the background of "Is it lucky" and dare not go there. The Voice of Germany's investigation found that the main body behind the WeChat Mini Program "was it transported" includes "Hangzhou has been transported? Technology Information Co., Ltd.". In addition, companies related to them include "Boys? Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd.", "Shenzhen Circle Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd.", "Hangzhou Onet Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd." and " Dongguan Genting International Logistics Co., Ltd. and other related companies.
Relevant investigations found that the legal representative of "Hangzhou has been transported to information and technology Co., Ltd." was changed to Zhang Keli before "Zhu Jie" in early March 2023. It has been included in the "Business abnormal list" on the public credit information publicity system of China, because the person in charge of the enterprise cannot be contacted through the registered residence or the operating venue. The Voice of Germany has tried to contact the customer service on WeChat and the middleman Voluntjw S.L. on WeChat through various channels. It has not received any reply so far. Registering multiple empty shell companies and frequently replacing the legal person is one of the core accusations issued by the rights protection group to the relevant enterprises of the relevant enterprises.
Public information shows: Voluntad JW S.L. is a company just registered in Barcelona, Spain in Barcelona, Spain.
WeChat Vitamin received the police warning 
Ms. A also had a number of people in the rights protection group. By reporting to the police in China and European countries, she tried to "transport it" to retrieve her consignment goods. She also asked for help to investigate the situation of related logistics companies in Dusseldorf, Germany. The reply is that "the embassy and consulate abroad has no administrative power, judicial power, and law enforcement power in the local area. It is recommended that you contact lawyers and police to safeguard your legitimate rights and interests through legal channels."
Subsequently, under the initiative of other members in the rights protection group, Ms. A was preparing to hold a rights protection activity in front of the Chinese Embassy in Germany and submit joint petition letter in front of the Chinese Embassy in Germany during the visit to Germany in mid -June. Follow the matter. However, Ms. A released the news about how to prepare demonstration protests in Germany's legal compliance reports in Germany. Among them, the people of the country immediately received a warning from the local public security department, saying that the plan in the plan "is not desirable, and find a way out of reasonable and legitimate methods." According to Ms. A, there are more than her who is similar to her. "Many group friends have received calls from domestic police to warn us not to participate in such actions." In the end, the protests did not go.
A friend of Ms. B in Germany's overseas warehouse logistics industry told her that Lin Yizhou and his chef gangs composed of relatives and friends behind them were already "infamous" in the industry. The customs's inspection is poor, and even corruption to complete the customs clearance of the goods. Therefore, at the price of 19 RMB per kilogram, it can provide "tax" and "closing customs clearance" of freight services. A suggestion given by a friend in the logistics industry is that if the goods are not involved in high -value products of tens of thousands of euros, it is not worth spending energy and financial resources to try to retrieve.
"Death of Chicken Eggs and Raw Chicken"Ms. A also admits that there is no breakthrough at all at all. "It is the dead cycle of a chicken -raw egg and chicken." Because although many people reported the case in Germany, the German police pay more attention to investigating the fraud accusations for the establishment of the fraud from the bank account of related companies in Europe. The German police collected by the rights protection group and the information behind the corporate and legal person behind the "Is it transported" and the legal person. Ms. A believes that from the perspective of Chinese police, it is also very difficult to cooperate with overseas police and local Chinese embassies and consulates that involve overseas evidence collection. 
Police investigation. " More than 400 people in the "victims work together" have launched actions to send report materials to the Chinese embassies, consulates, and overseas Chinese federations from all over Europe, including sending all rights protection and reporting materials to the officials on the Belt.

Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Friday (July 14), met with Japanese foreign minister Lin Fangzheng in Jakarta. Lin Fangzheng explained water for the emission nuclear treatment in Japan. Wang Yi called on Japan to deal with it carefully and "don't do it alone."
China News Agency reported that Lin Fangzheng explained the idea of the Japanese side on the issue of "nuclear treatment of water" in Fukushima and hoped that the Chinese side would understand. Wang Yi emphasized that Japan's "nuclear pollution water" is safe and healthy in human life. Nuclear pollution water generated by nuclear accidents is completely different from the abolishment of wastewater generated by the normal operation of nuclear power plants, and cannot be compared. There is no precedent for pollution water to the ocean nuclear accidents around the world, and there is no common recognition standard.
Wang Yi said that this is both a scientific issue and an attitude. The Japanese side should face up to the legitimate concerns of all parties and different opinions of experts, and scientifically demonstrate various different treatment methods, and fully communicate with neighboring countries with a sincere attitude. We must deal with it carefully and do not intend to do it alone.
At the Asia Simmer's Third Foreign Minister's meeting held in Jakarta earlier in Indonesia, Wang Yi and Lin Fang's positions on nuclear treatment water were inconsistent.
When it comes to bilateral relations, Wang Yi said that 45 years ago, China and Japan concluded a peaceful and friendly treaty, stipulating that China and Japan should adhere to peace, friendship and cooperation in legal forms, and established a long -term and long -lasting one for the exchanges between the two countries. Principles and directions. The two parties should take the 45th anniversary of the approval as an opportunity to jointly work to build Sino -Japanese relations that meet the requirements of the new era.
Lin Fangzheng pointed out that the potential for cooperation between the two countries in a wide range of fields is huge. During the recent period, the exchanges between the two sides have opened closely, and the Japanese party welcomes this, hoping to further strengthen humanistic exchanges. The Japanese side attaches great importance to strengthening dialogue and communication with China, and looks forward to taking the 45th anniversary of the conclusion of the peace and friendly treaty of Japan, guiding the consensus between the leaders of the two countries, to build a constructive and stable Japanese -China relations, and create conditions for senior exchanges between the two sides.

Wine farmers Lukassermann took over the family winery two years before the flood. He has no flood insurance, but fortunately, there is a 30 billion euro reconstruction fund established by the German Federation and the states, which covers 80%of his economic losses.
The Alts Valley is a well -known wine plantation, with about 560 hectares of planting area. In particular, the wine brewed on the steep foothills is very popular with experts and tourists.
Selman said that the wine is selling well now, but tourists still have no tide. He felt that this was because the road has not been completely repaired, and the same is true of bicycle lanes and railways. The parking lots of large passenger bus and camping cars are still under construction.

Infrastructure is still under construction 
In addition, many hotels and conference centers of the Alval Valley have not been reopened. In 2019 before the flood and the epidemic, 1.3 million tourists have ushered in here. Today, about 60 % are restored from the number of beds. However, most of the tourists who spend the night here are mostly weekends, not like they have taken a few days before.
THOMASWINGES said that the tourism industry here has not fully recovered and it is not surprising. Because there are construction sites and machine noise everywhere. Saw the wood, build a house, and knock on the nails everywhere. However, his business is not bad.

He will tell the situation of the flood at the time of the hiking tourists. In this small village, 10 people were killed. At that time, the water level of the Ali River rose here to 10.6 meters (currently 48 cm). He also tells that after the flood, people help each other and volunteers have surged from all over the place The huge enthusiasm for helping help.
Hubert Pauly, chairman of the Local Wine Planting Association, said Many residents It has not been completely calmed down from the state of the disaster. There are about 130,000 residents here. Many people are still scared when there are heavy rain. Poly said that a friend's little granddaughter would ask his grandfather during the thunderstorm: "Will the house be broken this time?"
Poly estimates that the total loss of the Altar wine farmers is up to 200 million euros. Only 5 of the 35 wine farmers were not affected. But he also said that wine farmers in other regions have extended their hands, whether it is cleaning the ruins or storing wine. Customers are also doing their righteousness and buy wine bottle with sludge wines.
But now there are phone lines that are not finished, and mobile networks are relatively poor. Poly said, Flood prevention measures in the Alval Valley It still needs to be improved. But in any case, he said that people here want to look forward. The Alts Valley is still "a place worth living and love".

As the United States and allies have promoted to accelerate the production of key mineral production in North America, the Trudeau government in Canada hopes to announce a plan to simplify mining project permits by the end of this year.
Bloomberg reported that as the United States is increasing the metal required by the production of electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, Canada is facing pressure to maintain synchronization with the United States. American legislators are discussing a legislation that may significantly accelerate the approval of resource projects.
Although Canada has a large number of key mineral resources, it may take five to 25 years in the production of mines, which constitutes a major challenge to Canada's hopes to participate in the United States' lead in the leading position in the key mineral field.
Exner Piparo, a special consultant of the Canadian Business Council, said that the United States' discussions on the legislation of licensed reform have increased the urgency of Canada's accelerated mineral construction.
She said: "The prices of commodities have risen, and some key metals have begun to be short -short, which shows that the United States has a serious attitude towards permission procedure reform. If we want to do something in the key mineral field, we must take action."
According to an official official, the most ideal situation is that the Canadian government has completed a plan to simplify the mining project permit before the autumn budget update.
The official said that the Trudeau administration will seek to implement the regulatory obstacle legislative legislation passed in 2019. These obstacles may be delayed for more than 10 years.
The backlog of the license is mainly due to insufficient funds responsible for approval, and the lack of coordination between the federal government and the counterpart departments of various provinces. The IMPACTASSSSSSSSSSSSENT ACT adopted in 2019, which aims to shorten the approval time of the permit approval to up to 5.6 months by setting the evaluation time limit, but the actual project delay still far exceeds this time limit.

Many people who want to reduce sugar intake will choose sweeteners as alternative
(Voice of Germany Chinese) WHO International Cancer Research Agency (IARC) released the evaluation report of Aspartam (E951) on Friday (July 14). The taste agent is listed as "may be carcinogenic to humans."
As an artificial synthetic sweetener, Asba is widely used in the food industry. Many processed foods have it, especially low -sugar carbonated beverages, baked foods, dairy products, and sugar -free gum, breakfast oatmeal, fast coffee, and food dishes.
"Cancer is one of the most common causes of death in the world. The scientific community has always been committed to the factors that may be possible or help cause cancer. The card (FranceScobranca) said in an announcement: "The assessment of Asba's sweetness shows that although the normal amount of use will not cause a large security problem, its potential consequences must be investigated through more and better research."
Asba Sweet is an artificial synthetic sweetener
Drinking white water is the best 
"We don't recommend consumers to completely reject sweeteners, but we recommend that they have restrained enjoyment." Branka explained that if you take a shopping in the supermarket, you choose sugar or [sweetener].(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/甜度高热量低的天然甜味剂甜菊/a-1571313)For soft drinks, you may wish to consider the third option -drinking white water or other drinks without sweetness.
The international cancer research institution located in Lyon, France has published the results of the research on the latest issue of the "Liuye Knife Cancer Medicine". Researchers discovered a limited basis for Asba Sweet Sweetan and some kind of liver cancer.
In such studies, scientists judge whether a substance may be carcinogenally in theory, but it does not consider how much a person takes to take in order to cause the risk of cancer.
According to the current European Union's suggestions, Asba's highest daily intake is 40 mg of weight per kilogram. The WHO explained that a 70 kg of people weighed more than ten cans of soft drinks with more than ten cans of Asba's sweet and high -content soft drinks will meet this standard. Therefore, according to the current cognition, consumers who are not such "indulgence" will not face higher cancer risks.

A comforting woman: The last batch of survivors of the Japanese Slave in World War II called for "Don't forget us"

Pillars Galan (right) and Mary of Mary.
When Pilargalaang entered a room full of 80 women, she suddenly didn't remember why she was wearing her favorite flower skirt. The 88 -year -old woman glanced at her sister -in -law Mariaquilantang, which was a reminder that made her remember back. These two women participated in the "comfort women" gathering during World War II, and the so -called comfort women were forced to enter the Japanese army in South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, China, and Indonesia's military brothels. 
In Mapaniqui, the countryside of the Philippines, about 20 women are the last batch of comfort women in the Philippines.
When they were young, they were taken away from home, dragged into a red house on the dusty road, and repeatedly raped the Japanese army. Now they are 80 or 90 years old, still struggling to obtain public apology and compensation from Japan.
But these wishes have not been realized for decades.
They tell their trauma to those who are willing to listen, hoping that they will not be forgotten by the world even if their memory is gradually blurred.
South Korea's earliest "comfort woman" image record "The biggest fear of the comfort woman is the forgotten of tragedy" Japanese Prime Minister Tonjo Machine ashes were confirmed to be sprinkled into the Pacific Ocean * The World War II in the United States: The dark history and family secrets behind a long -seized kimono At that time, they had nearly 200,000 people, most of them were Koreans. In South Korea, their number has now decreased to nine people. The last known comfort woman survivor in Taiwan died in May this year. Japan's refusal to face the past and pay compensation, which has always been the source of the tension between the country and the neighboring countries.
In the Peace Treaty signed with Japan in 1951, the Philippines agreed to give up the right to claim compensation during the battle. Although these comfort women did not admit this, the Philippines, as the main source of development aid in Japan, has been reluctant to put pressure on Tokyo.

Many local women were taken away from home, dragged and detained into a red house on the dusty road, and repeatedly raped by the Japanese army.
"We hope that we can get justice before our death," the "team leader" in the comfort women who requested the claim is also the most blunt Maria told BBC, "We have only a few people, and we have entered the twilight years."
In a hot afternoon, a group called "Malaya Lolas" (free grandmother) gathered together in the Philippines, singing his own life stories in a slow -played verse.
"We cried, we begged a little sympathy. Their brutal heart was only eager to satisfy. When I was 14 years old, I was viciously infringed ..." The group sang.
Maria began to say some jokes, making other grandmother feel easier. She told them that singing in front of the audience is no different from singing karaoke. Moreover, chewing betel nut can soothe all anxiety.
After that, she became serious. When she was eight years old, she was raped in the red house in the middle of the paddy field. To this day, every time she sees the house from the highway, the pain will emerge. Because the broken house still stands over there, now attracts people and some historians who are curious about the ghost story.
In the villages where these grandmothers lived, there were many houses that have been broken during World War II. The village is located in the town of Candaba, which is two hours north of the capital Manila, and is rich in duck eggs and breeding catfish. It is no longer known for its past dark wartime history.

Maria said the disaster took her childhood, as well as a good education and a happy family life that could have been.
Maria told BBC that other daily ordinary things would also cause her past memories. When she saw the soil soaked by the rain, she recalled that during the imprisonment, her only source of drinking water was to plow the buffalo of the rice field to step on, leaving the water in deep footprints.
She said, "We carry a very heavy burden."
"But I have a lot of dreams when I was a kid."
Maria said that the disaster took her childhood and had a good education and a happy family life that could have been, but her father died in the war: I could have wearing beautiful clothes and became a cute little girl. On the contrary, we are constantly moving and always afraid of the Japanese. "
However, she thought she was lucky because she married a farmer and formed a family. Many other Philippine comfort women are discriminated against in the community and their families.

Ms. Cruise: At the age of 94, she is one of the oldest people in this comfort women group.
Maxima Delacruz also hoped to attend the party in the afternoon, but she could not attend because she couldn't afford it. At the age of 94, she is one of the oldest people in this group."I have participated in so many protests. I have been to Japan, Hong Kong, and even Europe," she said.
"The lawyer helped us to these places. Although my body is weak, everything is still clear for me, and it is deeply imprinted in my mind."

This village has a painful history.
Cruz said that after the war, she was forced to work and could not go to school because she had to help on her parents' farm. When she got married at the age of 16, she clearly remembered that her family shared a whole chicken instead of holding a wedding banquet.
"If Japan can give us a little living expenses," she said.
For "free grandmother", recalling the past is always a kind of spiritual sustenance, their lawyer Virginia Suarez told reporters.
"For them, telling your own story in the form of songs is very liberated. When you experience what they experience, you can't keep silent. Because it will be an extra torture," Suarez said.
Japan must be supported by the Philippine women's seeking compensation for compensation. The "free grandmother" once made relevant requirements to the Philippine government and even appealed to the Supreme Court, but failed to succeed.

The "free grandmother" appealed to the "CEDAW) of the United Nations Elimination of the Women's Disclosure Committee (CEDAW). In March of this year, Manila must compensate these grandmother and publicly apologize for their decades of suffering and discriminatory encounters. Essence
"For the victims of these victims who were stunned, neglected, ignored and erased in the past, this is a symbolic moment of victory," the United Nations eliminates the member of the Women's Disclosure Committee, Mariene Berris ( Marionbethel) said.
Lawyer Suarez said that since the CEDAW ruling, government agencies have distributed thousands of flees to her customers. But she added that they would never stop fighting Japan's apology.

"For 'Liberty Grandma', apology is really important, because it is a recognition of errors," she said.
She also emphasized that "Japan has committed very serious crimes on them. The world should not forget this, and the Japanese side should pay the price for this."
For Maria, as long as someone is willing to listen, their battle will continue. "We are a very close friends group, and many people are helping us. We want justice. As long as someone invites us, we will continue to sing."

The Black Sea Food Agreement allows Ukraine to export more than 32 million tons of grain, which is mainly exported to developing countries
(Voice of Germany Chinese) Turkish President Erdogan said on Friday (July 14) that Russia has agreed to extend the Black Sea Food Agreement.
Erdogan told reporters that he had called with Russian President Putin. He said: "We are preparing to welcome Putin to visit in August, and we will extend the Grain Corridor of the Black Sea to reach an agreement."
However, the Kremlin has not issued any statement on this matter and emphasized that the agreement will be extended only when it meets its own export conditions.
Black Sea Grain Agreement is important? 
In February 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine was interrupted, which interrupted Ukraine's food exports, leading to a shortage of food in some countries, and global food prices soared.
According to the World Grain Program, food from Ukraine has supported about 400 million people around the world.

July 2022, Türkiye helps to promote the Black Sea Food Agreement After that, the agreement has been renewed many times. The agreement allows Ukraine to export more than 32 million tons of grain, most of which are sold to developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and other regions.
If not renewed, the current agreement will fail on July 18.

Russia requires its own export guarantee 
Moscow has repeatedly threatened the Black Sea Food Agreement, saying that the promise of Russia's own fertilizer and food exports has not been fulfilled.
In particular, Russia is seeking sanctions from Western payment, logistics and transportation insurance, saying that these sanctions have always been an obstacle to their exports.
Putin said in an interview with National Television on Thursday that Russia was "none of them" as requested by the agreement.
"I want to emphasize that nothing is done and nothing is done. This is unilateral." Putin said, "We will consider what to do, we still have a few days."
Earlier this week, UN Secretary -General Guterres gave a letter to Putin to talk about extended agreement and eliminate Russian fertilizer export disorders.
Erdogan said that he hoped that "through this letter, we will work with Russia to ensure the extension of the grain corridor."
