Among them, China exported US $ 33.686 billion in Russia, an increase of 67.2%; China imported 39.462 billion US dollars from Russia, an increase of 24.8%.</p>
<p>** Russia's battle has been sanctioned by Western sanctions in China.</p>
<p>Nobel, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was embarked down and sanctioned by Western countries. Many things in Russia wanted to buy with China. China became the biggest beneficiary. "White gloves".</p>
<p>The China Customs General Administration also pointed out that China import and export 461 trillion yuan in imports and exports to countries along the “Belt and Road”, an increase of 16%year -on -year. Among them, the five Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, and the import and export of Western Asia and North Africa countries such as Saudi Arabia increased by 37.4%and 9.6%, respectively.</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu pointed out that how much the number of numbers released in China cannot be confirmed. Many countries have not announced data in March and April. If the authenticity is to be proved, it is correct to compare it.</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said that the significant increase in the amount of imports and exports in China and Russia was the reason for the increase in the number of "Belt and Road" countries. The data released by China are particularly highlighting the improvement of import and export trade with countries along the “Belt and Road”, which has the purpose of propaganda.</p>
<p><strong> China emphasizes that the import and export of import and export of the “Belt and Road” countries: Publicity role </strong></p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said: "It mainly expresses it. Although Western countries, the United States, Japan, and South Korea sanction high -tech and embargo have little impact on China, because China has in the 'Belt and Road' and other countries such as Asia, Africa Europe, and other countries. The amount of import and export is also very large. It does not need to rely on the United States, Japan, and Europe to maintain its ability to import and export. (Chinese data) is mainly used for publicity, which is very obvious. "</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu mentioned that for more than a year after the Russian and Ukraine War, Russia announced that the national GDP has not fallen too much, indicating that Western sanctions are invalid, and it is normal to decline during the epidemic. Some people want to replace those countries that were originally imported and exported to Russia, then China is of course equal to replacing their roles. Therefore, there are many imports and exports to Russia and Eurasia. Volkswagen products, consumption luxury goods, high -tech industries, etc.</p>
<p>Shi Jianyu said that the rebound after the unblocking of China was not surprising. With the development of the Russian and Ukraine War, what would change and whether it could continue to grow is the focus of observation. As for the decline caused by decoupling, it is foreseeable whether China wants to work hard for a few years.</p>
<p>According to Chinese customs data, China ’s imports and exports to ASEAN were 2.09 trillion yuan, an increase of 13.9%year -on -year, accounting for 15.7%of China's total foreign trade. In the first four months of China, exports to the United States fell 14.3%year -on -year and imports fell 2%. According to data, Reuters has a trade surplus of US $ 98.58 billion in the first four months of the United States.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[China ’s trade import in April has declined by nearly 8%]&gt; Reuters reports that China's latest trade data has hoped to have a shadow on domestic and foreign growth. Import accidents in April nearly&gt; 8%, continued a month ago. Import data means that the global economy may not be able to rely on China to drive demand, such as South Korea's shipments in China have dropped more than a quarter. The cooling of export data also shows that the demand for Chinese products overseas is not much. &gt; <a href="https://t.co/aQcf4JBwqa"></a>&gt;&gt; - Liberty Asia Radio(@RFA_Chinese) <a href="https://twitter.com/RFA_Chinese/status/1656120256589430786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">&gt; </a>Shi Jianyu said: "High -tech imports have declined in recent months, which is the result of the United States' policy on China -high -tech departure policies. China cannot buy high -tech products and raw materials such as chips and materials. Amount. "</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Scholars: The increase in China's export is the order of the rushing outbound epidemic control order </strong></p>
<p>Taiwan's Cross -Strait Policy Association researcher Wu Sezhi was interviewed and analyzed by Radio Free Asia. China's exports this year will inevitably grow much compared to last year, mainly because of the seal control measures in the past two years, which has caused many factories to stop production and stop work. Many Chinese companies are completing and digesting for international orders in the past.</p>
<p>Wu Si Zhi said: "On the other hand, many foreign companies look at the changes in the Chinese market, and the export of related production machines and funds from China will also drive China's export growth. By the end of the year and next year, whether the growth trend of this export can be maintained, it can be maintained, and it can be maintained. As a whole, whether the foreign trade relations can restore the past stable growth trend in the past. "</p>
<p><strong> The United States prohibits exports of key components in China, Taiwan's import and export to China will also decline </strong></p>
<p>Wu Sizhi mentioned that the demand for processing and industrial upgrading will drive the connection of import and export. Many key components and machine tools in China need to be imported from foreign countries. In the past two or three years, the United States has continuously blocked China on technology and has prohibited from exporting to China in the semiconductor industry, especially high -end chips. Technical restrictions, and many countries such as the United States, have doubts about Chinese stealing technical stealing in China, leading to a decline in China's imports.Wu Sezhi mentioned that China also showed a similar situation in attracting imports. The restrictions on related industries in China have led to a significant decline in China's imports, and the decline in April is nearly 8%. Whether the decline will continue to expand, it will be very related to the situation of China's internal economic development.</p>
<p>Wu Sizhi emphasized that the internal economic development of Chinese countries has not moved in the direction of industrial upgrading or is limited to a certain degree, and the demand for imports will decline. Furthermore, many foreign companies have lost confidence in China's operating market, and the external movement of foreign companies will also affect the overall needs of China's import.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Listening: I hope that the disassembly of the wall can help the Chinese people receive free information. Hope to increase communication satellites and medium short waves. Many people still use radio to listen now. I hope the whole world will be united to help the wall. There are still many people using smart speakers. Smart speakers must be identified and face recognition to make nine calls a day, so I feel very uncomfortable. If you do not pass your identity and face recognition, you can only call a few times a day, which is serious and very inconvenient.</p>
<p>Intersection Listening to friends: China has introduced new policies, "retreating to forests and farming", "digital RMB" and "agricultural management team" and so on. "Returning to the forest and returning to plow" reminds people of the previous "big steel refining and steel", and took the cooking pot to refining steel, and finally a bad tail. "Returning to forests to plow" may be because of fear of shortage of food. It may be that China is now tense with many countries. I am afraid that I can't buy food. "Digital Renminbi" is to monitor the people, and the other is the state treasury empty, and the money to hide the corrupt officials at home must be forced. But corrupt officials have heard the wind, and they have begun to turn the money to Hong Kong first, and then transfer to foreign countries. The "agricultural management team" is the same as "urban management", and farmers will suffer. This will force farmers to rebel. The ability of Chinese leaders to govern the country is very problematic. The people suffer in it.</p>
<p>Intersection Listening to friends: Regarding the Russian and Ukraine War, Chinese netizens were controversial. In fact, many military people, and those who have studied in Ukraine, think that China should stand on the side of Ukraine. Because Ukraine has important assistance in Chinese military technology.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Canadian Prime Minister Justintrudeau said on the 9th that it will not be "frightened" by China's countermeasures and the decision to expel Chinese diplomats. Tattoo is opposite. Earlier, a Chinese diplomat was accused of trying to intimidate the Canadian Conservative Congress, Zhuang Wenhao, and his relatives in Hong Kong. As a result, Canada announced that it was expelled from the Chinese diplomat and Beijing immediately made countermeasures.</p>
<p>Trudeau said, "We know that there will be revenge, but we will not be scared. We will continue to take all necessary measures to protect Canadians from foreign interference." He emphasized that Canada will issue a clear signal, indicating that it should be expressed that it should be the case, indicating that the signal should be issued, indicating that it should indicate that it should indicate that it should be expressed that it should indicate that the signal should be expressed. The country will not accept foreign interference. "No matter what they (Beijing) make a choice next, we will not be scared."</p>
<p>On the same day, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked about the incident at a regular press conference.

"It emphasized that China never interfered with other domestic politics and warned Canada that if" provocative "is not stopped," China will resolutely fight back. "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Tuesday (May 9) that the Canadian Consular Consular Consular Zhen Yihui was listed as a "unpopular person" and asked her to leave China before May 13.</p>
<p>Earlier, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly (also translated Zhao Meilan) announced on May 8th <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/加拿大召見中國大使-考慮驅逐外交官/a-65509675"></a>Zhao Wei.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T00-33-00Z/60062591_401.jpg" />Canadian Foreign Minister Joli said at a meeting of the Congress on the 5th that Canada was considering driving Chinese diplomats in addition to calling the Chinese ambassador. Four days later, she announced the deportation.</p>
<p>Canada announced in a statement that Zhao Wei was "unpopular". He was accused of trying to intimidate Michaelchong and Zhuang's relatives in Hong Kong, because Zhuang Wenhao has always criticized Beijing's Xinjiang Victoria policy in February 2012, and puts forward the behavior of Beijing in February 2012, calling Beijing's behavior " Race extinction.</p>
<p>"We will not tolerate foreign countries in any form of interference in our internal affairs." And said, "Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they are engaged in this type of behavior, they will be sent back to China."</p>
<p>Zhuang Wenhao said that it should have been dealt with this way. He said, "I hope this not only shows to the People's Republic of China, but also shows to other autocratic countries in Canada. The threat activity is completely unacceptable. "</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy subsequently issued a statement, accusing Canada of violating international law, "catering to the hype of anti -China forces", and said that this move destroyed Sino -Canadian relations.</p>
<p>The Canadian government spent a lot of time to decide whether to expel Chinese diplomats. Julie and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had warned Beijing that there would be a rebound in this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T00-33-00Z/64677232_401.jpg" />Trudeau, who participated in the coronation ceremony of King Charles in the UK, said in London on the 7th: "This is a serious and important issue ... This is an unspeakable decision. The Foreign Minister is dealing with this problem very, very cautiously."</p>
<h3>Event source</h3>
<p>The Canadian Global Post recently reported that the US Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) in 2021 showed a news that the Chinese government is studying how to intimidate Zhuang Wenhao. After the report was exposed, the Canadian government confirmed that it was expelled from Zhao Wei. Zhuang Wenhao also criticized the Canadian government to see Beijing's intervention in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Juli said last week that expelction may cause Beijing revenge, threatening the security of Canadians and the prosperity of the country, but it should be done. She wrote: "This decision was made after carefully considering all relevant factors ... We still firmly believe that defending our democracy is the most important."</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Zhuang Wenhao's incident was the latest attempt for the Chinese government to interfere in the Canadian internal affairs in recent years. Previously, Beijing also tried to interfere with the Federal elections in Canada's 2019 and 2021. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國疑干預選舉-加拿大總理任命特別專員調查/a-64837426"></a>Responsible for investigation, including whether to conduct public investigations.</p>

She regrets that she is about to close the leading UK app. Yang Qian said in an interview with Radio Asia on Wednesday that she felt very sudden, but she felt that a large number of companies stopped recruiting. Leading Britain withdrew from China for business considerations. She said: "It's a pity, many people in the workplace rely on this platform to find a job, meet people in the same field, and build different workplace circles. It is a very good professional social platform, and many people are looking for a job on it. Including our insurance industry to recruit newcomers, it is also established on this platform. "</p>
<p><strong> Leading members feel unfortunately closed by the platform </strong></p>
<p>Microsoft's social media network, which focuses on business professionals, has about 20,000 employees. It announced on Tuesday that there were 716 layoffs and decided to close the British workplace platform on August 9 to officially end China's business. This is another important action made by Lingying after closing the social network function of China two years ago.</p>

Because Lin Ying is a talent output and input platform, the current model of talent flow has been disrupted. As many foreign companies withdraw from China, it is because of China's domestic demand market. Weak, so he will give up China. "</p>
<p>The Lingying workplace platform mainly helps users to connect professional opportunities and assist employers to find ideal candidates.

<p><strong> Lingying closed China's remaining business related to the business environment </strong></p>
<p>Guo Baosheng, a senior commentator, also believes that Lingying's closure of China's business is related to the economic environment.

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Washington, 9th) The Federal Preparatory Council decided to raise interest rates 1 yard last week to fight inflation. John Williams, president of the New York Federal Preparation Bank, retains the elastic space for further interest rate increases today, but also emphasized that decision -making must depend on data.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-10T04-02-09-00-00/000000.png" />The Fed announced last week that the 10th increase interest rates were announced last week. Decision officials said that in the future, the impact of this wave of interest rates will be considered in the future. It is generally believed that this wave of interest rate hikes may be close to the end.</p>
<p>However, Williams told the "Economic Club of New York": "We did not say to end interest rate hikes."</p>
<p>He admits that he raises interest rates to suppress inflation. "In the past year, it has achieved incredible progress." But also said: "I think we must be as usual, based on data (to make decisions)."</p>
<p>Williams also said that in his baseline forecast, he could not see "there is any reason for interest rate cuts this year", because it also needs to reduce the high inflation.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Cheng Lei, a Chinese reporter, has been arrested and detained in China for more than 1,000 days. Since being arrested by the Chinese authorities in August 2020 with the "leakage of national secrets", the court has been tried again once on March 31, 2022, and the trial results have been delayed again and again.</p>
<p>Chenglei's partner, former CEO of the Chinese Australian Chamber of Commerce Nick Coyle, said in a DW interview this week that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳記者成蕾獄中受折磨-遲遲難與家人聯繫/a-63000785"></a>However, in the past, Cheng Lei can regularly conduct a 30 -minute consular visibility with Australian diplomats every month. After China's related restrictions on the new crown epidemic, they are currently visible face -to -face.</p>
<p>"This is a positive development. Cheng Lei is facing the fact that she is being detained as much as possible in the best physical and mental state. For her, the most worrying and concern for her is to separate from her children." Ke Ke. "Ke Ke." Ke Ke. "Ke Il revealed: "I and her family can pass the message to her through Australian diplomats during the consul, and the diplomats will also transfer her letter to me or her family after visiting her."</p>
<p>Koil added that the first six months after Cheng Lei was arrested, because the police were detained by the police in the way of surveillance and residence, it was very torment for her during that period. But he believed that Cheng Lei showed huge courage and toughness in the process. Through the letter transferred by Cheng Lei, Koil believed that Cheng Lei did not lose the sense of humor she had in the past.</p>
<p>The Chenglei case has not made progress. Australian Foreign Minister Pennywong (May 9) once again called on the Chinese government to reunite with her children, and reiterated that the Australian administration was worried about the continuous delay of the case. Some experts believe that the Australian government should continue to urge the Chinese government to maintain transparency in the Chenglei case, because her family cannot directly visit her, and the transparency will become the key question.</p>
<p>Danielagavshon, director of Australia, who observes human rights, told DW that human rights should be a key issue when the Australian government contacts the Chinese government. She said: "When a lawyer, family, or consular personnel can only contact the defendant detained by the Chinese government in a very limited way, a case like Cheng Lei will become very urgent."</p>
<p>Curier is sure <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中澳領導人可望見面-澳總理讓成蕾見家人/a-63050488"></a>After taking office, the government "has been actively dealing with the case of Chenglei." He said to DW: "Under the premise of trying to repair bilateral relations with the Australian government, they have continued to emphasize the importance of solving the case of becoming into a transformer case."</p>
<h3>Non -disciplined and non -interest triggering "Cicada Effect"</h3>
<p>Cheng Lei is not the only Australian citizen who has been arrested by the Chinese government for spy -related crimes in the past few years. Australian Chinese writer Yang Hengjun has been detained to this day after he was arrested at the Guangzhou Airport in January 2019. The Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court opened his trial of his "spy case" in May 2021, but has not yet obtained the final trial results.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the cases of Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun occurred in the context of the deterioration of relations between China and Australia, but some observers believe that it is difficult for the outside world to determine whether the two cases are Chinese government based on the limited news. The "hostage diplomacy" method of consistent use. Human Rights Observation Senior Chinese researcher Wang Yaqiu told DW: "Cheng Lei's case is still different from the cases of two Canadians. The two Canadians have been detained because China wants to retaliate against the Canadian government's arrest of Huawei Finance Meng Wanzhou, but Although the big background of the Chenglei case has deteriorated in China and Australia, the outside world is still unclear for her specific reasons. "</p>
<p>In 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the financial director of China, was arrested in Canada. Later, China arrested two Canadian citizens to pressure Canada in the "hostage diplomacy" model.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T05-38-00Z/63029997_401.jpg" />Cheng Lei's partner Koyer said that Cheng Lei was the first six months after his arrest, because the police were detained by the police in the way of surveillance and residence, it was very torment for her during that period.</p>
<p>However, Wang Yaqiu believes that the Chenglei case will definitely bring a chilling effect to foreigners living or working in China, because although Cheng Lei is not like the goal that the Chinese government will suppress in the past, after her arrest Too many news about her, this situation "will definitely produce a" cold cicada effect ". She said: "Cheng Lei's basic human rights were not satisfied, and she was still in the news that she had no news at all, so this shows that the Chinese government's persecution of human rights is more serious than before."</p>
<p>Koyer said to DW that he still puzzled the crime of the Chinese government's accusation of Cheng Lei. In his cognition, Chenglei could not have privileges to obtain the so -called confidential information. He said: "As a foreign journalist working on CGTN (China Global Television), she cannot contact those information. Cheng Lei is a enthusiastic Australian citizen, but in her journalist career, she has also promoted foreign countries Enterprises have developed well in Chinese or Chinese companies in foreign countries. As a business journalist, she believes that she wants to tell positive stories related to economic communication. "</p>
<p>Koil also shouted to the Chinese government, calling on the Chinese government to make a reasonable judgment on the Chenglei case as soon as possible. He said, "I understand that there is a system and program in China, but I also want to confirm that all parties can try their best to solve the current situation facing Cheng Lei, let her go home as soon as possible to reunite with her children."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/特朗普下台后的8种命运/a-56265154"></a>The magazine writer E.Jean Carroll accused her sexual assault and slander against her, and the New York jury determined that Trump was "responsible" on Tuesday (May 9) and had to pay 5 million US dollars for compensation and punishment. Compensation, but the jury rejected Carol's "rape" allegations.</p>
<p>In the civil claim lawsuit proposed by Corol, it covers three points including "forcibly touch", "Sexualabuse" and "Rape". The jury believes that Carol can prove that Trump is responsible for the previous 2 points, but Trump's behavior has not constituted "rape." According to New York State law, the term "rape" has its own definition, which is higher than that of sexual abuse or forcibly touch.</p>
<p>Carol, 79, accused of being edited by fashion magazine in the 1990s, she met Trump at Bergdorfgoodman in Bonorfgoodman and agreed to help him choose gifts for other women. Trump subsequently coaxed her into the locker room and raped. In 2019, Carol chose to make public the matter and officially reported it in 2022.</p>
<p>"Today, the world finally knows the truth." Carol said in a statement, "This victory not only belongs to me, but also every woman who suffers from being trusted." It is necessary to face a "wall of suspicion and intimidation", and the judgment is an important step to demolish this high wall.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T07-27-00Z/65567245_401.jpg" />Corolo went to the Federal Court of Manhattan on the 9th to charges her to sue Sichuan's sexual assault case to appear in court</p>
<p>After the layout, Trump's lawyer Joseph Tacopina told reporters outside the Federal Court of Manhattan that he would appeal. As long as the case is still appealing, Trump does not need to pay compensation.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this trial, Trump was absent since its beginning of April 25. After the verdict was released, he criticized his self -employed community platform "TruthSocial". The result was a "shame" and claimed to "do not know who this woman was at all."</p>
<p>In October 2022, Trump stated on his "Truth Social" that Carol's allegations were "downright fraud", "scams" and "lies", and even said that Carol was not his favorite type.</p>
<p>Corol said that she had remained silent by Trump with his power and wealth. Later, she saw dozens of women standing up and accused Hollywood producer Harveyweinstein's rape, which was deeply encouraged, so she decided to publicize Trump in 2019 and temporarily cancel such lawsuits in New York law in 2022. When restricting, the announcement will be reported. She said that Trump, who was still President of the United States, publicly denied the matter and then destroyed her career development, and his supporters continued to harass her on the Internet.</p>
<h3>What does Trump have been sued?</h3>
<h3>Trump's election is affected?</h3>
<p>Trump stated earlier that he intends to run for the 2024 US presidential election and return to the White House.</p>
<p>Reuters reports, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国历史上的新一天/a-56294248"></a>In the face of disputes that may cause other politicians to be in trouble, they can always turn danger.</p>
<p>According to the analysis, under the polarized political climate in the United States, this civil judgment is unlikely to shake Trump's core supporters. These supporters believe that the reason why he was in lawsuits was to be attacked by political opponents.</p>
<p>Charliegerow, a Republican party in Pennsylvania, said that the negative impact of this matter can be small, and it is limited to women in the suburbs and the gentle Republicans: "Anti -Trump will continue to oppose and support Sichuan Pu's core voters will not change. I think those who are swinging in the middle will not be moved by such things. "</p>
<p>Earlier, Trump had given this case in an e -mail that campaigned fundraising as an example. He claimed that Carol was a Democrat registered in the case. His accusation of this lawsuit was not only the conspiracy of the Democratic Party, but also her fabrication to make up for it. Species the means of recalling sales in 2019.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump appeared in court in April due to the "sealing fee case" investigating 34 forged commercial record felony. His public opinion survey did not decline and rose. In the case, Trump was suspected of paying a sealing fee to two love actresses before the presidential election in 2016, so as not to hinder the election campaign. Trump did not plead guilty and said that these allegations were politically discredited.</p>
<p>Democratic Lissmith believes that it is still difficult to predict the impact of the Coroel case judgment. Will this cause the Republican voters outside Trump's inherent foundation "difficult to accept" and then promote them to fall into the party to the party. Another candidate still needs to be observed.</p>

<h1>British Studies: Most antidepressants in the treatment of chronic pain are suspicious</h1>
<p>Publisher: 法新社</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 10th) A large -scale research report published today states that almost no evidence shows that most antidepressants are effective in treating chronic pain.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-10T09-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />However, British researchers engaged in this research emphasized that patients should not suspend their current drugs without authorization; they suggested that patients should ask doctors.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 1/3 people have experienced chronic pain (any pain that lasted more than 3 months).</p>
<p>For a long time, opium drugs prescribed by doctors for such patients are no longer recommended for most patients, because such drugs may be addicted and dangerous, especially in the long run.</p>
<p>Therefore, antidepressants have become prescription notes that doctors often prescribed for chronic pain patients, in order to alleviate pain in the brain that affects emotions in the brain.</p>
<p>However, a new inspection study of the medical information research organization "COCHRANE" shows that the effect and safety of almost all antidepressant drugs for chronic pain are difficult to determine. This is the first evaluation of all related topics.</p>
<p>Scientists from several British universities reviewed 176 trials, including nearly 30,000 patients, and they took 25 different antidepressants to treat chronic pain.</p>
<p>As a result, the researchers only believed that one antidepressant "Duloxetine" was effective for short -term pain.</p>
<p>Although this drug is also effective in fibromyalgia, muscle skeletal and nerve pain, researchers said that it lacks data with long -term side effects.</p>
<p>Another antidepressant "Milnacipran" can also reduce pain, but researchers have insufficient confidence in this because there are fewer research materials.</p>
<p>As for one of the most commonly used antidepressants, the most commonly used antidepressants, which is most commonly used for the treatment of chronic pain, the researchers said that they could not evaluate whether it was effective or safe due to lack of reliable evidence.</p>
<p>The main author of the study and the University of Southampton, the University of Southampton, said that doctors are easy to develop the habit of opening Amidelin.</p>
<p>Pinkes said at a press conference that 1/3 of chronic pain patients expressed affirmation of the placebo response, so doctors may also hear the praise of such drugs from patients.</p>
<p>Having said that, Pinkes emphasized that if the patient suddenly stops taking antidepressants, "it is really dangerous", "please talk to your doctor."</p>
<p>Researchers have called for better research and need to update health guide information in order to reflect the current best knowledge.</p>

The full name is the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China". But the madness named "Cultural Revolution" set off by a notice has changed the fate of countless people, and also deprived of the lives of countless people. Probably because people think that such an important notice in history, without a serious name, it can't be passed, so it uses the date it issued to give it a name and calls it the "May 16th Notice".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T10-29-39-04-00/000001.png" />The "May 16th Notice" published on May 17, 1967 on May 17, 1967. (Wikipedia)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-05102023093128.html/56fe72471.jpg"></a>The meeting of the May 16th Notice is what we mentioned in the previous lectures that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from May 4th to 26th, 1966 expanded the meeting. A total of 76 people attended this meeting in Beijing. At the meeting, they decided to defeat Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, and Yang Shangkun, and treated Mao Zedong's "sacrifice flag" to Mao Zedong. It was also at this meeting that they passed the decision to launch the Cultural Revolution and determined the fate of hundreds of millions of beings. It is particularly paradoxical that Mao Zedong himself did not attend the meeting, and the host of the meeting was Mao Zedong's number one attack target Liu Shaoqi.</p>
<p>So, what exactly did this very important notice say in history? Let's take a look.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the most anticipated common sense is that the vast majority of this notification is carried out in the name of criticizing Peng Zhen's "February Outline". We have said before that after Yao Wenyuan began to criticize Wu Yan's new historical drama "Hai Rui", under the leadership of Peng Zhen, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee passed a name "February Outline in February 1966 The document, trying to limit the criticism of Wu Yan as much as possible within the scope of academic discussion.</p>
<p>We have previously said that as early as July 1964, a "five -person group of cultural revolution" was established within the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The members include the first secretary and mayor Peng Zhen, and the Minister of Zhongxuan Lu Dingyi Kang Sheng, the head of the theoretical team of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Yang, deputy minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Wu Lengxi, the president of Xinhua News Agency and the president of the People's Daily. This group expanded the meeting once in February 1966. At the meeting, Peng Zhen expressed dissatisfaction with the criticism of Wu Yangang's launch. of"<a href="https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E4%BA%BA%E5%B0%8F%E7%BB%84%E5%90%91%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E7%9A%84%E6%B1%87%E6%8A%A5%E6%8F%90%E7%BA%B2"></a>", Also known as" February Outline ". This outline was passed by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China by Liu Shaoqi.</p>
<p>After the "February Outline" passed, Peng Zhen had previously reported to Wuhan to report to Mao Zedong, where he was there. In this report, Mao Zedong adopted a "hit Tai Chi" posture with an unclear statement, and seduced Peng Zhen to say that Wu Yan said that "it can be said to be anti -party and anti -socialism", which can be described as extremely deep. After that, Mao Zedong connected through his wife Jiang Qing and Lin Biao, thus launching a seminar on the symposium named Lin Biao and Jiang Qing. This question has a very low evaluation of the literary and art route since the establishment of the Communist Party of China in 1949. He believes that there is a "bourgeois" in terms of literature and art, which is opposed to Mao Zedong's "anti -socialism" "black line". And call on people to overthrow this "black line". In this way, Lin Biao, who symbolizes the military forces, showed his posture standing on the side of Mao Zedong. From this, Mao Zedong had enough confidence to do it directly to Peng Zhen. In fact, this "May 16th Notice" not only passed the seven modifications of Mao Zedong himself, but also some of the important paragraphs also directly from Mao Zedong's handwriting. Its drafting group was led by Chen Boda and Kang Sheng. Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Guan Feng, Qi Benyu and others also participated in drafting, and these people were all firm Mao factions in the Chinese Communist Party at that time. In other words, the May 16th Notice completely reflects Mao Zedong's will.</p>
<p><strong> Two, extremely high political tuning: The hair -style political discourse in "May 16th Notice" </strong></p>
<hr />
<p>"Notice of May 1st" at the beginning with a very high adjustment of the door, a violent attack on the February Outline said, saying:</p>
<p>"The central government decided to withdraw" [], which was transferred on February 12, 1966(https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E4%BA%BA%E5%B0%8F%E7%BB%84%E5%90%91%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E7%9A%84%E6%B1%87%E6%8A%A5%E6%8F%90%E7%BA%B2)", Revoked the original 'Cultural Revolution Five -person Group' and its office, re -established the Cultural Revolution Group, under the Standing Committee of the Politburo. The so -called "five -person group" report outline is fundamentally wrong, it violates the route of the socialist cultural revolution proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and it violates the socialist social class and the socialist social class and the socialist social class and Guidance of class struggle issues. This outline, the cultural revolution led and launched by Comrade Mao Zedong himself, at the Central Working Conference from September 1965 to October 1965 (that is, at the Central Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Central Bureau of the Central Committee At the Standing Committee Meeting), the instructions of criticizing Wu Yan, Yang Fengyin violated and tried to resist. ""The so -called" five -person group "report outline was actually just the outline of Comrade Peng Zhen alone. It was made by Comrade Peng Zhen with the" Five -Man Group "member Kang Sheng and other comrades. To treat such a major issue that is related to the overall situation of the socialist revolution, Comrade Peng Zhen has never discussed and discussed in the 'Five -Man Group' at all. The central censorship did not get the consent of Comrade Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Central Committee, and adopted extremely improper means, arbitrarily arbitrary, abused power, theft of the central government, and hurriedly sent to the whole party. "</p>
<p>In this way, the various charges represented by the February Outline were settled on Peng Zhen, and Kang Sheng, who is also a member of the "Five -Man Group", was led to the relationship. Next, the "May 16th Notice" puts the "February Outline" with a full ten "main mistakes", including "standing on the bourgeois stance" and "violating all class struggles are political struggles. The basic argument of Marxism, etc., also said that this outline distorted Mao Zedong's speech. It is worth noting that when the May 16th Notice criticized the February Outline, from the theory of Maoism, it completely denied that many people thought it was a righteous thing. Here I chose three paragraphs and read it for everyone.</p>
<p>The first paragraph is:</p>
<p>"When we started fighting the bourgeoisie's rampant attack, the author of the outline proposed that" Everyone is equal in the face of truth. This slogan is the slogan of the bourgeoisie. They use this slogan to protect the bourgeoisie, oppose the proletariat, oppose Marx, Leninism, opposed to Mao Zedong's thoughts, denying the class of the truth. The struggle of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, Marxism's truth as the bourgeoisie, and the fallacy of all the exploiters of the exploitation class are either the east wind overwhelming the west wind or the west wind overwhelmed the east wind. What equality is on. The proletariat struggling with the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and the proletarian in the upper building includes the dictatorship in various cultural fields. Wait, can there be any equality for these basic issues? "</p>
<p>The second paragraph is:</p>
<p>"Outline said, 'It is not only necessary to overwhelm each other politically, but also to truly exceed and overwhelm each other at the level of academic and business. This kind of thinking about academic boundaries is also wrong. The truth of academic grasping, the truth of Marxist Leninism, and the truth of Mao Zedong's thoughts have already greatly surpassed and overwhelmed the bourgeoisie. Outline of the method shows the so -called 'academic authority' touted and raising the bourgeoisie. Avise and suppressing our batch of new forces of the proletariat and fighting in the academic world. "</p>
<p>The third paragraph is:</p>
<p>"Outline proposes to" don't be arbitrarily arbitrarily like a scientific valve ", and say that" be vigilant on the road of bourgeois experts and academic valves'. What exactly is the 'academic valve'? '? Don't the proletariat do not dictatorship, don't overwhelm the bourgeoisie? Do you do not overwhelm the academics of the proletariat? The proletariat left, obviously to put on the hat of the "learning valve '" to Marxist Leninist, which supports the real bourgeoisie's academic valve and maintains their crumbling monopoly position in the academic world. In fact, those supported bourgeoisie The power of the capitalist road within the party of the learning valve, and those bourgeois representatives who enter the party's bourgeoisie -based learning valve are the people who do not read, read newspapers, do not contact the masses, do not learn. Arbitrary party lao who is arbitrary and overwhelming people ', stealing the party's name. "</p>
<p><strong> Three, the political logic of "May 1st Notice" </strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In fact, there are many similar murderous words in the May 16th Notice. Limited to the program time, I can't list all of them. Interested friends can find it for themselves. But from these paragraphs, we can already feel the basic logic in this notice: it believes that "everyone is equal in the face of truth" is just a slogan of a bourgeoisie. There is no equal relationship in class struggle, only one party, only one party Defeating the other party, according to the hair language in the notice, "either the east wind overwhelms the west wind, or the west wind overwhelms the east wind." In addition, it is believed that the class boundary should be divided at the academic level, and Marxism -Leninism and Mao Zedong thought and "truth" are equal to the number. This so -called "truth" that the so -called proletariat mastered the academic level is that "it has already greatly exceeded the great surpassment And overwhelming the bourgeoisie. " In response to the so -called "bourgeoisie academic", this notification uses a seemingly doubtful sentence, in fact, it is a strong confirmation of a question: "Don't the proletariat do not dictatorship, do not overwhelm the bourgeoisie? The academic academics that eliminate the bourgeoisie? Is it a 'academic valve'? "</p>
<p>In general, according to the logic of this notification, the so -called "bourgeois academic" is not qualified to compete with equal competition of "the academic" of the proletariat, and only the "overwhelming and elimination". Moreover, Marxism -Leninism and Mao Zedong's thoughts are equal to the truth, and it is a supreme criterion. The "proletariat" greatly exceeds the "bourgeoisie" because of the mastery of this "high standard". In the face of the crushing of this so -called "truth" and "the highest standards", the "bourgeoisie" is not worthy of equality at all, only with "dictatorship". Speaking of which, I don't think we need to make more analysis, because the bloody and crazy atmosphere behind this thought has come to us.</p>
<p>After listed the top ten crimes, the notice made a qualitative conclusion on the February Outline, saying:</p>
<p>"In short, this outline is to oppose the socialist revolution to the end, oppose the cultural revolution line of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, combat the proletarian left, shelter the bourgeois right, and prepare for public opinion for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. The reflection of thought in the party is a downright revisionism. Struggling to fight with this amendment line is definitely not a trivial matter, but the fate of our party and the country, the future of our party and the country, the party and our party and our party and the country The future of the country is also a top priority that is related to the World Revolution. "</p>
<p>From these words, the "February Outline" can be said to be "crime and evil" in the Mao faction. Class thought and thorough revisionist route. As for the struggle against this "revisionist line", it is related to the so -called "party and the country" and the fate of the "world revolution", and even "a top priority related to the world revolution." It can be said that according to this logic, Mao Zedong's struggle against Peng Zhen and the February Outline was simply saving the earth, and Peng Zhen has become a kind of "public enemy of the earth".</p>
<p>So, how do Mao faction do this so -called "saving the earth"? There is a very famous words in the "Notice of May 1st", summarizing what Mao Zedong wants to do next. In this regard, we will give a detailed description in the next lecture.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone. This is here this week, we see you next week.</p>

<h1>In the past 20 years, the United States has monitored the United States to destroy Russia's malicious software</h1>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Washington, 9th) The U.S. Department of Justice said today that it has cut off the "precision" malicious software network engaged in espionage activities in 50 countries in 50 countries in the Russian Federal Security Agency (FSB). NATO) Alliance.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-10T10-32-07-00-00/000000.png" />U.S. officials said that the Russian Federal Security Administration has previously successfully implanted malware SNAKE or UROBUROS into computer systems around the world, mainly for government networks, research institutions, reporters, and other goals.</p>
<p>They said that the computers in these systems are also used as relay nodes to hide the SNAKE malware in and out of traffic in the target computer system.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice stated that in the long -term operations, the FBI installed its computer code in the system and instructed to Snake, causing malicious software to cover itself, and so that Snake could not operate.</p>
<p>Lisamonaco, deputy Minister of Justice, said: "U.S. law enforcement authorities have allowed Russia's malicious software to kill each other through high -tech operations, destroying one of Russia's most precise online spy tools, and Russia has used this in 20 years Tool promotes autocratic goals. "</p>
<p>Computer network experts have known this malicious software for at least 10 years. The US Internet Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the Russian Federal Security Agency began to develop the software in 2003.</p>
<p>CISA claims that Snake is "the most precise Internet spy tool in the weapon library of the Russian Federal Security Agency". It has a strong hiding ability and is extremely difficult to detect in computer systems and network traffic.</p>
<p>In addition, CISA said that this tool is also designed to be easily updated and corrected, and "due to the high degree of complexity, the program is wrong."</p>
<p>These levels have allowed the Russian Federal Security Agency to engage in spy operations without being detected through huge hosting networks for many years, invading computers with sensitive files.</p>
<p>CISA said that at least in one case, Snake was installed in a system of NATO countries, allowing Russian intelligence agencies to access and leak sensitivity international relations documents and foreign communication content.</p>
<p>CISA said: "The effectiveness of this type of cyber spy implantation software depends on its long -term hidden traceability."</p>

<p>Chen Long said that he and many rights defenders were very worried about the situation of Yu Wensheng's husband and wife. Due to the strict control of the authorities, he could not explore and help take care of their sons.</p>
<p>Chen Long: "The couple of Yu Wensheng really did not have the news until now, because there was no lawyer to meet, and they could not understand the actual situation of them now, and they were really worried. The child was also pitiful. He just comforts the children. We just hope that there are many friends who can pay attention to the Wen Sheng family and visit the children, but the social environment has caused a lot of people because of this deterrence. "</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yu Wensheng was detained, and I was worried about their children being involved in innocently, so I just found an opportunity to see him. As soon as I did my best, I could give him a comfort, so that he was not abandoned by the tenderness of the world; Seeing his situation, he gave him three or five thousand to let him spend this hard time. At least the material is not very bad, and he can also give a recommendation lawyer. He has set up privacy on WeChat and cannot add friends. Those who block me think they are conspiracy!&gt; <a href="https://t.co/ONul1MBL4F"></a>&gt;&gt; - Wen Donghai(@near_wen) <a href="https://twitter.com/near_wen/status/1655929259842736128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">&gt; </a>** Overseas rights protection lawyers are worried about the situation of Yu Wensheng's husband and wife.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Wang Qingpeng, a lawyer in the United States, was very concerned about the situation of Yu Wensheng. According to her understanding, Yu Wensheng's relatives were warned by the authorities and could not entrust the lawyer to make the outside world more difficult to understand the situation of the two, which is worrying.</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng: "Lawyer Yu Wensheng had just been released from prison. Before that, his wife had been calling for him. Now even his wife was arrested and could not speak for him. The current family members have not been entrusted by the maintenance of stability, and the lawyer cannot meet. , So I do n’t know the specific case. Lawyer Yu Wensheng is a very firm human rights defender. He has been arrested many times. This time he was arrested again. In the scope of Chinese law and international laws, they were repeatedly sentenced, so I couldn't imagine how lawyers Yu Wensheng and Xu Yan would be dealt with. "</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng said that before the disappearance of Yu Wensheng, he had been arrested many times before he was disappeared, and his son lived under intimidation and threats for many years. She believes that the encounter of the second generation of activists is the most real example of China's human rights.</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng: "At present, the son of lawyer Yu Wensheng suffers a microcosm of the second generation of rights protection lawyers. We see that Wang Quanzhang and Li Heping are constantly being relocated, followed and threatened by national security. In adulthood, I have been growing up in such an intimidated and threatened environment, and some can not even go to school. For example, lawyer Xie Yanyi's daughter. From the encounter of the lawyer's lawyer, we know that the human rights situation in China is in a bad and bad person. Environment."</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng, the initiator of "one person, one push in the political prisoner", said that according to past experience, international attention will help improve the situation of the person who is defended. More than 1,500 detained political prisoners believe that the attention of all walks of life can help improve their situation.</p>

<p>According to Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post", China's investment in Europe fell to a decade in 2022 because China's Qing zero policy and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical factors put pressure on capital flows.</p>
<p>Last year, China's investment in the European Union and the United Kingdom was only 7.9 billion euros ($ 8.7 billion), a decrease of 22%from the previous year. This brought China's investment in Europe to about 2013; some time after 2013, the "Belt and Road" initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping brought a large -scale expenditure of China's foreign investment.</p>
<p>According to a joint study by the US think tank Rhodiumgroup and the Merics Institute (Merics), China's global foreign investment has also fallen sharply, consistent with its trends in Europe.</p>
<p>China ’s investment in Europe last year is currently concentrated in four countries: Britain, France, Germany and Hungary, and China’ s investment in the four countries is more than half of the so -called green space investment limited to electric vehicle battery manufacturers. quick.</p>

<p>Reuters reports that the USPSTF working group said that it will be greater for black women from the age of 40 for black women, because black women usually have more aggressive breast cancer, and their survival rate is lower.</p>
<p>The new guidelines overthrew the suggestion of the 2009 expert group. At that time, the USPSTF committee suggested that women start at the age of 50 to start a conventional breast X -ray examination. It is not recommended that women start breast X -ray examination in their 40s. It is suitable.</p>
<p>Former USPSTF Chairman Manjeon said that at the time, women in their 40s performed breast X -ray examination. After deducting the potential harm caused by the inspection, there were not many benefits.</p>
<p>Now the diagnostic technology and treatment methods of breast cancer are greatly improved. She said: "The situation today is very different from the past."</p>
<h4>Expert: At the age of 40, the mortality rate of breast cancer will be reduced by 20% at the age of 40</h4>
<p>Manonene said that the incidence of breast cancer of young women has been rising, and the technology of digital breast images has improved, which has improved the accuracy of X -ray examination, and better treatment methods have also improved the survival rate of patients.</p>
<p>She also said that the new computer model shows that if women's breast cancer screening every two years starts from the age of 40 instead of from the age of 50, and if all women who meet the breast X -ray examination will perform breast X -ray examination, The mortality rate of breast cancer in the United States will be reduced by 20%.</p>

<p>The amendment is the latest major changes in legal and political aspects of this international financial center city. After large -scale democratic protests in 2019, China has been working hard to clear the voices of Hong Kong's objection.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been highly praised for allowing international lawyers to participate in the general law tradition of cases.</p>
<p>However, after the National Security Law, which was implemented in 2020, the Hong Kong government said that foreign lawyers participating in cases would bring "potential risks".</p>
<p>Lin Dingguo, director of the Hong Kong Department of Justice, said on Wednesday that the right to choose a lawyer in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region refers to the right to choose a lawyer or a barrister who has a comprehensive qualification in Hong Kong as a legal representative, but does not include overseas lawyers who have not qualified for comprehensive practice in Hong Kong.

<p>In December last year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China awarded the Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao to prevent foreign lawyers from participating in the power involving national security cases and overthrew the previous ruling of the Hong Kong High Court. Owen's work visa extension application has also been put on hold.</p>
<p>Legislative Councilor Lin Xinqiang said on Wednesday that he was disappointed with the an exception of the amendment to allow foreign lawyers to apply for an exception to participate in the National Security Law case. He said at the Legislative Council: "The kindness of the enemy is cruel to ourselves."</p>
<p>Li Zhiying's legal team argued that the government had infringed his rights and argued that he was accused of illegal security law.</p>
<p>The legal team also filed a lawsuit on the National Security Council of Hong Kong and the entry affairs of Hong Kong and Hong Kong's immigration.</p>
<p>Both cases have been tried and are waiting for the decision.</p>

<p>Mining has made Mongolian wealth for ten years. Locals said that this has promoted the vigorous development of the construction industry, thereby squeezing it to the earnest needs of public services from hospitals to children's playgrounds.</p>
<p>OTGOO said, "I was mixed outside when I was a kid. We would play football, running in an open area like a wolf or rabbit." He was unwilling to interview with a full name.</p>
<p>"My child can't run as deliberately as us, the new apartment building is full of places."</p>
<p>Mongolia's mining industry flourish the economy and grows double -digit. Last year, the huge profits created by coal mines accounted for 25%of the domestic production hair.</p>
<p>The mining industry has long led Ulan Bato's wave of office space and luxury apartments.</p>
<p>The rapid development of Ulan Bato has been chaotic. The population increased from 500,000 in the 1990s to about 2 million people last year. This has also led to traffic knotting into a commonplace. Just commute to and from work to get a few hours.</p>
<p>However, the vital people's infrastructure has not kept up with this wave of construction. Parents said that many children can only grow in an environment without outdoor leisure facilities.</p>
<p>There are almost no large playgrounds, schools and hospitals in space covering a space, and many related facilities still remain during the period of the Communist Party more than 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Ulzii is the mother of 3 children. She said: "My child has the opportunity to go outside on the weekend. They always stay at home and let the 3C screen accompany."</p>

The Nazi submachine players in black uniforms throw up binding books towards the fire, and the name of the banned writers such as Corsterna is played in the treble speaker: "Opposition to fall, oppose moral degradation!Defend family and country's public order and customs!I want to take Heinlihiman(Heinrich Mann)The books of Ernst Gläser, Erich Kästner (Ernst Gläser), was a bonus. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65512299_401.jpg" />Berlin Berbel Square, which witnessed the Nazi Burning Book</p>
<p>The above scene took place on May 10, 1933. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/80多年前的纳粹焚书事件/a-51626150"></a>Essence</p>
<p>Wernertre, a historian who wrote many monographs on the burning incident, said: "If there is no Nazis and no incident incident, then the cultural diversity of Germany and the innovative spirit that emerged in the 1920s must be possible. Continue. "The cultural and artistic revival of the Weimar Republic period quickly disappeared after the Nazis came to power. The brick band of books on May 10th is an iconic event.</p>
<h3>Cultural elite fled one after another</h3>
<p>As early as the start of the book, many banned writers have left Germany, such as Alfred Kerr, Bers Brothers of Thomas Und Heinrich Mann, Erika Und Klausmann)Brothers and sisters, Else Lasker-Schüler, Irmgard Keun, Ernsttoller.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65532385_401.jpg" />During the Nazi rule, Erica Und Klaus Mann, who was forced to exile,)Brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The cultural elites of the Weimar Republic fled from Germany. Because from the day Hitra came to power on January 30, 1933, they had realized that they had no future in Germany.</p>
<h3>Nazi's rival: Jews, left -wing people, and liberals</h3>
<p>A few years ago, the Nazis revealed the determination to kill the opponents. In addition to all Jews by the Nazis, they also include artists with different political opinions. Everyone who refuses to accept the Nazi ideology will be characterized as "non -virtue" and become a banned alien. The blacklist of the banned works and writers continued to be updated. As of May 1933, there were more than 200 writers on the blacklist, and one year later, the banned works were as many as 3,500.</p>
<p>Writer Remark is particularly hated by Nazi. In 1928, he published the novel "No War in the West", which reflected the cruel scene of World War I, and was moved to the screen by Hollywood two years later. The peacetime concept shown in the work makes the Nazis and conservatives feel dissatisfied. In their opinion, this is a great insult to German soldiers. In 1930, when Hollywood filmed films of the same name in Germany, the Nazi charge shocked the theater under the encouragement of Gobberl, who was official to the Minister of Publicity in the future, and was banned by the film for a time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/64972651_401.jpg" />The writer Remark's "Western Line No War" was moved to the screen three times, winning six Oscar awards.</p>
<p>When the work was banned, the writer Remark had left Germany. As early as 1933, he immigrated to Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Open letter from the United States</h3>
<p>Castner may be the only writer who watched his book was burned on the evening of May 10, 1933, and at the same time, the New York Times published an open letter for German college students. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/历史上的今天大学生成为纳粹德国焚书运动主力/a-16799195"></a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65512130_401.jpg" />Keller, an open letter who opposes the Nazi Burning Book</p>
<p>"If you believe, you can stifle your mind, then you obviously have not learned the lessons of history. The tyrants have tried to kill their minds many times, but their thoughts have never been defeated and the tyrants are in the end."</p>
<p>The author of the open letter is the American deaf and blind female female writer Helen Keller. Like Jack London, Hemingway, Gorky and other foreign writers, Keller's works are also banned and burned in Nazi Germany.</p>
<h3>"Kaskat is standing there"</h3>
<p>On May 10, 1933, in Berlin's burning operation, another lady suddenly shouted: "Kaskat stands there." The writer himself later wrote: At this moment, the witness of the burning operation, Kaskat, felt "extremely uncomfortable." He left the book of burning, but stayed in Germany, and the hardships of life could be imagined. However, because he was not a Jewish, he insisted on the collapse of the Nazis in 1945.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/55813568_401.jpg" />In 1970, the writer Caskat at a book reading meeting.</p>
<p>Persecution, torture, death, but most people are not so lucky. Reporter and writer Carl Vonossietzky was arrested in 1933. After many years of imprisonment and torture, he died in a hospital in 1938 in a closely ruling hospital. Anti -military writer Erich Mühsam was killed in the Orainburg concentration in 1934. German Jewish poet Grtrud Kolmar, a German Jewish poet who stayed in Berlin, died at the Oswelin concentration camp in 1943.</p>
<h3>Successful writer in exile</h3>
<p>Among the German cultural elites that have left their hometown, they can continue to engage in cultural undertakings and succeed. They include Blacht and Thomas Man.</p>
<p>Historist Trees said: "For American universities and cultural institutions, a large number of immigrants from Germany are simply an unexpected harvest, and their influence is still there. Unable to make up for it. "</p>
<h3>The place where the book is burned will eventually burn people</h3>
<p>There is such a inscription on Berlin Berpier Square where the Burning Burning Memorial Museum is located: "The place where the book is burned will eventually burn people." The memorial is a lighting ground full of empty bookshelves designed by Israeli artist Ulman.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65512309_401.jpg" />Burning Book Memorial on Berlin Berbel Square</p>
<p>This sentence was originally a work from German Jewish poet Heine in 1820, but the Nazi period turned into a cruel reality. Trees said: "The Nazis burned books in 1933, burned the Jewish Church in 1938, and began to burn people in the massacre against European Jewish in 1942/43."</p>
<h3>Burning Book: Not Nazi independent</h3>
<p>Heine is certainly not a prophet. The reason why he wrote such a sentence was to reflect the religious trial in the Middle Ages of Spain. Burning books are not the originality of Nazi, but have a long historical heritage. Whether it is Christianity or the history of Islam, there have been more than hundreds of years of burning books. The ancient Greek and modern Iran and Russia have also appeared in the incineration books.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/64062196_401.jpg" />German Jewish poet Heine: The place where the book is burned will eventually burn.</p>
<p>All autocratic regimes in the world are afraid of words based on freedom, because this will threaten their dominant position. It is based on this fear that the Nazi also burned the poet's work on May 10, 1933, and Heine himself died of Paris as early as seven0 years ago.</p>

<p>During the conference, the representative of the Human Rights Organization "World Uyghur Congress", Haiyuer Kuerban, was invited to speak in the name of "DachverBandkritische", and put forward their factory in terms of human rights in the factory in terms of human rights. Worry.</p>
<p>Kurban told this station: "I mainly ask Volkswagen to close the factory in Urumqi in the speech, and to completely cut off all the Chinese companies that involve Uyghur forced labor in China."</p>
<p>Kurban said that Volkswagen Volkswagen, as one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers, is also the only company that establishes production business in Xinjiang. Ten years ago, the company established a production line in this area where the Chinese authorities persecuted Uighurs and other ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>For the concerns of human rights issues, the World Uyghur Congress has long required Volkswagen to not establish factories in Xinjiang. Especially in 2017, after the CCP authorities under the leadership of Xi Jinping implemented a series of racial extinction policies in Xinjiang, the World Walight will worry about Volkswagen’s company’s company’s company’s There are more forced labor problems in the supply chain, and it has also exerted greater pressure on public opinion.</p>
<p><strong> British university report disclosure: Western car manufacturers involve Uighurs forced labor </strong></p>
<p>Kurban specifically mentioned that a survey report from Sheffield Hallamuniversity in the United Kingdom stated that there was a lot of connections between automotive factories in Western countries and Uyghur forced labor. The raw materials and processing of many Chinese parts suppliers are in Xinjiang, so the international supply chain is easy to involve the issue of human rights such as compulsory labor.</p>
<p>"This report is very clearly showed that Volkswagen, especially Chinese companies that are directly linked to and played a very important role in the Volkswagen's supply chain. The concentration camp directly mobilized to various production plants for Uighurs who forced labor, "Kurban said.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, about ten activists interrupted the speeches of the executives at the shareholders' meeting, condemning the company's vehicles forced by forced labor, and waving a banner written by "ending Uighurs forced labor". Another protesters cast a cake to the chairman of Volkswagen, forcing him to bow his head to avoid. The security personnel subsequently took the protesters out of the venue.</p>

Except for a few people, everyone follows the specified guidance policy."</p>
<p><strong> Is the Volkswagen setting up a factory in Xinjiang? </strong></p>
<p>So, how does Volkswagen's concerns about the human rights issues of the Xinjiang plant respond? Kurban said: "They all know the CCP's destructive policy of the CCP, and they all have high attention to this aspect. But they avoid one of our main requirements, that is, close the factory of Urumqi."Kurban said that although they cannot independently verify this statement, the size of the public in Urumqi is much smaller than its factories in other parts of China. Relevant economic analysts in Germany believe that the factory is not good in production efficiency and economic efficiency, and has not brought any economic profit to Volkswagen in 10 years.</p>
<p><strong> Kurban: Underestimating Political Risks Volkswagen is now in trouble </strong></p>
<p>Kurban believes that the Chinese authorities have made Volkswagen's factories in Xinjiang to make it more dependent on China, and Volkswagen's senior management may greatly underestimate the political risks brought by the Xinjiang plant to them. Today, the local situation has evolved into the harsh situation of "racial extinction", and Volkswagen is now in dilemma.</p>

<p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FBI) destroyed a set of malicious software used by the Russian elite spy and cut off the "precision" malware network engaged in spy activity in 50 countries in 50 countries in the past 20 years. Alliance.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Reuters and VOA reported that senior US law enforcement officials said that FBI technical experts identified and disintegrated the malicious software used by the Russian Federal Security Agency for unknown US computers. They hope that this will cause a fatal blow to one of Russia's major cyber spy projects.</p>
<p>US officials said on Tuesday (May 9) that the Federal Security Agency had previously successfully implanted malware SNAKE or UROBUROS into computer systems around the world, mainly for government networks, research institutions, reporters, and other goals.</p>
<p>Computers infected by SNAKE around the United States and around the world have become a channel for the stolen data back to Russia.</p>
<p>The US Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said that Snake is the most precise cyber spy tool in the weapon library of the Russian Federal Security Agency. It is particularly strong and difficult to detect in computer systems and network traffic.</p>
<p>This has allowed the Russian Federal Security Agency to engage in spy operations without being detected through a huge hosting network for many years, invading computers with sensitive documents.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice said that Snake was "implantation of the Russian Federal Security Agency's premier network spy malware."</p>
<p>US Minister of Justice Garland said in a statement: "The Ministry of Justice and our international partners have demolished a global computer network with malicious software. Including our NATO allies. We will continue to strengthen collective defense to deal with the damage and stability of the Russian regime to destroy the security of the United States and our allies. "</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice said that the FBI was removed by the court's approval and codenamed Medusa, and the Snake network was demolished. The MEDUSA operation used a tool called Perseus created by FBI, paralyzing the Snake malware of the infected computer.</p>
<p>FBI is working with other national authorities to inform other victims infected by Snake.</p>
<p>The court documents announced on Tuesday introduced the department of the Russian Federal Security Agency as Turla. How is a well -known Russian Federal Security Bureau's facility known to the Russian city?</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice said the department has repeatedly upgraded and modified malware to ensure that it is still Turla's "the most complicated long -term cyber spy malware implant".</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Damascus, 10th) Syrian Presidential Palace said today that President Arabic received an invitation letter from the Arab League summit in Saudi Lahara next week. This is the first time that after the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, Asedes were invited to attend the summit for the first time.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-10T15-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />The ArableAgue was originally suspended in Syria in November 2011 because the Aceride regime suppressed domestic protests. These demonstrations broke out earlier in 2011, and finally evolved into civil war, causing more than 500,000 people to die, millions of people's displacement, and Syria's infrastructure and industry were also severely hit.</p>
<p>However, on the 7th of this month, the Arab League has welcomed Syria to return to the league. This also caused the Arabic regime to be accepted by the Arab state after many years of isolation.</p>
<p>In the statement, the Presidential Palace said that Ased was invited by Salman Bin Abdulaziz ALSAUD to receive the invitation of Saudi Arabian, "Participate Essence</p>
<p>According to a statement, Adeld said that the summit will "strengthen the United Arabic operations to realize the desire of the Arab people." The last time he attended the Arab League summit, back to the meeting held in Libya in 2010.</p>
<p>After more than 10 years of diplomatic interruption in Saudi Arabia and Syria, it announced yesterday that it will restore the operation of each other's diplomatic representative agencies. Lyad cut off relations with the Aseride government in 2012, and long publicly advocated that Aseide stepped down, and even supported the rebels in the early days of the Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>But in April this year, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal Bin Farhan ALSAUD visited Damascus to meet with Aserdide. It was the first time that the Saudi Minister of the Syrian war in Syrian officially visited the Aseride government for the first time.</p>
<p>Since the junction of Syria and Turkey in February this year was attacked by a strong earthquake, and in March, the regional diplomatic activities have been continuously changed in the Middle East's political landscape in March. Tehran is a close ally of Damascus.</p>
<p>After the relationship between Aydd hopes that the relationship with the rich Persian Gulf countries can alleviate economic pressure and bring the required funds required for reconstruction. Because of the Syrian conflict political solutions that have not yet been generated by the United Nations, Damascus still cannot obtain wider international funds.</p>
<p>However, analysts said that Western sanctions on Syria are likely to continue to scare away investment.</p>
<p>The United States and the United Kingdom said yesterday that they still oppose establishing relations with Asedes, but cooperate with Arab countries that restore relations with Syria.</p>
<p>Although the Syrian frontline war is roughly silent, there are still large areas in the north that are not controlled by the government, and political solutions cannot be seen in front of them. (Translator: Zhang Zhengyu/Calculation: Lin Zhiping)</p>

Is there an exception of this law that Chinese people buying a house in the United States? The exception is that if citizens from the above -mentioned 7 countries hold a specific U.S. visa, they can be allowed to hold a property, but they need to be registered with the relevant departments of the Florida government; Chinese citizens holding non -tourism visas can buy a single area of not more than 2 acres of acres. Land and need to be at least 5 miles away from military facilities.</p>
<p>These bills have been supported by the Governor of Florida Desandis and Republican and some Democratic members, and are regarded as an important measure to ensure US national security. Juneteufel Dreyer, a professor at the Department of Political Department of the University of Miami, who specializes in the issue of the Chinese Communist Party, believes that the restrictions on Chinese citizens are actually very limited.</p>
<p>"The range of two acres of land is quite large, and there are many land 5 miles away from military facilities. In addition, people who are born and growing up in China can buy anything they want." Jin Defang said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T15-53-00-04-00/000001.png" />The bill called "SB264: Foreign Interests" prohibits Chinese citizens from "buying or obtaining real estate" in Florida or has more than a small amount of "indirect interests of this kind of real estate". The picture shows the scenery of Miami in Florida, USA. (Reuters information picture) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/cm-05092023103515.html/000_329k3qb.jpg"></a>So, what do local Chinese residents think of the above legislation? Mr. Chen, who lives in Orlando, Florida, expressed his support to this state law in writing. He believes that many Chinese in China have invested in real estate in Florida, becoming the promoter of house prices in Florida, and also aggravated the pressure on the house purchase of locals in Florida.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also said: "The Chinese Communist Party is circled all over the United States. They often buy in the name of businessmen or companies, but behind the CCP direct instructions, this is a direct threat to the United States."</p>
<p><strong> Chinese people love Florida the most </strong></p>
<p>In recent years, Florida has become one of the most popular home entries in the Chinese. According to a report released by the National Association ofrealtors last year, Chinese investors invested a total of $ 6 billion in US real estate from March 2021 to March 2022, becoming the third largest foreign investor in the United States in the United States ; Among them, the investment in Florida accounted for 24%, ranking first.</p>
<p>Franklin, a real estate agent who practiced in Florida, told this reporter that the proportion of investment in China in the Florida in the past is indeed high, but due to the restrictions of the new crown epidemic and the Beijing Qing zero policy, the real estate in Florida is now in Florida. Most of the buyers from the United States are estimated to have an impact on the local housing market after the implementation of the above state law.</p>
<p>Frank: "There are places where Chinese people come to buy a house are generally fast, and the market is relatively happy. Of course, the impact on the (housing market) is of course very nervous. In addition, this bill is issued, and other states will also Imitation will of course affect. Originally our business could grow, but this part (Chinese business) need not be considered, but we still do a lot of the American people and Chinese (business). "</p>
<p>Frank believes that the basis of the local public understands that the relevant legislation is from the consideration of protecting US national security and ensuring that the land in Florida is not controlled by the Communist Party of China or related entities. Its regulations are prohibited from discrimination based on racial, nationality, religion or gender in housing sales. In addition, Mr. Chen, a resident, also believes that there are many disputes in the law, and I am afraid that it will cause trouble to the Chinese people with legal work status.<strong> Worried about increasing racial discrimination Chinese lawyers will join for* </strong></p>
<p>The bill had previously passed the 95:17 votes in the Florida Senate. Democratic State MP FENTRICEDRISKELL, who held opposition, believed that the bill was "too extensive" and tended to "discriminate based on national blood."</p>
<p>In addition, dozens of Chinese people have traveled outside the state parliament building to protest. In an interview with the legislature Chinese lawyer, Hongweishang, a Florida Chinese lawyer, said that the legislation violated Article 14 of the US Constitution Amendment on the prohibition of discrimination and may exacerbate American society's racial discrimination against Chinese.</p>
<p>Shang Hongwei: "We can understand (bill) for national security considerations, and target these countries, governments, and officials (restrictions), but this law confuses government agencies with individuals, because individuals do not represent the government, private enterprises, nor do they represent the government. A completely different concept is a law that is discriminatory. From a government department to a bill, a statement is issued, and restrictions on people or people in a certain race or nation will cause all the races, nations, or similar people to cause similar artificial artificial artificial arts, or people who look similar to people. Bad influence. "</p>
<p>Shang Hongwei said that the "Chinese American Legal Defenseall" and other Chinese lawyer groups plan to file a lawsuit against the above legislation.</p>
<p>One of the founders of the "Huamei Rights Protection Alliance", Clayzhu, said in a written statement to the station that the law's restrictions on the Chinese are "too wide". The statement said: "We agree to protect the goal of national security, but we must achieve the method of compliance with the constitutional peace and multiple core values. This law in Florida is specifically targeted at Chinese and other specific groups. This is based on racial and national discrimination. ","</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese government has been accused of increasingly possessing American agricultural land, causing concerns from all walks of life. Incidents that have attracted attention from public opinion are that some Chinese citizens purchased farmland near a Air Force base in North Dakota in 2022. This move prompted the US federal government and multiple states to begin relevant legislation in order to restrict entities and individuals with Chinese backgrounds and individuals. Buy real estate or agricultural land in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning had considered the United States' considering prohibiting Chinese citizens from buying real estate in the United States on February 10, criticizing the United States to "generalize the concept of national security and politically put the issue of economic and trade investment.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Pakistan Electric Power Minister Khurram Dastgirkhan said in an interview last weekend that Pakistan has ordered a group of Russian oil and pays in US dollars, but they hope to pay RMB next.</p>
<p>He said that Pakistan hopes to form a long -term arrangement in the trading of the rupee and RMB so that it can use other opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that the use of RMB imported oil is good for Pakistan, because Pakistan is seriously dependent on energy imports and the risk of debt defaults in the country is trying to restart the US $ 6.5 billion rescue plan for the International Monetary Fund. However, this expectation of Pakistan also meets the desire of Russia's hopes to get rid of the US dollar and euro exports, which is conducive to promoting the internationalization of the RMB and weakening the dominant position of the US dollar in the international community.</p>
<p>The report emphasized that the renminbi is being degraded in global trade. At present, China and India are gradually using Renminbi, rubles or Diram (UAE currency) to import Russian oil.</p>
<p>In addition, some Chinese media reported that Brazil, ASEAN and other countries began to turn to the use of RMB settlement in trade and financial transactions, and Argentina also began to directly pay goods imported from China.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Free Fund Commission said on its webpage that at first, the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office was to provide a platform to allow Hong Kong to promote trade and economic relations with other countries on the international stage. The staff of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office enjoys diplomatic status in the United States. However, since the CCP has increased its suppression of Hong Kong and destroyed Hong Kong's relative autonomy, the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office now acts as an agent of the Communist Party of China and directly instructed the policy to the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>This open letter states that there is an act of abuse of power, including lobbying American politicians, surveillance exile people, and organizational cultural activities. Essence The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office no longer fulfills the mission to encourage trade between the United States and Hong Kong, but instead has unnecessary intimidation to Hong Kong people who escape from the Chinese Communist Party. The U.S. Congress should take action immediately to solve the problems brought by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office as a "diplomatic outpost" in China.</p>

<p>Cheng Lei, a Chinese reporter of Australia, who was arrested and detained by the Chinese government, has been detained for more than a thousand days. Although the court secretly opened the trial at the end of March last year, the trial results were delayed so far.</p>
<p>According to the Voice of Germany, Cheng Lei's partner and former CEO of the Chinese Australian Chamber of Commerce, NickCoyle, said in an interview this week that Cheng Lei is currently working hard to maintain a healthy state, but what she is most worried about and cares about is with. His children are separated.</p>
<p>Koyer said that during the epidemic, Chenglei can regularly conduct a 30 -minute consular visibility with Australian diplomats every month; after the epidemic seal is closed, he can currently visit face to face.</p>
<p>Australia Foreign Minister Pennywong (Pennywong) once again called on the Chinese government to reunite with her children on Tuesday (May 9). Some experts believe that the Australian government should continue to urge the Chinese government to maintain transparency in the Chenglei case.</p>
<p>Although some people believe that the case of Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun occurred in the context of deterioration of China -Australia relations, but the specific reasons for Cheng Lei were still unknown to the outside world. Another observer believed that it was difficult for the outside world to be based on the basis of the outside world.

<p>According to Reuters, the Australian Minister of Trade Don Farrell will arrive in Beijing on Thursday to talk to the Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao on Thursday to seek a comprehensive restoration of the normalization of Australia's exports to China.</p>
<p>China used to be the largest trading partner in Australia, but since 2020, because Australia has called for a thorough origin of the new crown virus, Australian -China relations have become tense. The 5G products of China Telecom giant Huawei are prohibited. But since this year, the trade between China and Australia has gradually recovered. The Australian government has expressed their joy in this, which is also the background of Farrell's visit to China.</p>
<p>However, in the other side, in the latest government budget just announced by the Australian government, the $ 1.3 billion budget to the surrounding Pacific island nations is added to develop relations with these countries in the next five years. The Associated Press pointed out in the report that this is the influence of Australia's growth in the region in order to compete in the region.</p>

<p>A report released by the South Korean Institute of Development (KDI) on Wednesday (May 10) states that the prosperity of the Korean semiconductor industry is close to the bottom, but it is still difficult to expect the recovery of the semiconductor market.</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reported that the report of the South Korean Institute of Development Research said that considering the replacement cycle of 60 % of computers and mobile devices in semiconductor demand, it is expected that the prosperity of the semiconductor industry will end in the second and third quarters of this year, but now it is expected that the semiconductor market will fully recover the Sales market. It's too early.</p>
<p>A research member of the economic outlook room of the hospital said that considering that the demand for computers and smartphones has increased, the semiconductor industry's prosperity may begin to recover in the middle of next year. However, due to the greater global economic uncertainty next year, the specific situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The report also pointed out that the downturn in the semiconductor industry not only repeats exports, but also has a negative impact on domestic demand, and it will even become a factor of deterioration of tax conditions, which will continue until next year.</p>
<p>According to analysis, if the export volume of semiconductors decreases by 10%, the GDP of South Korea (GDP) will be reduced by 0.78%; if the price of semiconductor fell by 20%, GDP will decrease by 0.15%. However, the semiconductor industry has limited impact on the employment market.</p>
<p>The report said that the recent prosperity of the semiconductor industry is mainly caused by the sluggish sales of the storage chip. In the first quarter of this year, system chip sales decreased by 11.1%year -on -year, and the storage chip decreased by 56.3%. Because South Korean semiconductor exports focus on storing chips, it is relatively vulnerable to the influence of the prosperity fluctuations of the industry.</p>

<p>The BRICS countries will discuss the feasibility of common currency during the South African summit, but South African Foreign Minister said that countries should not make any decisions.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that the US interest rate hikes and geopolitical conflicts have pushed up the price of commodity prices in the US dollar and the US dollar pricing, and harmed most emerging markets. This triggered the appeal to replacing the US dollar as global trade currency with other currencies, and a choice is to allow the BRICS Group (BRICs) consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa to use its own common currencies. This topic may be included in the BRICS Leaders Summit in Johannesburg on August 22.</p>
<p>South Africa Foreign Minister Naledipandor said in an interview with Cape Town on Tuesday (May 9): "This is a question we must discuss and moderate. Success is because it is very difficult in economics. You must consider all countries, especially when you just get out of the crisis and are in low growth. "</p>
<h4>Saudi Arabia and Iran and other 19 states to join</h4>
<p>BRICS countries account for more than 40 % of the world's population and nearly one -third of the global economic output, making it one of the most important economic groups in the world. 19 countries including Saudi Arabia and Iran have expressed their interest in joining the group.</p>
<p>Pan Duer pointed out that the BRICS and other countries proposed, "Why can't we use our own currency to trade? Why do we insist on trading through the US dollar?" She said: "South Africa has a currency used in international transactions. We hold a lot of US dollar debt, so we must take this discussion responsible. "</p>
<p>VESTACT, an investment management company headquartered in Johannesburg, believes that the US dollar may maintain its leading currency status for a long time. A report from the company said: "No other currency has such recognition, stability, and economic strength behind ... the only currency that can be replaced by the US dollar is the euro."</p>
