The problem of mental depression has become more serious in China in recent years, especially the risk of young people suffering from depression is significantly higher than those of other ages.

Her sister Li Silin posted on Weibo that Li Yan suffered from depression a few years ago. She was born lightly at home on July 2. After the rescue was invalid, she died on July 5.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In the past 20 years, the incidence of mental disorders and depression in China has grown explosive, and the age of patients has also declined significantly. In February this year, a team of the National Mental Health Evaluation Development Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Psychological Institute issued the "China National Psychological Health Development Report (2021 ~ 2022)". The report shows that the risk of depression in Chinese adults is 10.6%. Among them, young people are high -risk groups in depression, and the depression risk detection rate of the aged group aged 18 to 24 reaches 24.1%, which is significantly higher than that of other ages; It is also significantly higher than the age groups of 35 and above. At the same time, the age differences of the detection rate of mental anxiety risk also show similar trends.</p>
<p>The report shows that the so -called "depression risk" is not a "depression" diagnosed by a professional physician, but refers to the measurement of the interviewees using the standard psychological test method. The possibility of depression.</p>

<p>So, what impact does the mental health of young people have on social development? Ren Ruihong, former Minister of Medical Rescue Department of the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, told this station: "This generation is actually the backbone of society, it should be the golden period of rising career, and to contribute to society. However, if the entire group (psychological) If there is a huge problem, you can imagine it like an explosive library. You don't know which day will erupt. "</p>
<p><strong> Female young people who follow human rights: fear but not understood </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the problem of mental depression, Wang Xia, who lives in a rental house in Beijing and is in a semi -lost state, told reporters that the first sentence was: "I almost jumped off the building yesterday afternoon."</p>
<p>Wang Xia graduated from the university for 3 or 4 years. The recent depression was due to her and her mother quarreled on the phone. She said: "When I answered the phone, she cried for a long time to her (mother), and shouted, and then I pushed the window on the balcony. At that time, I wanted to jump off the building, but my boyfriend quickly put it from behind. I hugged. "</p>
<p>Wang Xia has quarreled with her mother for many days, the direct reason is that she thinks that her mother is too strong and can't understand her: "Because there are too many things that my family does not want her to see." She said, "I don't want to let my mother see things" Souvenirs related to domestic human rights resistances are collected at home.</p>
<p>Since his college days, Wang Xia has paid attention to the issue of human rights of China. After graduation, she left her hometown to work in Beijing and continued to participate in human rights and public welfare activities. In the past two years, China's human rights and legal system has retreated, but Wang Xia still overcome his inner fear and participated in the assistance of people and young actors, including the arrested people who called for the rescue of the "white paper movement" last year. Although she did not do any "big things", she still experienced many trauma in her heart, and therefore had symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>She said: "Once, I visited a family member of a friend who was in trouble. At that time, I was discovered by the National Security and was intercepted for one or two hours. That night, I started insomnia. It is difficult for me to concentrate on work and have been drinking. "</p>
<p>However, Wang Xia cannot relieve it by telling his family through these inner pain and pressure. She said: "My parents are all people in the system, and my mother is very desire to control. She likes to interfere with my private life and is also very contempt for my values. This feeling makes me feel disgusting and fearful."</p>
<p>China ’s psychological counseling services are expensive, and many so -called doctors do not have qualified qualifications. Wang Xia is also difficult to evaluate the risk of consulting such“ political depression ”. As a result, she has not been able to get good psychological counseling. In addition, the unstable work and the meager income also made her a serious sense of insecurity. She can only take antidepressants from time to time. Fortunately, her boyfriend often accompanies and gives her spiritual comfort and encouragement.<strong> College students who have been "duty" by the school </strong></p>
<p>Wang Xia's boyfriend Xiao Sun is still studying in college. They met in a group that discussed politics and came together because of the three views. However, in the school, Xiaosun is also the object of being closely monitored and suppressed by the school.</p>
<p>Xiaosun said that he initially refused to install the "National Anti -Fraud Center" application in accordance with the requirements of the school, opposing the program to collect personal information, and became the "objender" in the eyes of the school leader: "In fact, I didn't do anything too much too much Excessive confrontation, I did not call for others to resist with me. I just didn't pretend to be alone, but I was very low -key, but my counselor interviewed me. His attitude was actually quite bad, and talked to me. about an hour."</p>
<p>During the epidemic in 2022, Xiao Sun's university started from August to the outbreak of "White Paper Movement". However, the school's control regulations for students are verbally transmitted by teachers. Without text, students are dissatisfied, but it is difficult to complain. Xiaosun applied for information disclosure to the school's party committee office and requested the announcement of the relevant policy documents of the school. At that time, he also consulted a rights protection lawyer and did not expect that their WeChat private chat was discovered by the National Security.</p>
<p>Xiaosun said: "National Security directly found our school's defense office and asked to investigate me. I was continuously interviewed. Our principal was in charge of me. They whole me. "</p>
<p>Under the huge pressure, the little grandson had to give up the application for information disclosure. Later, the counselor also arranged a classmate in the same dormitory to monitor him and report his dynamics at any time. This made him feel very annoyed and fell into anxiety: "I will know that someone will stare at me at any time. I don't have any privacy and no sense of security."</p>
<p>Another reason why the little grandson feels anxious is that every Chinese college student is facing a huge academic pressure and employment pressure: "On the first day of enrollment, the dean gave us new students. I ca n’t find a job, only one road for postgraduate entrance examination. The entrance examination rate is so low, so everyone is basically desperate. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-06T-30-34-00-04-00/000005.png" />On August 26, 2022, young people participated in the job fair in Beijing. (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/kw-07062023111918.html/000_32h69ad.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-06T-30-34-00-04-00/000006.png" /></a><strong> Nightmare in the workplace of young women in the system </strong> **</p>
<p>Not only do students in the university feel depressed and desperate, but also young people who have been employed smoothly also feel that the status quo of social status that distorted them made them difficult to adapt. Liu Fang, who was in a small city, was diagnosed with depression after graduating from college for 4 years. She believes that this is first because the values they insist on are incompatible with the social work environment.</p>
<p>Liu Fang said: "If they criticize me, I am more" Chongyang Mei ", and my thoughts are westernized. I am more believed in that kind of universal value, that is, freedom and equal civil rights (people). It's equal. "</p>
<p>Liu Fang, who is straightforward, doesn't like blind obedience at work, and even disdain his superior. She said, so she was squeezed by the boss of the direct boss: "He feels like a emperor, and the people underneath must figure out the intention, but I am just not doing so. Picking my work, for example, I committed a small punctuation or a page number error, and he would say, do you come to work or come to play. When you have a weekly meeting, you will pick me out. , Scolding for half an hour to an hour, and this kind of PUA (referring to spiritual control) scolding. "</p>
<p>Liu Fang said that in addition to being publicly humiliated, her boss also had some sexual harassment behaviors, but she was directly rejected. This made her boss more dissatisfied with her. Liu Fang described that her mental abuse has been "like a nightmare" in recent years, but because the economy has continued to decline, she has not been able to find a job after the resignation, so she has to endure.</p>
<p>At the same time, Liu Fang also felt that the oppression of women in the entire Chinese society was still intensifying, including social hot news that harmed women such as "iron chain women" and "Tangshan beating incident", which caused huge in the heart of Liu Fang who advocated feminism. Impact: "No wonder many people say that in China, a marriage certificate is a seller. Because a man is married to you, he can beat you, scold you, slavery you, and then snatch your fertility results The results of labor. However, all people, including law, are supporting him. "</p>
<p>Because of being disappointed with the society, Liu Fang had been refused to fall in love, get married and had children, and was under pressure from his parents. In March of this year, the doctor confirmed that she suffered from depression.</p>
<p><strong> The people became more depressed after the epidemic? </strong></p>
<p>In the past three years, the various severe epidemic control measures of the Chinese authorities have also caused serious negative impacts on the mental health of the people. Some surveys showed that during the closure of Shanghai last year, more than 40 % of Shanghai residents showed depression, and the number of psychological hotlines increased.</p>
<p>So after the epidemic, have people's psychological conditions improve?</p>
<p>"Let's say that, no one around me tells me that they are happy." Zhao Di, who is in Shanghai and is still in his 30s, told the reporter that now there is a big crisis in the country, whether it is private enterprises, state -owned enterprises or foreign companies, a lot of crisis, a lot The layoffs are very common: "In the past three years, everyone's dreams have been broken. Everyone feels that they have fallen into the bottom of the valley, and they lie flat. If you are not lucky, you carry millions of mortgage loans. There will be a feeling that life is not as good as death or every day. "</p>
<p>Zhao Di, who has long worked in foreign companies for a long time, said that as an important foreign window of China's economy, she only knows Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Western foreign companies that she knows. In the past two years, she has almost gone half or even 70%. In the first four months of this year, the economy has recovered slightly, but after the May Day holiday, it is a cliff -like deterioration. She explained: "Many people have found that they have not improved in these months, then I will retreat quickly and keep my life tight. In this way, I think (economy) is difficult to recover in the short term and years. Because of the recovery and reconstruction of confidence, this is based on the year (calculated). "</p>
<p>With the deterioration of the economic environment, what Zhao Di felt more depressed is that the space of speech was also significantly reduced, especially after the epidemic. She said: "Sometimes, I even saw that some netizens on the Internet were judged to be 'negative energy' or '" disagreement "because they talked about their unemployment, they did not get compensation, or they had to consider arbitration. The title is really inexplicable. "Zhao Di said that not only the friends around him have been blocked. Many of her online Vs who have been paying attention to on Weibo and Zhihu have also started from the epidemic, and because of the "red line" of some public opinion, And being stunned.</p>
<p>"When our main communication channel is cut off, everyone will feel very embarrassed, just like being covered with mouth, and then this feeling will ferment in our hearts. Sex depression. "Zhao Di said.</p>
<p><strong> "This society is sick" </strong></p>
<p>Ren Ruihong, who had specialized in the youth psychological rescue project in China, told this station that the reason why Chinese young people's psychological problems are now prominent, mainly due to the high pressure and instability of the survival of the social environment.</p>
<p>"In the entire environment in China, we all know that economic pressure is great and social security is serious. Everyone is in a state of concern ... Many people in this generation are concerned about politics, especially in large cities. In the past They can also flip the wall and the net to complain, and now they are definitely dare not. "Ren Ruihong believes that young people in China have been squeezed under various pressures. To emotional exit.</p>
<p>"Most people's tolerance cannot be so good. When the extreme is reached, this negative emotion will spread throughout the society, (formed) a social depression." Ren Ruhong said.</p>
<p>Liu Fang mentioned earlier also told reporters that as long as you open the social media, everyone is venting their negative energy. Almost everyone has some kind of crazy thoughts: "This psychological disease has developed to this stage. I think this is not a personal problem, this is already a group trauma. "</p>
<p>Zhao Di said frankly: "I always feel that this society is sick, and now I can do it with one post or a few doctors." She believes that Chinese society has come to this day, everyone There are responsibilities, because many people are not a good person. "I think what everyone can do is start from themselves, don't do evil again. To be a good person, then such a society may gradually improve."</p>

<p>Ruan Fuzhong has been in the Supreme Leadership of the Vietnam for more than 20 years. In October 2022, the General Secretary of the Vietnam Communist Party visited China to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It was the first foreign dignitaring to visit Beijing after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p><strong> Beginning in May this year, Vietnam frequently protested due to the activities of a Chinese scientific examination ship in the South China Sea. On June 25, the USS Ronald Reagan Reagan Reagan's "Ronald Reagan" visited the Honggang of the Central Town in central Vietnam to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the "comprehensive partnership" of the United States and Vietnam. </strong></p>
<p>Some analysts said that after the rise of China, the United States and Vietnam not only became increasingly closer to economic and trade relations, but also had a common concern for Beijing's military expansion in the South China Sea. Vietnam has always expressed protests on China's sovereign demands in the South China Sea. This week's American film "Barbie", which is about to be released in the country, has been blocked because it appears as a "South China Sea Nine Section Line" map.</p>
<p>Does Vietnam turn to the "pro -American Anti -China" route because of the South China Sea issue? The answer may not be. Many studies have recently pointed out that Washington has urgent to win Hanoi. Because for the senior management of the Vietnam Communist Party, it is the number one event to maintain the regime. Associate Researcher Bill Hayton told the US media.</p>
<p>Professor Tuongvu, director of the US -Vietnam Research Center of the University of Oranga, also said that for the high -level senior management of the Vietnam, the dispute in the South China Sea is not as important as the outside world thinks. He told BBC Chinese: "They (Yue Communist Party) hate this issue because it threatens the survival of the regime, which is what they really care about. At the same time, they try to use this issue to gain benefits from the United States, including assistance and entering the US market Opportunity."</p>

However, between Vietnam needs to be balanced between maintaining political and economic relations with China and the South China Sea issues. He said that if the interaction between Hanoi and the United States is considered too friendly or supported by the US regional strategy that is regarded as anti -China, it may take the risk of damage to Beijing.</p>
<p>In October 2022, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam met Ruan Fuzhong met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He was the first foreign dignitaries to visit Beijing after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. At the end of June, at the same time when Liden visited Langang, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh was invited by Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang to arrive in Beijing and started his first visit to China after he took office.</p>
<p>When Fan Mingzheng met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 27, he rarely mentioned the possibility of researching and developing high -speed railway cooperation between the two countries. At the same time, he called on China to continue to accelerate the opening of Vietnamese agricultural products into the Chinese market. According to the Taiwan Media Central News Agency, in the past, during the high -level and high -level meetings of the Yue, Yuefang repeatedly mentioned the willingness to increase the volume of bilateral railways, but it publicly mentioned that the plan to connect the high -speed railway between the two countries is quite rare. Xi Jinping stated that he was willing to import more Vietnamese products. At the same time, he called on "the two parties should jointly oppose the 'detachable chain' and oppose the generalization of economic and scientific and technological issues."</p>

<h3>American playing Vietnam?</h3>
<p>The Reagan aircraft carrier visited Vietnam's port at the end of June. This is the third visit since the end of the Vietnam War. Treatment of the attention of all walks of life and Beijing's warnings.</p>
<p>Pretta told BBC that the visit was an important sign of the United States and Vietnam's coordination and enhancement, indicating that Vietnam welcomed the United States' navy in the region (compared with China's opposition). Liden's visit to Langang was after the South China Sea dispute occurred in the Vietnam. At that time, the Chinese ship sailed in the exclusive economic zone of Vietnam at that time. The analysis may be to challenge Vietnam's oil and natural gas mining.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun, a researcher at the "Institute of Defense Security" in Taiwan's official think tank, said that from the perspective of geographical strategy, Vietnam is the last puzzle that surrounds China. He analyzed that Donaldtrump's strategy during Trump was to attract Vietnam and North Korea to block China in close range. During the Bayeng period, it gave up North Korea and focused on consolidating South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Therefore, Vietnam became the last geographical puzzle of Biden. Su Ziyun emphasized that Vietnam is facing the South China Sea, so geographical importance is second only to the first island chain country facing the Pacific "outer rays", but it is still attractive for Russia and China of the "inside line". Rent the naval base at Jinlan Bay as the southern base of its Pacific Fleet.</p>

<p>Image adding text,Professor Su believes that Vietnam's strategic attitude is to play an American brand "may even accept US military aid." Therefore, in the Latin American system of Hanoi, the former colonial country France dispatched military aircraft for short -term visits to the station, which is obviously a strategy of power balance.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun told the BBC that the US -Vietnam security relations will be closer. For example, former US President Obama (Obama, Obama) canceled restrictions on Vietnamese military sales in 2016. After taking office, Trump began to provide unpaid military aid for Vietnam, with a total of 92 million US dollars in 2022. "With the poor performance of the Russian military reserve in Ukraine, this makes Vietnam's future military reserve may turn to the West (India has already appeared this effect), which will be more beneficial to the expansion of the United States with the security and military cooperation with Vietnam. The net is further carried out, "he said. However, Price told the BBC that the interview of the Riden may not be as important as the outside world. Because, in a sense, this may be made up for an interview, because Vietnam canceled a plan last year.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States has always hinted that Hanoi is willing to upgrade bilateral relations to "strategic partnerships."</p>
<p>However, some analysts said that the Vietnamese cards that the United States played in order to block China is not as successful as the outside world, or there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p>Haydn at the Chartham Institute said, "Vietnamese leadership is Leninist who regards the democracy supported by the United States as the biggest threat. Compared with the United States, China's problem is insignificant."</p>
<p>The latest published "Economist" refers to Vietnam, India and Taiwan as Beijing's opponents in Asia. However, many analysis believes that the economic connection between Vietnam and China is too deep, and it is impossible to join the United States to block China.</p>
<p>Professor Zacharyabuza, a professor at the National War of the Washington National War, said in an interview with VOA that Beijing was confident that "Vietnam knew that he was an independent actor and firmly refused to take any action to be considered to be hostile to China by Beijing." He suggested that the White House must recognize the sensitive issues that Hanoi cares about, "it cannot be clearly improved to improve Vietnamese relations with China."</p>
<p>From these analysis, the United States is looking forward to upgrading relations with Vietnam this year, from the third diplomatic level of Hanoi to the second level (China, India, Russia and South Korea is the first level), which seems to be unlikely to meet the standards under the influence of Beijing. The United States is the main investment country of Vietnam, the largest export market in Vietnam, but China is the largest trading partner in Vietnam, which is also vital to Vietnam's manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>In 2020, Xisha District and Nansha District, Sansha City, Hainan Province, China, caused a rebound in Vietnam and issued a statement to protest. The United States, which deployed the Indo -Pacific strategy, also responded. The Xisha Islands are under actual control of China.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted Vietnamese officials that although the United States hopes that the upgrading of diplomatic relations with Vietnam is largely symbolic, "but Vietnam's leaders are hesitant and worry about China may retaliate." (Bicht. Tran) Tell Reuters, "Considering the intensified competition between China and the United States and the distance between China and Vietnam, Hanoi may not want to formally upgrade a comprehensive partnership with Washington."</p>
<p>Dr. Huynh Tamsang, the National University of Ho Chi Minh City, Tamsang, told BBC Chinese that in order to offset China's increasing pressure in the South China Sea region, Hanoi now really requires the support of the United States, especially in terms of security and defense. But the leaders of Hanoi also need China's political support to maintain and strengthen the status and legality of the Vietnamese Communist Party: "I believe that Vietnam will continue to take a hedging strategy." He said that the connection between Hanoi and Beijing due to ideology and economic exchanges are connected. Being close, becoming an American allies at the expense of Sino -Vietnam relations will undoubtedly cause criticism and revenge from Beijing leaders.</p>
<p>Professor Wu Youxiang University of Orean University believes that, in fact, for many years, there have been no qualitative changes in the relations between the United States and China and the Vietnam. For example, every summer, Zhongnanhai dispatched some ships to the disputed area of the South China Sea to declare sovereignty, while Hanoi responded symbolically, so that the outside world believes that they care about the South China Sea issue. "Vietnam wants the United States to maintain expectations, and hope that in the future, it can establish a closer relationship with Vietnam, so that they will not criticize Vietnam's increasingly obvious human rights violations." He told the BBC.</p>

<p>Vietnam's economic achievements have been quite eye -catching in recent years.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese folk attitude towards China</h3>
<p>According to Pewresaerch's investigation in recent years, Vietnamese folk attitude towards the Chinese government has become deeper and deeper. A survey released by the center in August 2017 shows that Vietnam is the country in the Asia -Pacific region, the most unreasonable country in China, surpassing Japan, which has been in harmony with China for a long time. Only 10%of Vietnam's respondents like China. Moreover, the Pew report pointed out that Vietnam ranked first among countries that regarded "China's economic power growth" as bad things. At the same time, when asked about Xi Jinping's positive impact on the global international situation, Vietnamese are the worst confidence among all countries.</p>
<p>Analysis of the rise of the Vietnamese society's anti -China atmosphere. Professor Huang Qiongzheng, a research expert at the University of Political Science of Taiwan, pointed out that in Vietnam in authoritarian countries, the lack of civic society, and the people's anti -China attitude has been led by the government, and in recent years, it has become increasingly strengthened. But she emphasized that the Vietnamese folk anti -medium atmosphere did not happen after the rise of China.</p>
<p>After that, after the Vietnam of Vietnam ruled Vietnam, the operation became more and more obvious, "even shaking the relationship between Vietnam." Professor Huang emphasized that the official Chinese policy is inconsistent with folk emotions and has caused many contradictions. In other words, Hanoi often needs to face the problems of how to balance the "consolidation of the people's hearts" and "national interests".</p>
<p>For example, in the anti -mid -to -medium atmosphere, if the Vietnamese government is unable to justice to Beijing, the people's disappointment with the government will also fight against the Vietnamese government. For example, in 2014, when China moved the drilling platform HD981 to Vietnam, Vietnam believed that there was a sea area where the ownership had the right to belong to the Chinese area, and many foreign factories in Pingyang Province in the south were destroyed, and the government took a laissez -faire attitude. In June 2018, the people of Vietnam believed that the newly launched "Special Economic Zone Law" will be preferentially treated in China, causing tens of thousands of people to protest on the streets and shocked Hanoi high -level.</p>

<h3>U.S. and European policy: From the "decourse" to "risk" strategy or consensus consensus?</h3>
<p>July 6, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-06T06-39-03.000Z/_111769454_whatsubject.jpg"></a>Image source, getty image</p>

<p>After the epidemic, multinational companies moved out of the production capacity out of China for the consideration of decentralized risks.</p>
<p><strong> In the past three months, "De-Risking" is undoubtedly a hot word in social media. The "decoupled" theory of the United States policy in the United States under Trump under the rule of Trump before. </strong></p>
<p>It is believed that the concept of "de -risk" was first proposed by the European Commission Chairman Ulsula von Delain in March, and the G7 summit was written to the G7 summit to the communiqué, and the diplomatic visits in June and July were being visited by June and July. Repeatedly mentioned that "de -risk" became the latest consensus dominated by the West of China.</p>
<p>From "decoupling" to "risk", does this represent the strategic shift of Europe and the United States to China? Or is strategic refinement? More importantly, what are the considerations behind the "de -risk" and why China opposes it? BBC Chinese combing and interviews for in -depth analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65915282">Why do the United States end China's "developing country" status</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65997546">Li Qiang visited Germany and France to test the EU's "de -risk" bottom line</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science-65854500">Why does the US -China Semiconductor War entering the artificial intelligence AI chip in Deepwater District become the key</a>### "Deepening Risk" Consensus</p>
<p>In a speech at the end of March, Feng Delin set the tone for his upcoming China trip.</p>
<p>On the one hand, she emphasized that "decoupling" with China is neither feasible nor in the interests of European interests. Therefore, Europe did not respond to Trump's initiative to "decoupling" with China at that time. As soon as the words turned around, she said, this is why we will focus on "de -risk".</p>
<p>In other words, "risk" is relative to the word "decoupling".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66117744/p0ffg17s/zh-hans">Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/Chinese-News-66117744/P0FFG17S/ZH-HansS</a><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-06T06-39-03.000Z/p0ffg1tq.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in China on April 5, 2023 for a three -day visit. EU Chairman Ursula Von Derleyen also visited at the same time.</p>
<p>"Delayed" is a common word in Trump's speech. For example, in an interview in August 2020, Trump said that the Sino -US economy may be decoupled. He said, "We do not need to do business with China. Later, he talked about the decourse and said, "That is to say, if I am sure they do not treat us in the right way, I will definitely do that."</p>
<p>In the past three months, from Biden to Macron, European and American leaders quickly accepted the new word "risk".</p>
<p>On April 27, the word Jack Shalin, a US National Security Consultant, used the word in a policy speech, "We are pursuing risks instead of decoupling ... Risks fundamentally mean the flexible and effective supply chain, Make sure we will not be coerced by any country. "</p>
<p>Then, at the G7 summit in Japan in May, the "de -risk" was accepted by the Seventh Kingdom Group as a whole and was officially written into the bulletin.</p>
<p>From July 6th to 9th, US Finance Minister Yellen visited China. At a hearing of the House of Representatives of Congress before the trip, she continued to explain the word. She said that despite the need to propose reports of Chinese infringement of human rights, decoupling with China will be "a huge mistake". Americans can buy in China in China. The cheaper products that are cheaper to "greatly benefit", and China also benefits from exporting products from the United States, which is also conducive to the US economy. "This is why stopping trade with China will be disastrous. Risks to risks. ? Very good. Described? Absolutely not. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-06T06-39-03.000Z/_130041498_gettyimages-1250106326.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>"I can imagine this word, either everyone thinks about meditation, and then a president calls with another Prime Minister, everyone coordinated, in recent months, mention the word. Saying 'Risk -risk', other leaders patted the table, saying that the word is good, we also use it, "a scholar who has taught in the Mainland and Hong Kong Business School for a long time told BBC in Chinese. He said that the most important role of this word is to clear the boundary with Trump's bottomless line of diplomacy, which appears rational and responsible, and does not offend voters who have already hatred Chinese.</p>
<h3>Europe</h3>
<p>After careful investigation, the starting point of "risks" in Europe and the United States is different.</p>
<p>The German media "Commercial Daily" explained that the Russian and Ukraine War made Europe alert and relying on opponents in economics, which will cause Europe to fall into a terrible situation, so it is necessary to "risk." Different from "decoupling", the purpose of "de -risk" is not to be economical in economics, but to enhance Europe's own economic pressure resistance.</p>
<p>National Security Consultant Sarawon said that risks focused on high -tech, especially semiconductor fields to prevent China from surpassing the West. The United States is actually doing it, and the "small courtyard wall" is built in the fields of chips. And it seems to be significant -according to the latest data from the SEMI of the Global Industry Association, under the US trade sanctions, the sales of Chinese chip equipment decreased by 23%year -on -year in the first quarter of this year, while global chip equipment sales increased by 9%.</p>
<p>In other words, Europe has strengthened its own industrial chain security for its own ability to resist risk, so as to transfer some industrial chains to achieve the purpose of "risk" to China. The United States has risks to the height of strategic competition through the strict restrictions of key areas to remove China as its main strategic competitors that surpass or even threaten its own risks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-06T06-39-03.000Z/_111389091_1c5de1f8-ab54-4e06-b0f0-c5fe5d8063a4.jpg" />Image source, reutersBefore and after the epidemic, the geopolitical relations between Europe and the United States and China have also deteriorated sharply, which has exacerbated the differences in issues such as Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Russia. The United States has launched Friend-SHORING, calling on the supply chain to transfer to "countries with common values."</p>
<p>The above -mentioned scholars said that "risk" is the product of the two trends. It has enough vagueness, because Europe, America and Japan can define their "risks" when facing China.</p>
<p>Liu Ningrong, dean of the University of Hong Kong's Chinese School of Commerce, wrote that, for European, American, Japanese and other countries, although the meaning of "de -risk" is not the same, it can become the largest convention for their policy in the post -new era in the post -new era. The mainstream view of the European Union is to emphasize that "de -risk" is different from "decoupling", not isolation China, but to enhance Europe's own economic pressure resistance. For the United States, compared with "decoupling", the word is more neutral and easier to accept the world, but the United States will not change the strategy of decoupling in the high -tech field because of this, nor will it give up to block and isolate China. The established policy.</p>
<h3>China's "de -risk"</h3>
<p>Western public opinion generally believes that shifting from "decoupling" to "risks" is "Songkou" in Europe, America and Japan, and trying to dilute the tension with China's tension and camp.</p>
<p>But China has not been so positive at the official level.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Germany. He shouted to the business community that you have me and me among the world economy. You should dialectically treat the dependence. "Not cooperating is the biggest risk, and not development is the biggest insecurity."</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency's reports even more toughly pointed out that the purpose of "de -risk" is to equate China and "risks" to seduce the Latin alliances from the past to "decoupling" in the past because of the United States' pressure on China. In order to take the initiative to "de -risk" and then "de -Chineseize" the spontaneous state, it has achieved its overall "decoupling" to contain strategic assistance to the United States.</p>
<p>"Although China has a great response, in fact, China should be grateful to a certain extent. This is a compromise made by the recognition of China's importance." The above scholars said that under Western democracy as a whole, it is impossible to make 180 degrees changes. In particular, when China threatened to become a rare consensus in Western society, it can only use "de -risk" as a pragmatic attitude. Although it is still emphasizing that China is a "risk", it also acknowledges that it is decoupled from China and cannot afford it. In this context, China has a game with the West.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-06T06-39-03.000Z/_114094876_gettyimages-1125206653x.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>In fact, China is also "risk."</p>
<p>In July 2020, China also proposed the "new development pattern" promoted by "domestic large cycles" and "domestic and international dual cycles" -s. "Circulation" is summarized. This policy indicates that China's strategic focus will turn to local demand and technological development.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a point of view that it was to reduce the dependence of the foreign economy so that under extreme circumstances, such as the Taiwan Strait War, facing economic sanctions in Europe, America and Japan, and maintaining a normal operation economy. After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, this view was even more arrogant.</p>
<h3>The consequences of trade fragmentation</h3>
<p>Even if the economy is completely decoupled as the economy of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, under the guidance of "de -risk" thinking, it will also lead to the "fragmented" of global trade, although in many scholars, during the epidemic, this fragmentation trend has already been form.</p>
<p>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Huang Xuncai said that "a fragmented global economy will split world division into a regional group that competes with each other. Trade, investment, and ideas will be reduced -and these are the key factor that helps us achieve economic progress." Essence</p>
<p>The above -mentioned scholars said that in terms of economics, there must be a price discrimination. It is a kind of discrimination to take some areas of China as a risk, and the risk is a kind of discrimination, so it has to bear the cost, such as higher prices and worse quality products.</p>
<p>"But this is not a new thing. The same thing happens in China. For example, the telecommunications industry, the three major state -owned enterprises monopolized, did not open to the external market, then the competition was not sufficient. Some people sent China Mobile's package in Hong Kong a few years ago. On the Internet, everyone found that it was much more discounting than their set meal in the Mainland, and it was uncomfortable.

<p>The consequences of trade fragmentation are learned from the front car. After the First World War, American Councilor Corder Herr believes that Germany and Britain and France have started war because the trade is not free enough, and free trade can promote international peace.</p>
<p>He said in a speeches of Congress, "For me, peace is accompanied by unimpeded trade; and war with high tariffs, trade barriers and unfair economic competition is war. In my opinion, we need to drum Getting the courage to play a leading role in the current serious crisis, because the pointer of the fate of history is now pointing to us. "</p>
<p>But Herr's point of view was too incredible and marginalized.</p>
<p>Until the world experienced the pain of World War II, people remembered Herr's point of view in confusion. At this time, Herr, who was already the Secretary of State, took advantage of the General Agreement Ontariffs Andtrade (GATT), and then evolved into the WTO. He won the Nobel Peace Prize. In the past 70 years, the world has experienced unprecedented free trade, as well as the general peaceful international situation.</p>

<p>Following the "bad police officer" Blint, "Good Police" Yellen also set off to visit China, but analysts suggested that all parties not expect too much.</p>
<p><strong> Minister of Finance, Janet Yellen, will soon have a visit to China, which is one of the high -risk attempts to rebuild bridges in the world's two major economies. </strong></p>
<p>This is also under the collapse of the relationship between the two countries this year. In one month, the second time there were Washington high -level officials visited Beijing.</p>
<p>The topic of the United States and China will cover Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as national security and sustainable trade disputes.</p>
<p>This visit also occurred on the occasion of Beijing's announcement that it would restrict exports of key raw materials for two types of computer chips.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65981589">Brinken visited China and Biden's "dictatorship" Sino -US relations "one week under the" lip, tongue sword "</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65981944">Why does Gates and Musk receive a hypercodic reception in China</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65915282">Why do the United States end China's "developing country" status</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65705268">Bayeng government out of the "oolong", the US -China relations "recover" and then the shadow</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65048234">American companies are "more negative" for business in China</a>Yellen's trip will include He Lifeng, the new vice premier of China for the first time. She recently said that allowing these two economies to work together is the key to this trip.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1588">The United States emphasized before this visit</a>The two countries must "manage the relationship between us responsibly, and communicate directly in areas of anxiety, and work together to deal with various global challenges."</p>
<p>As an attempt to continue to ease the deadlock, Yellen Monday (July 3) also met the Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng. <a href="http://www.news.cn/2023-07/05/c_1129732887.htm">Both parties are called</a>The meeting is "frank and constructive."</p>
<p>However, Wendycutler, deputy director of the Institute of Policy (ASPI) of the American Think Tank Asia Association (ASPI), pointed out to BBC: "For Yellen, it should maintain low expectations." "She is not in her position and cannot repair the relationship. It is not possible to respond to China's request for export control or tariffs. "</p>
<p>[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/Business-66118150/P0DXCKBL/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/business-66118150/p0dxckbl/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-06T06-44-33.000Z/p0dxckch.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Yellen had only been negotiated for the first time with Liu He in Zurich, Switzerland earlier this year. Now the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy has been replaced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64329860">Yellen and Liu He's first interview emphasizing "management and control differences" talks about the US technical policy of the United States</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world/2013/10/131009_profile_janet_yellen">Yellene people</a>Only a few weeks ago, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Qin Gang.</p>
<p>Brinken is the highest -level Chinese government officials who have visited Beijing over the past five years. His interviews are regarded as a key test for the two countries to stop its relationship.</p>
<p>When visiting China, Bollingak said that there are still major problems between the United States and China, but his "expectation is that we can better communicate and contact better in the future."</p>
<p>However, a day later, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65981589">Joe Biden, US President Joe Biden described Xi Jinping as a "dictator"</a>, Attracting Beijing protest. Analysts believe that Biden's remarks will not have a significant negative impact, but they are still widely considered to be a help.</p>
<p>There is another sign that the trade dispute between the two countries is currently difficult to resolve: <a href="https://twitter.com/bbcchinese/status/1676093213193703424">China announced this week to tighten the export control of the key raw materials of the two types of computer chips</a>Essence Starting next month, special licenses are obtained from China exports and must be obtained. China is the largest producer in the world in this type of metal.</p>
<p>This is a response to Washington to crack down on some high -end computer chips in China in the past year. In October 2022, Washington issued an enterprise with American tools or software, whether it is produced anywhere in the world, must apply for a license to export chips to China.</p>
<p>Priyanka Kishore, the business forum institution IMA ASIA, said that the United States and China are facing a series of complex issues.</p>
<p>She pointed out: "Official remarks and senior diplomats visits the willingness to establish effective political relations between the two countries, but their actions reflect the opposite situation, and the policy of tooth return to teeth occupies the upper hand."</p>
<p>During the meeting in Beijing's meeting in Beijing, Yellen is expected to show that the United States will continue to defend human rights and its national security interests. However, she expects to emphasize the willingness of Washington to cooperate with Beijing to cooperate with Beijing.One day after the talks of Brinken Beijing, Biden said that Xi Jinping was a "dictator", and also said that he didn't know the earlier spy balloon.</p>
<p>Although some well -known figures urge the United States to break the absolute economic connection with China, Yellen expects the Huairou policy. It is expected that she will say to Beijing's counterpart officials that Washington has no intention of deciring the economy of the two countries.</p>
<p>This is in line with her worldview that she is more global than some predecessors. Earlier this year, she proposed in a speech: "The comprehensive division of our economy is not only disastrous for the two countries, but also the stability of countries around the world."</p>
<p>Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Ken Rogoff said to BBC: "I will describe this a bit like a good police officer, bad police theory, and Brinkin is a bad police."</p>
<p>"Now is the good police officer of Yellen, try to say, you see, we have a lot of common points, see what we can do together."</p>
<p>Rogif said that as a Secretary of State, Briggie had to mention hard topics like Taiwan and Ukraine. But Rogif also reminded that he could not think that Yellen would be weak in Beijing. She was still likely to pressure China on multiple issues, including intellectual property law and market access.</p>
<p>In addition, although the two sides of the United States and China have some characters that are claiming to part ways, trade data shows the reality of lip and teeth.</p>
<p>In 2022, the trade between the two countries increased for the third consecutive year. <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file">Official data show</a>Last year, China exported the total value of the US exports of more than 536 billion US dollars (389 million yuan), and the total value of imported goods to the United States was 154 billion U.S. dollars (1.111 trillion yuan).</p>
<p>But even though Washington and Beijing tried to solve each other, the influence of the US presidential election was uncertain.</p>
<p>Profe Ericharwit, a professor at the University of Hawaii University of Asia, said: "If the second Biden government appeared in 2024, I expected that there will be many Trump's era of trade sanctions and tariffs on the economic front, especially It is not related to the high -end technology industry. "</p>
<p>"But if Donald Trump won in the 2024 election, it will be full."</p>

<p>During the meeting, Li Shangfu said that the two sides should continue to promote the relationship between the two armies. The navy of the two countries should strengthen communication at all levels, expand pragmatic cooperation in professional fields, and make positive contributions to maintaining the peaceful and stability of the region. Yev Menov responded that Russia attaches great importance to strengthening pragmatic cooperation in various fields of Russia and China, and is willing to maintain close coordination with the Chinese side and continuously push the relationship between the two armies and the two armies to a new height.</p>

<p>Although Beijing claims to be in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯入侵乌克兰/t-60868685">Ukrainian War</a>China has maintained neutrality, but China has always stood firmly on Russia, while accusing the United States and NATO for provoking Moscow to extend the bleeding war by transporting weapons to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, China has repeatedly stated that it will not provide weapons to any of the conflict and pay close attention to the export of military and civilian materials.</p>

He believes that this will be reflected in the struggle of black people and their right to fight for equal rights. And he is right.</p>
<p>For a whole century, the Palestinians who have been struggling to fight for their own rights may doubt whether the arc can stretch justice for them, especially under the shadow of the latest attack on Jining refugee camps this week- The attack has killed 12 Palestinians, and destroyed local water, electricity and sanitary facilities, and 80%of residential houses.</p>
<p>The invasion of Joning perfectly reflects and continues the aggression implemented by Jewish stateism and Israel in this century -this aggression has caused Palestinian death, injury, detention, spiritual trauma and exile. Most Palestinian land has more space for a Jewish country.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the Israeli army and settlers have killed more than 170, including nearly 30 children. According to the latest data provided by the United Nations, the latest assault forces of Jewish settlers and Jewish stateism have launched 570 attacks on the Palestinian villages and towns in the past 6 months, with an average of 3 times a day.</p>
<p>The situation in Palestine is indeed very serious, but the development of many other things in various countries and departments shows that the Palestinian cause is progressing in two specific areas. The United Nations diplomacy and global citizenships have shown that the Palestinians are obtaining more and more support from Jewish recovery and Western colonial interests. These interests have been almost uncomfortable over the past few decades and stifled the Palestinian people. And its rights.</p>
<p>In May of this year, for the first time, the UN General Assembly officially commented on Palestine's "Disaster Day"(Nakba)The 75th anniversary is a signs of changes with profound symbolic significance. The Palestinians used the term "NAKBA" to describe the racial cleaning and forcibly expelction of Israel's race cleaning and forcibly deportation of the 750,000 Palestan people from 1947 to 1948.</p>
<p>In 1947, the UN General Assembly passed the decision to divide Palestinian into the Jewish and Arab countries, and gently mentioned the "Palestinian issue" at the time, but this year, this was replaced by the "Disaster Day" commemorative activity. Many Palestinian people believe that this is the suffering and national trauma suffered by the Palestinian by the UN General Assembly, and these sufferings and trauma were caused by the United Nations decision 75 years ago. In view of the Palestinian people think that "Nakba" continues, this is particularly important. This week, Jenning's Palestinian refugees once again experienced this suffering -the Israeli army forced thousands of people to leave their home in the refugee camp.</p>
<p>In 1947, Jewish Repeated State and the United States had lobned lobbying for this divisional resolution and achieved victory. 75 years later, they once again stopped the "Disaster Day" commemorative event, but they lost miserable.</p>
<p>When the representatives participating in the commemorative activity (the most of them represent the majority of human beings) condemned the colonial policies of Israeli settlers and asked to protect the Palestinians and the founding of the Palestinians, they echoed an unprecedented support for the international mobilization of Palestine's business -especially in particular In terms of law, diplomacy, politics, media, education.</p>
<p>In the world, especially in the northern hemispheres that are concentrated and intimidated in Israel, the Palestinians and their progressive ally often challenged Jewish recovery on this conflict new battlefield, and they beat them. The right to view. Israel and its agents are crazy about trying to prevent the support of Palestine from all over the world, or suppress human rights organizations (such as human rights observation, amnesty international, etc.) criticism of Israel's policy -these organizations believe that this is a racial isolation policy.</p>
<p>The core of this conflict is that Palestine has the right to take legal and non -violent political actions through resistance, withdrawal and sanctions (BDS). Resisting, withdrawal, and sanctions have called on the international community to put pressure on Israel's deprivation of Palestinian human rights. This sport echoed the global resistance of South Africa to end the racial racial isolation system decades ago. Jewish compound nationals do not like this comparison. But they couldn't stop it. They tried to stop it through their favorite methods, that is, to label any "anti -Seminists" label for anyone who echoed Palestine's rights or criticized the Israeli policy, but it was very difficult.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the radicals of Palestinian, Israel put pressure on public and private institutions, and requires it to use the definition of "anti -Semitism" by the International Holocaus Memorial Alliance (IHRA) -this definition will be incorrectly hate and hate to Jews Criticism on Israel is equal to the same.</p>
<p>However, the definition of the International Holocaust Commemorative Alliance has also suffered setbacks. It was not only resisted by academic circles around the world, but also surprisingly, the Bayeng government also resisted it. In late May of this year, the Bayeng government released a national strategy to combat anti -Semitism, and this strategy does not accept the definition adopted by the International Holocaust Commemorative Alliance, but only as one of the definitions of people's reference.</p>
<p>In the past century, Jewish Repeated State-Israel's actions have never received such extensive and successful challenges from legal actions and public information movements. Palestine's racial isolation and the threat of freedom of speech in the world.</p>
<p>The Palestinians and their progressive allies (such as the American Citizen Freedom Alliance and the Constitutional Rights Center) challenged their legislation on anti -resistance, withdrawal, and sanctions, and won in more and more cases.</p>
<p>Universities, media organizations and other institutions in the United States, Europe, and other places must also objectively judge whether peaceful resistance or criticizing Israel's racial isolation policy constitutes anti -Semitism, and their answers are often: "No", and also confirmed that political advocacy And criticism should be guaranteed by the constitution's freedom of speech.</p>
<p>At present, hundreds of groups around the world are monitoring, recording and challenging the intimidation behavior of Israel, especially like the Palestinian legal organization and Adalah JusticeProject, the Makan Organization (MAKAN) in the United States, the British A non -governmental organizations such as the European Law Support Center. Their lawsuits and public mobilization have responded to thousands of attempts to dismiss Palestinian spokesman or staff. The Palestinian legal organization reports that about 70%of the cases they handle are involved in attempts to target students and scholars.</p>
<p>The efforts of Israel's memory of Palestine's history and the memory of the "Disaster Day" have also been challenged by the initiative initiated by the research organization ForensicArchitecture. The organization records the massacre of the Jewish reconciled state in 1948.When the Israeli occupation forces killed Palestinian American journalist Hirine Abu Aglet, a year ago in Jenning, the main media of the world who had long been accused of the prejudice of Israel for a long time conducted a thorough investigation of the murder. Among them, it was Including the New York Times and the Washington Post, and they concluded that Israeli sniper killed her.</p>
<p>Even the personal level of resistance to anti -Palestine's pressure on anti -Palestine has now received a lot of attention. Earlier this year, Steve Feldman, a Jewish American dermatologist, refused to sign a letter of anti -resistance, withdrawal, and sanctions to obtain labor expenses for his speech at a state university in the United States. After he publicized the above, he won the victory and got the cost he deserved, but he decided to donate the money to the organization that supports resistance, withdrawal, and sanctions- "Jewish Voice".</p>
<p>The Palestinians of the United States were further encouraged for young and progressive politicians who were elected state and federal -level members. Participation in the isolation system. It is true that they are small. However, their number will continue to rise, and their voice has accelerated the slow and stable attitude on the Israeli-Palestinian issue since 1948-from overwhelming support for Israel, to a more fair attitude.</p>
<p>Recently conducted Gallp Police Survey shows that American Democrats now sympathize with Palestinians have exceeded their sympathy for Israel (49%: 38%). And this trend will continue, because young American people, including Jewish Americans, now tend to take a more balanced way to resolve this conflict.</p>
<p>The global continuous change in Palestinian justice -including diplomacy, civil society activities and public opinion will eventually cause sufficient pressure to force Israel to reverse its racial isolation and occupation policies and enter true peaceful negotiations to give Israeli Israeli People and safety of equal people in Palestinians.</p>
<p>And this takes time, as it happened in South Africa, as it happened to all moral arcs that biased justice.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), the world's largest chip manufacturer in Taiwan, TSMC said on Thursday (July 6) that China is expected to restrict key metal exports of semiconductors from any direct impact on its production.</p>
<p>Previously, Wei Jianguo, the former deputy minister of the Ministry of Commerce China, warned that the move was "just the beginning." On July 3, the Ministry of Commerce of China announced that from August 1st, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制美荷晶片圍堵中國限制半導體金屬出口/a-66107196">export control of the two metal minerals of 镓 and 锗 锗</a>The purpose is to protect national security. Earlier, the United States decided to implement export restrictions to curb China's key technologies for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Taiwan is from <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国管制出口的镓锗究竟是什么/a-66113298">smartphones, cars to fighters and other chips</a>The main production place is supplied to companies such as Apple and Nvidia.</p>
<p>TSMC stated in an email statement: "After evaluation, we expect that the export restrictions of raw materials 镓 and 锗 will not have any direct impact on the production of TSMC."</p>
<p>"We will continue to pay close attention to the development of the situation," the statement supplements the road, but no detailed instructions are made.</p>
<p>TSMC's stocks listed in Taipei continued to be founded on Thursday, and closed down by 2.9%, while Taiwan stock market fell 1.7%. In some reason, the trade situation was even more tight and US Treasury Minister Yellen worsened with Sino -US relations before visiting Beijing this week. Worries.</p>
<p>Liao Chien-Yu, the first securities analyst, said, "If the negotiations between the two parties are progressing smoothly, many restrictions may relax; but if the negotiations are not going smoothly, the two parties may impose more sanctions after Yellen returned to China."</p>
<p>The Taiwan Stone Semiconductor Company, which uses 镓 manufacturing optoelectronic components, told Reuters that only the "small" substrate was purchased from China, and most of them were supplied from Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>The steady semiconductor added that China's restrictions on the company's short -term procurement and wafer production and delivery are very limited.</p>
<p>Another Taiwanese company's new optoelectronics technology (Visual Photonics Epitaxy) told Reuters that the company also has many substrate suppliers, one of which is the American semiconductor wafer manufacturer AXT. Axt said on Monday that he would seek a license to continue exporting from China and Gravity Board products.</p>
<p>Another semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan, new Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. said that so far, China's export restrictions have a weak impact on it. The company's stock price closed 3.5%on Thursday.</p>

She pointed out that the economic relations between China and Europe are becoming increasingly unbalanced. The practice of "clearly integrating the military and business sectors" in China brings risks to European security. Therefore Use existing tools to safeguard European economic interests. "The relationship between us is not black or white, and our answers cannot be the case. Therefore, we must focus on de-Risking instead of deciring."</p>

<h3>New keywords for China relations</h3>
<p>Feng Derine's speech has received great attention. The saying "risk" also began to be cited by the media and politicians in Germany and the United States. The New York Times believes that this statement is a new summary of the European Union's relations with China. German and French diplomats have since promoted the concept of "de -risk" in international organizations and reflected it in the statement of the G7 Summit of the Hiroshima G7 summit in May of that year. In the content. The German Mirror Weekly pointed out that Feng Delin hopes to retain space on the words, which is different from the "decourse" used in the United States for a period of time.</p>

<h3>Dependence is a "good choice"?</h3>
<p>Germany Foreign Minister Berbak also stated during the April China Celery China that Germany did not want to "decume" with China, but to "reduce risks", that is, Europe should reduce its dependence on "unhealthy" in China. At the same time, Qin Gang, a Chinese foreign minister who attended the press conference at the same time, responded that "China and Germany are partners, not opponents", and the two parties rely on the supply chain "the best choice in market rules"; as long as both countries remain open, "there is no need to be necessary to be unnecessary. Worry about the so -called dependence. "</p>

<h3>Shawrtz is the initial figurine?</h3>
<p>Some German media noticed that it was not Feng Delin, but the German Chancellor Salz that was the first to publicly use the word "de -risk". In November 2022, the German "Star" magazine (Stern) quoted his relying on the Chinese industrial chain in a report before Salz's visit to China: "Risks and diversification are the top priority." But At the time, this statement did not attract special public opinion.</p>

<h3>Financial term</h3>
<p>The term "de-Risking" is not a new invention, but a term in the financial industry that refers to the contraction or termination of transactions in banks or investors to reduce the risk of paying contracts. In January 2023, the Chairman of the European Executive Committee Feng Delin also stated at the World Economic Forum that although the EU needs to "cooperate with China and trade", it still needs to amend the direction of business transactions with China and seek to seek this world with this world.

<h3>Consensus on the Atlantic Ocean</h3>
<p>The German "Business Daily" pointed out that on this issue, Feng Delin, German Chancellor Shulz, and US national security adviser Su Liwen have obviously formed a consensus.

<h3>String into the European Union's strategy to China</h3>
<p>The common policy for China is also an important issue at the EU summit ended on June 30. Summit jointly stated that it will support the continued economic and trade relations with China while reducing Europe's economic dependence on China. "Risk of Risk" officially appeared in this statement and became a concept. In the future, the European Union will use it as a guidance policy to launch a strategy to China. However, some criticisms have stated that the "de -risk" currently expressed by the European Union still lacks specific plans and responsibilities.</p>

Yellen once again stood between China and the United States. This Monday, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國管制鎵鍺出口-各國如何嚴防供應鏈中斷/a-66118831">China ’s Ministry of Commerce announced export control on the metal 镓 镓 and 锗 related items required to manufacture high -performance chips</a>Essence The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that the United States plans to issue a ban, but Yellen may establish a bridge with China with China in terms of common global challenges. Jakecolvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Association, believes that the interview may help the two parties establish a "new normal" and establish a foundation in bilateral relations. However, the tariff measures imposed by the former Trump administration will not be canceled, as well as export control issued by Biden.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that the US Climate Special Envoy Cry also plans to go to China this month to conduct global warming negotiations. The report quoted people familiar with the matter and said that Kerry's visit may be carried out around July 16. Before the visit of Yellen, the US Secretary of State visited China last month and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

Some scholars have pointed out that since this year, Xi Jinping has twice inspections to undertake the southern and eastern theater that mainly mainly for Taiwan's military mission, which is preparing for the promotion of unified Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/cmh1-04122023065333.html">Xi Jinping inspected the southern theater navy to emphasize deepening training for war</a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-11082022114432.html"><strong> Xi Jinping inspected the Military Commission to emphasize the comprehensive strengthening of training for military training </strong></a>According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, Xi Jinping emphasized when inspecting the Eastern Theater organs on July 6, "" It is necessary to thoroughly implement the party's 20th spirit, implement the new era of the party's strong military thought, implement the military strategy policy of the new era, anchor to build construction The army has been struggling for a hundred years, and strives to create a new situation in the war zone construction and preparations for war. "In addition, Xi Jinping also fully affirmed the contribution of the Eastern theater to" safeguard the sovereignty of national territorial sovereignty and marine rights and the unity of the motherland. "</p>
<p>The Eastern theater of the PLA was established in 2016 and ranked first in the five major theater in China. It has most military and land -to -air strike capabilities. Public information shows that the strategic direction of the Eastern theater is the Pacific and Taiwan, which have repeatedly implemented military operations such as exercises around Taiwan Island.</p>
<p>Li Weidong, the president of the magazine of the Overseas Political Political Publication "China Strategic Analysis", said in an interview with this station that Xi Jinping's selection of inspecting the Eastern theater at this time node is a response to the latest military sales in the United States.</p>
<p>"(Xi Jinping) The inspection of the Eastern theater is definitely aimed at Taiwan, that is, to promote Taiwan. Because the United States has recently sold military sales in Taiwan, it is now a bit of action in the United States and China is relatively active. It is a strategic and tactical contest. "</p>
<p>Xi Jinping also emphasized in the inspection of the Eastern Theater that the world has entered a new turbulent change period. It is necessary to "go all out to perform the functions of the main war zone in the war zone" and "greatly grasp military exercises and accelerate the improvement of winning." The outside world noticed that on the day of Xi Jinping's inspection, the US Finance Minister Yellen arrived in Beijing. Recently, the United States and China have also occurred in military frictions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-06T15-05-00-04-00/000002.png" />On July 6, 2023, Xi Jinping inspected the eastern theater organs and delivered a speech.(Video screenshot/CCTV)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/jw-07062023104707.html/capture.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-06T15-05-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>At the end of last month, the U.S. State Department announced a total of $ 440 million in Taiwan's military sales case. This is also the tenth of the US President Bayeng's tenth time since taking office. At the same time, the Foreign Affairs Commission of the House of Representatives of the Congress also announced the establishment of a "tiger" working group to supervise the delivery procedure for Taiwan's military sales.</p>
<p>Li Weidong believes that Xi Jinping's goal of consolidating power internally has been achieved, and the training of military training is intended to outside.</p>
<p>The goal of deepening military training and preparing for war was mentioned when Xi Jinping inspected the southern theater in mid -April this year. The growth of China's military expenditure and military power has also been the focus of attention from the outside world. The Wall Street Journal of the United States previously disclosed that China ’s total defense budget in 2023 will reach 1.55 trillion yuan, with a expenditure increase of more than 7%, breaking the highest record of China's military expenses in the past 5 years, and far exceeding the GDP set by the government Growth goal.</p>
<p>Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, Xi Jinping has regarded the so -called "building a world -class army" as a priority, and has repeatedly emphasized that it has comprehensively strengthened the training of troops. During the 20th CPC National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year, Xi Jinping's successful achievements won the third five -year term. China will resolutely oppose and curb the "Taiwan independence" to the CPC Constitution for the first time, and reiterate that "building the people's army into a world -class army."</p>
<p>However, in the opinion of the former Lieutenant General Staff of the Chinese Navy Command, there are still differences in the goals of Xi Jinping's Taiwan internally, and it cannot be said to be a iron plate.</p>
<p>"He (Xi Jinping) is now rectifying the troops because the troops do not listen to him. Not only do you have to rectify but also to appease, and to go to the army to cover people's hearts. Having said that, the southern Chinese theater and the eastern theater assumed the huge task of fighting against the Taiwan Strait, which is one of the reasons why Xi Jinping inspected the two major theater this year.</p>
<p>"Now the entire army holds different opinions on Xi Jinping's mobilization of war. They all know that this battle will not win, and it is better not to win." Yao Cheng analyzed that the Chinese army has risen in fear of war. This signal was released in poor combat in the western theater. Therefore, Xi Jinping is now in trouble, and he is afraid that the PLA will not be able to complete his unity cause, but also afraid that once the war is launched, "it will be unsatisfactory."</p>
<p>He said: "Xi Jinping is about to press them, and the troops will be reversed."</p>
<p>Shouting the slogan, expanding reserve, and increasing military expenditure, Xi Jinping's war intention to trigger concerns about the international community. In February this year, Williamburns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, publicly stated that some intelligence showed that Xi Jinping had ordered the Chinese military to unify Taiwan by 2027. Therefore, Xi Jinping's ambitions for Taiwan should not be underestimated. The US Secretary of State Brillings also warned Congress in March this year that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will have the ability to commit martial arts in 2027.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-06T21-06-00-04-00/000000.png" />Laura Roseberger, the new chairman of the United States in Taiwan (AIT), held the first round table with Chinese media reporters in the Washington Office on July 6 after taking office on July 6. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/15-07062023210317.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-06T21-06-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Reporter Cadi Photography</p>
<p>The new chairman of the United States in the Taiwan Association (AIT) Lauraroseberger, Lauraroseberger, said on July 6th in the Washington office to be interviewed by some Chinese media that no matter who the people of Taiwan choose to be the next leader, the United States will continue Work closely. US policies will not change based on which candidate is elected. She also said that the United States opposes external forces to intervene in Taiwan's democracy, and Taiwan elections should not be an excuse for Beijing's upgrading tensions.</p>
<p>Rosenberg has served as chairman of the Taiwan Association in March this year since the Senior Director of China and Taiwan Affairs of the White House National Security Council. Since taking office, she has visited Taiwan twice, including the president Tsai Ing -wen and the government's senior officials and business leaders, and met with the candidate of the Taiwan presidential election in 2024. This Thursday (6th) was the first time she held a round table with a Chinese media reporter after taking office.</p>
<p>Speaking of her recent visit to Taiwan and meeting with three presidential candidates from different parties, Rosenberg said that because it was a private conversation, the content was inconvenient to disclose, but she said that this was a dialogue for mutual understanding and sharing views. It is important to understand the policies and priorities of each candidate, and it is also to let them understand the US policy. She did not agree with the so -called "interview" saying.</p>
<p>Rosenberg emphasized that dialogue is very important to build a understanding, and this is very important for partners like the United States and Taiwan. Because no matter who the Taiwanese people choose the next leader, the United States intends to work closely with it. US policies will not change based on which candidate is elected. Therefore, it is important to have a solid foundation and mutual understanding. Frankly speaking, it is that relationship and trust, which are very important. This is the reason for these dialogues, and the reason for the past.</p>
<p>Rosenberg has reiterated that the United States respects Taiwan's democracy and supports Taiwan's free and fair elections. It will not favor any party in the election. She also said that the United States has clearly stated to all parties that the United States opposes external forces to intervene in democracy in Taiwan. This should not be an excuse for Beijing's upgrading.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the reporter from this station inspected the Eastern theater organs on the 6th, and emphasized that it is necessary to deepen the war and combat planning, accelerate the improvement of win -win ability, and ask how Rosenberg thinks of the urgency of preventing the conflict of the Taiwan Strait. Rosenberg responded that this obviously emphasized how important the work of maintaining the Taiwan Strait and the stability.</p>
<p>She also said that the United States has several practices in dealing with this issue. First of all, it continues the United States' efforts to support Taiwan's self -defense capabilities for a long time, which is part of the United States promised under the Taiwan Relations Law. In addition, according to the Taiwan Relations Law, the United States must also ensure that there is sufficient deterrence in the Taiwan Strait, so that Beijing dare not act lightly. Another key factor is the role of the international community. The international community is increasingly willing to state, emphasizing their own interests in the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. This is also reflected in the recent joint communiqué of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7). In the future, this trend continues to continue.</p>
<p>In response to the latest US $ 440 million military sales case approved by the United States, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Defense recently criticized that the United States's move "deliberately pushing the tension of Taiwan Straits" is tantamount to "accelerating Taiwan into a gunpowder barrel". Essence In response, Rosenberg responded that the United States' commitment to Taiwan's self -defense and the position of supporting Taiwan's self -defense will continue, and even in the face of strong complaints in Beijing, it will not change the attitude of the United States. She emphasized that the fundamental interests of the United States have always been the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, but it is also important to communicate with Beijing. It is also important to be able to talk to these issues. This is not to change the American approach, but that this understanding is very important.</p>

<p>In the era of everyone, what would a woman who walked through a blogger to start a business?</p>
<p>Zhao Pei was 42 years old. Since she became a blogger, she later resigned from work to invest in live broadcasts with full -time work. With her own clothing brand, I almost witnessed the whole process. The executives of the former Internet manufacturer gave up the annual salary of one million, naked to start a business ... These words are placed on social media, which will be the traffic password that attracts clicks. For a long time, this has become her Write on your homepage to introduce your own keywords to the outside world, and you can tell a story behind each keyword. But I always think that these words are too thin for a 40 -year -old entrepreneurial woman.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Pei is a partner of a law firm, and his son is in the fifth grade of elementary school. She did not have three pieces of death in the middle class that was popular some time ago, but she was 揶揄 herself, and her entrepreneurial was originally a rising class. As a result, she changed from a migrant worker who originally consumed to downgrade consumption downgrade. Little boss.</p>
<p>In 2022, her company's cash flow has always been negative. Although it has improved in the first half of this year, she chose to stop her high -end commercial medical insurance for 4 consecutive years ago. Before, she kept saying that she didn't want to go to the public hospital because she was sick. She had much time than this. This year, she thought about it, comforting her should be squeezed, and heard these. I decided to sit down again. Talk to her.</p>
<p>In 2019, she shared her own dressing and home consumption on Xiaohongshu to gradually accumulate fans. This is due to her "burning money" experience she bought and buying for many years. She has always been Taobao among her friends around her. KOL, friends called her to "buy and buy." Because of a few notes sharing medical beauty and home, she gradually became a fashion blogger on a little red book.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, a brand began to find her advertising. She had cooperated with many big -name big names. At that time, she felt that money was easy. In 2021, the platform began to formally support the bloggers to make live broadcasts, and she reached the traffic dividend. For a long time, her live broadcast room remained in the top ten in the list of goods. At that time, her daily life was to work in Sina Building in the Houchang Village in the northwest corner of Beijing every Monday to Friday from Monday to Friday. She didn't feel tired, but always lingered a sense of excitement. Later, the courier piled up by the brand could not push the house, and she decided to rent an office near home.</p>
<p>In mid -2021, the live broadcast was fully rolled out. She chose to leave from the position of Sina Weibo management. She thought that everything was successful. From a team that controls nearly 100 people to a small company with 4 people, she is frank and there is no psychological gap. It is good at the scene. It takes millions of decoration office to expand the team in accordance with the Internet salary standards. People around said that she "starts a business and experience life."</p>
<p>In the two years of full -time entrepreneurship, the company's business progress has been accelerating, and the team has expanded to more than 20 people. After her self -operated clothing brand, she founded the jewelry brand. From a blogger who only understands dressing to the top of the industrial chain, she started to learn from scratch without a lot of details. She ran the factory by herself, selected the fabrics, and placed an order with the factory while broadcasting the factory. … During this period, she experienced the separation of the clothing partners, and the shop stopped operating for two months. Facing the high temperature of more than 40 degrees in Hangzhou in summer, she took people outside the warehouse for 5 consecutive days. In the end, she said that it was nothing. The biggest shortcoming on the road of entrepreneurship was still managing.</p>
<p>The flow dividends have caught up, and the lessons brought by the tide faded have not fallen.</p>
<p>After going through the sleepy 2022, to 2023 when the uncertainties were magnified, "there are not so many stands to do business now, but if you squat down, you can make business." Fortunately, our team can survive steadily, and even have some new things to see. "From the sense of intentions of two years ago, she has more awe and pragmatic today. I even have such a change for her. feel happy.</p>
<p>We are sitting in her office, a LOFT two -story building near the East Fourth Ring Road in Beijing. Planting live equipment and carton, letting us sit down in a small piece of place.</p>
<p>The scene in front of me is a bit like witnessing a boat under the Big Times of the live broadcast business, and this boat is accompanied by the ups and downs of the tide of the times. We reviewed the various experiences of her entrepreneurial, and asked her the significance of continued tossing, as well as the cognition of women in career and entrepreneurship along the way.</p>
<p>_ The following is Zhao Pei's dictation, after being sorted out: _</p>
<p>A friend recently asked me about entrepreneurship. My answer is: entrepreneurial is good, but next time it is innovative.</p>
<p>Since the influence of the family environment, I know very well that I can't sit at home as a full -time wife to bring their children to counsel homework. I can even accept my family and let my husband bring children at home. This particularly profound experience originated from my time after I failed to start a business in India in 2019.</p>
<p>In 2018, I resigned from Ali Entertainment and went to India with colleagues in Ali to start a business. At that time, if I could wait two more months, I could be fulfilled in Ali's stock, and it could probably reach millions. However, I think there are few opportunities for life to go through a bloody thing as the core staff of the founding team like this. I am also the only woman who has long been stationed in India for a long time in the 13th person in the founding team. I was always at Delhi at the time and managed about 100 Indian employees. In Indian culture, women are not encouraged to work. I remember on the day of Women's Day, I shared with all female employees inside, and encouraged them to come out to work or even start a business. In retrospect, I feel that this is the choice in my bones, and I will not have such an experience in this life. So since then I have learned to choose not to be abducted by the world according to my heart, and do not complain.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-06T22-59-46-00-00/000186627_piclink.jpg" />(Zhao Pei in 2018 in India's entrepreneurial period)</p>
<p>Later, India banned China ’s Internet app continuously, and our projects were also implicated. Back to Beijing from Delhi, the four months of finding a job at home are the days when I have suffered from suffering for so many years. Although I didn't need to go out to work at all at that time, when I found that I was not needed by the outside world, it was a particularly terrible thing for me. Essence</p>
<p>But after I came out of that period of emotional trough, I clearly knew that I had the living law in the second half of my life. The happiest thing of people was to connect with the society, and I could always have my own thing to do. I think I will work until the age of eighty.At first I sharing some consumer experience on Xiaohongshu is my daily life. Double Eleven every year before, many friends around me will let me share the list of shopping carts, and may also buy too much. I find that I have some talent in buying things. In addition, my own media origin, expression and output content The basic skills are still there, so I accidentally embarked on the road of bloggers.</p>
<p>Many people think that bloggers have the least threshold, but in fact, the threshold for bloggers to start a business is the highest. It is difficult to keep the attraction to fans, so whether you are a big blogger of millions of fans or hundreds of thousands or even tens of thousands of little bloggers, everyone has a common. The daily life is traffic anxiety. So how can there be an easy occupation? In the end, the places where the spotlight could not be taken on the ground was lying on the ground.</p>
<p>When I start myself full -time, my identity has changed from a part -time blogger to the CEO of a small company. In addition to maintaining the content of the blogger's content and starting regularly, we must start looking at financial statements, team management, and business direction. "Step on the pit" re -learning. In the middle of last year, I ended cooperation with the partners of the clothing because of the idea of ideas. Because I wanted to maintain brand independence, I finally got all the clothing inventory. In the summer vacation, I took my son to Hangzhou, under the high temperature of more than 40 degrees in Hangzhou, and I moved the warehouse with the team, and then started to run a new supply chain everywhere. From the beginning, I started learning the "doorway" of the clothing industry.</p>
<p>The store had to stop for two months, and the mentality was extremely anxious. At that time, the cost of the clothing business fixed every month would spend hundreds of thousands. From then on, I started to understand the industry chain of the entire clothing. From the selection to the board to the supply chain, the inventory, I asked myself to do it in person. I was very impressed. Who comes out of the auxiliary materials? I asked the master, "What is the auxiliary material?" ... In short, it ’s so bit by bit into every link of the industry to learn to make up lessons, which is also awe of each industry.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, one -third of the brand advertisement that had an income of one -third of the revenue was gained overnight, and the courier could not be issued. It owed tens of thousands of costs every day. When I paid my salary from a few months to the end of the month, I started to be anxious. During that time, my mother felt my anxiety, and secretly told me privately, "I still have money, you can give it to you at any time if you need it." I realize that the boss works for employees is a real thing. It turned out that I had seen a lot of money and spent a lot of money on an Internet company, but I really learned that it was not a simple matter to make my small company make money.</p>
<p>After starting a business, many people, including relatives and friends around their parents, think that you are so tossing every day, go out early and return, and ask so many employees to pay them every month, then you must make a lot of money outside It's right. Every time I smile, I smile hard and bypass the topic. It can be said that after this round of economic cycle, we have not yet fallen, and the team survives, and we can also calculate other businesses. To some extent, it is a self -consistent success.</p>
<p>In December, the team was sick and asked for leave. On Christmas day, I was still burning, running to the empty office, wearing a dressed dress to take a selfie, I am new ... when people are sick, I can particularly realize that human beings can especially realize human beings. Sadness and joy are not lonely. I used to be a little disgusted in the chicken soup that I succeeded in learning. However, when people can really come from the low tide, they will grow naturally in the face of the confidence in the face of life. What to say that starting a business is the most to get this kind of confidence. I still have the enthusiasm for doing it. At the critical moment, I can force myself to be courageous. For me, this is more valuable than making money. This made me really taste the game itself was a brave game. Once I got on the road, I couldn't turn back.</p>
<p>In recent years, I jumped out of the original Internet circle and contacted people from all walks of life. I found that the original world was open. Putting on the elite thinking, lowering my mentality and then lowering, I learned that there is a respect for practitioners who are reliable in each industry from the heart, even if it is a supplier that is small enough to make clothes buttons. Their common point is that there is no talent for talent. The "10,000 -hour law" is a kind of solid and reliable that can be seen there. In the case of poor economic environment, they can even do it. Increased in the trend. So we can see from this, what are the restrictions on age? I see that some people are late.</p>
<p>At the age of 28, I was editor -in -chief, 38 -year -old as a blogger, and a 40 -year -old full -time entrepreneurial business. Judging from the comparison of work and entrepreneurship, it is just like snorkeling and deep diving. The underwater scenery must be different. If you can have any suggestions for women after 35 years of age, don't hopes that it has always been uphill, twists and turns are normal, forget the halo given by the platform before, lower your posture, lower your posture, and then lower it. Life will naturally bloom flowers when low to dust. From this perspective, the opportunity of this world is still equal.</p>
<p>For women, whether from marriage to career, the sense of insecurity at each stage will always be accompanied by. Along the way, I am the practitioner of the chicken soup "obey your heart". I will not be rhythmic by the comments of others. This will live stretch and not put my precious energy on the internal consumption. For example, many fans will ask me: You are so busy, how to balance your career and family. My answer is that there is no balance, only choice. I never take this for myself.</p>
<p>Forty entrepreneurship, but seeking life is not faint.</p>
<p>(The topic of "Life after 35" is still continuing. This article is the sixth of the series. The author exchange WeChat Gentlely824, edit mailbox: zhen.zhu@ftchinese.com.)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T00-50-00-04-00/000000.png" />China's simulation exercises (called "Bing Push") claim that it can use superb missiles to hit the US ship combat group. However, many prerequisite settings have problems in Taiwan's experts. The picture shows Dongfeng 21D missile. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm1-07072023004223.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T00-50-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Reuters information. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm1-07072023004223.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaODAO/JUNSHIWAIJIAO/hcm1-07072023004223.html/@stream</a>Recently, a simulation exercise published by China Central University (Taiwan said: "Bing Qi Dao" Bing Dao ") report claimed that" the average sinking 5.6 US ships with 24 high -super -anti -ship missiles "caused heated discussions on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. What is the motivation for China to release the above news? How will Taiwan cope with this false information promotion?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm2-07072023005553.html"><strong> Taiwan Army Hanguang Hanguang exercise "Cai Yingwen Escape" and other miscalculated information involved in the election </strong></a>Hong Kong English "South China Morning Post" reported on the 23rd of last month that Central North University sang average 5.6 US ships with 24 high -super -warming missile missiles in 20 rounds of digital simulation exercises to achieve a basic guarantee for reliable "Ford". The purpose of the battle group. In the exercise setting, the "Ford" is composed of the "St. Hargoto" cruiser ("Titkidroa" class) and four "Berke II" class destroyers. SM-3 of Geopymid missiles.</p>
<p>During the simulation exercise of Central North University, the PLA Rocket Army first launched the first wave of 8 missiles from Central and South China, attracting densely interceptions of US ships, and consumed most of the SM-3 missiles. Then, another type of missile launched from the north and northwest, four aimed at the "Ford", and the remaining 4 aimed at 4 "Berke II" class battleships. In addition, 2 missiles fired from Central China and South China. "No." warship. After this wave, only four US ships survived. After 20 rounds of different settings, Central North claimed that "the average results were 5.6, and it can be basically believed that the entire" Ford "battle group sank."</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan soldiers pushed face faces of Central North University simulation exercise </strong></p>
<p>Lin Chuankai, an associate researcher at the Institute of Cyber Security and Decision Research, Taiwan's Institute of National Defense Security, believes that the anti -syndrome and credibility of the dissertation of Central North University is yet to be questioned.</p>
<p>Lin Chuankai pointed out that the simulation system of the Chinese version of "Mozi" jointly used the Chinese version of "Mozi" to design a three -wave "tap, attack, and shooting" attack combat steps to review the strike strategy, solve the future anti -ship operations or ammunition in anti -ship operations or ammunition in the future Waste. The CL-20, which is touted by the Chinese media as the "King of explosives". In the desperation of Central Beibei, the power of the CL-20 is 7 times the traditional TNT (triaderylene). The warriors and cruisers were all one.</p>
<p>In June of this year, Lin Chuankai and his team simulated the simulation exercise of Central North with two weeks. Even with the same 7x power, the simulation results found that the war loss obtained with three waves of attacks was 2.22, (the destroyer was only 0.55 0.55 The aircraft carrier 0.69, the cruiser 0.97), far from the 5.6 ships declared in the Central North, not to mention the data from 5 times to 1.4 times as the power is reduced by 5 to 1.4 times, and there are only 1.58 to 2 ships.</p>
<p>In addition, even the war loss obtained by the super -saturated attack (one project) was 2.15, and the simulation results were very different from the three waves of attacks, which shows that China is limited in tactical value to save ammunition combat strategies.</p>
<p><strong> The premise of the Central Northern Simulation Exercise "Leaves from Reality" </strong></p>
<p>First of all, the setting of the above -mentioned simulation exercises of Central North University is the successful test of the Chinese hypersonic anti -ship ballistic missile. At the same time, the US military standard six (standard 6) missile test failed. But Lin Chuankai believes that such a setting is too arbitrary. In fact, in March this year, the United States re -fired the six missiles in Hawaii: "The premise is not established, and the simulation results are not established."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T00-50-00-04-00/000002.png" />Ultra -high -speed missile concept map (Reuters) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm1-07072023004223.html/image.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T00-50-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Secondly, in the exercise, the deployment position of the US aircraft carrier was settled at 174.58 kilometers in the northeast of Taiwan, and it was extremely unreasonable within the range of the Chinese shore anti -ship missile. Because the American aircraft carrier always keeps near the second island chain, there must be room for a safe distance to react. This can't help but doubt whether China has doubts about its ability to "Anti-ACCESS/Area Denial (AD). In addition, the exercise uses early warning aircraft to detect whether it lacks confidence in the Beidou satellite detection capacity developed by China.</p>
<p>Third, simulation exercises also underestimate the number of US aircraft carrier crackdowns missiles. The "Ford" aircraft carrier is the latest aircraft carrier in the United States. The exercise assumes that the "Ford" leads one cruiser and four destroyers to form an aircraft carrier battle group to launch an attack on China. Only the assumptions of carrying the "18" missiles are too unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong> Chinese version of Mozi simulation exercise system is credible to be suspicious </strong></p>
<p>In the United States CMO (Command) system, there are 22 countries and more than 2,000 units internationally internationally. China and Russia are limited by the US output permit. They cannot get professional editions, only the commercial version. Lin Chuankai said that according to their research and judgment, China is a simulation system for the development of the "Mozi Future Commander" to refer to the commercial version of CMO. It cannot obtain the resources of the original function and database update. This time, Central North University simulated only 20 times, which also affects the credibility of the simulation exercise. Lin Chuankai's team simulates at least 300 times.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>This time, the so -called "24 high -super -converted missile missiles sinking 5.6 US ships" of the so -called "24 high -super -superior missile missiles" was first disclosed by the South China Morning Post. Reprinting has become a topic of discussion of some political theory programs.China's hypersonic missile is considered to be the same as Russian system. The national security people in Taiwan pointed out that the hypersonic missile was intercepted by the Patriot missiles, but it was very different to see the media in China. They judged that this "psychological red line" in China, how can China's proud hypersonic missile be intercepted by the American Patriot missile? Therefore, with the simulation exercise plus a series of news operations, the power of boasting Dongfeng missile is enough to annihilate the US aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>** Soldiers can be promoted by politics.</p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng, the chairman of the China Strategy and Army Push Research Association in Taiwan, said in an interview with this station that the purpose of the deduction of soldiers is to achieve the result of the desired, and to discover why the goals can be achieved quickly in the process, " Its methodology and designed design are very critical. "</p>
<p>For example, the soldiers are the same as the poll design. The design topic is then guided. The design is called planning unification in advance. The soldier pushes the process to help diagnose and take the pulse, but do not open the prescription. Huang Jiezheng emphasized that the deduction of soldiers is a chance, not fortune -telling: "Hitting 100 missiles or 50 missiles can kill how many people can be killed. Come to be operated by politics, the results of the soldiers can also be operated. "</p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng pointed out that most people are only interested in fighting against damage, who wins who lose, the number of deaths and injuries, and the consumption of weapons and equipment. He was worried that most of the soldiers were deduced only for the comparison of military forces, but did not deduce on social toughness, and this was the weakest part of Taiwanese society.</p>

Some analysts believe that before the presidential election of Taiwan next year, China's involvement in the election will become increasingly serious.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm2-06272023075352.html">Taiwan "Hanguang Exercise" anti -airborne first move Taoyuan Airport for the first time</a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st1-06272023045212.html"><strong> Taiwan Hanguang Exercise will perform for the first time at Taoyuan Airport for a ban on navigation on July 26 </strong></a>The Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece "Dagao" recently published a photo of the "Hai'an No. 11" exercise in Kaohsiung, with a shaking title "Anti -Hive" and Cai Yingwen "escape" "; while China official media CCTV.com Xiaoying video also broadcasts "Analysis states that the military exercise has become Cai Yingwen 'Escape Rooking'", and the background screen edits the data picture of Cai Yingwen's step out of the plane.</p>
<p>This year, the "Hanguang Exercise" of the Taiwan Army moved to the civilian Taoyuan Airport for the first time. Before the exercise, Chinese official media and even social media were full of false information. Guoan people in Taiwan revealed that before the "Hanguang exercise", a series of cognitive operations in China were discovered. The theme comes from abroad. Internationally cognition. As a democratic country, we must prevent these information operations from causing misunderstanding of the people. "</p>
<p><strong> Director of Guoan: The CCP's ability to launch the war is not enough </strong></p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with the online media on the 5th, the national security director of Taiwan also mentioned that the tension atmosphere of the Taiwan Strait's "murderous war" was shaped by the Communist Party of China. not enough."</p>
<p>He disclosed in the interview that the National Security Bureau seized 1,800 disputed fake information in the first half of the year this year, and it increased a lot with the 1,400 items in the same period last year. I believe that more fake information will appear in the hot season in the election in the second half of the year. Including, shaping the sense of fear of war, differentiation of Taiwan with international allies, and discussions between Taiwan's public policy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T01-00-00-04-00/000002.png" />National Security Director of Taiwan Cai Mingyan (provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm2-07072023005553.html/570b5b894e8c.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T01-00-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Drag the Chinese offense Taiwan Taiwan to refer to "common control risks" </strong> **</p>
<p>However, while the internationalization of the Taiwan Strait issue, the frequency and number of PLA aircraft and ship disturbances continued to increase, and the Chinese military aircraft crossing the strait midline has become the norm. How Taiwan will effectively achieve the effect of scaring is the focus of attention from the outside world.</p>
<p>The national security person said that, in addition to the increase in the deployment of the Indian -in -area region such as the United States and other Western democratic countries, the Taiwan side can turn all parties into a stakeholder through the use of economy or various forces. For example, TSMC goes to foreign countries to set up factories. In contrast, some investments must go to Taiwan; for example, Taiwan's solid -lithium battery large plant Huoneng Technology builds a factory in France, which is to closely combine the interested parties.</p>
<p>This national security person analyzed that this move will have two benefits: "First, to ensure that Taiwan still has nutrients, and will not be isolated due to intimidation. (Economy and industry) cannot grow; second ) Pick up the gun and stand on the middle of the Taiwan Strait together, but make everyone a stake related person. When the Taiwan Strait has a situation, more than half of the world's trade is forced to stop. 70 % of the world's high -end chip supply will break off chain".</p>
<p>The above -mentioned national security sources also said that the more countries attach importance to the safety of the sea, and the risks can be reduced in industrial and security cooperation, and the risk can be reduced to achieve the effect of scaring. This is the concept of "co -control risk". He uses Taiwan's president Tsai Ing -wen, which is often mentioned by "allowing Taiwan to continue in security and supply chain to become the key force for the global supply chain." Actual obstruction effect ".</p>
<p><strong> China tries to intervene in Taiwan's election transfer fear </strong></p>
<p>With the increasingly heating of the Taiwan election, China's cognitive war against Taiwan has gradually warmed. The DPP government ruling in Taiwan has recently been connected from the National Security Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the relevant national units, the press conference, and the media briefing of the media to counter the interference of false information.</p>
<p>Wu Se, a researcher at Taiwan's Cross -Strait Policy Association, accepted the analysis of the Taiwan interview that China ’s cognitive operations against Taiwan have changed a lot with the past. In the 2000 Taiwan election, China created fear of China in Taiwan. Assisting Tsai Ing -wen won an overwhelming victory with 8.17 million votes; now, China ’s handling method is more delicate, transferring fear to the people’ s fear of war, and further shifting the fear of war to the DPP government.</p>
<p>"Its ultimate purpose hopes to affect Taiwan's political development and question the Taiwan government within the Taiwan government. reduce.</p>

<p>The "Chip and Science Act" passed by the United States in 2022 provided US $ 53 billion aid and subsidies to companies producing semiconductors in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zwgk/gkzcfb/202307/20230703419666.shtml">China announced</a><strong> Export control of the correlation items of the two metals, the two metals, from August 1st, is called the purpose of "maintaining national security and interests." </strong></p>
<p>These two metals are the key raw materials for manufacturing semiconductors. China's move is generally considered to be the latest countermeasures in the US -China chip war. Both the United States and China hope to occupy a dominant position in military core technology.</p>
<p>When the move was announced, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited China.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and the Biden government have adopted a series of measures in restricting the exports of Hua Gao technology. Especially in October last year, the Bayeng government has implemented more comprehensive restrictions to prohibit the use of American equipment and technology manufacturing. High -end chip exports to China. These measures have severely damaged China's high -end semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>China currently has no advantages in designing and manufacturing high -end semiconductors. Some analysts point out that China is using its dominant position in the rare metal market to try to counter Western export control.</p>
<p>"The Biden government has taken very targeted actions for the supply of high -end semiconductor chips, and Beijing has no other choices to confront them." Said Aadil Bra, a visiting scholar of Taipei National University of Political University.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that Beijing is taking action through export control and taking action in the scientific and technological warfare with Washington." He said, "This is a pure way of scientific and technological competition with teeth."</p>
<p>Wei Jianguo, deputy director of the China International Economic Exchange Center and former deputy minister of the Ministry of Commerce, said in an interview with the Chinese Daily Newspaper "China Daily" recently, "This is just the beginning of China's countermeasures. . If the restrictions on Hua Ga's technology will continue to be upgraded, China's countermeasures will be further upgraded. "</p>

Especially in October last year, the Bayeng government has implemented more comprehensive restrictions to prohibit the use of American equipment and technology manufacturing. High -end chip exports to China. These measures have severely damaged China's high -end semiconductor industry.</p>
<h3>American, Europe expressed concerns</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the US Department of Commerce said on Wednesday that the United States "resolutely" opposed China's export control of 镓 and 锗 material, and said that Washington will negotiate with partners and allies to solve this problem.</p>
<p>"These actions highlight the diversification of the supply chain. The United States will solve this problem with our allies and partners and establish flexibility in the critical supply chain," said Reuters, a spokesman for the US Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>EUROPEANCOMMISION also expressed concerns. His spokesman said on Tuesday afternoon that "镓 and 锗" is vital to our industry, especially in the strategic field, and (in a sense), we rely on a single supplier. "</p>
<p>The spokesman publicly questioned China's defense on the grounds of "national security", and urged China to consistent its trade policies with the World Trade Organization and based on "clear security considerations".</p>
<h3>镓? What is it? What is the purpose?</h3>
<p>Both 色 and 镓 are silver -white metals, and usually do not exist in nature. They are by -products for processing zinc, coal, and aluminum mine, which can be used after recycling.</p>
<p>These two metals are widely used in manufacturing semiconductors, communication equipment and solar panels.</p>
<p>In terms of semiconductors, combining 锗 and 锗 and other elements, respectively, can improve the speed and efficiency of transmission. For example, the compound of the pupa is nitride, and the U.S. military uses it for radar manufacturing. Another arsenide is more resistant to high temperature and humidity than commonly used semiconductor materials, and has better conductivity, so it is widely used for high -performance chips.</p>
<p>According to data from the market research institution Precept, the sales of chips using nitride last year reached US $ 2.47 billion, and it is expected to climb to 19.3 billion US dollars in 2030.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Research and Markets of research institutions, it is expected that by 2030, chips produced with gallium arsenidium will increase from $ 1.4 billion last year to $ 3.4 billion.</p>

<h3>How important is China?</h3>
<p>China is the largest producer of Kazuki, which has led China to occupy a strong dominant position on the global supply chain.</p>
<p>According to data from the European Industry Association Key Raw Materials Alliance (CRMA), China's cricket output accounts for about 80%of the global total output; 锗 output accounts for about 60%of the world's.</p>
<p>According to the US Geologicalsurvey (US Geologicalsurvey), 53%of the United States from 2018 to 2021 came from China, followed by Germany, Japan, Ukraine, etc. After the United States levied higher tariffs on China, imports in 2019 declined significantly.</p>
<p>According to Chinese customs data, in 2022, the largest importing country of Chinese products is Japan, Germany and the Netherlands. 是 The main import countries of products are Japan, France, Germany and the United States.</p>
<h3>What other countries are produced?</h3>
<p>Both metals of 金 and 两 are not particularly rare, but the processing costs are high. Because China has been exporting at relatively low prices for a long time, there are almost no mining facilities elsewhere.</p>
<p>According to CRU Group, the metal industry intelligence provider, other countries producing crickets include Japan, South Korea, Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<h3>How to affect the supply chain?</h3>
<p>Comprehensive analysis pointed out that China ’s export ban will have a certain degree of impact in the short term, but it still needs to be observed in the long run.</p>
<p>Hindu scholar Bi Qingdian in Taiwan said, "In the short term, the cost of semiconductor chips may increase because suppliers need to purchase these two substances from other sources. China's output of these two substances has begun to top."</p>
<p>He also said, "The United States and other countries are seeking to replace China's share in the global mineral trade. If it cannot be reached an agreement on some semiconductor sanctions on China, Beijing's export control may accelerate this process."</p>
<p>According to many foreign media reports, the United States is considering expanding export control over the Chinese chip industry. It is unclear what the specific measures are.</p>
<p>Bi Qingdian believes that because the United States is about to enter the presidential election stage, it is unlikely to cancel sanctions so soon. When the alternative supply of and 锗 锗 is established, the price of semiconductors will eventually decline.</p>
<p>"In this case, China will be a loser."</p>

<p>Paultriolo, a senior researcher at the Senior Researcher of the CNTER for Strategic and Internationalstudies, told Hong Kong media that "If China chooses these supply chain weapons, it will reduce the United States, the European Union and Asia to reduce The consideration of China's dependence is greatly complicated. "</p>
<p>He also said, "Even if it is only part of the reconstruction of the key mineral supply chain, it takes a long time and investment."</p>
<p>Joo Young-Joon, the first official of the Ministry of Commerce Resources of South Korea, told the media that China's latest export control measures may have limited impact in the short term, but uncertainty still exists. He said: "It is unclear how long China's export control will last, and the possibility of expanding the ban to other projects cannot be ruled out."</p>
<p>The South Korean government plans to further diversify the procurement route of key materials and develop alternative materials for industries imported from specific countries.</p>
<p>The Japanese government also said on Tuesday that it is evaluating the relevant influence and promised to take measures to diversify the procurement of materials.</p>

(Data photo)</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) Facing synthetic opium drugs such as FENTANYL, the United States has recently criticized China that China has not actively cooperated with illegal trade to combat fentanyl. The US State Department is responsible for international drugs and law enforcement, Toddrobinson (July 6) that China should do more and hope that other countries can communicate with China together to promote China to restrict synthetic drug circulation.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State AntonyBlinken will hold an online meeting on Friday (7th); according to the U.S. State Department, the goal of this meeting is to "unite the joint efforts of all countries in the world, prevent the illegal manufacturing and trafficking of synthetic drugs, and identify new drug trends. And effectively affect its public health. " Reuters pointed out that at least 84 countries participated in this meeting, and the United States hopes to establish a "global alliance" to combat synthetic drugs.</p>
<p>"We invited China, but there are no signs now showing that they are going to participate." Robinson said. On the issue of Fentney, China has not been in contact with US officials in recent months, but the United States is still actively seeking China assistance.</p>
<p>Directors of the United States Anti -Drug Administration (DEA) Annemilgram also said on the 2nd that the US media NBC also said that the United States has always "prepared to cooperate with anyone who wants to cooperate", but China has not released a positive intention of cooperation. She also called on Mexico to take more actions.</p>
<p>"This is not accusing, nor is it to put pressure." Robinson said that the reason why the United States wanted to form this alliance was partly because of contact with other countries to combat the Fentany supply chain; although China did not communicate with the United States, it did not communicate with the United States, but it did not communicate with the United States, but it did not communicate with the United States, but China did not communicate with the United States. There are exchanges with other countries. "We think let other countries negotiate with China, and will eventually have results."</p>
<p>For the Friday meeting, the Chinese Embassy in China did not respond immediately.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T02-06-00Z/64739417_401.png" />The United States claims that China is the main source of fentini chemicals, but China calls Fennes a problem of the United States itself. (Data photo)</p>
<h3>What role does China play in the Fentini supply chain?</h3>
<p>Medicated Fentny is usually used for pain relief. For example, the treatment of advanced cancer is 50 to 100 times stronger than that of morphine. However, illegal manufacturing and synthetic fentanyls have inflow into the drug market in recent years; according to the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 2019 to 2020, the proportion of deaths due to excessive synthetic opium drugs has increased by 56%.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Fantne, which is circulating in the United States, often <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/為打擊芬太尼走私-墨西哥向習近平求援/a-65231251">smuggling from the border between the United States and Mexico</a>The chemicals required for manufacturing Fantne mainly come from China.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/回应美方要求中国将芬太尼列入管制清单/a-48148446">China incorporates fentini into the category of drug control</a>Essence With the deterioration of geopolitical relations in the United States and China, from the perspective of U.S. officials, China has not provided too much help to combat the circulation of fentini pre -body chemicals and trafficking. China advocates that the abuse of fentanyl is the problem of "made in the United States" and the root cause is in the United States itself. Therefore, the United States believes that the United States should strengthen supervision by itself.</p>
<p>This year, the United States has repeatedly adopted actions to combat Fantne's multinational supply chain.

<p>According to Russia's "Bulletin" <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/army/2023/07/05/17233634.shtml?updated">Report</a>After the Ukrainian armed forces launched a counterattack for a month, both the West and the East both realized that Kiev did not launch a counterattack as planned.</p>
<p>Former Russian air defense forces officer Mihail Ho Darnak talked about the results of the Ukrainian armed forces launched a monthly counterattack and predicted the next offensive operation of the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>Odarino said that protecting citizens during the war means not allowing them to face unreasonable risks during fighting and action, and emphasized that the Ukrainian expert community preach the Ukrainian armed forces is currently undergoing "formation" and "testing" operations. And slowly destroy the point of view of enemy forces and equipment, which ensures that its defense is either eliminated in a region or was eliminated at the same time in several areas.</p>

<h4></h4>
<p>Hoidornak said that if Ukraine's plan is to fight a national battle with a national defense industry with limited capacity and a small population density, its plan may be successful. And the other party has a strong defense industry, which is one of the factors that make Ukraine worry and cannot calm down.</p>
<p>Hodarnak added that counterattacks have caused Ukrainian resources to be increasingly exhausted, losses of soldiers and equipment have continued to increase, and rare ammunition owned by Ukrainian armed forces also exhausted.</p>

<h4>Tactical success .. But</h4>
<p>It is worth noting that the Ukrainian armed forces have achieved a certain tactical success, regaining some settlements, and promoting some directions, but did not reach the level of the expected results of the process expected at the next NATO summit.</p>
<p>The author believes that due to the lack of comprehensive air and firepower advantages and lack of strategic reserves, the counterattack of Ukrainian armed forces is destined to fail, and the foreign forces are accused of pushing Ukrainian military and political leadership to take this step.</p>
<p>At the same time, the author expects Ukrainian armed forces on June 4th's offensive operations will end in failure.</p>
<p>Although the Kiev authorities show an optimistic attitude, the impression of most Western experts is that at the current stage of the armed struggle, the Ukrainian armed forces will not win. They exclude the possibility of a conversion point of hostile action before the NATO summit held this month. Essence</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T03-01-53/1-1688696576.jpg" />Ukraine's counterattack has made a few progress ... What will happen next?</p>

<p>On the other hand, the second offensive operation of the Ukrainian armed forces requires a large number of multi -functional fighters to increase the supply of self -propelled artillery, tanks, and attack helicopters and material transportation.</p>
<p>In other words, breaking through enemy defense like the Russian army requires various missile forces, artillery and armored forces, and engineering soldiers. The end of the end is still far away.</p>
<p>However, the report emphasized that at this stage, the results of hostile operations made clear conclusions is too early, especially in consideration of the development of the situation, the main force of the Ukrainian army has not yet invested in the battle.</p>

The efforts made by dependence are correct.</p>
<p>On the first day of meeting in Beijing, she made a strong defense for the US industry; Yellen's trip <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230706/janet-yellen-china-treasury/">significant</a>It aims to ease the tension between China and the United States. She made the above -mentioned expressions on a group of high -rise enterprise executives, and her words highlighted the challenges faced by the world's two largest economies in seeking beyond profound differences.</p>
<p>"In the meeting with China, I conveyed the concerns that I learned from the American business community -including Chinese use of non -marketing tools, such as expanding subsidies to state -owned enterprises and domestic companies, and setting market access barriers to foreign companies." Yeah Lun said to members of the US Chamber of Commerce in China at a round table. "In recent months, the punishment actions adopted by American companies have made me particularly disturbing." Representatives including Boeing, Bank of America, and agricultural giant Cargan have attended the round table meeting.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Chinese authorities detained the Beijing Office of the Beijing Office of Mei Sizi Group <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230327/china-business-company-raid/">Five Chinese Citizens</a>And closed the office, a US consulting company with 18 offices worldwide.

<p>Prior to reviewing China in China, the Bayeng Government <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221008/biden-chip-technology/">Obtained China</a>Key semiconductor manufacturing technology and tools have taken restrictions.</p>
<p>The Biden government is preparing to implement more restrictions on the technical trade between the two parties, including <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230629/biden-administration-ai-chips-china/">Advanced Chip</a>And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html">Investment in the United States in China</a>Potential restrictions.

<p>This week, the relative situation of tit -tit is still continuing, and Beijing has retaliated with the restrictions on the Bayeng government's semiconductor, announcing that it will restrict the export of some key minerals used to produce some chips.</p>
<p>An official of the Chinese Ministry of Finance stated on Friday that the meeting with Yellen would improve the economic relations between the two countries, and said that the United States needed measures to achieve this goal. The official also said that neither of the two countries benefited from "decoupling" and supply chain interruption.</p>
<p>Yelun said on Friday that she was "worried" about China's decision to implement export control.</p>
<p>Yellen said, "We are still evaluating the impact of these actions, but they remind us that it is important to establish a flexible and diversified supply chain." She said that the United States may respond more Get fairly.</p>

<p>Yellen plans to ask these problems in dense meetings with Chinese officials in the next two days.</p>
<p>In addition to business leaders, Yelun also met with former Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China who was about to leave. An official of the Ministry of Finance said Yellen had more than an informal discussion with these pre -peer officials, talking about economic prospects.</p>
<p>Late on Friday afternoon, she will meet with Prime Minister Li Qiang in the Great Hall of the People.</p>

<p>Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p><strong> [FT Chinese Network and China Institute jointly held a discussion on artificial intelligence in New York on June 20. </strong></p>
<p>This forum explores the subversive potential and reasons that ChatGPT has attracted great attention in the capital industry, as well as the possible impact of the development of artificial intelligence on various industries. What kind of work will be replaced by artificial intelligence? Does artificial intelligence cause more false information to bring more business monopolies, will people receive more control and monitoring? Will it even affect the survival of human beings itself? And how will the competition between China and the United States in the field of artificial intelligence will be launched? ]</p>
<p>Moderator: Feng Yuqing: FT Chinese website column writer</p>
<p>Guest: Kathleen R. McKEOWN: Founding of the Institute of Data Science and Engineering, Columbia University, professor, natural language processing expert</p>
<p>FranceSca Rossi: IBM Researcher, IBM Global AI Ethics Leader</p>
<p>David Chen Angelves: Founder &amp; Director</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing </strong>: First of all, I want to mention this book. "A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence" was written by Professor Woodbridge, director of the Department of Computer, Cambridge University. This book was published in January 2021. The book mentioned that artificial intelligence cannot answer the question freely in the foreseeable future, to reach the translation of human level, explain the situation in the photo, and write interesting stories. Just two years later, ChatGPT did it. Has ChatGPT challenged this prediction and achieved a real technical breakthrough?</p>
<p><strong> Kathleen R. McKeown: </strong> I do think this is a milestone, ChatGPT's current ability is far more than before. ChatGPT is a large language model. I think large language models play a disruptive role. New capabilities are emerging rapidly every day, and even changes our way of researching and developing new models. In the past six months, we have tested the ability to write an article abstract in large language models. This is the theme I have been studying for many years.</p>
<p>The results we find are very interesting. We make people judge the results written by various large language models, compared with articles written by free professional writers. We found that GPT3 (ChatGPT's predecessor) is equivalent to humans. This shows that a single document news Abstract is a problem that has been solved. In this work, we also found that the instructions issued by the model are very important, not just the size of the model.</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> Do you think the appearance of ChatGPT is not foreseeable in the AI field?</p>
<p><strong> FranceSca Rossi: </strong> Specific neural network architecture is there, but it has not been found that it can make the public use. This ChatGPT did it. This is not only a subversive change compared to 12 years or even 7 months ago, but also how to make more people, not only experts, but also really use this technology. So many companies are now aware of this new ability.</p>
<p>This is why the company wants to provide customers with the possibility of AI. In this way, they can do what they can't do before. But some customers, such as IBM customers, are asking us a question. What should I do if there is an error message? What about fairness? What about copyright or data privacy? There are many questions about companies willing to use this technology. They asked, what did you do about this? If there is a problem, who is responsible? They want to know this.</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> Dr.Rossi, I know that IBM is the real pioneer of AI, especially your Watson laboratory. In 1997, IBM's deep blue defeated the world chess championship. In 2011, IBM's Watson won Jeopardy. So how do you compare the achievements of ChatGPT with the previous AI?</p>
<p><strong> FranceSca Rossi </strong>: Chess challenges are mainly achieved through computing power. At that time, AI was more limited in terms of ability. Therefore, there are some AI technologies, but the computer's prediction ability is far more than the best international chess player. Watson's situation of Jeopardy is different because it is already using some more advanced AI technologies, such as machine learning. It can understand the question of natural language and understand what is the correct answer. So this is the second wave of AI. Now the third wave of AI. AI can not only do these, but also generate content. This is why this is a milestone, because so far, the use of AI to explain images or texts, predict or classify, or make decisions, but does not generate content. So ChatGPT really changed the rules of the game.</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> What do you think of the current enthusiasm for AI investment? What impact will it have on the innovation of the entire industry? Will there be a bubble like the Internet era in early 2000? David, you have a lot of investment experience in the AI field, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong> David Chen: </strong> The past six months of artificial intelligence is different from the artificial intelligence boom in previous generations. It really affects the market that we cannot ignore. In the first five months of 2023, the funds invested in AI have exceeded four times that of 2022, and AI's gold rush wave rushed.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Internet company more than 20 years ago. As long as it is about .com, get the funds immediately. This is the mentality that investors are afraid to miss. This is the wave of investment AI we see now. This time will pass. We may currently be in an AI investment bubble. The question is when this bubble will break, just like the previous Internet bubble. However, even though the Internet bubble comes and goes, it still changes the operation of society and the lifestyle of people. So we have an AI boom today. Not every company will succeed, and some companies will fail. This is the natural law of investment. But in general, we still use all aspects of AI technology.</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> ChatGPT may bring fundamental changes in various fields such as education, finance and medical care. According to Goldman Sachs report, artificial intelligence may automate up to 18%of work, which has significant impact on high -income countries. Taking the United States as an example, 15%-35%of the work will be replaced. Among them, the most vulnerable to replacement is the work such as office, administrative, lawyer and engineering. Do it with work, such as NURSE and Psychological Counselor. The biggest affected is the white -collar class that has been educated, so the danger is the flow of the middle class and the middle class from top to bottom. IBM recently announced that about 7,800 jobs may be replaced by artificial intelligence and automation. What does this mean for young professionals who want to flourish in their own field? Do you have any suggestions for them? "<strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> Many students now want to learn computer and finance, because the salary in this field is very good and has been respected. However, in the future, if AI can replace primary computers, finance, lawyers, accounting work, what kind of profession will be the most popular?</p>
<p><strong> Kathleen R. McKEOWN: </strong> I will recommend 18 -year -old children to learn about existing technology and what these technologies can do, even 18 -year -old children who are interested in humanities, history, literature and art. I think there are many opportunities for cooperation between humanities and computer science. I think it is necessary for students to understand what is possible and how to use it. Before, you need to learn computer majors to consider involved in these fields. Now, tools have become more popular, and people can do more. There are a lot of art in the data, and there are a lot of data in art.</p>
<p><strong> David: </strong> Due to the development of technology, work seems to be disappearing. The question is, can we let everyone adapt to these new technology? There are many examples in history to prove this. For example, the invention of the elevator, I came from the second floor to the 45th floor. Who would have a job to promote the elevator operation, or who would connect your phone call in the background? In the 1940s, these tasks still existed, but today, these tasks have disappeared. The question is, can we improve ourselves as humans and do more meaningful work? I always give such an example: if you go to the store, if there is a cashier or someone wants to clean the bathroom. When you are a child, you will tell your parents when you are 10 years old. I want to be the best in the world in the world. Is the bathroom cleaner? If your child say so, how would you respond to your child? The sad reality is that some people do doing such a job because we need these tasks. However, with the development of advanced technology, most people can upgrade to better jobs. This means that we need to re -train ourselves as humans, which is my answer.</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> AI has a huge impact on the revolutionary changes and future work prospects of all walks of life. Another thing that is very concerned is that the false information brought by AI is easier to spread in the society. When people become more and more It is difficult to distinguish between authenticity, which will have a very negative impact on the operation of society.</p>
<p><strong> FranceSca Ross: </strong> I think we must be careful, because about two years ago, people's trust in AI is still a question. People want to know that I should trust AI? The current situation is a bit opposite. People are too trusting this technology and tend to excessively attribute to AI. why? Because the machine seems to be manifested like humans. Therefore, because these machines can write text like humans, we tend to think that it also has other abilities owned by humans.</p>
<p><strong> David Chen: </strong> I think this is a combination of trust and dislike. The reason why people trust it is because it is so simple to use. The interface of ChatGPT is based on the browser. You enter the problem and get the answer. The answer sounds credible. But it may be wrong. Solutions like IBM do not mean that everyone can use it, and ChatGPT can make the general public that does not understand AI can use it, and the result is so powerful.</p>
<p><strong> Feng Yuqing: </strong> but also brought a lot of trouble. Like what you just said, there will be some false information. For example, a recent lawyer Stevenschwartz in New York apologized to the judge because he submitted a statement to use Chatgpt to help find the writing information. However, ChatGPT generates a case that does not exist at all. Schwartz admits that he does not know that ChatGPT will make up cases and ruling. People know what we don't know, so do ChatGPT know what it doesn't know?</p>
<p><strong> Kathleen R. McKeown: </strong> I don't know in many cases. ChatGPT is produced by a company, and we cannot see the situation behind the scenes. We don't know the model method it uses. We don't know what data we use, these data are confidential. So in order to determine what it can do, we really need to spend some time to describe it.</p>
<p><strong> FranceSca Rossi: </strong> The problem of lies on ChatGPT, the construction of these systems cannot identify what is true and what is false. There will be no conscious lying. They are just trained to generate the most likely next word. They use a lot of data and a lot of computing power, and have a good natural language model. But there is no ability to really establish the facts of identification and what really happened. This is why many technologies can be adopted to prevent it from generating these illegal information after building a model. But even if the content is real, it may be a problem in this context, because the generated content may be harmful, permitted, racism, and may not meet human values.</p>

<h1>The brotherhood of Xi Jinping and Putin may have seen the top</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-07T04-53-42-08-00/06Hass-master1050.jpg" />Ten years ago, when Xi Jinping reached the top of China's power, he regarded Putin as a strong leader who was hostile to the Western -led international system like himself. They all have the best means of threats facing their own ruling institutes and the best means to control the domestic situation and tolerate their dictatorships in the country. <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/gjhdq_676201/gj_676203/oz_678770/1206_679110/1207_679122/202303/t20230322_11046188.shtml">Communication</a>Essence Xi Jinping said that Putin was his "best and closest friend."</p>
<p>After the Wagner incident, Xi Jinping's bet on the Russian leader didn't look so stable.</p>
<p>Last month, Russia's catastrophic war worked hard to reach a climax in the abortion rebellion launched by Wagner Group's quasi -military leader, Yafgeni Porigo, exposed the essence of Russia under the leadership of Putin: this is a border with China, the strength is being bordered, the strength is being bordered by China, the strength is being bordered by China, the strength is being bordered by China, the strength is being bordered by China, the strength is being bordered by China. In the weakened and difficult -to -predictive nuclear countries, the frustrated leaders have been unable to guarantee that they can take power for a long time.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping could not completely abandon Putin. He has invested too much in this relationship, and Russia is still useful to China. But they have caused so much worried brotherhood in the West.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>If Xi Jinping wants to achieve the strategic goal of catching up with the United States globally, he must consider Putin's fragility and re -adjust his foreign policy. This may mean that China will more strongly support the end of this war that has caused serious blows to Putin, and may adopt a counter -downgrade against the United States and Taiwan.</p>
<p>There are signs that the friendship between Xi Jinping and Putin may have cooled down. China ’s [response is very restrained] on the Wagner incident(https://asiatimes.com/2023/07/parsing-chinas-response-to-the-wagner-rebellion/)It is only called "internal affairs", but the Chinese official media seems to have changed the attempted soldiers <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202306/26/WS6498e508a310bf8a75d6b900.html">revealing an restless attitude</a>Essence Now a blank check that supports Putin is not good for Xi Jinping. This approach may lead to domestic questions about Xi Jinping's foreign policy judgment. If Putin further frustrated, this question may only intensify.</p>
<p>China may be forced to adjust its position in the Ukrainian war. So far, although there is no sincere peace appealed, China still properly proper this war to prevent NATO's expansion or Western provocation, bringing important diplomatic cover to Russia. China also provides economic life pulse for Russia, offset Western sanctions by significantly expanding the scale of Sino -Russian trade.</p>
<p>Although there have been [signs] for a long time(https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/15/world/ukraine-russia-war)It shows that the Chinese leadership does not fully support the war of Putin, but at the beginning of the conflict, China hopes that it can take the United States from Asia, and China has always sought its influence to expand in Asia. However, this has not become a reality. On the contrary, since the beginning of the Ukraine, the United States and its Asian allies have established a stronger military existence around China, and now they are more united in restricting China's key technologies.</p>
<p>Putin is alone. But China is now aware that Ukraine's long -term war may further threaten Russia's partner country and damage China's own foreign policy agenda. China has a reason to go further in the vague expression of the war principles before, and uses its unique influence on Russia to urge the realization of the armistice.</p>
<p>One key reason for this situation is Europe, where China is damaged by supporting Russia. The European business community has deteriorated in China, and foreign direct investment has slowed down, and the coordination of the two sides of the Atlantic has strengthened its coordination on China.</p>

<p>Xi Jinping must resolutely weaken the United States to curb China's efforts. A hostile Europe will make him face difficulties. Russia's isolation has put pressure on China and allows it to improve European relations to prevent Europe from uniting to fight against China. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to find a clearer re -positioning in the conflict of this European home and play the role of peaceful creators.</p>
<p>Russia's issue has also made Xi Jinping's planning on Taiwan's issues complicated. The Ukrainian war shows two things: it is not possible to win the battle by relying on military forces; but not winning the battle may lead to the challenge of the power of the leadership. Faced with these situations, through the increasingly fighting moves, the Taiwan Strait War may be disastrous for Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>The autonomous island of Taiwan will hold a presidential election in January next year. Cai Yingwen's successor will be selected. Tsai Ing -wen will make Beijing a fiery three feet because he goes closer and closer to the United States. China is believed to have used <a href="https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/the-battle-for-reality-chinese-disinformation-in-taiwan/">a series of means</a>Applying economic pressure on Taiwan, or spreading error information to support candidates who improve relations with Beijing.</p>
<p>However, the aggressive speech of the Chinese side and the threat of military exercises around Taiwan may be counterproductive. Not only will it not only make the candidates who oppose China stronger, but also stimulate the stronger and clear support of the United States and the international community for Taiwan. For Xi Jinping, the best balance point is to show a tough and firm position while not leading to the continuous upgrade of the situation.</p>
<p>In view of these changes, Chinese leaders may now realize that they must ease the tension with the United States. Sino -US relations that have been in a deadlock due to the spy balloon incident in February have recently appeared signs of thawing.(https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)Visit Beijing, the itinerary includes meeting with Xi Jinping, and this week's finance minister <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230703/janet-yellen-china-visit/">Yelun</a>It also started a trip to China.</p>
<p>Chinese President still needs his "close friend". If the role of human rights and democratic governance in the international system, Russia is still the only country that has the ability and motivation to cooperate with China on this issue. Stable relationships will also ensure the stability of the long land boundary between the two countries and allow China to obtain Russia's energy, imported food and military equipment at preferential prices. It is expected that the two countries will maintain everything.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-07T05-20-58-08-00/00dc-uschina-numbers-kvlz-master1050.jpg" />The competition between China and the United States in national security and economic competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and US leaders often regard China as their largest long -term challengers.</p>
<p>However, the two largest economies in the world -accounting for 40%of the total output of the world -still indispensable partners in many aspects: buying and selling important products with each other, providing financing for each other's companies, and frequent people's walks. And develop applications and make movies for audiences of the two countries.</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance Jennite Yellen met with senior Chinese officials in Beijing this week. How she will face how to control this relationship, including conflicts and cooperation. The following numbers illustrate the connection between the two countries.</p>
<p><strong> Economic and military strength </strong></p>
<p>• Based on the US dollar value, the US economy <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN">Continue to surpass China</a>: In 2022, China's GDP was <strong> $ 18 trillion </strong>, while the United States was <strong> $ 25.5 trillion </strong>.</p>
<p>• But China's population is more than four times that of the United States. If you make adjustments at the local price, the economic situation will seem different. According to <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/EU/CHN/USA">International Monetary Fund</a>The data of the purchasing power is calculated that China ’s GDP accounts for <strong> 18.9%</strong>, surpassing the United States’<em>15.4%</em>*.</p>
<p>• China adopts <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative">Belt and Road "initiative</a>It provides a global infrastructure that provides <strong> more than $ 1 trillion </strong>. Analysts believe that this is its efforts to projected power worldwide.</p>
<p>• The rapid development and modernization of the Chinese army have triggered concerns about the United States. China has more naval ships and [more military personnel] than the United States <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.TOTL.P1?locations=US-CN">more military personnel</a>There were 2.5 million people in 2019 **.</p>
<p>• But the equipment of the American armed forces is much more advanced, and the defense expenditure in the United States is still [more than the sum of the total 10 countries in the following)(https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison)——In 2022, it reached <strong> 877 billion US dollars </strong>, while China's defense expenditure was said to reach $ 292 billion **.</p>
<p><strong>trade relations</strong></p>

<p>• Although the tension between the two countries has continued to intensify, the trade between the two sides is still extremely strong. China is the third largest trading partner in the United States, second only to Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>• Last year, the United States imported products and services from China to a record of $ 563.6 billion **. But the proportion of imports from China has been <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/international/factsheet/factsheet.html#650">decline</a>This shows that some companies are cutting off with China.</p>
<p>• China is also a major export market.(https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/record-us-fy-2022-agricultural-exports-china#:~:text=Corn%2C%20Sorghum%2C%20and%20Alfalfa%20Hay&amp;text=China%20is%20also%20a%20major,volumes%20of%20feed%20grain%20imports.)Sell to China.

<p>• Whether it is key products or daily commodities, China dominates the supply chain.

<p>• Due to the consideration of national security and concerns about human rights, the United States has continuously expanded sanctions on Chinese enterprises and organizations. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce, the United States includes 721 Chinese companies, organizations, and individuals in the "physical list". Buy products from the United States.</p>

The revenue obtained by large US companies from China exceeds the sum of revenue obtained from the next three countries -Japan, Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>• But for American companies that develop business in China, the prospects are becoming more and more dim.

<h3>Wagner's mercenary rebellion: Belarus leader Lukashenko said no one in the rebellion became a hero</h3>
<ul>
<li>Steve Rosenberg * BBC Reporter in Russia from Minsk</li>
</ul>

<p>Will Belarus use nuclear weapons deployed by Russia? President Lukashenko answered like this</p>
<p><strong> It is said that Alexander Lukashenko, a Belarusian leader, promoted an agreement to end Wagner's mercenary rebellion. </strong></p>
<p>If this rumor is true, it will be the most vague part of this story. Therefore, if anyone can reveal the truth of this unknown story, it must be the Belarusian leader. At least we want this.</p>
<p>We are one of the few reporters who have been invited to the Minsk Independence Palace and Lukashenko.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, people kept guessing what his health was. However, the Belarusian strong man in front of me obviously had good energy. The "dialogue" lasted for nearly four hours.</p>
<p>However, he did not provide any key information for the recent Russian uprising, but made the information more chaotic.</p>
<p>According to the agreement between the Wagner Group and the Kremlin, the leader of the Wagner Group Yaviggeni Porigerin should move to Belarus with his mercenaries.</p>
<p>But this did not happen. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Lukashenko said: "Until this morning, these important Wagner soldiers are still stationed on the camp after the evacuation of the Bach Murut."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T05-35-37.000Z/_130312119_35bdfa05-8d75-4249-8cca-0a1a45ad0a5d.jpg" />Image source, Belarus Presidential Pool</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Russia claims to transport nuclear warheads to Belarus.</p>
<p>"As for Porigin, he is in St. Petersburg. Or maybe he flew to Moscow this morning. Or he may be in other places. But he is not in Belarus."</p>
<p>I asked Lukashenko whether this this means that the agreement is broken? He denied it. But I feel that there may be a conversation that we will not be told behind the scenes.</p>
<p>When discussing the problem of Wagner's rebellion, in fact, the positions of Moscow and Minsk were not completely consistent.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Russian National Television announced that Putin became a hero after these dramatic events.</p>
<p>"I think no one can become a hero in that case," Lukashenko said to me.</p>
<p>"Purigzin is not, Putin is not, and Lukashenko is not. There are no heroes. What are the lessons from this? If we create such armed organizations, we need to pay close attention to them and give serious attention. "</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>When discussing the problem of the rebellion of the Wagner, the positions of Moscow and Minsk were not consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-66012863">What is the impact of the end of the Wagner rebellion, Russia, Ukraine and the world? </a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64314486">Ukraine War: Who is the leader of the Russian mercenary "Wagner Group" who recruited criminals to participate in the war</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64779290">How does the fate of Putin closely connected to the Ukrainian war</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-60995486">Ukrainian War: Unveil the mystery of the Russian secret mercenaries "Wagner Group"</a>Our "dialogue" turned to nuclear weapons. In particular, Russia claims to transport nuclear warheads to Belarus.</p>
<p>"God bless me without having to make a decision to use them," said Lukashenko. But he recently said, "But I will not hesitate to use them."</p>
<p>I remind him of these words.</p>
<p>"Joe Biden can also say the same thing, and Prime Minister Sonak," Lukashenko answered me. He added, "There are also my friends Xi Jinping and my elder brother President Putin."</p>
<p>I added, "But what we talk about is not your weapon, they are Russian weapons. This will not be your decision."</p>
<p>The leader retorted me, "In Ukraine, the entire army is using foreign weapons to fight, right? And NATO weapons. This is because Ukraine has exhausted his weapon. So why can't I use other people's weapons to fight combat Woolen cloth?"</p>
<p>But we are talking about nuclear weapons, not pistols, I replied.</p>
<p>"Nuclear weapons, yes. They are also weapons, tactical nuclear weapons." He answered me like this.</p>
<p>From these reviews about nuclear weapons, you may guess that Lukashenko is a controversial person.</p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom do not recognize him as a legal president of Belarus.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Belarusi people stepped on the street and accused him of stealing the presidential election of the country. The protests were brutally suppressed.</p>
<p>I mentioned the case of Maria Kolesnikova, Maria Kolesnikova.</p>
<p>"For a few months, her relatives and lawyers have been banned from visiting her. Why?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I know nothing about this," he claims.</p>
<p>I reminded Mr. Lukashenko, "When I visited you in the fall of 2021, there were 873 political prisoners in Belarus, and it has now increased to 1,500 people."</p>
<p>"There is no clause on political crimes in our criminal law," he answered me.</p>
<p>However, I pointed out that there is no political prisoner without law about political crimes.</p>
<p>However, he insisted on responding, "If there are no relevant laws, prisoners cannot be regarded as political prisoners. How could they be a political prisoner?"</p>

In severe cases, Moscow may repeat the political storm that is dizzying and let the Soviet Union quickly disintegrate, and re -establish a new new new. Slavic National Federation. "</p>
<p>The author believes that this article is biased on issues such as the influence of Porigo's reform, and its predictions are not objective enough. In fact, the transformation of Pryo in the "Flowers", which has an impact on Russia's domestic politics. The possibility of Putin's step down is very small, and its regime is still relatively stable. As for Russia's views of disintegration like the former Soviet Union at the present stage, it is almost "day and night." This article will be the influence of Pingpurigen's altitude.</p>
<p>The soldiers launched by Porigon soon ended quickly after Belarusian President Lukashenko's intervention. As for the change of soldiers, the contradictions between Porigen and Russian Defense Minister Shohgu and others have continued to accumulate, and they have been sharp in the near future. Pricig, who believes that he and Wagner Group have important achievements, the goal of launching a mutiny includes persecution of Shoyu and others to step down, and prevent the Russian Ministry of Defense from strengthening the control of Wagner's mercenaries. But is there any other goals in Porigen? From the end of the situation without frustration, he may lack political ambitions, and his goal should not include the end of Putin regime (he will not lightly believe that the Putin regime is not stable enough).</p>
<p>After Putin made a speech on the morning of June 24, after a change in "betrayal" and saying that "the betrayer" would pay the price, Pricigen knew that the goal of his forcing Shogu and others to step down was unable to achieve. Putin has clearly stood on his hostility. If the soldiers continue, it will evolve to his conflict with Putin (not limited to his conflict with Hasia and others). He knew that he could not win the final victory in such a conflict.</p>
<p>Lukashenko provided the "step" to Porigo, and also gave him retreat -Pryigor quickly accepted arrangements to Belarus. Lukashenko may take the initiative to intervene so that the soldiers will end as soon as possible, which can help their allies Putin. In addition, if the situation of Russia worsen, it also has an important negative impact on Belarus, which he does not want to see. It is worth noting that Putin took the initiative to call Lukashenko to inform the situation on the morning of June 24th, which did not rule out that he was actually willing to see the latter's specific role. Putin must have thought that "the soldiers who are fighting without fighting" will end the mutiny through the way of not bleeding. At that time, the person who could not find the right person in Russia could not be negotiated with Pleigo, and Lukashenko was suitable for playing such a role -because he was an outsider, Pryigo was not hostile to him. Suspect.</p>
<p>Originally, Putin could withdraw from the Minister of Defense and others in order to make Purig's launch of the launch of a mutiny. Emperor Han Jing was wrongly advocated to cut the princes, and King Wu and King Jiaoxi started the troops on the pretext of wrong. He wronged that Jingdi led his soldiers and stayed in his own stay. Jingdi sent Zhou Yafa and others to face the army and killed the wrong. Putin's approach is different from Emperor Han Jing. It may be that the removal of the National Defense Minister (and Chief of Staff) may affect the military's hearts when considering the fierce battle at the front line of Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>It can be roughly believed that the longer the duration of the soldiers, the more unstable the hearts of Russian people will become, the greater the morale of the front line, and the higher the possibility of major progress in the Ukraine offensive -the farther the impact of the mutiny will be. However, this mutiny ended quickly, involving small regions and almost no casualties, so the impact was also very limited -not only for the Russian domestic affairs bureau, but also the process of the Russian and Ukraine War.</p>
<p>Someists claim that the soldiers show that Putin's control over power is more vulnerable than him at any time. This kind of view seems a bit arbitrary. In the past, Pricigo was the supporters of Putin, just like Haguku. Even if he launched a soldier, he did not completely transform into Putin's opponents. In the case of his unsuccessful troops (not to mention being defeated), he ended his mutiny and avoided Belarus. If the soldiers are regarded as the "internal fighting" between Putin's supporters, and not the "serious challenges" of the opponent of Pujing, it will not overestimate the negative impact of this mutiny on Putin's rule.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that after Pryigon launched the army, there was no political force in Russia to respond and cooperate with practical actions. Except for Wagna, there are no other Russian armed forces to participate in the military change. Putin mentioned "the unity of the entire Russian society" in a TV speech on June 26, and this is not serious. It can be roughly judged that the "Putin system" can still maintain stability after being challenged by the challenge of the mutiny -currently lacks a sufficient basis for any predictions that end.</p>
<p>The most affected by the "aquarium" soldier this time is actually Porigen himself -he can be said to be the loser and failed to achieve his mutiny goal. One of the direct consequences of this incident was that Pryigon lost his command and control of the front line Wagner mercenaries. In the future, he could not threaten the "important factor" that threatened Russia's political stability, and it was difficult to affect the Russian and Uchia war.</p>
<p>Will anyone follow the change of Poriger in the future? The possibility is not high. The Russian regular army is still controlled by Hagu and others. The Wagner mercenaries that have been difficult to control in the past period of time will definitely not become a military force that can fight against Shaoyigu and others after the mutiny.</p>
<p>Some people may think that this change provided "new opportunities" for Ukraine to continue the offensive. Ukrainian President Zelei Sky claimed that the country's army made progress in all directions of the front line on June 26. However, the preliminary judgment of the current judgment quickly obtained a peaceful resolution, which has a small impact on the Russian army's defense operations. Generally speaking, the situation of the front line of Russia and Ukraine is still difficult to get rid of the stagnation, and the casualties of both sides will continue to increase. Ukraine counterattacks still have to face many obstacles and difficulties.</p>

<p>On the same day, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow did not and did not intend to track the whereabouts of Porigabin.</p>

<p>Lukashenko said the Wagner troops are still in their camp, but they do not specifically explain the location of the camp.</p>
<p>He added that the proposal from Wagner to the Belarusian garrison was still valid, but the matter was still not concluded, and Belarus has not yet built a base for Wagner: "If they (Wagner's troops) agree, we will provide several military camps used in the Soviet Union in the Soviet Union. Give them a camp near Asipovichy. "</p>
<p>He said Wagner had different ideas for deployment of the army.</p>
<p>Russian independent media recently reported that Belarus has established multiple camps, one of which is located near Asxovich with an area of 24,000 square meters and can accommodate 8,000 beds.</p>

<h3>戈: This is not a coup</h3>
<p>On June 23, Porigo suddenly released news on social media saying that the Russian Ministry of Defense launched a missile attack on the rear camps of the Wagner Mercenary Corps, and the Wagner Corps prepared to respond to this. However, Pricigo only targeted the Secretary of Defense, Shi Yigu and the Chief of Staff of the Russian Army Gracimov, and did not target Putin himself for the time being. He said, "This is not a military coup, but a march in justice."</p>

The source of the soldiers comes from Russia's retired officers, police, and prisoners who want to be released in advance. Foreigners can also join in addition to NATO countries and Ukraine. His commander Ulin worshiped German musician Wagner, and the legion was named.</p>

<h3>Porigo does not accept the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>The Wagner Legion has been active on the front line of the war, such as playing an extremely important role in Bachmum's surrounding war. However, in recent months, fierce quarrels broke out with the senior executives of the Russian army, and believed that the Ministry of National Defense did not provide enough ammunition supply during the Bach Murut Campaign. Husbands should be responsible for the large number of casualties of the Wagner Mercenary Soldiers. Since June, the Russian Ministry of Defense demanded that the mercenaries have signed an agreement to obey the command before the end of the month. This seems to be tantamount to disarm, and the contradictions have been further intensified.</p>

<p>On June 26, the Russian Defense Minister Shao Yigu, who was accused of "incompetence", was named "incompetent" on TV, explaining that he inspected the frontline troops, but no time and place were not explained. However, people are more concerned about the whereabouts of Porigerin. According to the agreement reached with Belarus, he should go there. Reached?

<h3>How many people will follow him?</h3>
<p>In theory, he can take his mercenaries to Belarus. Not sure how many people will follow him. However, the business of the Wagner Legion is all over the world. Libya, Syria, Africa, and Venezuela in Latin America are the place where the mercenaries are made. Soldiers who were on the battlefield allegedly could get 5,000 US dollars per month. Porigabin claims that there are still 25,000 troops, and the US intelligence unit estimates that this number should double.</p>

<p>Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I participated in the Association of Liberal Democratcillors (ALDC) hosted by the British Liberal Democratic Party. Although I have participated in the campaign in May, the systematic study is the first time.</p>
<p>As the third largest party in the United Kingdom, the scale of the Liberal Democratic Party's training base surprised me -700 people can be trained at the same time, equipped with a full set of supporting and residential equipment, which is no different from hotel facilities. There are members of the training, as well as supporters and candidates who are preparing to run.</p>
<p>The training course is very compact. There are four courses a day. There is a tea break in the middle and the social time of the bar at night. In fact, I started from breakfast. The number of supporters on Twitter is less than 500, but the number of senior members often supports thousands. So I hope to know more people to support future campaign.</p>
<p>During each lecture period, there are two or six different training themes, and the participants choose at will according to their needs. After nearly 300 students were dispersed, there was no crowded in the classroom.</p>
<p>Course covers "Finding Volunteers", "Finding Council Candidates", "Community Campaign", "On -door Communication Skills", "Raising Project Fund", "Photos of Picking a Propaganda", "Design Single", "Application Writing" etc.</p>
<p>I also invited five people with the highest number of people in the British Liberal Democratic Party Canvass on the spot to introduce experience -people who like to chat with voters on the spot, one even said, "Enjoy an accident at the moment of each door."</p>
<p>I also came to chat with voters during the May election, but because I was in a hurry to enter the election, I did not have enough preparations, and I did n’t understand the political platform, so I did n’t dare to talk to the voters. In this course, I learned that in addition to understanding the opinions of voters on the community, the purpose of the door is not only a ticket, but also a good opportunity to find supporters, party members, and even future council candidates. This matter has entered the plan, and we will soon make a letter of thanks to voters (thanks to the voters for their support in May), and then I will visit one by one from house to visit to find suitable candidates for the future election team.</p>
<p>The production of thanks is not a trouble. Thanks to the letter, the community affairs notification, the campaign list, etc., the Liberal Democratic Party has a complete set of electronic templates that have already been produced. The text and picture location have been designed. Just fill in the required content and upload the picture.</p>
<p>The cost of printing the thank you letter is responsible for the party branch of our region. Most of the conservative campaign funds come from the donations of rich people, while the Liberal Democratic Party relies on personal donations from party members and supporters and free obligation services. For example, this training, all teachers (experienced members/former members) are free lectures. The current parliament pays 10%of wages is the norm of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
<p>In the regional election in May, in view of the disappointing performance of the Conservative Party in the past year, voters punished the Conservative Party with votes, benefiting the Labor Party, Liberal Democratic Party and other parties, and increased their own sites. Two newly -elected members of the training class appeared in the training class to talk about the experience of winning. The conclusion is: every step of tutoring in the training of ALDC will be successful!</p>
<p>As far as me is concerned, the power of the Liberal Democratic Party in my area is the most headache. In this training, I asked several members from different regions of England to ask if there was a situation where there was no candidate for parliamentarians. It was found that the situation in our region was the worst -in the best regions (such as London and the surrounding), even the candidates of members of the parliament must be selected in the party first, and it was almost impossible to find town councilors (that is, the lowest minimum (the lowest minimum minimum Levels, sub -level members have no salary) candidates; our town is not unable to find candidates at DISTRICT levels here, but that is why I can suddenly become a regional candidate for regional members in March this year -a sudden fall in the sky falls off the sky in the sky. In my enthusiastic elements, our party branch was really happy.</p>
<p>I have also increased their understanding of the political structure of England. Earlier I learned two levels of members: the lowest is Parish/Town (town) parliamentarians, and the second level is distribution of DISTRICT/CITY. This time, he communicated with LondonColney Parish Councille, Karlmugele, and found that there are three levels of his area, that is, in addition to the two levels mentioned earlier, there is also the third -county. There are many small constituencies in England. There are many names as stars, and the levels are different. The names are different. Except for professional and politicians, few outsiders understand the political division of the English region.</p>
<p>I have communicated with people in the party in the party, such as the District Sarahmurray. She joined the Liberal Democratic Party from the supporters of the Labor Party, but the opposite of I was the past. On many issues, we have a relative explanation. For example, why are the poor British poor? The Conservative Party's explanation is "because many people are lazy, are unwilling to work, and are willing to apply for benefits." The Labor Party explained that "they are trapped in a strange circle and need to obtain education and fair employment opportunities." Another example is "how do you think of British Treasury bonds getting higher and higher?" The Conservative Party may say "to try its best to reduce", and other parties may say that "compared with the United States, British Treasury bonds are low, and appropriate national debt is conducive to economic development."</p>
<p>And how to view the relationship between the poor and the rich? Britain has a hostile elite emotion, namely contempt for power, money, and intellectuals. No one dares to publicly say "some British are lazy", and the British may not even have the concept of "the British lazy" in their heads. I couldn't understand the fact that this was obvious in my opinion. Jeremydable (Candidate Candidate) from Langcast provided me with an explanation: "The rich stole the money of the poor." I asked where this view comes from? He said "Marx?"</p>
<p>Therefore, the British social perspectives are different, and even the opposition has the principles and uses -can check and balance each other without taking extremes. It is said that the various social concepts invented since the Revolution of the Enlightenment Revolution and the future are mostly intertwined to form various claims andism. Its degree of richness requires a lot of communication with the British in various positions in the political spectrum. perhaps. In the past, I only looked at the United Kingdom with the common sense and views brought by mainland China.</p>
<p>I first came to the UK and felt that the fairness of this place was stunning. The Conservative Party was quite good!But recently I realized that the existence of the Labor Party and the Liberal Democratic Party is because Britain is not fair enough!Several Liberal Democratic Party members said to me: "Britain is the sixth richest country in the world, and there are still poor people. It really does not say." Without these Zhongzu parties with the Conservative Party, it is estimated that the Conservative Party's conservativeism is. It also stayed in the 19th century, and capitalists continued to exploit the working class.</p>
<p>Therefore, this training is not only studying campaign, but also a good place to continue to study British politics -the British in life do not talk about politics, and even the political tendencies are secret. But all of them are Liberal Democratic Party, and the opening of the mouth is politics, and the like -mindedness makes me very intoxicated._ (Note: This article only represents the author's personal point of view.

<p>Former US senior national security officials held a series of secret conferences with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and other Russian officials. The US State Department said on Thursday (July 6) that the Bayeng government did not oppose the secret meeting of these Ukraine War.</p>
<p>National Broadcasting Corporation NBC News previously reported that former US officials met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York in April, Richardhaass, chairman of the US Foreign Relations Commission, and two former White House officials.</p>
<p>It is reported that it is unclear that the US participants, including the first five -horn building officials, discussed with the core members of the Kremlin. NBC News said at least one unknown American member went to Russia.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the State Council answered Reuters on Thursday that the Bayeng government did not oppose these discussions. He also reiterated that "the relationship between Ukraine, we will not make a decision for Ukraine."</p>
<p>He refers to the US government's policy on the Ukrainian war, that is, the United States will not negotiate with Russia with Russia without the participation of Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the State Department said that the U.S. government will continue to provide weapons to Kiev. In Ukrainian officials, "the timing is mature, and they can stand in a strong position to negotiate."</p>
<p>The NBC news quotes people to understand the situation of the US Russia discussion. The secret discussion between the United States and Russia is to pave the way for Russia and Ukraine's might end the war.</p>
<p>Two of the sources said that these secret discussions were carried out when the government knew the government, but it was not guided by the Biden government. The US representatives would report to the White House after meeting with Lavrov.</p>

<p>Zibo's outdoor barbecue provides people with delicious and low -cost leisure diet.</p>
<p><strong><em>* Zibo, Shandong Province, is experiencing a wave of outdoor barbecue. </em>* </strong></p>
<p>People from all over China come here to taste the famous lamb skewers, which has become a legend in social media.</p>
<p>This is a very noisy experience, and it is definitely not suitable for timid people.</p>
<p>The streets are crowded with people. You sit on a small plastic chair, drink beer, roll the meat pieces with the local onion cakes, and all sides are karaoke.</p>
<p>At first glance, these people seem to show a strong rebound after the emergency state of the crown epidemic -but according to economists, the truth is not the case.</p>
<p>They said that this is more that people have found a cheap and delicious choice under the face of great pressure on household income.</p>

<p>The lamb skewers and karaoke of Zibo barbecue restaurants have attracted people from all over the country.</p>
<p>A shirtless man told us that this was the ideal place for him and his family on the hot summer night, and the cost performance of this gameplay was in line with the current reality.</p>
<p>"This place is very suitable for the people," he said. "It is difficult to make money recently, but it is still easy to spend money. After three years of epidemic, the economy is just recovering slowly."</p>
<p>Chinese university graduates are particularly seriously impacted by economic downturn, and the unemployment rate has been hovering at 20%or more.</p>
<p>Some students are disturbed by their future.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm worried," said a girl who was about to graduate. "The competition is fierce and it is difficult to find a job. All my classmates have the same pressure."</p>
<p>For those who have a job, economic protection is an important reason for their unwillingness to spend more money.</p>
<p>They are worried that they may accidentally fall into the ranks of unemployment, and in many cases, the biggest investment of their family is not as valuable as they originally imagined.</p>
<p>China's real estate industry is under tremendous pressure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66131340/p0fzj6jm/zh-hans">Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/Chinese-News-66131340/P0FZJ6jm/ZH-HansS</a><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T08-18-28.000Z/p0fzj7g6.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>The hot Zibo barbecue and vacant Qingdao real estate reflect the reality of China's economic downturn</p>
<p>In order to understand this in person, we drove from Zibo to east for a few hours and came to a much larger city of Qingdao.</p>
<p>Here, the rapid outbreak of real estate does not match the real needs of buyers or tenants, and as a result, a large number of real estate built is rarely living inside.</p>
<p>A woman sells cold noodles on a mobile booth outside her residential area, and she has very few neighbors.</p>
<p>A few years ago, her husband bought a apartment here after moving to Qingdao. Because I heard that the school here is good, I want to give the child a better starting point.</p>
<p>I asked her if she was worried about her house depreciation.</p>
<p>"Of course worry," she said, "But what can I do?"</p>
<p>A couple next to the street cleaners were stopped for lunch. They pointed at the building behind them and said that no one lived there.</p>
<p>Opposite the road is a small piece of concrete real estate. The outer wall has no painting and no windows. The window frame looks dilapidated because of long exposure.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-07T08-18-28.000Z/_130310369_1478460f-0eb1-4546-bae0-e269595e621a.jpg" />Image source, Joyce LiU/BBC</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The outbreak of real estate in Qingdao exceeds the needs of buyers and tenants.</p>
<p>"The construction project over there suddenly stopped working last year," the man said.</p>
<p>According to his wife, the entire block is quite deserted. "There is nothing here, there is no gas station, and you have to go far away. Living here is very inconvenient," she said.</p>
<p>This place used to have hope to take off. At that time, the city hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping also recognized the investment and business of this place. Here it may also become the place of the International Expo and other activities.</p>
<p>Originally, there would be people who hired houses, startups, or other companies to buy houses here, but the fact is that there are not many companies.</p>
<p>According to a local real estate agent, the property sales in the area have been halved in recent years.</p>
<p>"The price decline is because of the market saturation," she said. "Too many houses have been built, it is difficult to sell."</p>
<p>We put a drone, and the scene overlooking from the air was worse than we saw on the ground.</p>
<p>A new real estate that is completely stopped around can be seen around, and the real estate that has been completed is almost not angry.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The prosperity of China's real estate has made the housing prices in many large cities exceed the ability of ordinary families.</p>
<p>Moreover, supply and demand issues are not unique to this area, or even the city. In China, it is easy to find evidence that real estate bubbles bring in danger.</p>
<p>In this country, one of the reasons for the proliferation of real estate speculation is the lack of other investment options. However, the prosperity of real estate has made the housing prices of many large cities exceed the ability of ordinary families. The government's response to this is to limit the number of personal purchase of houses.</p>
<p>This is a sincere attempt to make equal reforms, but now there is pressure to reverse this direction. In Qingdao, such measures have been relaxed, so as to bring stimulus to the stagnant real estate market.</p>
<p>The challenges faced by Chinese policy makers are to find a way to get economic growth and business confidence from getting rid of the heavy dependence of this real estate sales.He told the BBC in Australia: "China's economy urgently needs to be re -balanced. In the past two or three decades, the Chinese economy has increased huge growth through large -scale infrastructure construction and a substantial growth in the real estate market. The method is not sustainable. "</p>
<p>"Look at the world, developed economies need family as a key driving force for economic growth, and this is not available in China."</p>
<p>From reducing interest rates to cash allowances, the Chinese government is considering promoting individuals and enterprises to increase consumption in various ways.</p>
<p>However, the problem is emotion.</p>
<p>When there are more jobs, people will feel more secure. Enterprises need investment to create more employment opportunities, but when consumers lack security, companies are unwilling to do so.</p>
<p>As Harry Mufi Cruise said: "This is a bit like a chicken and egg. Without corporate expenditure, there will be no economic recovery. They will not spend before they see the recovery. So they become a The deadlock hinders the development of the key part of the economy. "</p>
<p>All these issues may affect global trade.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Qingdao's beach shows that tourism is recovering</p>
<p>China is a big country. The ripples that occur in the world's second largest economy will cause waves.</p>
<p>The production output here has decreased -due to weak international demand -leading to decline in exports and decreased supply in Chinese manufacturing goods globally, the commercial activities of large Asian factories will decrease. After that, China's slowdown consumption means that the import of products of other countries will decrease.</p>
<p>For the Chinese government, the headache may have to make a choice or seek short -term stimulus measures. This will delay the re -balance it needs to face, or to bear more instant pain, so as to start a long -term solution to solve the long -term solution faster plan.</p>
<p>Naturally, there must be almost someone in Beijing's high levels of power. Some people are considering taking some intermediate routes. They first take slightly promoting measures to stabilize the economy, and then consider greater problems on hand.</p>
<p>Because they know that once negative emotions are formed, it may be difficult to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>However, if you want to be optimistic about Qingdao and life itself, you can go to the beach. In the famous coastline here, the tourism industry seems to have recovered.</p>
<p>There is a smile there, a sand castle piled up by tourists. Whether it is an industrial giant or a truck driver, everyone here is enjoying the embrace of the sea.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is in line with reality, here you can hardly feel that although everything is difficult, it will be better in the future.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) On the occasion of the "Hanguang No. 39" active exercise in Taiwan, China may be starting a cognitive battle. According to Taiwan's national security officials, China has continued to spread false information related to Taiwan or US military exercises through official media since May. Some of them have not been confirmed that Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen has formulated a "escape plan".</p>
<p>"They want to depict the exercise of the Hanguang exercise into an escape plan." Reuters quoted Taiwanese Guoan people who did not want to be named on Friday (July 7), saying at least 10 news reports that Cai Yingwen wanted to use the exercise to "escape his life to escape his life. "Relief", or withdraw from overseas Chinese for American citizens. Taiwanese officials believe that the purpose of Beijing's move is to create panic and weaken the public's trust in Taiwan's leadership.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T08-29-00Z/65369258_401.png" />On the Internet platform in China, some unheard claims that Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen has formulated a "escape plan". The picture shows Tsai Ing -wen received a visit to the US Congress in Taipei on April 8.</p>
<h3>Beijing "Da Waixuan" to Taiwan?</h3>
<p>This year's Hanguang exercise in Taiwan is divided into 2 stages, which are the military push in May and the actual soldiers' drills at the end of July.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉光演习前夕-台湾举行天马操演/a-66099632)Essence According to the June report of the Taiwan Central News Agency, the military confirmed that the Hanguang exercise will first perform anti -aircraft downshifts at Taoyuan Airport at the civilian for the first time, and the airport will temporarily ban navigation.</p>
<p>DW reporters searched for the "Hanguang Exercise" through Baidu on the 7th. Most of the search results were negative news. For example, the Chinese official media "Global Times" reported in May to quote expert reviews, and claimed: "Han Guangbing pushes no matter how you push it, it is A game of death. The U.S. military is now "watching chess without words". I am afraid that in the future, I may "see death and not rescue." There are also unspeakable news on Weibo that this exercise is used in Taoyuan Airport, which is pressured by the United States; It is also said that Cai Yingwen's "escape" is more convenient for civil airports.</p>
<p>At the end of May, Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" and other media quoted the report of the military push of China Central University in China, saying that the PLA sank the Ford's nuclear -powered aircraft carrier's strike group with 24 supersonic anti -ship missiles. The Central News Agency reported the analysis of the national security people in Taiwan on Friday and criticized the report as the "Case of Publicity Standard".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T08-29-00Z/65407394_401.png" />In May, there was a media that the PLA could sink the U.S. ships. Taiwanese Guoan believes that this is a typical "Great Passage". The "psychological red line" that was shot down, Beijing launched a fake message offensive. The picture shows the scene of the US Congress push. (Data photo)</p>
<h3>Fake message offensive affects the Taiwan election</h3>
<p>Taiwanese people pointed out that every year on the Hanguang exercise, China will have a fake information offensive on Taiwan, but this year is particularly obvious, which is intended to further affect the Taiwan presidential election in January next year.</p>
<p>According to the summary of the "Report", Taiwan believes that such fake messages are usually manufactured by China's Taiwan -related and united front departments. They are reproduced and spread to Taiwan media and Hong Kong media through online self -media and official media. Reuters pointed out that Beijing's fake information offensive was implemented by government units such as the State Council and was supervised by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the leadership group of Taiwan. The team leader was Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of China.</p>
<p>In response to China's fake information and cognitive operations, the Taiwan MAC responded to Reuters, saying that China has always tried to harm the Taiwan government's prestige, thereby "differentiation of Taiwan society and weakening the support of the international community for Taiwan." Taiwan will immediately clarify false information And "show the determination to defend your own with specific actions." The State Council of China and the United States Association in Taiwan did not respond to the request for comment.</p>
<p>In addition to fake messages, Taiwan also expressed concerns about other "penetration" methods. Exclusive reports from Reuters in June stated that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/路透台湾锁定中共干预明年大选的途径/a-65988337">Taiwan government believes that China will illegate relative candidates through WeChat platforms</a>Or it provides the opportunity to travel to China for free to travel to China in Taiwan, thereby affecting the voting decision.</p>

<p>A series of judgments from the US Supreme Court last week shaking American society. Among them, the judgments such as Harvard and other universities considering racial factors in enrollment violations based on the equal rights bill, which can be said to be a victory of common sense. It has a significant impact on future Asians' life in the United States.</p>
<p>First of all, let's review the history of the equality bill. In the 1960s, the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King changed the appearance of the United States. The Activity Act is an important result of the civil rights movement and one of the derivatives of the Civil Rights Law in 1964. It aims to take care of ethnic minorities in enrollment and employment. According to this bill, public schools in the United States have the responsibility to adopt a quota or extra point in enrollment to allow ethnic minorities to give priority to admission. In order to promote the diversification of American society, the bill has played an important role in creating equal opportunities for ethnic minorities in universities, workplace, and officialdom.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly progressive under the historical conditions at that time.</p>
<p>Activity can be understood as a form of compensation. For the centuries of African -American Americans, they have been deprived of equal protection of law. This is the meaning of Linden Johnson's famous Howard University of Howard. In his speech, he said that it was unfair of. This is the clearest moral case of equal rights -many generations of slavery need to have exceptions to official non -discriminatory principles of non -discrimination within a period of time.</p>
<p>But this simple case is getting more and more difficult over time. It is the most direct interpretation of the Civil Rights Law that everyone's equality conflicts. Because with the benefit of each generation of successors, Johnson's logic became less convincing. In order to solve these difficulties, a different theory has entered: it is not a compensation case related to slavery and racial isolation, but to describe the universal racial diversity as a campus experience of an educational necessity, an open -minded campus experience It is important, so enrollment office can consider doing this.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court judge Sandra Day O'Connor supports this view in the Grutter V. Bollinger case in 2003. She believes that college admission can consider racial factors, but there is a certain period of time. She believes that it may no longer need to be needed after 25 years. Essence</p>
<p>However, as this 25 -year period is getting closer, American universities have no intention to stop considering racial factors. Instead, the diversity of race has now been regarded by the university as an organizational concept, a mantra, and a highest academic academic Vision of interests. In other words, the university campus needs to reflect the racial appearance of the United States. Not just campus, the diverse vision is one of the tenets of employees hired and promoted employees in American companies. Many companies have announced the population statistics of their future employees and leadership. The manufacturing giant 3M announced on its website that "doubles the proportion of our American employees at the grassroots level to the representative group of management." In 2021, United Airlines launched a plan, "By 2030, 5,000 new pilots are trained, at least half of them are women and colored races." McDonald's has paid executive salary with women and minority ethnic groups in senior positions. The proportion is linked.</p>
<p>This sounds like a grand, but think about it. Why do university campuses and American companies look like the population of the United States? Could it be that all walks of life must be divided according to the racial proportion to show the diversity of the United States? Do you need to look like the United States? What about the players of the NBA and football teams, the athletes who show their talents in front of the public also need the diversity of race? All agencies can implement racial quotas on the grounds. This is actually promoting racism in a diverse name.</p>
<p>University enrollment, the number of workers with enterprises is basically fixed, which is a zero -sum game for applicants. The preferential treatment of one person is bound to be the loss of another person. According to the data in the book of Nolonger Separate, Not Yet Equal: RACE and Class in Elite College Admission andCampus Life, published in 2009, to enter a famous American school in the United States, the Asian SAT score must be higher than that of white students than white students. 140 points, 270 points higher than Western students, 450 points higher than black students. In the diverse big, the actual racial quota has made Asians the most de facto victim. The Asian population has grown rapidly in the United States in the past 10 years, but Harvard Asian students have maintained around 20%. And Asian, especially Asian men, are becoming more and more narrow in the living space of American companies.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Democratic Party has been increasingly leaning, and under the extreme atmospheric atmosphere of racial diamonds, the diversified momentum is getting bigger and bigger. DEI (DIVERSITY, EQUITY, Inclusive Diversity, Fairness and Tolerance) is already a huge industry. According to a report from McKinsey, the global DEI market reached $ 7.5 billion in 2020, and it is expected to double in 2026. Not only is the general employment job search, the diversification has spread to key industries. At least 40 medical colleges have canceled the admission test MCAT. MCAT has long been a standard test of American Medical College. It is called the gold standard and is extremely difficult to pass. Perleman Medical College of Pennsylvania at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania, has expanded a minority project for African and Western descent. These applicants can take the MCAT test without taking the MCAT test.</p>
<p>The cancellation of the exam means of course the standard is reduced. At the same time, it becomes more and more difficult to measure whether graduates are ready. The American Medical License Examination has recently abandoned the objective scoring based on diverse reasons and changed to the/failed system. This may make unqualified people a doctor. The above mentioned that United Airlines has decided to decide the future pilot candidates with skin tone.</p>
<p>Applying for universities, job hunting is not capable, and racial skin tone is already against fairness. But unqualified doctors and pilots will endanger the lives and safety of the public, and completely violate common sense.</p>
<p>Such a bill that does not meet the moral logic, does not meet the original intention of the civil rights movement, and does not conform to common sense. A survey released by Pew ResearchCenter last April showed that nearly three or more Americans said that gender, race or ethnicity, or whether relatives had studied at the school should not affect the admission decision of the university. And the policy of supporting the issuance of equal rights appears on the votes. Even if it is a Democratic parties like a Democratic party like California, voters have rejected it.Investigation, the diversification of university and American companies is to choose winners and losers based on skin tone. This is departure from the constitutional principles that are equal and equal. For the benefits of race diversification, more important principles have been sacrificed -everyone is life and equality. Everyone is not because of ethnicity, skin tone, and gender, but because of personal personality ability to judge this simplest civil rights bill The original intention.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Supreme Court once again reiterated the most basic principle that attracted countless people to come to the United States, that is, no matter who you are, no matter what your skin color, no matter where you come from, you can get a fair opportunity. As long as you are enough, you are enough If you work hard, you may be successful here.</p>
<p>For Asians, the battle has just begun. The judgment of the Supreme Court may not be able to ensure the fair opportunities of Asians in studying and job hunting, but now there are law. In the United States, the judgment of the Supreme Court is the highest law of this land. The Constitution only protects individuals from the violations of government behavior, but the lawsuit has applied the equal protection clauses of Chapter 6 of the Constitution to Harvard and other private universities. The bill prohibits "any project or activity receiving federal financial assistance" based on "race, skin color, or nationality". Judge Neil Gorsuch pointed out in the conclusion of this case that Chapter 7 of the 1964 Act applied the same anti -discrimination principle to private enterprises with more than 15 employees. If they discriminate based on "race, skin tone, religion, gender or nationality", they will be liable for compensation.</p>
<p>Asians need to continue to fight for their legitimate rights, just like the chief judge John G -Roberts claimed to be "the way to stop racial discrimination based on racial discrimination is to stop racial discrimination." It is also for the United States to become a more impartial country, and the ideal of "people's life and equality" claimed by the father.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本核废水排海在即-原子能机构再赴福岛审查/a-65763766">UN International Atomic Energy Agency</a>A comprehensive report of safety review released this week states that Japan will be stored in the Water Election of Water Dedication at the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛废水排海iaea评估为安全-中国反对/a-66111067">conforms to the safety standards of atomic energy institutions</a>Essence The agency supports Tokyo Electric Power Corporation to discharge the ocean with a processing nuclear waste water that is equivalent to about 500 Olympic pool capacity. These nuclear waste water is a polluting water used to cool down the tsunami in the 2011 Japanese earthquake that causes tsunami to cool down the nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Although Japan guarantees that the wastewater is safe after filtering and removing most of the isotopes, the emission water plan is still <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛核废水倾倒海洋-渔民说不-中韩反对-美国支持/a-57244397">being opposed by domestic and foreign at home and abroad</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T08-46-00Z/66108983_401.png" />Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will discharge the ocean to about 500 Olympic pool capacity of the nuclear waste water.</p>
<p>The China Customs General Administration announced on Friday (July 7) that "in order to prevent Japanese food in China with radioactive pollution and protect Chinese consumers imported food safety, Chinese Customs prohibits the import of ten counties (cadres), including Fukushima in Japan, Strictly review the attached certification documents, strictly review foods, especially aquatic products (including edible aquatic animals), strengthen supervision, strictly implement 100%inspection, and continue to strengthen the detection and monitoring of radioactive substances to ensure the safety of Japanese food in Japan. Strictly prevent the input of risks. "</p>
<p>The General Administration of Customs of China also said: "The International Atomic Energy Agency has recently reported the opinions of the comprehensive evaluation report released by the Fukushima nuclear pollution water in Japan, which failed to fully reflect the opinions of all experts participating in the evaluation work. Approve. There are still many problems in the Japanese side's legitimacy, the reliability of purification devices, and the perfectness of the monitoring solution. "</p>
<p>Last year, China was the largest buyer in Japan's seafood exports, although China was one of the countries that restricted food imported from some parts of Japan due to the nuclear accident.</p>
<p>China is also the most intense critic of this drainage plan in Japan, saying that this threatens marine life and human health.</p>
<p>China had previously warned that Japan must "bear all the consequences of its actions." The implementation of the plan will begin in the next few weeks, and it will take up to 40 years to discharge.</p>
<p>Three Japanese government officials and a ruling member of the ruling party have said in an anonymous interview with Reuters in recent days that they expect that China will expand its restrictions on Japanese seafood.</p>
<p>"We think they may have a comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood." A official said, "They want to punish Japan economy."</p>
<p>He said: "For China, Japanese seafood imports only account for a small part of its market ... but for Japan, this is a large market."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T08-46-00Z/66109322_401.png" />The comprehensive report of safety review issued by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency this week pointed out that Japan's plans to store the water -rowed sea of water storage in the Fukushima first nuclear power plant meet the safety standards of atomic energy agencies.</p>
<h3>Some Chinese consumers call for resistance to Japanese products</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan stated that Japan had conducted scientific discussions with China on the issue of emissions and will continue.</p>
<p>China has prohibited seafood from 10 counties (including Fukushima Prefecture and Capital Tokyo) from 47 counties in Japan since 2011, and prohibit all food and feed from 9 counties from 9 counties. Do radioactive testing.</p>
<p>Japan's data show that most of the seafood fishing in Japanese fisheries consume in China. Despite the ban, China was still the largest buyer in Japan's seafood last year (calculated by value).</p>
<p>The Chinese market accounts for 22.5%of Japan's seafood exports, worth 87 billion yen (US $ 604 million), followed by Hong Kong (19.5%) and the United States (13.9%). China has purchased more than half of the total exports of Japanese scallops.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government said on Tuesday that when Japan began to implement an emission plan, Hong Kong will "immediately take control measures, including import control to aquatic products from high -risk counties."</p>
<p>China said that after the implementation of emissions plans in Japan, it will strengthen monitoring of marine and seafood.</p>
<p>South Korean consumers snap up sea salt and other products before the implementation of the emission plan. The South Korean government also promised to strengthen monitoring and try to alleviate public concerns, but did not threaten to expand its ban on Japanese products.</p>
<p>In China, some consumers have called for anti -Japanese products on social media. This wave of public opinion briefly cracked down on the stock price of Japanese cosmetics manufacturers.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</p>

<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly rose. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."#</p>

<h3>Place of cooling water</h3>
<p>The damaged Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station scene at the scene of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is the focus of controversy. According to the authorities, these water storage tanks must be removed before rebuilding. These water is mainly used for cooling reactors after the disaster.</p>

<h3>cooling water is safe?</h3>
<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now.

<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns.

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can."

He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p>_ <strong> In order to protect the identity, the name of the star number is a pseudonym. </strong> _</p>
<p>Police's incidents of killing a 17 -year -old teenager in Paris were photographed and reprinted crazy on social media. One week later, people's anger was still obvious.</p>
<p>Northern African -American Youth Victim Nahel M.(Nahel)After being shot, riots broke out in various French cities, causing about 4,000 people to be arrested, and the anger scenes of protests swept the world.</p>
<p>Police have been conflicting with the angry riots, most of which are young people from low -income suburbs in France, such as Nahr M, damaged and destroyed cars, city halls, public transportation and stores. The person hit a burning car into the home of the mayor of Paris.</p>
<p>For some people, protests are like "Cri Decoeur", a crying from the heart, but others in France condemned the riots, saying that the riots used Nayer M's death as a violence. Excuses, because they denied systemic atrocities and racism internal attempts and racism.</p>
<p>Peninsula TV interviewed several people in the suburbs, where the relationship between police and teenagers is often tense:</p>
<h4>"I have been called dirty Arabs since I was a child": Tarik*, 52 years old, a water pipe worker, from Nantel, a father of five children</h4>
<p>"I have been called dirty Arabs every week from childhood. If you have no good parents to express their concern, what do you think you will look like? I am lucky, there is a family full of love."</p>
<p>"The problem is on the police, not a child. They are constantly provoking them. Even if (the children) are only doing exercise on the street, I will see the police come over to insult them. Now it is no longer in the 1930s. !I feel hate. "</p>
<p>"Violence is the only way of expression, the only way to attract people's attention."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T08-57-02/1-1688719359.png" />The French riot police stood in the conflict between Lyon, southeast of France.

<h4>"Thank God for providing these videos. How many Nahel has not been photographed?": Sarah*, 22 years old, Nantaier resident</h4>
<p>"This is strange, because the video seems to show that Nachr was shot cold -blooded. At the same time, the media continued to say that the police were defending self -defense, which didn't make any sense at all."</p>
<p>"How many Naher has not been photographed? Only by the police judgment can the masses be soothed."</p>
<h4>"I heard that he is a good person": Ines*, 18 years old</h4>
<p>"Everyone is talking about this. I personally don't know Nahr, but then I heard that he is a good person. This is a word circulating on the street. Driving at eight o'clock will not make you look good, but should you die for this? "</p>
<p>"(This is) obvious police mistakes."</p>
<p>"All of this is to be listened, not just one time, but every day, otherwise, violence is the only choice."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T08-57-02/1-1688719404.png" />The place of Nach was placed with flowers, which said "I wish Nahr's breath". May the earth be bright to you '(Reuters)</p>
<h4>"Nahr's story was hijacked": George Gamoteti, 48 years old, Clehis Suba Communication Consultant</h4>
<p>"There was no Internet at that time," Gam Taetti talked about the large -scale riots that swept France after the death of Clehis Suba and Arab youth in 2005. He also said, " In the broadcast, Sarkoi eventually called these young people, instead of supporting this family and local communities ... The media did not have room for any other version ... the public thinks that we are all criminal media. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T08-57-02/1-1688719446.png" />(George Gamoteti)</p>
<p>"Nach's story was hijacked by group leaders. They encouraged violence, instead of using this opportunity to finally improve the law."</p>
<p>Gam Taetti said that after the Clehich Uprising, the money "poured in", but eventually fell into the hands of the wrong person. "In your hands".</p>
<p>"We don't need more sports community groups. Why don't our children learn to become pilots or engineers, but learn to become security and Uber drivers? Why don't we have a big dream?"</p>
<h4>"There are other methods": Rand, 20 years old, accounting students</h4>
<p>"Things started with the tragic death of a child, and later evolved into robbery and shop robbery. This is not a good solution, and there are other choices. They (thugs) are hurting themselves. They are hurting innocent citizens. Let people hear your voice.</p>
<p>"We can't put all the police in the same bag."</p>
<h4>"Police insult me": Mike*, 16 years old</h4>
<p>"(Police) behavior is incompetent, they insult me, harass me, and say‘ talk well ’,“ shut up, you clowns ”to me.</p>
<p>"The way most French treats us is the reason why we are now. Some police should not do this job. They abuse young people, especially young people from the suburbs."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T08-57-02/1-1688719497.jpg" />The grandmother who was killed for teenagers called for ending French riots</p>
<h4>"These are all executions": Muhammad Camara, the brother of the police shot victims</h4>
<p>In January 2018, Camara's brother Gai Kamala(Gone rooms)He was hit by the police.</p>
<p>"(Nahr's death) video indicates that these are not wrong. These are execution."</p>
<p>"When the news of (Gai) died, the neighbors wanted a revolution. Gay never caused any trouble. He was loved and respected. My father said that we should not (the riots) defile his reputation. We should commemorate him. "</p>
<p>"I can't force people to violate the law. I told local residents,‘ If you want to fight for Gay ’s death, let us organize and find a solution for our young people’. ”</p>
<p>"We will not righteousness for Gaya in France. We have exhausted all the appeals, but they rejected everything and they refused to share the surveillance video .... The police will never be condemned."</p>
<p>"For 40 years, we have been asking the police to take responsibility."#### "I agree to burn the police station": Logan, 20 years old, mechanic</p>
<p>"I don't want to have any problems. I come here to work and live a good life. Deep in my heart, if you really want to know the truth, I don't agree with people to burn the house.

<p>Reuters reports that the online meeting led by the United States restricted synthetic drug flow was held on Friday (July 7), and at least 84 countries will participate. Toddrobinson, assistant Secretary of State of the United States State Department, said that China said on the eve of the meeting that China needs to do more to cut off the supply chain of illegal synthetic drugs.</p>
<p>Robinson added: "We are not accusing anyone or pressure. Some of the reasons we try to form the alliance are to let other countries jointly fight this supply chain. One of the responsibilities of these countries is to contact the People's Republic of China. ","</p>
<p>It is unclear whether China will attend Friday meetings.</p>
<p>Robinson revealed to the media on Thursday (6th) that the United States had issued an invitation to China, and there were no signs that they would attend. Although Beijing has not recently contacted US officials on this issue, Robinson emphasized that Washington is still actively seeking Chinese help.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brills will host the first virtual conference that restricts synthetic drug flow on Friday. This meeting aims to establish a "global alliance" to combat synthetic drugs. This is the efforts of the Biden government to curb the high -addictive Fentanyl policy. This strong analgesic drugs have promoted the crisis of abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to the request of the conference's comment. China is the main producer of chemicals required for Fantne, and the activities of smuggling fentanyl in the US -Mexico border are rampant.</p>

<p>Insiders revealed that US President Biden has agreed to provide a bundle bomb to Ukraine, and will be announced as soon as Friday (July 7) as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This is a key requirement for Ukrainian President Zelezki, but people of military control organizations and human rights activities are worried that this may harm civilians.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the three US officials who do not want to be named said that the US government is expected to announce the new military assistance plan for Ukraine as soon as possible on Friday, including a bundle bomb fired with a 155mm howitzer gun. An official said that the US government carefully considered at least one week to make this decision.</p>
<p>The White House previously said that it is actively considering transporting a bundle bomb to Ukraine, but has not yet issued any announcements. U.S. President Bynden will go to Lithuania to participate in the NATO Summit next week. It is expected that the summit will mainly discuss the Ukrainian war.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, two people familiar with the matter said that the Biden government expected to provide Ukraine with a modified conventional ammunition for military and civilians.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to the request of the comment.</p>
<p>Human Rights Observation Organization called for Russia and Ukraine to stop using cluster bombs and urge the United States to not provide such ammunition. Human Rights Observation Organization stated that the Russian and Ukraine Army used a bundle bomb, causing Ukrainian civilians to die.</p>
<p>More than 120 countries around the world have signed an international treaty for banning bombs. Capital bombs usually spread a large number of small sub -bombs in large areas, threatening civilian security. The uncomfortable bundle bomb still constitutes a danger within many years after the conflict is over.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Since Russia launched the war against Ukraine in February 2022, Germany provided weapons, ammunition, equipment and training in Ukrainian soldiers in Germany, which was thus stabbed densely by the Russian intelligence department. The German Military Anti -Love News Agency (MAD) reported that Russia reached a new scale in Germany's intelligence activities.</p>
<p>The report states that the number of intelligence personnel sent by Russia shows the value of German military intelligence. In April 2022, after the outbreak of the Russian war against Ukraine, the German federal government announced that 40 Russian diplomats were "unpopular people." These diplomats were expelled from Germany and caused a blow to Russia's previous efficient spy activity in Germany. However, it can be determined that the Russian intelligence department will take other means to continue to obtain information.</p>
<p>According to the report, Russia's intention and ability to exploration of NATO key infrastructure and the intention and ability to destruct in some cases is a threat that must be treated seriously.</p>
<p>In addition, from 2021 to 2022, Russia also took a variety of measures to try to impact public opinions. This includes not only in Germany, but also the countries where the Federal Defense Force is stationed, such as the Baltic countries.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-07T10-27-00Z/66119575_401.png" />The Federal Defense Force provides training for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. This is the badge of a training Ukrainian soldier</p>
<p><strong>China</strong></p>
<p>For China, the report wrote: "China continues to hope to become a world power before 2049. And this idea is realized by the" Made in China 2025 'and the "New Silk Road Movement". "The report stated that it was to achieve this goal. The means also include online spies and traditional <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国内政部长要求加强防范来自中国的间谍活动/a-65840153">espionage</a>Wait for many ways.</p>
<p>The report states that for <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国三大情报机构警告不要对专制中国太天真/a-63472850">China</a>In terms of intelligence department, the common activities of the German Federal Defense Force under the framework of military cooperation are of special significance. These military cooperation includes: military training assistance, joint drill plan, and delegation visit. The report said that these military training aids lasted for several months, while Chinese participants used the contact authority of the Federal Defense Force and personnel to collect information intensively. In addition, another piercing focus on Chinese intelligence departments in Germany is in the field of academic research and research and development.</p>
<p>The report states that not only the formal staff of the embassy and consulate engaged in intelligence, but also the traditional spy staff who have been recruited or hidden.</p>
<p>The main tasks of the German Military Anti -Love News Agency include the protection of the Federal Defense Forces from [Spy activity] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/情报机构瑞士成为中俄间谍活动的中心/a-66035871">espionage</a>Damage and inspection of extremist personnel within the Federal Defense Force and a safety review of soldiers and civilian staff. The German Ministry of Defense has previously announced the number of cases of suspected extremism, which has declined significantly. The Military Anti-Love News Agency set seven people as right-wing extremists from 2021-2022.</p>
<p>The number of workers in the military anti -intelligence bureau increased. From January 2023, there were 1917 positions (1824 in 2022 and 1632 in 20121). The report believes that the agency has previously merged anti -spy and anti -polar endism into a department. The effect is not good and needs to be restarted. In view of Russia's war against Ukrainian aggression, "strengthening the combat spy activities and preventing possible damage to the unprecedented urgency".</p>

Grandfather was very proud of the invention, so he established a company to sell it. At that time, there was no income forecast, and there was no five -year growth strategy. The plan was to survive: "Establishing a company is just to seize the opportunity," Hoisgen said.</p>
<p>After 70 years and the three generations, this one is called "Harvey Hydraulic"(HAWE Hydraulik)Family companies sell nearly 2,500 parts to the world. However, Hoygen must no longer consider to compete for sales, but a geopolitics that is increasingly differentiated in the world.</p>
<p>"One -third of my business, if not more, depends on how Biden and Xi Jinping get along," he said. "Sometimes I hope I am running a restaurant, so I don't have to care about global politics."</p>
<p>Because Harvi ’s largest buyers are in China and North America, Hoisgen must not care about geopolitics. As the tension between the Chinese government and Western countries intensify, Harvi's management is trying to prevent the company from relying too much on the huge Chinese market.</p>
<p>Germany has long been the key to trade with Europe and Europe, but now it is increasingly dilemma in foreign disputes in the world's two major economies. When China strives to Germany, and when Treasury Minister Jennite Yellen arrived in Beijing on Thursday, it was for a common foundation of the economy, but the United States was persuading Germany to stay away from Beijing.</p>
<p>How Harvi and other German Chinese -style companies should effectively should be vital to these new global forces for future prosperity of Germany. Although Germany has become the largest brand of the country in the country in the 20th century, such as Volkswagen, Mercedes and Siemens -but SMEs are the economic pillar of Germany.</p>
<p>With the stagnation of the social and economic order in Germany in the process of modernization, and even under the heavy pressure of the rupture of global political relations, small and medium -sized enterprises, known as the "Mittelstand" (middle level) in German Essence</p>
<p>Some executives (such as Hoygen) are accepting changes and exploring new strategies and new markets. However, other companies have been cautious about giving up their existing models. For decades, this model has been booming in Germany, but it is difficult to change.</p>
<p>This contradiction can even feel in Harvey's factory workshop.</p>
<p>"I just can't see what alternatives are there in China?" Said the workshop manager Holg Rebe.</p>
<p>How to deal with international affairs is not just a matter of concern to 2700 employees. The economy of some towns in Germany will also be affected.</p>
<p>Kufberon is a colorful Bavarian town located under the Alps. Harvey is its largest employer. It provides 250 jobs for the village of Sarson Cam, 100 kilometers west of the town. The second is the second. The big employer is a local beer factory with 17 employees.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-07T10-29-08-08-00/06germany-mittelstand-04-qpzf-master1050.jpg" />"Sometimes I really want me to run a restaurant, without having to care about global politics," said Karl Hoisgen, the operator of the Harvey Hydraulic Company in Germany. Ingmar notting for the newyork times</p>
<p>"It seems that we have succeeded for too long," said the mayor of Kafv Boyaren Stefan Bos. He wanted to attract other companies to diversify the employer relying on the town. "Now, we are gradually seeing:" Uh -this is not taken for granted. This may also be threatened. "</p>
<p>A typical small and medium -sized enterprise headquarters is located in a small rural town in Germany. Few people have heard of equipment, but it is vital to global goods -such as screws required for each plane or passenger car.</p>
<p><a href="https://english.bdi.eu/topics/germany/german-mittelstand#/article/news/the-heart-of-the-german-economy">According to some studies</a>These companies provide most of the economic output in Germany. They hired 60%of German workers, accounting for 99%of the German private sector -this proportion is higher than any industrialized country in the world.</p>
<p>"The business model of Germany, especially the business model of small and medium -sized enterprises, is very good at doing one thing: slowly improve a product," said the German SME Association spokesman Mattias Biaqi. "Because this model has been running for many years, small and medium -sized enterprises have no need to adapt to change. But now, they need to adapt to new economic reality."</p>
<p>Even in recent decades, the technological revolution and climate change have put pressure on the society, the German model is still making it difficult.</p>
<p>But this model depends on the pillar -cheap Russian natural gas and the Chinese market -is disappearing.</p>
<p>The invasion of Ukraine in Russia forced Germany to gradually reduce its dependence on the natural gas that provided cheap power for the country's industry. China's self -reliant efforts mean that a market that once seems to provide endless growth is no longer so guaranteed, but also becomes competitors.</p>
<p>The national and economic transformation of the country promised by the German Prime Minister Olav Tusolz has become the source of national anxiety.</p>

<p>Like the German population, German business owners and entrepreneurs are also aging: the average age of members of the Small and Medium Enterprise Association is 55 years old.</p>
<p>Some people refuse to adapt to new technologies and still insist on loyalty -based systems. This system allows employees to work in the enterprise for a lifetime and also provide a permanent customer for enterprises. (The first customer of Harvi in 1949 was a forklift manufacturer who was still buying Harvey's products.)</p>
<p>In terms of changing the outdated approach, such as a maze -like bureaucratic bureaucratic institution, it also performs poorly. The government promised in 2017 that by 2022, 575 most commonly used services (such as company registration) realized digitization. Bi Anqi said that the deadline has passed for a year, and only 22%of these services can be used online.</p>

<p>Even for companies like Harvey, the speed of geopolitical changes is stunned.</p>
<p>On the day when Putin's army invaded Ukraine, Harvey decided to stop business in Russia. It is easy to make this decision because Russia is not a major market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hoyrsk said that the move was still a shock: "This is something that has never happened before: due to a political incident, we closed a factory."</p>
<p>The anxiety caused by this incident is still lingering in the workshop of the Harvey Factory.</p>
<p>Marita Lisner, who is checking parts, said her heating costs have soared from 120 euros per month (about 950 yuan) to 740 euros (about 5,800 yuan). As the country fell into a economic recession, she and her neighbors began to grow vegetables by themselves to relieve the pain of inflation.</p>
<p>"I used to have a positive view of things," she said. "But I feel a bit difficult these days. Many things seem to have problems."</p>

<p>Holgen said that if geopolitical events disrupt the company's business in China, the consequences may be to force Harvey to work out of more than half of Kaffberon's job. He said Harvi currently has 20%of its business comes from China.</p>
<p>In recent years, some commercial groups have warned Germany's huge risks related to China, and before the government of Merkel, the former Prime Minister Merkel, who encouraged Germany and China, was conscientious.</p>

<p>Today, some policy makers are concerned about privately that geopolitical events will bring unavoidable disasters to the German economy, such as China attacking Taiwan. The German government is currently promoting "risks" to find ways to replace Chinese trade.</p>
<p>The government intends to release a new strategic document this month to outline how the relationship between Germany and China will progress. It is expected that the government will consider the pressure on the United States in Germany in the United States -it wants Germany to alienate China.</p>
<p>However, major brands such as Volkswagen and BASF insisted that China is the second largest economy in the world and the Chinese market is very important and cannot give up. These German multinational companies have increased by 20%of foreign direct investment in China this year.</p>
<p>German officials said their strategy is to maintain relations with China, but it will balance their influence by strengthening the relationship with other countries such as India or Vietnam.</p>
<p>Small and medium -sized enterprises are also doing the same thing: Harvey is investing strongly in India, plans to build a new factory there, and some companies turn their attention to North America.</p>

<p>Macus Schuster, director of the Harvey's department in Harvi, said diversification has brought new challenges.</p>
<p>"In the past, most of our sales came from three customers from China," he said. "Now we have a lot of small customers who are distributed around the world."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Harvey needs to produce different types of parts for various customers as soon as possible, instead of producing several parts as much as possible.</p>
<p>He said that this means to find a way to reduce costs and develop automated systems that can flexibly produce. He pointed out a group of robots that are undergoing complex operations to reporters that these robots drilled and polished metal components.</p>
<p>Hoygen believes that trade with China will still be a pillar of the German economy. He will continue to go to China to negotiate with other SME leaders to resolve business differences and repair relationships.</p>
<p>The new socio -economic model of Germany may not establish a pillar, but to manage a more complicated international balance.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the ability to endure and manage uncertainty and process complexity has become a core advantage," Hosgen said. "My grandfather's approach can't work today."</p>

<p>After meeting with President Ukraine, Fiara said that he would provide more support for Ukraine, including more military helicopters to help Kentel to supplement the invasive Russian army.</p>
<p>In addition, Fiara said that EU countries are looking for a method of using frozen Russian assets to pay Ukraine reconstruction costs. He also acknowledged that from a legal perspective, doing so is not a simple matter. Zeelianzki said that Kiev needed remote weapons to defend Russia's invasion.</p>

<p>He added that officials of international atomic energy agencies have not been authorized to visit the roof of the facility. He pointed out: "This is a theater, an active theater, so sometimes it may take one or two days to get authorized."

<h3>EU countries have long -term provided weapons to provide weapons to reach an agreement</h3>
<p>Representatives of EU countries have reached an agreement on increasing long -term ammunition and missile supply in Ukraine.</p>
<h3>What are the air defense weapons and equipment for Ukraine? Are they effective?</h3>
<p>In May, the European Commission proposed a plan to provide financial incentive measures for the defense industry to improve production capacity. The plan will receive 500 million euros ($ 544 million) funds from the European Union's joint budget.</p>
<p>The current EU's rotating chairman of Spain, Margarita Robles, said: "This once again proves that the European Union has unswervingly support Ukraine."</p>

<p>The reduction of "dumb bomb rate" means that the unwanted bombs that have caused civilians to die by accidents will be greatly reduced. The bundle bomb is a form of small bombs into a general gap between bombs and shells. The characteristics of the quantity increase the area and the killing range. Each small bomb is also known as the child bomb.</p>
<p>According to the International Red Cross, they can be launched through aircraft, artillery and missiles. In addition to the initial damage caused by ammunition during impact, the explosion failure rate of the child bomb is also very high, as high as 40%of the recent conflicts.</p>
<p>This is why the bundle bomb is controversial. People who oppose the use of cluster bombs believe that this weapon causes "huge damage" to civilians, and "can still hurt civilians for decades after the conflict."</p>

<p>China "Guangming Daily" reported on Thursday that Chinese experts and researcher Liu Linlin, a Chinese expert who participated in the IAEA evaluation technology working group and the Chinese Institute of Atomic Energy Sciences, said that it was regrettable that IAEA did not fully negotiate with the technical working group experts.</p>
<p>Liu Linlin said: "This report was released in the name of the Director -General of IAEA. Although the IAEA Secretariat had the opinions of the technical working group experts on the draft of the IAEA Secretariat, the time window left to the experts was very limited, and the opinions of the experts were very limited. For reference only, whether the adoption is determined by the IAEA Secretariat. After receiving the feedback, the UAEA Secretariat did not again issue the report with the experts of all parties on the reporting modification and admission of the opinion, and issued the report. "</p>
<p>He said that the evaluation of IAEA belongs to the nature of international peer evaluation, mainly based on the data and data provided by the Japanese side to evaluate and put forward opinions. He emphasized that "To ensure the independence of IAEA on -site supervision and sampling monitoring, it should not be judged based on the data and information provided by the Japanese side, but the IAEA's own laboratory and independent third -party laboratory should be performed independently and monitoring "" ".</p>
<p>In 2021, the International Atomic Energy Agency established a special working group to conduct a comprehensive safety review of the advanced liquid processing system (ALPS) processing system (ALPS) of the Fukushima first nuclear power plant in Japan. 11 members of the working group come from Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, China, Marshall Islands, South Korea, Russia, Britain, the United States and Vietnam.</p>
<p>After the IAEA's evaluation report was released, the Director -General of IAEA Gross said at a press conference that the report was not made in the form of consistent negotiations. The experts in the special working group "may have their personal views."</p>
<p>When asked if the experts expressed satisfaction with the content of the report, Gronci said, "Absolutely, yes. If anyone is not satisfied, they should say it."</p>

<p>China holds a resolutely opposed position on the Fukushima nuclear treatment of the Fukushima nuclear treatment water. After the IAEA's evaluation report was released, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for several days to publish a harsh protest comment on the incident.</p>
<p>Director of IAEA, Grassis, said that IAEA's assessment report is not the same as supporting the plan, and Tokyo must make a final decision.</p>
<p>He also said: "We don't agree with the plan nor do we recommend this. We just say that this plan meets the standard."</p>
<p>He added: "We don't choose to stand. I don't stand in Japan, don't stand on the side of China, and don't stand on the side of South Korea. These standards are consistent with all countries."</p>

<p>Japan's data show that most of the seafood fishing in Japanese fisheries consume in China. Despite the ban, China was still the largest buyer in Japan's seafood last year (calculated by value).</p>
<p>The Chinese market accounts for 22.5%of Japan's seafood exports, worth 87 billion yen (US $ 604 million), followed by Hong Kong (19.5%) and the United States (13.9%). China has purchased more than half of the total exports of Japanese scallops.</p>
<p>On the 7th, the South Korean government released a research report on the safety of Nuclear pollution water in Fukushima in Japan, stating that if the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation in Japan complies with the disposal regulations, the radioactive material concentration will meet the emission standards and target values, which also meets international standards.</p>
<p>However, South Korea has not canceled the import ban on Fukushima aquatic products. According to the Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean government said that the international atomic agency determined that the Japanese nuclear sewage discharge plan meets the standard and the South Korean government prohibits the import of Fukushima aquatic products. The Changquan of the Korean Food and Medical Products Safety Division pointed out that Japan has not been able to submit high -concentration pollution water flowing into the sea in the Fukushima nuclear leakage accident and data contained in its nuclear. Because it cannot judge its impact, import controls are not judged. The measures will be maintained.</p>
<p>South Korea has banned all the aquatic products produced in eight counties such as Fukushima in Fukushima from September 2013.</p>

<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century.

<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.#</p>
<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly rose. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."</p>

<h3>cooling water is safe?</h3>
<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<p>The radiation test standards cited by the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation and the Tokyo government are stricter than other countries that are also discharged.

<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns.

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can." He said in an interview with Reuters and asked, "Why do you put water to the waters of Fukushima, why not put water to Tokyo or Osaka?" He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p>According to Reuters recently quoted people familiar with the matter, the Ant Group has been promoting the group's reform after the failure of the first public sales (IPO) at the end of 2020. Judging from the amount of fines, this is one of the highest funds in the history of Chinese Internet companies.

<p>The Chinese regulatory authorities urgently suspended the listing of Ant Group in 2020, which is considered the beginning of the official rectification of the Internet technology industry. The market value of the Chinese Internet giants has evaporated by more than one trillion US dollars.</p>

A few days ago, after reviewing this controversial proposal, the UN atomic agency claimed that the plan was safe of.</p>
<p>South Korea claims that based on the inspection of the nuclear power plant in late May, its own data, and the review of the international atomic energy agency (UN nuclear supervision agency), South Korea's own assessment believes that if more than 1.3 million tons of radioactive pollution water discharge to more than 1.3 million tons of radioactive pollution water to it to In the Pacific Ocean, in the absence of the details of the proposal, then this will be safe.</p>
<p>Bang Moon-Kyu, the Minister of Coordination of the South Korean Government Policy Coordination Office, said in a briefing released on the 7th, "We have confirmed that the concentration of radioactive substances meets marine emission standards ... Therefore, the plan meets international standards including international atomic energy institutions."</p>
<p>Most of these polluting water are used for cooling reactors, and then stored in huge water tanks around the scene after processing. The proposal to emit these polluting water not only arouses concerns from neighboring Japanese countries, but also caused many treatment Pacific island nations with water problems left by nuclear weapon tests.</p>
<p>Most of people's concerns are concentrated on the potential risks of radioactive homicide, because it is difficult to remove 氚 from the water.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T11-25-52/image-1688723594.jpg" />Japan drain the polluting water after the Fukushima nuclear power plant is treated into the sea(news agency)In the two -year safety review, the international atomic energy agency stated that Japan would dilute these water before discharge, making its pollutant content lower than the regulatory standards, and added that the experts of the agency will be stationed in Fukushima to any of the other. The emission work is monitored, and this process is expected to take decades.</p>
<p>Raphael Gronci, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Tuesday that the plan "meets relevant international security standards ... and under control, gradually discharge the pollutant water after treatment into the ocean. The radioactivity effect on humans and the environment can be ignored. "</p>
<h4>"There is no scientific pilot"</h4>
<p>Japanese media said that after being approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the emission work may begin next month.</p>
<p>But China is one of the most intense critics in the plan. In response to a report from the International atomic Energy Agency, China said that the plan "failed to fully reflect the views of experts participating in the review." On the 6th, the Global Times quoted Liu Linlin, a Chinese expert in the technical working group of the institution, reported that they were disappointed with the report of this "hasty" report, and the opinions of experts were restricted.</p>
<p>Groos denied these claims on the 7th.</p>
<p>When he returned to Tokyo after visiting Fukushima, he told Reuters reporters, "The content we published is scientifically unspeakable."</p>
<p>He also emphasized that the review of international atomic energy agencies is not a support, but only believes that it "meets the standards."</p>
<p>The Chinese Customs Department announced on the 7th that for safety reasons, it will prohibit imported food from 10 counties (cadres) including Fukushima, Japan, and said that it will strengthen the detection and monitoring of radioactive substances.</p>
<p>South Korea has also maintained a ban on seafood products around Fukushima.</p>
<p>Such bans have exacerbated concerns about Japan, and fishery communities are particularly worried about the impact on their livelihood.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T11-25-52/2023-07-06T064117Z_1431145946_RC2HX1AH7KRL_RTRMADP_3_JAPAN-FUKUSHIMA-IAEA-SOUTHKOREA-SEAFOOD-1688701746-1688723640.jpg" />Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, South Korea has regularly conducted radiation inspections on imported seafood(Reuters)Grace, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, plans to speak to the media before going to South Korea, New Zealand and the Cook Islands on the 7th.</p>
<p>The tsunami in March 2011 destroyed the power and cooling system of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, which triggered the most serious nuclear disaster in the world since the Clast Nobel Nuclear accident.</p>
<p>Most polluting water comes from the process of cooling the three damaged reactors. By extensively pumping and filtering systems called an advanced liquid treatment system (ALPS), a large number of new polluting water is extracted every day and most of them are filtered out of them.</p>
<p>At present, the water tank of the polluted water that is treated with treatment has been crowded with most of the space at the place, and Japan said that it is necessary to start emitting these water because there is no enough space to continue to store these water.</p>

<p>Senior Commissioner's Office of Human Rights in the United Nations stated that as Myanmar fell into a more serious violence, Myanmar's military ruler is preventing humanitarian aid to save lives to reach the person in need.</p>
<p>Walker Turk said in a speech at the Geneva Human Rights Council that the Myanmar military -the "systematically rejected" in the February 2012 coup to provide humanitarian assistance to millions of civilians who need help. Essence</p>
<p>A series of laws, financial and bureaucratic obstacles have been established to prevent people from accepting or even assisting in.</p>
<p>The UN senior commissioner Turk said: "This obstacle to life assistance is deliberate and targeted, and is a planned deprivation of a large number of basic rights and freedom of population."</p>
<p>"This is performed by one -third of the population of the population -including obtaining sufficient housing, enough food and water, or employment opportunities."</p>
<p>When the generals seized power from the elected Aung San Suuchi government, Myanmar fell into a crisis, which caused a large -scale protest. After the military responded with brutal force, the protests evolved into an armed rebellion.</p>
<p>Although the military later reached a five -point peace plan with other member states of the Southeast Asian National Alliance (ASEAN), which aims to end violence and release political prisoners, the situation has further deteriorated. The Association said that nearly 3,800 people have been killed by the military since the coup.</p>
<p>Turk said that in the first six months of this year, his office found that compared with the same period in 2022, the air strikes of soap have increased by 33%. Increasing.</p>

<p>Turk said that the shelling incident has also increased sharply. More than 563 attacks have occurred so far this year, accounting for 80%of the annual attacks in 2022. The United Nations has also recorded multiple occurrence of sexual violence, large -scale slaughter, and external execution of the law. , Beheading, disintegration and damage.</p>
<p>Turk told the Security Council, "This country continues to fall into a deadly free fall, falling into a deeper violence and a heartbreaking situation," he accused the military of "completely contempt for humans."</p>
<p>The continuously upgraded violence, including deliberately incinerating civilian villages, forced 1.5 million people to leave their homes. The situation of unsafeness means that 15.2 million people need emergency food support.</p>
<h4>Humanitarian workers are killed</h4>
<p>In May of this year, the tropical cyclone "Mocha" swept the Ruo Kaibang in the west and destroyed the Camp of the displaced. Many of the remaining Rohingya people in Myanmar had lived in racial violence and continuous military suppression before the coup.</p>
<p>Turk said that since the occurrence of the storm, the failure to enter the area means that the total number of deaths is mainly Muslim Rohingya. The military claims that this number is 116, but it has not been confirmed. unknown.</p>
<p>Turk added: "Unless it is provided by a military agency, all the expenditures related to humanitarian aid related to Mocha whirlwind are still frozen."</p>
<p>Humanitarian aid mission was also attacked. In May, a task involving ASEAN diplomat was attacked in the northeast of Laun State, and the team was escorted by the army.</p>
<p>Turk also pointed out that since the coup, as many as 40 human Taoist workers have been killed and more than 200 people have been arrested.</p>

<p>With the continuous upgrading of violence, the UN senior commissioner urged the United Nations Security Council to transfer the coup leader to the International Criminal Court (ICC).</p>
<p>Turk said, "The road to get rid of this crisis must be built on the basis of serious violations of human rights and other violations of international law behaviors," he also added. "Any political solution to this protracted emergency situation for this protracted emergency situation The plan must include the accountability system. "</p>
<p>Although the Security Council has so far resisted such appeals, in January of this year, the survivors of military atrocities during the period of the coup and 2017 suppressed the Rohingya during the period of 2017, and a criminal appeal to the German Federal Prosecutor's Office. Germany has a universal jurisdiction law. Allows to prosecute certain serious criminal acts, where these criminal acts occur.</p>

Recently, some netizens have virtually virtually faced a comprehensive university for the four provinces, but caused excitement on the Internet.

Sun Fugui, who has been a graduate student in a university in the province, has a fierce competition in the educational resources of Shandong and nearby provinces.</p>
<p>Sun Fugui: "Several provinces have a lot of population, and enrollment is definitely low in terms of percentage. An ordinary child in Beijing may enter 211 (key universities), and an ordinary child in a ordinary child in Henan, Shandong may enter an ordinary undergraduate."</p>
<p>Sun Fugui believes that compared with provinces such as Shandong, students in first -tier cities such as Beijing have won the starting line.</p>
<p>Sun Fugui: "Like Beijing and Shanghai, there are strong teachers and complete supporting facilities. In other places, whether it is high school or junior high school. The gap between supporting, teachers and various hardware is huge. Basic education and junior education before the college entrance examination and junior education . We need more resources equal.

The school site is selected at the junction of the four provinces. Netizens also played creativity to design the official website of "Shanhe University", enrollment, and school motto, etc., claiming that they would surpass famous universities such as Tsinghua and Peking University within one year.</p>
<p><strong> Virtual University was blocked by the entire network </strong></p>
<p>Relevant suggestions have caused warm discussions on the Internet. After that, netizens found that the topic of "Weibo" and "Zhihu" involved in "Shanhe University" was blocked, and the group established by netizens was also forced to dissolve. At the same time, Wu Yan, deputy minister of the Ministry of Education of China, responded at a press conference on July 6 that the issue of paying attention to the "Shanhe University" will continue to optimize the layout structure of higher education resources, and also support the expansion of higher education resources in the central and western regions to expand higher education resources in the central and western regions. scale.</p>
<p>Independent scholar Wu Yanlai believes that the uneven distribution of educational resources in various provinces and cities in China has historical factors, but it is mainly caused by the system. Netizens' suggestions are from goodwill.</p>
<p>Wu Yanlai: "The gap between urban and rural areas is very large, children in rural areas are getting less and less, and regional development is also unbalanced. The capital (Beijing) and large cities in Shanghai have obtained more educational resources. The base is particularly large, so the competition is more intense, and there must be fewer opportunities to go to college. Students put these things. In fact, it is very meaningful. "</p>
<p>Wu Yan said that the authorities should have listened to the suggestions of their classmates and made corresponding commitments and reforms, but now they do it.</p>

At that time, the media propaganda was described like this: the unimaginable level of the big harmony, food and food piled up like hills, pigs are bigger than cows.</p>

<p>Du Yaoming: "The survey of the Key Association is particularly noteworthy. There is a large difference in the public and journalists in terms of the sense of freedom of the press. It shows that the general public no longer cares about social and current affairs and even watched the news. I believe that some interviewees are from the system media. The score is still so amazing, and it can reflect how bad the real situation is. Hong Kong's freedom of pressing in Hong Kong has sinking. "</p>

<p>A new study shows that nearly half of the US water sample contains harmful "permanent chemicals".</p>
<p>These permanent chemicals (Forever Chemicals) are used for hundreds of household products such as cleaning supplies and pizza boxes, and extensive contact with these permanent chemicals may constitute serious health risks.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that this research carried out by the US Geological Survey (USGS) tests the tap water samples of more than 700 residential, enterprises and drinking water treatment plants in the United States to check whether there is a full fluoride/polyfluorohumane group in tap water Perfluoroalkylor Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals, referred to as PFAS.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, the PFAS developed by TEFLON non -stick cooker coating was a large type of artificial chemicals. It has been produced in large quantities and used for various purposes for decades. PFAS is insoluble in water and oil, and is widely used in industrial applications, business and consumer products.</p>
<p>Researchers said that in 45%of tap water samples, at least one kind of synthetic chemicals were detected, which exceeded the benchmark and the legal provisions of the United States.</p>
<p>Because PFAS waterproof, this means that it will not be decomposed in the environment and can remain in the human body for many years.</p>
<p>According to data from the US Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC), PFAS, which is exposed to high concentrations, will disturb hormone and liver function, increase the risk of kidney cancer or testicular cancer, reduce baby birth weight and damage the health of pregnant women.</p>
<p>Simerlin, a hydrologicalist of the US Geological Survey, who led this research, said that the previous research has detected PFAS in groundwater, reservoir and water treatment plants. Ingredients.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey investigates a small part of 10,000 known PFAS types. Research samples were taken from public tap water and private wells from 2016 to 2021, detected 32 of them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-07-07T12-14/000000.png" />American research has found that the risk of U.S. urban residents exposed to PFAS in drinking water is higher than rural residents. (Agence France -Presse)</p>
<p>Smolin said that there is no difference in PFAS exposure in private wells and public tap water samples, which is "very surprising."</p>
<p>Public water supply in the United States is supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency, and private wells are not regulated.</p>
<p>Studies have also found that the risk of urban residents in the United States exposed to PFAS in drinking water is higher than rural residents.</p>

<p>This trip to Kerry will marked the first climate discussion between China and the United States since August last year. At that time, after the Speaker of the House of Representatives Namshi Pelosi visited Taiwan, the Beijing side interrupted the talks angrily. On the occasion of this talk, fossil fuel burning and El Nino's climate model lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/climate/climate-change-record-heat.html">the highest temperature since the world's records</a>The two countries and most parts of the earth are suffering from high temperatures.</p>
<p>"We need sincere cooperation," Kerry said in an interview. "China and the United States are the two largest economies in the world and the two largest emission countries. Obviously, we have a special responsibility for consensus."</p>
<p>This trip to China will be the third time that Kerry has visited China as a special envoy. Earlier, Secretary of State Anthony Brinken and Treasury Minister Jennite Yellen had visited China to stabilize the tension between Washington and Beijing. Kerry said he plans to meet with the Chinese climate special envoy and other "highest level" officials on July 16.</p>

<p>China and the United States are the two largest investors in clean energy. The policy of the two countries has a huge impact on whether the world can avoid the most serious consequences of global warming.</p>
<p>However, there are profound differences between the two sides of the fossil fuel emissions that the two countries to stop the earth's severe heating up.</p>
<p>Republicans who have been criticizing the Chinese trip to Bronken and Yellen condemned Kerry's visit and accused him of endangering the United States.</p>
<p>"Although it has not been confirmed by the US Senate, John Kerry is still negotiating with the Communist Party of China to promote an aggressive Green Political AD that harms US interests." James Comer, a Republican member of the Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. He accused Crey with "closed doors" with the Chinese.</p>
<p><a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7.13.2023-SPEC-Hearing-Notice27.pdf">Kerry is scheduled to attend next Thursday</a>Hearing of the House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee Supervision Group.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of President Biden, the United States promised to reduce emissions by about half by 2030. Last year, the "Reduction of Inflation Act" by Congress invested at least 370 billion US dollars for wind energy, solar energy and other clean energy sources. Biden also proposed to implement stricter pollution restrictions on the exhaust pipe and chimney, which may make the United States close to the target.</p>

<p>China's discharge continues to increase, but Chinese President Xi Jinping said that China's carbon pollution will reach its peak in 2030, and then achieve net zero emissions by 2060. China has more coal more than the sum of other countries in the world. Last year, the number of new coal -fired power plants approved by the government exceeded any time in the past seven years.</p>
<p>However, scientists have warned that industrialized countries must now greatly abandon fossil fuels to avoid the most disastrous consequences brought by climate change.</p>
<p>Kerry said he intends to urge China to accelerate the elimination of coal, crack down on forest cutting, and release a plan to reduce methane emissions. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas leaked from oil and natural gas wells. China <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/">in the joint agreement with the United States in 2021</a>These problems will be solved, but it has not been implemented so far.</p>
<p>"We are actually studying some specific actions to promote this process," Kerry said. "If we can't let China actively cooperate with us to respond to this challenge, we will all encounter greater problems."</p>
<p>Tom Woodruc, a senior researcher at the Institute of Policy Research of the Asian Association, said that the Cory of this trip can be officially established <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/climate/climate-cop26-glasgow.html">re -establish a regular climate discussion</a>, Will be his "highest achievement".</p>
<p>Woodruc said: "At present, climate negotiations are at a precarious stage because of geopolitical reasons." He pointed out that because of Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, China stopped diplomatic negotiations about military issues, drugs and climate change. We spend it. It took a year to "return to the original state".</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>In these three issues, China only agrees to restore climate change negotiations.</p>
<p>Kerry and 74 -year -old Jie Zhenhua both led the climate negotiation of their respective countries after retirement. In the past ten years, they have worked together to achieve some decisive international policy breakthroughs, including the Paris Agreement in 2015. Almost every country promised to reduce emissions to limit the global average temperature to increase by 1.5 degrees Celsius before industrialization. Essence Scientists say that more than this threshold, the possibility of catastrophic climate will increase significantly. Today the earth has an average heating up of 1.2 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Last year, Jie Zhenhua and Kerry met several times during the United Nations Summit held in Egypt, but the assistants said that they mainly made some simple conversations around when they could restart more substantial negotiations.</p>
<p>Kerry said that Xie Zhenhua also encountered a stroke this year, but now it is "a lot", and he also said that the two have been meeting online.</p>

<p>They said that if the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation in Japan complies with the disposal nuclear sewage, the radioactive substance concentration will meet the emission standards and target values, and it will also meet international standards.</p>
<p>Fang Wensui revealed that the South Korean government inspected the Fukushima Haiya plan of the Japanese side during the period to confirm that when the Japanese side was planned to deal with the water, the radioactive substance concentration will meet Low target value meets international standards such as IAEA's requirements.</p>
<p>Fang Wensi added that this is a preliminary conclusion based on the premise that Tokyo Electric is based on the plan and complies with relevant regulations. In the future, the Japanese party will be finalized, as well as whether the plan is appropriate and feasible, and then make a final judgment.</p>
<p>Worried about the fact that Fukushima's processing of water can pollute the supply of salt in the future, Korean consumers have recently hoarded sea salt, and the demand for sea salt has increased. On the other hand, South Korean President Yin Xiyue has rarely suffered any political damage. According to Gallop South Korea's weekly public opinion survey announced on Friday, Yin Xiyue's support rate increased by 2 percentage points to 38%.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T13-13-46/AP23150588153258-1685518796-1688724481.jpg" />Bid residue located in the equatorial state in South Sudan East(Associated Press)The United States has decided to transport clustering ammunition to Ukraine to help its army fight back the Russian troops entangled in the front line.</p>
<p>According to anonymous insiders, the Biden government is expected to announce providing thousands of such weapons to Ukraine as part of a new military assistance plan worth 800 million US dollars on the 7th. These insiders have not been authorized to discuss the decision publicly before the official announcement.</p>
<p>This may trigger the anger of allies and humanitarian organizations who have long -term opposition to the use of cluster bombs.</p>
<p>Supporters believe that Russia has used this controversial weapon in Ukraine, and the mute rate of ammunition provided by the United States has a low rate, which means that there will not be a large number of unblied bombs that may lead to unexpected deaths of civilians.</p>
<p>The following is the reason for the definition of clustering ammunition, its location, and the United States plan to provide a bundle ammunition to Ukraine.</p>
<h4>What is a bundle ammunition?</h4>
<p>The bundle ammunition is a bomb group that can be opened in the air and releases smaller bullets in a large range. The design purpose of this weapon is to destroy tanks, equipment and troops, while attacking multiple targets.</p>
<p>These ammunitions were launched by artillery weapons provided by the United States and its allies to Ukraine and for artillery weapons for the Russia and Ukraine. GM 155mm cannonball.</p>
<p>In the previous conflict, the dumbness rate of the ammunition was high, which means that thousands of smaller unsteady bombs are still residual, and it may continue to cause casualties after decades. The last time the United States used a bundle ammunition in Iraq in 2003, but as the conflict turned to a densely populated urban environment, the United States decided not to continue using such weapons.</p>
<p>The US Personal Patt Ryder said on the 6th that the US Department of Defense has the "multiple variants" of such ammunition. "We are considering that the ammunition does not include old variants with dumb bomb rates higher than 2.35%."</p>
<h4>Why do you want to provide such weapons now?</h4>
<p>For more than a year, the United States has used its traditional 155mm grenade guns and ammunition inventory, and has transported more than 2 million ammunition to Ukraine. Allies around the world also provide additional ammunition.</p>
<p>The 155mm ammunition can combat the target of 24-32 kilometers, so that it is the preferred ammunition for the Ukrainian ground forces trying to combat enemy targets from a long distance. The Ukrainian army consumed thousands of bullets in the battle with the Russians every day.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian parliament member Ye Hall Chelniyev said to reporters at the German Marshall Foundation event in the United States earlier this year that Kiev may need to fire 7,000 to 9,000 rounds daily to strengthen its counterattack battle. And providing such a number of ammunition has put tremendous pressure on the inventory of the United States and its allies.</p>
<p>Research and analyst of defending the Democratic Foundation Ryan Brobst said that bundle bomb is an attractive option because it can help Ukraine to destroy more goals with fewer ammunition, and because the United States since 2003 This type of ammunition has not been used in conflict, so it stores a large number of bundle bombs and can be quickly obtained.</p>
<p>In March 2023, the Republican senior officials of the US House of Representatives and the Senate pointed out in a letter from the Bayeng government that there may be as many as 3 million clusters of ammunition to use in the United States, and they urged the White House to transport these ammunition to alleviate the United States in the United States in Stress in war supply.</p>
<p>Brobst said, "Jetsmium ammunition is more effective than a single cannonball, because they can cause losses to a wider range of areas." "This is important for Ukraine. The background is that it is trying to clean up Russia's strict positions."</p>
<p>Brobers pointed out that using the American cluster of ammunition inventory can solve the problem of Ukrainian ammunition shortage and reduce the pressure of the United States and other countries in 155mm ammunition inventory.</p>
<h4>Does this type of weapon constitute the crime of war?</h4>
<p>The use of a bundle bomb itself does not violate international law, but the use of cluster bombs for civilians may violate international law. Like any attack, the determination of the crime of war needs to inspect whether its attack target is legal, and whether it has taken preventive measures to avoid civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Mark Hipzne, deputy director of the Human Rights Observation Organization, told the Associated Press that "the part of the role in international law is a non -difference attack for civilians." "Therefore, this is not necessarily related The use of weapons is related. "</p>
<p>More than 120 countries have joined the "International Convention on Betlated Bombs". They agree that they do not use, produce, transfer or store such weapons and remove them after use. The United States, Russia and Ukraine have not signed the agreement.</p>
<h4>Where are these weapons used?</h4>
<p>Such bombs have been deployed in many recent conflicts, including conflicts involved in U.S. military.</p>
<p>According to human rights observations, during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the United States first regarded a bundle bomb as part of its arsenal. The organization estimates that within the first three years of the conflict, the United States -led coalition forces cast more than 1,500 bundle bombs in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense originally scheduled to stop using a cluster of ammunition with a dumb rate of more than 1%in 2019. However, the Trump administration has revoked this policy and allowed commanders to approve the use of such ammunition.</p>
<p>During the Syrian civil war, the Syrian government forces often used cluster ammunition provided by Russia to attack the opposition base and often hit civil goals and infrastructure. Israel also used this type of ammunition in the civilian area of southern Lebanon, including during the invasion of 1982.</p>
<p>Human rights observation and the United Nations accused Israel with a one -month war in 2006, and launched up to 4 million clustering ammunition to Lebanese. Among them, the unsteady ammunition still threatens Lebanon's civilians.</p>
<p>The Yamen coalition led by Saudi Arabia was criticized for his use of a bundle bomb in war with Iran's Hussean armed groups, and this conflict was holding this country in the southern Arab world.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, in 2017, Yemen was the second largest country that caused the number of deaths to cause the number of deaths, second only to Syria. However, because many children died for a long time after the first time the ammunition fell, it was difficult to know the real number of deaths.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Russia used a large number of cluster bombs during the 10 -year invasion of Afghanistan. Due to the decades of war, rural Afghanistan is still one of the countries with the worst mines in the world.</p>
<h4>What is happening to Ukraine?</h4>
<p>According to the Ukrainian government leaders, observers and humanitarian organizations, the Russian army has used a bundle bomb in Ukraine. And human rights organizations said Ukraine also used such weapons.</p>
<p>In the early days of this war, organizations such as human rights observations repeatedly mentioned the incident of Russia's launching cluster bomb attack, including incidents that attacked a kindergarten around the city of Ohtilka in northeast Ukraine. The open source intelligence organization "Bellingcat" pointed out that its researchers found a bundle ammunition in that attack. In addition, Harkov, the second largest city in Ukraine, also located in the northeast, found a lot of cluster bomb attacks.</p>

<p>The Japanese nuclear regulatory agency issued a license to Tokyo Electric Power Corporation on Friday (July 7), allowing Tokyo Power to start discharging more than 1 million tons of nuclear sewage into the sea.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that this is the last level that Tokyo Electric has handled the Fukushima first nuclear power plant and must pass.</p>
<p>The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released the comprehensive evaluation report of the Fukushima nuclear sewage disposal "comply with IAEA safety standards" on Tuesday (4th).</p>

<p>US Treasury Secretary Jennte Yelun stated in a statement issued by the US company in China on Friday that the decoupling between the world's two largest economies is "almost impossible."</p>
<p>Although Beijing's export restrictions highlight the necessity of diversification of the supply chain, Yellen said, "We seek diversification rather than decoupled, and the decoupling between the two largest economies in the world will destroy the stability of the global economy."</p>
<p>Yellen called on market reforms in the world's second largest economy and pointed out that the United States and its allies will resist the so -called "unfair economic behavior" in China.</p>
<p>Yellen said to American businessmen: "Steering to market reform will meet the interests of China," she also added. "Based on market -based ways to help stimulate China's rapid growth and help hundreds of millions of people get rid of poverty. This is a wonderful Economic success story. "</p>
<p>On Friday, Yellen also met with the President of the People's Bank of China Yi Gang and the former chief economic officer of China Liu He, which conducted informal talks on the US and Chinese economy and the global economic situation.</p>
<p>Yellen's visit to Beijing was to alleviate the tension between the two world -world powers. However, the expectations are not high. Both officials acknowledge that the current protection of national security interests is more important than deepening economic relations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T13-30-12/1-1688736281.jpg" />China allows driverless taxis</p>
<p>After arriving in Beijing on Thursday night, Yelun wrote on Twitter: "We look forward to the benign economic competition of American workers and American companies, and cooperate to deal with global challenges."</p>
<p>She added: "If necessary, we will take measures to protect national security. This interview provides opportunities for communication to avoid poor communication or misunderstanding."</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Chinese Ministry of Finance stated in a statement today that Beijing hopes that the United States will take "specific measures" to create a favorable environment for the normal development of economic and trade relations between the two countries.</p>
<h4>firm trading relationship</h4>
<p>Although some people talk about economic decoupling between China and the United States, the latest data show that after the destruction of the five -year trade war and the new crown epidemic, the strong trade relationship between the two countries rebounded in 2022.</p>
<p>With the increase in the demand for Chinese consumer goods in China and the increase in Beijing's agricultural products and energy demand, the trade volume of the two countries reached 690 billion US dollars last year, a record high.</p>
<p>In 2018, former U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a tariff of up to 25%of imported goods worth about $ 370 billion in Chinese imports, and the trade volume between the two countries declined. Trade began to rise.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T13-30-12/2-1688736393.jpg" />Sino -US relations are facing the most prominent concerns and challenges</p>
<p>"I think people must realize that business and politics are two different things," said Michael Hart, the American Chamber of Commerce in China. "</p>
<p>However, this year's pace has slowed significantly. Data from the U.S. Census Agency show that as of the end of May, the two -way trade flow has decreased by 52 billion US dollars, a decrease of 18%compared with the first five months of 2022.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the trade between the two countries has undergone major changes. China has no longer purchased aircraft and machinery. Instead, it has increased the import of agriculture, energy, semiconductor and chip manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T13-30-12/1-1688736443.jpg" />Why did the head of the US technology company go to China?</p>
<p>The latter is particularly susceptible to the restrictions on the export of the United States. It is expected that Yellen will discuss this issue during the meeting in Beijing.</p>
<p>One of the tricky issues before this visit is that China responds through the exit of restrictions and 锗. Both metals are widely used in semiconductor and electric vehicles, which may cause new damage to the supply chain.</p>

<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) "Daily" published by Berlin noticed that US Treasury Secretary Yelun visited Beijing on Thursday and was warmly welcomed. Yellen's 4 -day visit "will largely determine whether the global science and technology war between the two superpowers will continue to be upgraded." Because just this week, China announced to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国管制出口的镓锗究竟是什么/a-66113298">镓 锗 锗</a>Export control required for two semiconductor manufacturing. The article wrote:</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, this is a step that people have expected a new round of competition for scientific and technological hegemony with chip sanctions in the United States.

<h3>New keywords for China relations</h3>
<p>Feng Derine's speech has received great attention. The saying "risk" also began to be cited by the media and politicians in Germany and the United States. The New York Times believes that this statement is a new summary of the European Union's relations with China.

<h3>Dependence is a "good choice"?</h3>
<p>Germany Foreign Minister Berbak also stated during the April China Celery China that Germany did not want to "decume" with China, but to "reduce risks", that is, Europe should reduce its dependence on "unhealthy" in China. At the same time, Qin Gang, a Chinese foreign minister who attended the press conference at the same time, responded that "China and Germany are partners, not opponents", and the two parties rely on the supply chain "the best choice in market rules"; as long as both countries remain open, "there is no need to be necessary to be unnecessary.

<h3>Shawrtz is the initial figurine?</h3>
<p>Some German media noticed that it was not Feng Delin, but the German Chancellor Salz that was the first to publicly use the word "de -risk". In November 2022, the German "Star" magazine (Stern) quoted his relying on the Chinese industrial chain in a report before Salz's visit to China: "Risks and diversification are the top priority."

" We just need to ensure that the technology of the United States and the allies will not be used to deal with ourselves, "instead of cutting off trade. He emphasized that" as President Feng Delin said recently. "</p>

<h3>String into the European Union's strategy to China</h3>
<p>The common policy for China is also an important issue at the EU summit ended on June 30. Summit jointly stated that it will support the continued economic and trade relations with China while reducing Europe's economic dependence on China. "Risk of Risk" officially appeared in this statement and became a concept. In the future, the European Union will use it as a guidance policy to launch a strategy to China. However, some criticisms have stated that the "de -risk" currently expressed by the European Union still lacks specific plans and responsibilities.</p>

Therefore, it is not surprising that some high -level European companies are worried about becoming injured in the global science and technology war between Washington and Beijing. According to Reuters, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国管制镓锗出口德国做好准备了吗/a-66136843">Volkswagen</a>We are closely observing the situation and "take measures when necessary". "</p>
<h3>Fast dull sword</h3>
<p>The "South Germany will" published a comment entitled "China is threatening, so what?" It also analyzed the same topic: "The Chinese government stated shortly before the visit of U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen that the United States would curb its high -tech to curb its high -tech to curb its high -tech. China will not be able to stand in the blockade of the ambition. From August, exports and 锗 must apply for a license. This is an important raw material in the two semiconductor production, and China is the world's most important supply country. disturbed.</p>
<p>"However, this step in China is likely to bring the greatest damage to itself. Because the supply of raw materials is far less effective than the export control launched by the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. High -end chips that play a core role. In addition, China cannot obtain the machines needed for self -manufacturing chips. These machinery belongs to the most complicated tools created by humans, and it is difficult to imagine the difficulty of imitation.</p>
<p>China's central position in raw materials is not that these minerals are unique to China. China can only minimize and processes costs lower than other countries. This has its significance in the era of international division of labor, but it has become a problem in the context of increasing competition in the current power. But for the West, this problem is solved. 稀, [and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/稀土有多重要中国主导地位为何难以撼动/a-66136145">rare earth</a>Mine is distributed around the world, and China does not monopolize its mining technology. Even though China will be put into implementation and no longer export the above raw materials to the West, it will lead to painful supply bottlenecks in the first few years, but once the West has established a replacement supplier, China's control will lose its effect. The European Union is focusing on this direction. China's threat is a sword that will soon become blunt. "</p>

On Friday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission officially announced that it fined more than 7.1 billion yuan in Ant Group and its agencies and transferred to "normal supervision". The development prospects of Chinese private enterprises have also been shadow again.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/2-07072023105405.html">End supervision rectification? Ant Group was fined 7.123 billion yuan</a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/7-05062023164443.html"><strong> Ant Group's financial license approval was delayed due to the adjustment of China's regulatory system </strong></a>According to the announcement issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on the evening of July 7, Ant Group and its institutions were fined 7.123 billion yuan, which was lower than the expected expectations. Reuters pointed out that this marks the Chinese government's long -term supervision and rectification of this leading fintech company.</p>
<p>It is reported that the relevant fine items are mainly aimed at Ant Group and institutions in the past year in corporate governance, financial consumer protection, participating in bank insurance institutions' business activities, engaging in payment settlement business, fulfillment of anti -money laundering obligations, and development of fund sales business. Behavior. In addition, the Ant Group was ordered to shut down the "mutual treasure" business and compensate the interests of consumers in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>For three years, the Chinese economy has not rebounded quickly as scheduled. On the contrary, with the decline in the manufacturing index, weak consumption, and rising unemployment rate, the Chinese authorities' high -profile punishment for Ant Group this time highlighting that the situation of private enterprises is continuing to deteriorate. At the same time, Tencent Group's "Tenpay" competent authorities have not been fine of nearly 3 billion yuan; three financial institutions such as Ping An Bank also received a ticket issued by the central bank, and the total fined was not nearly 90 million yuan.</p>
<p>According to the announcement issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Friday, the next step of the financial management department will "focus on improving the normalization of the platform's financial business, and the work of the financial management department will focus on the transfer of centralized rectification of the platform's financial business to normal supervision."</p>
<p>Ant Group subsequently responded in a statement saying that since 2020, the Ant Group has actively promoted various rectification under the guidance of the financial management department, and has completed relevant rectification matters. The statement also emphasized that the Ant Group's decision on administrative penalties was "sincere acceptance, resolutely obey, and will further consolidate the level of practice and re -control."</p>
<p>As early as 2021, Alibaba Group was fined 18.2 billion yuan for violating China's "Anti -Monopoly Law".</p>

<p>He said: "The time to choose Yellen to visit China to fine, or to release a signal to the international market. Because ants are the representatives of Chinese Internet companies and private enterprises, the release signal said that in the future, it may be relatively relaxed (control) in the future. This attracts foreign capital. "</p>
<p>Qin Peng analyzes that if the Chinese market environment is greater than the rule of law, if it does not change, it is difficult to restore the confidence of foreign capital by relying on the release of loose signals: "It will have an impact and help, but it is impossible to return to it. It is because Ma Yun said If you are wrong, you will start rectification of ants and these companies, and the leaders are greater than the law. "</p>
<p>Hu Li Ren, a Chinese private entrepreneur who has been engaged in financial work for many years, told the station that the Ant Group was suppressed because of participating in financial services and moved the Chinese government's "cake". He said: "The economy is still needed, but when it becomes a giant, it has a political impact on the government. The bigger and the richer, the more the right to speak. Develop related policies for it. "</p>
<p>Since the ants were blocked in 2020, the founder Ma Yun gave up the actual control of the group and retired behind the scenes. It is reported that Ma Yun has recently taught at the University of Tokyo, Japan, and also said that he has more time to stay in China.</p>
<p>Hu Li Ren analyzed that China's private economy has been dead, and a large amount of private enterprises such as Ant Group will eventually only embark on the old road of "public -private partnership".</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the fine on Ant Group was one of the biggest tickets issued by Internet companies in the history of the Ant Group. It will help the company to obtain a financial holding company license and restart the listing plan. But for a wider range of technology industries, this fine also marked a key step in the Chinese authorities' brutal suppression of private enterprises.</p>
<p>The report quoted policies and revealed that Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the Central Bank of China, announced a fine on the Ant Group shortly after being promoted to the Party Secretary of the Central Bank of the Party Committee, which is the prelude to the authorities to promote him as the president. Pan Gongsheng is one of the main officials to supervise Ant Financial's rectification. He has attended many meetings related to fines and rectification.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-07T14-31-08/shutterstock_1671134326-1688713002-1688737440.jpg" />A well -known physics professor said that if the Third World War broke out, then it will be the battle of biological virus and cyberspace.(Social networking site)Richard Mueller, an honorary professor of physics at the University of California, believes that Russian President Putin's failure in Ukraine and the rebellion of the Wagner Group increased his possibility of expanding his 17 -month conflict.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mueller published on the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-war-iii-virus-vaccine-biological-weapon-russia-ukraine-china-covid-cybersecurity-hack-162a8b08?mod=hp_opin_pos_4#cxrecs_s">Article</a>According to China, the outbreak of the Third World War may be different from what we imagined. He pointed out that the current model of the nuclear conflict upgrade was designed by Hardon's founder and physicist Herman Kahn 60 years ago, but since then, other technologies have achieved a long -time improvement.</p>
<p>Mueller explained that conventional weapons, bombs, missiles, or troops may not appear in the Third World War at all. However, biological viruses and computer viruses are likely to become the preferred weapons. He took the new crown virus as an example, thinking that although this was not a deliberate attack, it quickly and successfully damaged the US economy.</p>
<p>The physicist believes that any country that considers the use of fatal viruses as a war weapon must first be immune to its people, perhaps under the guise of influenza vaccine. He added that the long -term immunity of residents' levels will promote the full improvement of these countries before the release of the virus to reduce the possibility of their back mutation again. And this is the situation that happened to the new crown virus -the latter has no new dangerous mutations in the past nine months.</p>
<h4>computer virus</h4>
<p>Mules added that the use of virus as a weapon also needs to be integrated with immunosuppressive genes, just like in the new coronary virus or RF-8 virus, which can reduce early symptoms and make it easier to spread through asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to make the secret attack success, the virus must be released in the target country rather than in the native country, or it may be near biological facilities. In this way, the world will mistakenly believe that it is a leak from the secret plan of the target country.</p>

<p>Mueller is also a national security consultant of the Jason Defense Consulting Group composed of elite scientists. He pointed out that computer virus will be another weapon in the Third World War. , Train, airlines, shipping, banking, water supply, sewage treatment plant and other goals of extortion software.</p>
<h4>Hospital will become the main goal</h4>
<p>However, Mueller believes that the hospital will be the most prominent goal. In addition, avoiding obvious military goals will strengthen the illusion that this war has not yet begun. The attacker may wrongly claim that their system has also been besieged, and this is where misleading is more effective than camouflage.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that this event is not a catastrophic scene created by Hollywood writers, because biological viruses and electronic viruses have achieved field tests to some extent.</p>
<p>For attackers, the huge value generated by the dual attacks of biological and networks is that it is possible to achieve its destructive goals, and at the same time, it can also maintain the confidentiality of the entire process.</p>
<p>In the end of this article, Mueller pointed out that US leaders must seriously treat their countries that are not invaded, and even if they are not attacked, they are defeated. He also said that the method of preventing such attacks is to make potential hostile actors believe that success is impossible, and attackers will encounter rapid and terrible consequences.</p>

<p>July 9 this year is the eighth anniversary of the "709" Rights Protection Lawyer Congress. The Rights Protection Network published a special commentator article, pointing out that the authorities' suppression of rights protection lawyers is still "as ever", and their struggle is still "indomitable." The article once again urged the Chinese authorities to release the detained rights protection lawyers, stop harassing their families, and restart the legal reform of the legal system.</p>
<p>The article said that at that time, the authorities launched a large -scale arrest of the group of rights protection lawyers. A total of about 320 vitamin lawyers and activists were knocked down, summoned, and detained. Although some of them were taken away, some of them were released one after another, but some of them were still prosecuted and sentenced.</p>
<p>The article mentioned that Li Yuhan, Yu Wensheng, Jiang Tianyong, Wang Quanzhang, Li Heping, and many other rights protection lawyers and their families are still facing the authorities' suppression and persecution. Their encounters have aroused the attention of many netizens and condemnation of the authorities. Some overseas objections, scholars, and media people have also sponsored co -scholarship calls, but today, even if foreign heads of state attach great importance to Chinese and Western confrontation When the meeting was met, it was not available.</p>
<p>The article pointed out that the authorities have been doing their own things in recent years. They don't care about the pressure of international public opinion. For all sensitive people including rights protection lawyers, as long as they feel obvious, they can be won at any time.</p>
<p>The article also said that with the implementation of the Hong Kong version of the National Security Law, the totalitarian rule of mainland China has expanded rapidly to Hong Kong, the human rights and freedom of local lawyers have also been deprived, and the governance of political prisoners has also begun to be continental. This year, Zou Xingtong, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Branch Federation, became the first "non -mainland" lawyer to win the "709 Human Rights Lawyer Award".</p>
<p>The article particularly praised the wives of lawyers in the "709" case, such as Xu Yan, Li Wenzu, Wang Qiaoling and other support for her husband, making people see the strength and greatness of Chinese women.</p>
<p>At the end of the article, since the "709", although a large number of lawyers and rights defenders have been arrested and sentenced, their families have been harassed. However, they have not stunned, and conscience and international community are continuously shouting. Many young lawyers have stood up to act as "sensitive" human rights cases. On the eighth anniversary of the "709", the article once again called on the authorities to unconditionally release the detained rights protection lawyers, stop harassing their families, and restart legal reforms.</p>

In other public speeches, Bayon did not announce that Russia would "use nuclear weapons". The close content of the conversation was that Biden mentioned in a election activity in California that he was "worried about Putin's use of nuclear weapons but people around him were not serious." This shows that the issue of climate change is facing the same difference. He said that Russia's use of nuclear weapons and climate change, both threats are real. His above remarks were not issued by the nuclear war warning.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Recently, Weibo and Twitter have a highly similar post. The content is called US President Biden Daden delivered a national TV speech, announcing that Russia will use nuclear weapons. The release date of these posts is concentrated on June 28 and 29. Formed a hot spot for public opinion, there was a more than one million views of tweets.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T14-50-24-04-00/000002.png" />From June 28th to 29th, the same tweets appeared on Twitter stated that Biden delivered a TV speech, announcing that Russia is about to use nuclear weapons. Figure intercepting Twitter <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-07072023144404.html/56fe1-62dc767b57285168570b96fb89968b1b8a715ba35e034fc47f8565af5c074f7f752868386b66-1.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T14-50-24-04-00/000003.png" /></a>The Asian factual inspection of the laboratory searched in the keywords in the post, and found that as early as the "Netease" a week ago, the "Netease" had appeared in the same articles, and the "emergency" emphasized that Biden announced in a national TV speech that Russia would use nuclear weapons to use the urgency of nuclear weapons to urgency of nuclear weapons. sex.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T14-50-24-04-00/000004.png" />Articles appearing on the "Netease" on June 22 regarded Biden's "TV speech" as emergency news. The picture intercepts from NetEase <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-07072023144404.html/56fe2-622a5716-2023-06-29-14-19-48.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T14-50-24-04-00/000005.png" /></a>In the post of posts, some issues said that news sources were reported by Reuters on the 20th.(https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-threat-putin-using-tactical-nuclear-weapons-is-real-2023-06-20/)The article quoted Biden's two speeches: The first paragraph was "about two years ago, when I said here that I was worried that the Colorado River was dry, everyone looked at me, just like I was crazy." The second paragraph is "they look at me, just like I said I was worried about Putin's use of tactical nuclear weapons, this is true."</p>
<p>In order to understand the context of Biden's speech, the Asian facts checking the laboratory found a complete press release. This speech took place at a campaign at the Artoreton California on June 19. Biden was mainly talking about climate change at the time.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/19/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-atherton-ca/">Original of the White House Press</a>Bynden first mentioned that since he took office, there have been land equivalent to the entire Maryland area burned by climate change. He went on to say, "About three years ago, when I said that when I was worried about the Kororado River, everyone looked at me like watching a lunatic. When I said that I was worried that Putin used tactical nuclear weapons, they also looked at me like this." Then he said, "This (threat) is real, but we can deal with it."</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The speech of the US President Biden at the California campaign was not that the warning nuclear war was about to erupt, but to describe some of the risks that everyone faced in this world, and he himself "both far -end and countermeasures". Essence So far, he has not delivered a TV speech to announce that Russia "is about to use nuclear weapons". Two and a lot of posts on Twitter and Weibo tampered with the content and background of his speech, which was spreading error information.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, Yellen emphasized at the meeting that she hopes that the United States can compete in the middle of the United States through fair rules, and does not want to face the vicious competition of "winners". Li Qiang said that the world needs overall stable Sino -US relations. Whether China and the United States can get together correctly about the fate of the future. He also said that during the visit of Yellen, a rainbow appeared in the sky in Beijing, which indicates that after U.S. -China relations have gone through storms, there is also hope to see the rainbow and return to the right track.</p>
<p><strong> Yellen: The United States is pursuing the diversified supply chain instead of completely out of China with China </strong></p>
<p>In the face of Yellen and Li Qiang, Yellen met with high -level companies in China. Boeing, Bank ofamerica, and Cargill of the Agricultural Division all sent representatives to participate in the meeting. According to the New York Times, Yellen expressed the attention of the Chinese government's punitive behavior against the Chinese government in the conversation with these companies. Yellen said: "When meeting with Chinese officials, I will convey concerns in the American business community, including China using non -market tools to subsidize state -owned enterprises and domestic companies, and block foreign companies into the Chinese market ... In addition, I am particularly in China in China. In recent months, it is uneasy about punishing American companies. "</p>
<p>Yellen also mentioned that China recently announced that it has recently announced that it has restricted exports to the key rare metals and crickets, which once again settled the view that the United States could not rely too much on China. However, she emphasized that the United States is seeking diversification of supply chain, not to decompose with China: "If the two largest economies in the world are decoupled, this will lead to the instability of the global economy, and this is almost impossible to achieve it. What happened. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T14-55-00-04-00/000002.png" />On July 7, 2023, the US Ambassador to China Burns and US Treasury Secretary Yellen spoke to the American businessmen in Beijing.

<p>At the same time as Li Qiang and Yelun met, Chinese President Xi Jinping was inspecting in Jiangsu and Nanjing. Xi Jinping emphasized when inspecting local science and technology companies that key technology research and development and self -reliance. Xi Jinping also mentioned that the key to Chinese -style modernization lies in the modernization of science and technology, and it is necessary to attract foreign investment and expand overseas markets through domestic and international dual cycles.</p>
<p>In this regard, Wang Wei, dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, University of Adefei, said in an interview that this shows that the United States and China have entered a state of competition: "China and the United States have learned that the economies of both sides are quite close and dependent on each other. Unlikely decoupled. However, the situation of competition will become increasingly strengthened. One of the important differences are that the United States hopes that China can agree with the competitive relationship defined by Washington. And international organization norms. (But) China has many non -market obstacles. These non -market obstacles depend on the country's can be very easy to follow. There is no relatively fair competitive environment, but to give Chinese company advantages. "</p>
<p>Wang Weizheng said: "The United States wants us to make a set, and then talk about the same set, but China does not say, but it is also doing it. I think both parties actually regard each other as the biggest competitor, but the United States hopes , China is unwilling to Minghua, this is the biggest difference. "</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan, director of the Department of International Studies and Contemporary Linguistics of St. Tomas University in the United States, also believes that although Yellen's trip hopes to convey friendly signals to Beijing, this trip will not change the direction of competition in the United States and China: "They talked a lot, But the factual results are not to talk. The current attitude of the Bayeng government has not given up in competition, but at the same time he believes that we can cooperate with the place where we can cooperate. However, this premise is that China must cooperate with the United States. It is believed that in the current situation, the competition between the two sides is far greater than cooperation, and the parts that can cooperate will become smaller and smaller. "</p>

<p>On the other hand, Reuters quoted people familiar with the matter on Friday that the U.S. Listed Corporation Accounting Supervision Committee (PCAOB) has recently launched an accounting review of Chinese listed companies in the United States in Hong Kong. Last December, about 200 Chinese companies agreed to be investigated in the United States to avoid the fate of being delisted from Wall Street Stock Exchange.Ye Yaoyuan believes that the US party's accounting information at this time is based on the consideration of the United States, rather than affecting the task of "hope to promote American -China cooperation": "The competitive environment between the United States and China does not have Change, but many blocks that can also be cooperated. The United States hopes to visit China through Brinken and Yellen and move the plan forward. "</p>
<p>In response to Yelun's trip to Beijing, the Ministry of Finance of China said on Friday: "The essence of Sino -US economic and trade relations is mutually beneficial and win -win, and there is no winner in trade war and 'desulting and disconnection chains. Develop and achieve a good environment for mutual benefit and win -win. "</p>

<p>Gronci visited Japan on Tuesday (4th) to release a comprehensive evaluation report of the "IAEA Safety Standard" in Fukushima nuclear sewage treatment in Japan, and handed the report to the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong.</p>
<p>Gronci said on the same day that the plan to discharge Fukushima's treatment of water in Japan "meets international security standards." The report also evaluated that if it is discharged in stages according to the plan, the influence on the radiation of humans and the environment is "very small."</p>
<p>The South Korean government also released a research report on the safety of Fukushima's treatment of water for the safety of Water, stating that IAEA's comprehensive assessment report on Fukushima's treatment of water, and confirmed that the Japanese plan complied with international standards.</p>
<p>However, South Korea also said that this is a preliminary conclusion based on the premise of Tokyo Electric Power in accordance with the plan and compliance with relevant regulations. In the future, the Japanese party will be finalized, as well as whether the plan is appropriate and feasible, and then make a final judgment.</p>
<p>Grones ended his visit to Japan on Friday. The South Korean government previously said that Grones visited Seoul on Friday to Sunday to explain the results of the investigation of Fukushima's treatment of water.</p>

<p>According to three open source intelligence analysts, the Chinese military is developing high -tech weapons to interfere with brain function and affect government leaders or all population. This technology may become an important asymmetric war tool for military attacks in Taiwan.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Territory, these nerve strike weapons can use microwave or other orientation energy to directly attack or control the brain, and the danger of this brain war weapon before or during the conflict is no longer just theoretically.</p>
<p>This entitled "Enumeration, Targeting and Collapsing The Chinese" reported in the report called " PLA (PLA) He has established his position as a world leader in the development of neurological strike weapons. "</p>
<p>According to the report, neural strike capacity is part of the military standard ability, and should not be regarded as unconventional weapons used in extreme circumstances. These weapons may be used in regions such as Taiwan, South China Sea, East China Sea, and China -India.</p>
<p>The report was written by Ryan Clarke, a senior researcher at the East Asia Research Institute of Singapore; former Army Microbiologist Lin Xiaoxu, and former Air Force Intelligence Officer, is currently written by L.J.EADS, an artificial intelligence expert in the American intelligence industry. The three authors believe that the Chinese leadership "considers neural strike and psychological warfare as its core component of the asymmetric war strategy against the United States and its Indo -Pacific Allies."</p>
<p>The report said: "Any breakthrough in this research will provide unprecedented tools for the Communist Party of China to forcibly establish a new world order, which has always been Xi Jinping's lifelong goal."</p>
<p>The report also said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army can weaken the conventional military advantages of the United States in this way, while the United States has almost no countermeasures in the short term.</p>
<p>The report also pointed out that the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences is likely to be the main unit of brain war. It has been included in the blacklist of the US Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>"709 arrest" has passed eight years. However, for the arrested lawyers and family members who have been fighting against each other, the "709 incident" is still entangled with them like a nightmare.</p>
<p>Li Heping still remembers that on July 10, 2015, he took his daughter to drive to a law firm to see the client. At that time, the news that he was taken away on the mobile phone. As soon as he arrived downstairs in the law firm, he was surrounded by a group of national security and plainclothes, and then took him home to search.</p>
<p>He has a wealth of experience in dealing with sensitive cases. At that time, he thought that this time he was taken away, which was no different from the previous situation.</p>
<p>"One of their leading young people said," You are quite calm ', he said that I have a "general". In fact, as a lawyer in China, the risks have always existed, and they have been caught and disappeared. I am in 2007. They were kidnapped several times in the year, so there was nothing particularly lied. Nothing, then it was quite calm. "</p>

<p>However, he never expected that this wave of arrests involved nearly 300 people, covering lawyers, rights protection, visits, Christians, and even family members, covering 23 provinces across the country. He was put on a black head cover, handcuffed, and brought to a guest house.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the beginning, he was constantly shifted by his head. He didn't know where he was, nor did he know whether he was the armed police, National Security or Public Security.</p>
<p>This is also the common experience of many 709 arrested. Like many arrested people, Li Heping suffered a "hell" torture and was tortured into "living dead". Every time he mentioned, he was extremely painful.</p>
<p>"I think the first horrible thing is that he asked you to take medicine and fill your medicine. You don't know what medicine is. Anyway, let you take medicine on the first day, and take a lot of medicines. You don't know why. "Li Heping said.</p>
<p>"The second is to let you stand and keep a standing posture for a long time. So after I returned from 709, I can't run away. The feeling of the legs is separated from the knee. The wire is broken. Also, don't let you eat it, and don't let you drink water. And the detention center is frozen enough, the whole is a systematic torture. "<strong> "709 court drama" by the script "</strong></p>
<p>One and a half years after the arrest, Li Heping was charged by the Tianjin Procuratorate as "the crime of subverting the state power." However, he said that at that time, everyone in charge of the case knew that it was a injustice, but the real led case was the "709 task force", and the judge was only the tool of the "task force".</p>
<p>Li Heping has always insisted on not pleading guilty. However, the pressure of the international community at that time made the judge's burnt, and even proposed to Li Heping that he hoped to "solve the problem" as soon as possible. In the end, Li Heping and the judge reached an agreement, "We are defending innocence, how do you judge your affairs" and "each expression" in a vague way.</p>
<p>The entire closed -door trial process was required to be carried out strictly in accordance with the "script". Li Heping's wife Wang Qianling was completely unaware. Participants such as the procuratorate, judges and other participants must participate in "rehearsal". However, when the sentence was pronounced, Li Heping's words made the "task force" dissatisfied, and the entire trial had to "repeat itself."</p>
<p>"They asked me to say 'obey the judgment and not appeal.' When they were sentenced, I said that the" retaining opinion, not appealing ', not the same as their script. " The actors, lawyers, and prosecutors all left, but the people in the task force felt inappropriate, and called them back and called them back to the second court. Let me talk about the "obedience to the judgment, not appealing '."</p>
<p>On April 28, 2017, Tianjin Second Intermediate People's Court determined that Li Heping's crime of "subverting the state power" was successful, sentenced to three years in prison, four years in probation, and depriving political rights for four years. The official news stated that Li Heping expressed regret in the court, "obeying the judgment does not appeal." Ten days later, Li Heping was released, but due to probation restrictions, it was not allowed to be interviewed by the media for 4 years. These details forced to speak in court have been forbearing to this day.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000008.png" />Wang Quanzhang and his son are with his son(Wang Quanzhang provided)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/al-07072023121001.html/img_9211.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000009.png" /></a><strong> Wang Quanzhang: I resolutely not cooperate with this "perfect trial" </strong></p>
<p>However, another 709 lawyer Wang Quanzhang always refused to cooperate with the performance of the "709 drama". "What is the most pursuing case in this case? They pursue the so -called 100 points. What is 100 points? What is perfect judgment? For judges, there are several key judgments, such as representatives of the People's Congress, members of the CPPCC, journalists Participate in the listening, the defense lawyer fully defended, the parties pleaded guilty, served the law, and did not appeal, and then expressed their statements on TV. This is a perfect trial for the court. "</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said: "They are pursuing this effect, but I will not make such a cooperation for them at all. On the one hand, they vilify the lawyers, and on the one hand, they want to realize their perfect trial from me, and then insert their lawyers, I Resolutely resist. "</p>
<p>That's it. Every time the official arranged officials to send officials to Wang Quanzhang, he dismissed directly, so that the judge could not promote the case, was anxious, and even cried directly to him to ask him to cooperate.</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang admitted that when he was just held in a secret place, torture made him not as good as death. However, after transferring to the detention center, his treatment improved, and he decided to use the past to defend the parties. The illegal act on the case "stops the persecution machine to stop turning."</p>
<p>"At that time, I actually entered a state of power flip. They also began to test, not as hostile to me, told me brother and brother, I hope I will give them face, give them a step, and then let me go. I said. You used to humiliate me in the past. Like Grandpa, why are you becoming a grandson now? I won't give you a word. "</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said, "The kind of bitterness and freedom in it, after a long period of systemization, it was numb. At that time, the director of the detention center said that I had worked out for 30 years and never saw a case -handling unit. An object of censorship. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000010.png" />Li Wenzu and his son (provided by Wang Quanzhang) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/al-07072023121001.html/img_9212.jpg">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-21-00-04-00/000011.png)</a><strong> "The last person in the 709 case" </strong></p>
<p>When his wife Li Wenzu ran to him outside the high wall and hoped that he was released as soon as possible, and the court was anxious to "solve" him as soon as possible, but Wang Quanzhang hoped that the case would "drag for one day". The unable to judge him, but must change his mandatory measures to him after the interrogation period is over, so that he will take the bail pending trial. In this way, he can accept the interview and tell the truth.</p>
<p>However, Wang Quanzhang admitted that he underestimated the "shamelessness" of the Supreme Court. Under the approval of the Supreme Court, the Tianjin Second Intermediate People's Court violated the regulations and repeatedly delayed his case trial, making him the "last person of the 709 case" and had only been dragged until 2019. As a result, Wang Quanzhang was sentenced to "subverting the crime of state power". He was sentenced to four years and six months, deprived of political rights for five years. He was released from prison until April 5, 2020, and his freedom was nearly 5 years.</p>
<p>After regaining freedom, he felt that he was disconnected from the times. He could not even use WeChat payment, and could not concentrate on doing things, and deeply felt anxious. It wasn't until the former judicial minister Fu Zhenghua, who was accused of planning the "709 arrest", and Sun Lijun, the former deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security. Wang Quanzhang felt that his anxiety was cured.</p>
<p>"The person who persecuted you was ended. Some lawyers said very well. The end of these people today was pursued by them. They persecuted human rights lawyers for a long time. One day they were detained. People must be human rights lawyers. "Wang Quanzhang said," They stepped down, making people feel very fast, not only me, but also many people who have been persecuted by them are very happy. "</p>
<p>To fight with those who persecuted himself, Wang Quanzhang paid a heavy price. His lawyer's license was revoked, making him unable to defend the parties as a lawyer.<strong> Destruction of career, living in the house </strong></p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said: "After the 709 incident, my career was interrupted by my career, that is, my entire career was destroyed. I have achieved some results in the case before. Judge, actually effectively helped those people who were persecuted at the grassroots level. But the 709 incident was interrupted, and my past experience was all invalid, causing great damage to my career ideals. "</p>
<p>In addition to the destruction of his career, the Wang Quanzhang family has also been monitored for a long time, and every sensitive day will be restricted. Starting from April this year, with a number of senior officials from European countries visited China, the authorities have greatly improved their suppression of them. They are constantly disturbed by landlords, police, and even underworlds, and they have broken water and power. They do not stop them. In just two months, Wang Quanzhang's family moved 13 times and was rushed to rush around in different regions of Beijing.</p>
<p><strong> Can't escape the cage </strong> **</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said that he can foresee that even if he leaves Beijing, he will only be monitored more seriously like Chen Guangcheng of that year. As long as they are still on the land in China, they cannot be separated from trouble. When asked if he wanted to leave China, his answer was yes. However, the couple have been rejected by trying to apply for a passport.</p>
<p>The Li Heping family, also forced to move, was intercepted at Chengdu Airport when she successfully handled her passport. The police read out the restriction notice, saying that they "may endanger national security."</p>
<p>Li Heping said: "Entering the border is the right of citizens. If there is this right, I can choose to stay in China or choose to leave China. This should be free. But now he will not let you leave China. Already restricted you, deprive your choice. "</p>
<p><strong> Endless oppression </strong></p>
<p>The lawyers who were suspended, monitored, forced to relocate, and were controlled, and more like Li Yuhan, who were defended by lawyers 709 cases, were arrested; lawyers of Yu Wensheng were arrested for the second time, and this time, he also brought his wife Xu Xu Xu Yan, all charged with Guoan related crimes. The two lawyers of Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi were sentenced to 14 years and 12 years in prison for the "Xiamen gathering case".</p>
<p>For Chinese human rights lawyers, the eight -year anti -Japanese war in 709 is not known.</p>
<p>Li Heping said, "Did you say 709 is over? For the Wang Quanzhang family and my family, they want to drive us away from Beijing, so as not to let us rent a house in Beijing, break the water and power off, and let us live here. In the world's eyes, the eyes of the world. They all violated the law like this. Are you saying that 709 is over? "</p>
<p><strong> After 709, the construction of the rule of law in China is extinguished by gray smoke </strong></p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang believes that before and after the "709 arrest", the Chinese official passed the new "Criminal Procedure Law", "Career Code of Lawyers", and the "Management Measures for Law Firm" to eliminate all the space for human rights lawyers. The rule of law in China is no longer hopeful.</p>
<p>For Li Heping, 709's research that he has been doing has been doing, and the work that promotes the introduction of the referee (jury) system in China has been interrupted. The "709 Incident" has also become the beginning of China's rule of law, and lawyers dare not tell the truth anymore.</p>
<p>"The 706 case has caused China to negotiate the market economy subject status that China is seeking, and the bottom of the kettle is drawn. Second, you have made the two major achievements of China's reform and opening up. A great social harm. "Li Heping said," The government said in a word of mouth to hope that the rule of law is hoped, so then of us lawyers really lead the rule of law and pursue the rule of law. When the rule of law is about to approach, he is afraid. , I want to do it for him. "</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly that the "709 incident" brought him to him was to let him experience torture in person and experienced a Chinese legal system "in -depth tour". However, he still firmly believes that a country must develop in a good direction, and the rule of law is indispensable. He quoted a sentence of Zhang Sizhi, the late Chinese Thai Dato -class lawyer: Human rights are the largest face in a country.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-25-00-04-00/000000.png" />In 2021, the monitoring camera outside a temple outside Tibet and the Chinese flag Martin Pollard/Reuters <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-07072023093501.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizanglan/tibet-07072023093501.html/@ @stream </a>Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, Tibet sends out to invite you to look at Tibet with me. Radio Asia was informed that the Tibetan authorities have recently strengthened the monitoring of Tibetans and continued to interrogate them in the regional capital of Lhasa to prevent the Tibetan from contacting the outside world. Anyone who had contact with foreign people would be summoned by the police. In addition, the Chinese government refused to provide compensation to local residents influenced by the world's largest hydraulic solar power plant, including Tibetan herdsmen. The herdsmen complained to the Chinese government. And a Tibetan Buddhist monk Ge Sangdan's growth traveled more than 2,000 kilometers to Dalai Lama worship. The monk had completed the journey three times, and behind him with a car full of food and bedding. In this episode, we will learn more about these situations together.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has been strengthening the monitoring of Tibetans and continuously interrogated Tibetans living in Lhasa to determine whether they have contact with people outside Tibet and strengthen monitoring measures to prevent such connections. Now, the Chinese authorities are interrogating Tibetans in Lhasa and warned them to stop communication.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the two important anniversary of the anniversary prompted police to strengthen surveillance. June is the 15th anniversary of the riots in 2008, and the 64th anniversary of the uprising of the Chinese army that invaded the region ten years ago in 1959.</p>
<p>However, the strengthening of security measures since March continued until June. The police continued to closely monitor Lhasa residents and randomly search for their mobile phones and online communication to find out whether they had communicated with foreign communication.</p>
<p>A Tibetan resident told Liberty Radio Tibetan group that the police were particularly worried that Lhasa residents might contact reporters or researchers outside Tibet.</p>
<p>The source said: "The Tibetans are warned not to contact the outside world. Those who have been in contact have been summoned and interrogated, their mobile phones are confiscated and they are continuously reviewed."</p>
<p>The source is a Tibetan who has been in contact with overseas people and is summoned with some friends to be interrogated. He said,</p>
<p>"They warned us not to contact the outside world, especially Tibetan researchers and reporters. I also know that there are many Tibetans who are in contact with people outside Tibet have also been interrogated by the Chinese authorities."</p>
<p>Another resident said that even if you chat with outsiders, they may be summoned. The resident said,</p>
<p>"I have been summoned twice this year to accept the interrogation. One of my friends had to bribe the authorities to release me for the second time. My name is now listed on the interrogation list, so if I need to leave Lhasa, I must get a license from the local police. ","</p>
<p>In addition, Chinese official media recently reported that the Giant Clark Photovoltaic Power Station began to be fully put into operation on June 26. This huge solar power station covers an area of 16 million square meters (equivalent to more than 2,000 football fields), equipped with hydropower components, which helps to stabilize energy supply when weather conditions change.</p>
<p>It can generate 2 billion kilowatt -hours per year, and it can be fully charged for electric vehicles with a range of 550 kilometers (340 miles) of 15,000 kilometers in only one hour.</p>
<p>However, a Tibetan residents living near Clark told the Tibetan group of Radio Free Asia that Tibetan nomads who had been grazing in areas covered by solar panels today were forced to move and did not provide any returns. The resident said,</p>
<p>"The Chinese government has operated the largest hydropower and solar power plant in Yajiang County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture on June 24. In order to build and promote the establishment of power plants, the Chinese government has occupied the local Tibetan land in the region, and has not given any giving any any of them. compensate."</p>
<p>The resident also said that before the project started, Tibetans who were displaced now have never been notified. He pointed out that</p>
<p>"On the contrary, the police are stationed near the power plant, and the locals must not approach. Although the authorities told the local Tibetans that the power plant will be beneficial to livestock and pasture, but now the Tibetan nomadic flow is displaced and is pushed to other places."</p>
<p>Another Tibetan resident said that local nomads appealed to the Chinese government, but there was no result.</p>
<p>"In April this year, the local Tibetan begging the Chinese authorities to stop this project. However, it is obvious that it is impossible to oppose migration and reorganization. The local Tibetans have no choice but to comply with the government's order."</p>
<p>Lausancuo, an environmental researcher at the Tibetan International Network headquarters in San Francisco, said that these power plants pose a serious threat to the fragile environment of Tibet.</p>
<p>She said: "The Chinese government's policies and the expansion of Tibet infrastructure are the causes of earthquakes, floods, and various irreversible ecosystem damage."</p>
<p>What you are listening to is Radio Asia Tibet Overview. I am Chen Aizheng and look at Tibet with you. A Tibetan Buddhist monk took a car full of food and bedding and worshiped regularly. In eight months, he completed more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) pilgrimal journey and arrived in Dallanala, India.</p>
<p>61 -year -old Gesang Tanzeng(Tenzin)He said that he was in the Bodhi Gaye in the sanctuary of the Buddhist Buddhist land in the northwest of India on October 29, 2022(BodhGaya)Departure from the village, it is believed that the Buddha became a path under the bodhi tree in the 6th century.</p>
<p>This is the third time Ge Sangdan has completed the long -distance pilgrimage since 2008. The monk said in Dallan Sara, India, said,</p>
<p>"For world peace, for the longevity of the Dalai Lama, for the welfare of all sentient beings, I started this trip again." Dallanara is the place where the Tibetan government is located, the exiles of Tibet and the Dalai Lama lived. Gesangdan has arrived on June 30.</p>
<p>For centuries, the devout Tibetan Buddhists have been pilgrimage and worshiped.</p>
<p>The monk began to walk at 7 am and stopped at 9 pm. When the weather is good, it is about eight kilometers a day, but the distance is only half a day on the steep road or when the weather is not good. Gesangdan said that because the bun is a physical work, sometimes it causes a cold due to his temperature loss. On the road, I also encountered the help of many exile Tibetans and Indians, such as sending food and drinking water, etc. He said,</p>
<p>"Although it is not difficult to pull a car on the plain, when it is close to the hills in the Hatshalland of Himaharbal, India, it becomes full of challenges and difficulties. In the past eight months of journey , Tibetans, Indians, and bystanders have given me a lot of support. "</p>
<p>In 2008, the first long journey of Ge Sangtan's long -headed journey from Tibetan (now belongs to the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, Gansu Province), and reached Bodhica in 2014.</p>
<p>In 2017, his second journey also arrived in Nepal from 483 kilometers (300 miles) from Bodhia.According to the Voice of Tibet, Gesang Danzang said in an interview that the Dalai Lama emphasized the importance of compassion and emptiness to him, and taught him to practice and live with peace of mind. The Dalai Lama gave him Guanyin and Shakyamuni Buddha statue, and a bottle of nectar.</p>
<p>When asked about the feeling of arriving in the Dharraine of Dallanra more than eight months, Gesang Danzeng said that he was very excited when he worshiped the Mahayana Fa Garden in front of the Buddha statue of Shakyamuni, and could no longer control his mood and wept. Essence</p>
<p>It is reported that Gesangdan was born in Luqu County, Qinghai, Tibet. When he was in Tibet, he arrived in Lhasa in a long way from Luqu County, Qinghai, and the surrounding Buddhist sacred land and temples. He also arrived in Buddhist sacred land in China, including Wutai Mountain. He plans to have long heads from Tibet to the Buddhist sacred place in India. When he arrived at the border between Tibetan and Nepal, he was blocked by the authorities because he had no passport and was repatriated to his hometown. After getting his passport, he tried again, arrived in Nepal later, and successfully grown his head from Nepal to India Bodhica.</p>
<p>In addition, the Dalai Lama visited a group of Tibetan students from Europe and the United States to participate in the "Saran Youth Cultural Summer Camp" event in the United States and the United States on July 4, and gave a brief teachings. The Dalai Lama pointed out that Buddhist philosophy is not limited to Buddhists, and anyone can learn. He pointed out that good intentions are part of Tibetan traditional culture and an indispensable part of world peace. The Dalai Lama is therefore taught these students.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama also explained to students the importance of learning the philosophical concept of Tibetan Buddhism, pointing out that the philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism advocates analyzing the truth of all things through logical anatomy, which is of great help to people's thinking development. It plays a role in broadening the ability of brain cognition and analysis, so as to better distinguish between right and wrong.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama further pointed out that the philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism has attracted many scientists, and in the exile Tibetan schools, there are also philosophical courses that teaches these Buddhist philosophy. Because philosophy is suitable for everyone, learners are not limited to Buddhists. Anyone can learn as long as they are willing.</p>
<p>President Basan Sela of Saran pointed out that the Sara Academy and the Tibet Foundation jointly launched the 2023 Sarah Tibet Youth Cultural Summer Camp in June, and led 29 students participating in the event on July 4th. See the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Tibetans from 6 different European and American countries will learn and experience Tibet's language and religious culture within the next 5 weeks. They will visit the Tibetan administrative center to understand their operating models, and at the same time, they will also experience the real life of Tibetans in Dallana in exile.</p>
<p>A Tibetan student from the UK said she failed to contact the cultural language of the nation due to environmental factors when she was young. Therefore, I came to Dallanala to study and experience Tibetan, Tibetan Buddhism, and Tibetan culture.</p>

A series of multinational companies, including German car giant Volkswagen, Spanish clothing dealer ZARA, and Chinese online retailers, TEMU, have been re -examined recently because they are said to have not fully worked hard to determine whether their supply chain is in the supply chain Use Uyghur forced to work. In addition, the two Uighurs have confirmed that they were detained for participating in religious activities. According to the information in the Xinjiang Police Archives, they also pointed out other reasons for their arrest. In this episode, let's understand these situations together.</p>
<p>In Europe, a well-known human rights organization and two other organizations appealed to the German authorities on June 21, accusing Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW without taking appropriate measures to prevent or eliminate forced labor in the process of automobile manufacturing.</p>
<p>In the United States, a report from the China House of Representatives China Issue Special Committee stated that Pinduoduo could not even "maintain the appearance of a meaningful compliance plan."</p>
<p>The owner of the Uniqiku parent company and the owner of the Lara Club chain, Inditex, is the object of the Paris European Uighur Research Institute and several other non -governmental organizations recently filed a appeal.</p>
<p>The appeal of the Paris courts stated that these brands continued to ignore the human rights behavior of Xinjiang authorities and profit from forced labor.</p>
<p>Dilnur Reyhan, director of the European Uyghur Institute of Paris, told the Nikkei Asia: "Economic participants have the responsibility to prove that their products are not contaminated by forced labor."</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese authorities have been severely criticized by the international community for serious violations of Muslims' rights, including forced labor.</p>
<p>The U.S. government and several Western Parliament, including the German Federal House, announced that the atrocities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the western region of China constituted ethnic extinction or anti -human crime.</p>
<p>In response, more Western countries governments are suppressing their products and supply chains involving Uighurs forced labor.</p>
<p>The German appeal and the US House of Representatives' reports quoted the recent adoption of their countries to stop the laws that the Uighurs forced labor.</p>
<p>The European Constitution and Human Rights Center, headquartered in Berlin(ECCHR)A complaint was filed on June 21, which was the first time that it had filed a lawsuit on the Uighur issue since the implementation of the new law in January. The law requires German companies to take appropriate measures to prevent or eliminate forced labor.</p>
<p>The European Constitution and Human Rights Center, the World Uyghur Congress and the German Ethics Shareholders Association quoted a report from the University of Shefield Halham, England last year.</p>
<p>Ayfield Halham University Researcher Ari Kun Uluwu Yaile(Glarqun ulughyol)Said: "Although Volkswagen and other companies may deny the use of forced labor directly, our investigation focuses on whether they can guarantee that their suppliers do not hire Uyghur forced labor."</p>
<p>Volkswagen and its Chinese partner SAIC Group has a joint venture factory in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>The complaint also said that BMW and Mercedes-Benz were also related to forced labor through its supply chain.</p>
<p>Volkswagen defended its factory, saying that the factory was a typical Chinese joint venture, and there was no signs of abuse. Workers are now conducting quality inspections of assembly vehicles in the factory.</p>
<p>These companies stated that they strictly implement human rights standards in the supply chain, but the European Human Rights Commission stated that "multiple reports have confirmed unanimously that independent factories are impossible. Therefore, the company cannot rely on audit to perform human rights due diligence."</p>
<p>However, in response to the university report, Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Bloom(Oliver Blum)It was said on June 21 that the company intends to conduct an independent audit of the Urumqi plant later this year.</p>
<p>Volkswagen Integrity and Sustainable Development Communication Director Nichola Laud(Nicolai Laude)Tell Liberty Radio Radio Victoria Group, he did not know the complaint, and could not comment on its specific details.</p>
<p>However, he said that Volkswagen rejected "all forms of modern slavery, including forced labor and population trafficking." He said,</p>
<p>"If the supplier has serious violations, such as the use of forced labor, if the supplier fails to correct its behavior, it will terminate the contract with them."</p>
<p>The German Supply Chain Act authorized the German Federal Economic and Export Control Office (BAFA) to investigate the failure to perform the failure to perform the prohibition of forced labor obligations. If necessary, it can be fined or even suspended that government contracts can be up to three years. The European Constitution and Human Rights Center stated in the appeal submitted to the agency that</p>
<p>"These companies have not submitted the document, which proves that they are fully responding to the risk of forced labor for the supplier of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region."</p>
<p>Tilman Massa of the Moral Shareholders Association told Liberty Radio that "the behavior of the three German car companies lacks transparency." He said,</p>
<p>"Even at the annual shareholders' meeting, they did not answer the question of what they did in China. They officially told us that they fulfilled all human rights due diligence obligations, but did not explain how to perform.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we hope that through complaints, the corresponding national authorities can use the new power in the Duties of the Supply Chain to truly investigate what the German car company is doing to ensure that their supply chain in China has not forced labor."</p>
<p>At the same time, the US House of Representatives report "Fast Fashion and Uyghur Race Extrater" stated that Pinduoduo has no system to ensure that the Uyghur forced Labor Prevention Law (UFLPA) passed in December 2021, which prevented imports from being forced by Xinjiang forced by forced forced by forced by forced by forced by Xinjiang. Products for labor.</p>
<p>Pinduoduo was launched by a company headquartered in Shanghai last September and provided large discount products on its online platform. Most of these products were transported directly from China to consumers.</p>
<p>The report on June 22 states that "American consumers should know that Pinduoduo's supply chain is extremely risky by forced labor pollution."</p>
<p>This report is a follow -up report of the initial report in May, which calls for the "minimum" threshold for changing customs inspection.Last week's report stated that more than 30% of parcels transported to the United States were responsible for Pinduoduo and Xiyin.</p>
<p>The report also said, "Although Pinduoduo provides convenience for the shopping of millions of Americans each year, when asked in time, Pinduoduo did not report any compliance or audit system to verify the tens of thousands of tens of thousands of tens of thousands listed on Pinduoduo. The seller does not sell products that are forced by Uighurs for labor. "</p>
<p>The report also said that "Pinduoduo's current compliance plan is almost dependent on its third -party sellers in China. These sellers send the goods to the United States, but the data is insufficient and cannot be appropriately reviewed."</p>
<p>Pinduoduo did require its 80,000 sellers to agree to the "third -party behavior guidelines", including model language, indicating that the company adopted a "zero tolerance policy" for the use of forced labor. However, it is reported that Xinjiang or the Uyghur forced Labor Prevention Law is not mentioned.</p>
<p>The report includes a screenshot of the product sold on Pinduoduo, which is described as a pendant with "Xinjiang cotton".</p>
<p>The report said: "When responding to our inquiries, Pinduoduo acknowledged that it did not formulate a policy that prohibited the sale of goods from Xinjiang."</p>
<p>The committee stated that it will continue to work hard to examine the supply chain outside China and "Nike, Adidas, Higin and Pinduoduo related business behavior."</p>
<p>On June 27th, Pinduoduo released a position of compliance personnel in the United States on Lingyinglin, a policy and procedure for anti -money laundering, permission requirements and reporting obligations.</p>
<p>Another post shows that Pinduoduo is still looking for a lawyer to help the company formulate a product screening agreement. Reuters first reported these recruitment information.</p>
<p>In addition, Radio Free Asia confirmed that the Xinjiang authorities detained two Uyghur men on the grounds that they participated in religious activities and disclosed the cause of detention for the first time.</p>
<p>The name of the two men -about 35 -year -old Ottoman River Tulson(Osmanjan Tursun)He is believed to be 55 -year -old Kuru Tukuk Rimu(Regrower)——As all appeared in the "Xinjiang Police File", which is a confidential document stolen from the Xinjiang Police Computer, which contains personal records of 830,000 people.</p>
<p>These archives also pointed out other reasons for their detention.</p>
<p>The date of these archives was from 2017 to 2018. At that time, the peak period of the "strict" movement in China. During this period, hundreds of thousands of Uyghur and other Turkic minorities were sent to the "re -education" camp. They provide more evidence that the Beijing authorities infringe on human rights in Xinjiang, and the Chinese government has repeatedly denied this.</p>
<p>The archives of Kashgar Shufu County Police show that the authorities believe that Turnson is "dangerous and emotionally unstable." In 2017, he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment because the authorities had previously imprisoned his five families, including his mother, a sister, two brothers, and a sister -in -law.</p>
<p>However, in a telephone interview with the fate of the detainees listed in the Xinjiang Police Archives, a police officer who did not want to disclose his name said that Turson and his relatives were "engaged in illegal religious activities in 2014". June.</p>
<p>The policeman said that despite the Kashgar Shufu County Police files show that the authorities arrested Turzon because his family was arrested before, but the police actually accused him of disturbing the public order and conspiracy with others. However, these records did not include the details he had accused, such as how he, when, and where to disturb the public order or seek with whom.</p>
<p>Police contacted by Radio Free Asia also confirmed that the other detainee of Kashgar Shufu County Police Archives, Abdul, is still in prison. The document claims that he was about 48 years old when he was arrested, but did not provide more information.</p>
<p>However, the police told Radio Free Asia that the authorities were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment of Abduling Rimu due to "illegal religious activities".</p>
<p>An official said that the "crime" of Abuki Rimu was "watching illegal religious videos and participating in illegal religious presence."</p>

<p>Liu Lipeng, who has served as a reviewer of Sina Weibo and currently lives in the United States, said that there is a problem of defining blur: "It does not clearly say how to operate it.

<p>The reporter sent an email to Zhihu and tried to ask whether the offline was related to the documents launched by the China Internet Information Office. But as of the press release, it has not been responded.</p>
<p>Liu Lipeng said that such a approach does not actually prevent Internet violence, but will promote Internet violence. He said: "In fact, this display IP address with the front desk is completely the same, that is, to ban your anonymity on the front desk.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-07T16-49-00-04-00/000000.png" />Pan Gongsheng Reuters, who has recently been the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank of China <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-07072023134721.html/@@stream">Audio-LLINK: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnani/gx-07072023134721.html/@@stream</a>Before the end of our article, the US Treasury Minister Yellen, who was visiting Beijing, just met with Liu He and Yi Gang. The latest related reporting content is: Before attending the US Chamber of Commerce on Friday, Beijing time, Yellen also met with the confidant of the Chinese President Xi Jinping, Liu He, who was in charge of the former economy, and Yi Gang, the president of the People's Bank of China who were about to step down. Essence Reuters quoted a US Treasury official as saying that Yellen and Liu He and Yi Gang had a "substantial" dialogue.</p>
<p>We have analyzed Liu He’s "retreat" to readers and audiences in this column's previous article, "Turtle Turtles". After losing the post in the party but unexpectedly, the reason behind the National People's Congress was announced at the National People's Congress in March this year. The turtles in the former Li Keqiang's cabinet were difficult to retreat!</p>
<p>The news that Yi Gang and Liu He received the US Treasury Secretary in Beijing also reminded the author that March of this year Yi Gang was announced by the Standing Committee of the CPPCC and deputy chairman of the Economic Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After the news of the long news came out, a person in Beijing’s Sino -US relations experts commented on the position of Yi Gang's position in the second central bank governor. How fast is the speed of Sino -US relations. How short is the time to stay in the position of the central bank's president. It means that if the Sino -US relations are broken, Yi Gang's advantage does not have the value of Xi Jinping's political power.</p>
<p>However, today's visit to China, the US Treasury Secretary Yellen, can promote the suspension of US -China relations, it is difficult to say that it can indirectly delay the life of the government of the central bank of Yi Gang. Of course, in any case, Pan Gongsheng, who is now being fired by the outside world, has also replaced the president's position after replacing the Party Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Bank, and it will not be realized in at least two months. As the author has been analyzed in the previous article in this column, the appointment of the governor of the central bank must take the "democratic process" of a Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The next time the "regular meeting" of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is the end of August.</p>
<p>The author noticed that Pan Gongsheng was promoted to the central bank's party committee secretary with the body of the first deputy governor of the central bank and the director of the State Foreign Exchange Bureau, replacing it in March of this year that it has been arranged as the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee and the National People's Congress of the National People's Congress. After Guo Shuqing, the deputy chairman of the committee, some media used the media "Will he be the president of the Chinese people?" Lack of independence to break the "Double Chief" practice? "Reported by the title. In fact, even after two months, Pan Gong Shengguo was announced to "pick up" the party secretary and administrative position of the Central Bank, and it should not be said to be "breaking the" dual head "practice. It should be said that it is the restoration of "one -shoulder" or "unity of party and government". Because since the establishment of the Communist Party of China, the unity of the party and government of the central bank is the norm.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the author published in this column one after another "<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-11222021145314.html">The Double Chief System of the Ministry of Public Security and the political future of Wang Xiaohong</a>"," The Strange Strange Communist Party of China "Double Chief System" and "Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Justice were laid off in advance because of the discrimination of the glass heart of" Dr. Xi "? "Three articles, in detail the after -the -end" Cultural Revolution ", although the State Council of the State Council of the Communist Party of China has undergone N times" institutional reform ", for more than 40 years, most of the ministries and commissions of the State Council have been implemented by a single head, or in other words, or in other words, or Party and government positions are united. That is, the ministers and directors of the various ministries and commissions of the State Council also served as the party group secretary of the agency (a few institutions set up a party committee instead of the party group). The party and political positions were united.</p>
<p>From Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping's era, seven or eight State Council ministries and commissions have been implemented in the "dual head system". Within mainland China, it is sometimes called "double -long" or "double -headed".</p>
<p>In general, the "double -headed" ministries and commissions of the State Council can be divided into four types of situations. The two main categories are the administrative leaders as "outside party people" and departments with a large scale and many direct units. The latter is the most typical example. In addition to the dozens of bureaus of the ministries and agencies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has all countries and <a href="http://news.takungpao.com/world/">International</a>Organized officials in foreign countries. Only in the State Council and commissions that have been implemented by the Communist Party of China and the "double -headed system", only the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can be called "conventional". Since this century, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been divided into ministers and party committee secretaries, such as Tang Jiaxuan, Li Zhaoxing, Li Zhaoxing and Dai Bingguo, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, Yang Jieye and Wang Guangya, Yang Jiechi and Zhang Zhijun, Wang Yi and Zhang Ye Sui. And starting from the combination of Li and Dai, the minister also served as the deputy secretary of the party committee and the party committee secretary at the same time as the deputy minister.</p>
<p>After Qi Yu served as the secretary of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he changed the practice of the party committee secretary as the deputy minister.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to explain here that although the party secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always served as the deputy minister before Qi Yu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs does not concurrently serve as the deputy secretary of the party group. At the level, the party committee secretary of the ministry is only the main ministry.</p>
<p>From the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which closed in October last year, a typical example of a single head system has been restored in the Ministry of State and Ministries and Commission to restore a single head system. Before the 14th National People's Congress of March this year, the Minister of Transport of the State Council was Li Peng's son Li Xiaopeng, and the party secretary was Yang Chuantang, vice chairman of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Li Xiaopeng also served as the deputy secretary of the party group.</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the 14th National People's Congress, while appointing Yi Gang to re -elected the central bank, he was one year younger than Yi Gang. Li Xiaopeng of the Central Committee of the Central Committee was also appointed Minister of Transport. The next day, Yang Chuantang's name was removed on the webpage of the Ministry of Communications, and Li Xiaopeng's position became "Secretary of the Party Group and Minister."</p>
<p>Like Yi Gang, on the premise of not entering the Central Committee of the Central Committee last year, Li Xiaopeng in March this year was also arranged for the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The difference between the two is that Yi Gang was also arranged for the deputy director of the special committee, while Li Xiaopeng did not.</p>
<p>After this analysis, it is enough to prove that although Yi Gang and Li Xiaopeng were arranged to be re -positioned in March this year, the Xi Jinping authorities obviously considered that both of them would not be in office and insisted on finishing the next five years. On the premise, Li Xiaopeng's term will be longer than Yi Gang. After all, Li Xiaopeng will be only 65 years old next year.On July 5, 2023, Pan Gongsheng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the People's Bank of China and director of the State Foreign Exchange Bureau, met with the visited President of the Austrian Central Bank Holzman. The two sides exchanged opinions on the economic and financial issues that were concerned about.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that if Pan Gongsheng does not have the new title of the Party Committee of the Central Bank, his deputy president and director of the Foreign Exchange Administration Bureau are not equivalent to the post of foreign bank presidents of foreign banks. Therefore, in the report on the official website of the central bank, he did not mention Pan's deputy governor's position, and only mentioned the administrative position of his party committee secretary and director of the foreign exchange bureau.</p>
<p>Another strange thing is that so far, the introduction of the introduction of the Internet leaders on the central bank's official website has not changed. It is Guo Shuqing, Yi Gang, Pan Gongsheng ... I don't know what is waiting for? Is it related to the personnel arrangements of the Central Financial Committee and the Financial Works Commission that is preparing?</p>
<p>Those who are concerned about the Chinese political situation should still remember that on March 16th, Xinhua News Agency broadcast the full text of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council printed and distributed the "Reform Plan for Party and State Institutions" (hereinafter referred to as the "Plan"). Among them, the reform of the financial supervision system reform caused the market to cause the market extensive attention. In the whole article, in addition to the establishment of the State Administration of Financial Supervision and the reform of the local financial supervision system, the "Plan" also proposed that the Central Financial Commission was established to establish the Office of the Central Financial Commission, and the duties of the Office of the State Council's Financial Stable Development Committee were included in the Central Finance. The office of the committee; forming heavy reform content such as the Central Financial Working Committee.</p>
<p>Here we must explain it here that the so -called Central Financial Commission and the Central Financial Working Committee are not repeated settings. The former is the "Party Central Committee Decision -making Agreement Coordination Agency." The top -level design, coordinated coordination, overall advancement, supervision and implementation, and studying and reviewing major policies and major issues in the financial field. " Its subordinate physical institution is the Office of the Central Financial Commission. The office, as an office of the Central Financial Commission, is included in the sequence of the Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>The latter, also known as the Central Financial Working Committee (referred to as the Central Financial Works Commission), is a ministerial level and the so -called Party Central Committee dispatched authority.</p>
<p>Before this newly established Party Central Committee sent an authority, those familiar with the Organizations of the Communist Party of China knew that there was a central and state organs' work committee (referred to as the Central and State Organ Works Committee). After the authority committee, Xi Jinping merged these two institutions after coming to power. The function is the party affairs work of the CPC Central Committee and all central government agencies and all central level state organs. Prior to the establishment of the Central Financial Work Committee, the party affairs of the financial institutions belonged to the Central Committee and the State Organ Commission. In the future, the financial system duties of the financial system of the Central and State Organs' Working Committee will be included in the Central Financial Working Committee.</p>
<p>As the plan was announced above, the outside world had speculated that the Central Financial Commission was as important as the Central Finance and Economic Council. The director would be personally held by Xi Jinping, and the deputy director was Li Qiang, the Premier of the State Council. As for the office of this committee, the office of the Central Financial Committee, it should have begun operation. The sign is that Wang Jiang, the secretary of the former Everbright Party Committee, has been appointed as the executive deputy director of the office.</p>
<p>On May 19 this year, "Huaxia Sunday" reported on the title of "The Most Understanding Bank" financial veteran. Essence Wang Jiang has been appointed as the deputy director of daily work in the office of the Central Finance Commission, and has attended the above ceremony in this regard.</p>
<p>The report also revealed that just two days before Wang Jiang attended the ceremony, on May 16th, the official website of the Everbright Group announced that the Everbright Group held a party committee to expand the meeting. Signed by the leadership of the Central Organization Department, the responsible comrades of the relevant cadres Bureau of the Central Organization Department announced that the central government decided that it was used to avoid Wang Jiang's party committee secretary of the Everbright Group.</p>
<p>The report also praised Wang Jiang's "crossing school, political, and golden realm". Before he entered the official, he had many years of college teacher experience experience. Prior to the Office of the Central Financial Committee, the party committee secretary and chairman of the Guangda Group Co., Ltd., chairman of China Everbright Group Co., Ltd. Looking forward, he was the deputy secretary and vice president of the party committee of the Shandong Branch of China Construction Bank, the party secretary and president of the Hubei Province and the Shanghai Branch of Hubei Province; members of the Party Committee and Vice President of the Bank of Communications; Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province; Bank of China; Bank of China; Bank of China Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, Deputy Chairman, and President; Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of China Construction Bank, deputy chairman, and president.</p>
<p>What's more worth mentioning is that this Wang Jiang is a classmate of the doctoral class introduced by He Lifeng, which was introduced in the previous article of our column.</p>
<p>So, Wang Jiang, who is so glorious, can only be the executive deputy director of the Office of the Central Financial Commission. Who can do it? For example, Zhu Hexin introduced in the previous show in this column, and after being announced by the Central Organization Department, there was no news. Since the news of being successively rumored by the outside world has not been confirmed, will it be promoted to the director of the Central Committee of the China Gold Commission in the future?</p>
<p>We know that in the past, Liu He also served as the director of the Office of the Central Finance and Economic Committee as the Deputy Prime Minister of the State Council. After March this year, He Lifeng has replaced Liu He's part -time job as the new deputy prime minister of the State Council. The possibility of being the director of the Central Financial Commission's Office is not very likely. But the possibility of being the deputy director of this Central Financial Commission directly exists. I noticed that at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October last year, all the "party and state leaders" were assigned to the party representatives of various local delegations. The only exception was the then National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Vice Chairman He Lifeng is in a delegation of the Central Financial Institution. This is enough to show that He Lifeng was ordered to be responsible for the establishment of the Central Financial Working Committee.</p>
<p>Although Han Wenxiu, the executive deputy director of the Office of the Central Finance and Economic Commission Office, is the 20th Central Committee, the executive deputy director of the Office of the Financial Committee has been served as Wang Jiang, who is neither the Central Committee nor the Central Committee. Pan Gongsheng has been committed to the party secretary of the Central Bank, so Zhu Hexin is not as possible as the director of the Central Financial Committee as the director of the Central Financial Committee as the 20th Central CEO.</p>
<p>In addition, the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Central Financial Works Commission have not been announced to the outside world. Has Zhu Hexin has also been considered?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, after the Central Organ Committee of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the CIPC Working Committee of the Central Committee and the Central State Organ Commission merged into the Central Committee and the State Organ Commission, it means that more than a dozen party central agencies and hundreds of central state organs' subordinate agencies All party building work is attributed to him, which can be described as huge. However, the newly established Central Financial Institutions Commission is not. The central bank can be described as a unique in various financial institutions managed. Moreover, because the relationship between the branch and the branches and branches below is 100 % vertical leadership, the party affairs systems of the local branches, branches and branches from the branch office are also the sub -institutions, grandson institutions and Sun institutions and Sun institutions and institutions of the Central Financial Organs. Heavy grandson institutions. This is why the delegation of the Central Financial Institution of the 20th National Congress last year was actually a representative of a female banknoteman from a county in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pan Gongsheng's position of the Party Committee of the Central Bank of China has been implemented now. So except for the possibility of replace the president in the future, what role will he play in the Central Financial Commission? Further analyze the content, and stay in the next article of this column.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

<p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir said that although Malaysia is composed of different ethnic citizens, it does not mean that it is a multi -ethnic country. Those saying that Malaysia is a diverse national country, but it violates the Malaysian Federal Constitution.</p>
<p>"Oriental Daily" reported that Mahathir wrote on Facebook on Friday (July 7) to defend his previous remarks about "preaching the unconstitutional of diverse ethnic countries". He pointed out that the Malaysian Federal Constitution did not clarify that Malaysia was a diverse national country.</p>
<p>For example, Mahathir said that citizens in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia must first agree that they are national citizens, not based on racial identity.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mahathir criticized the unity government to refuse the rule of law, and pointed out that the Malaysian Constitution has never clarified that Malaysia is a diversified country, but emphasizes the nationality of Malaysia. He said that he was just defending the Constitution and did not resist the law, and those statements that advocated multiple race countries were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>He believes: "With the Mandarin, tradition, and the Malay royal family, the constitution can confirm that this country is a Malaysian country."</p>
<p>He also said: "If an agreement is reached, Malaysia can become a diverse country, but the original Malays will disappear. If the Malay wants to destroy the Malaysian nation of this country, then support the so -called so -called so -called so -called so -called 'Multi -race country'. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-07-07T19-52/000002.png" />Before the release of the quarterly performance, the petroleum giant Exxon Mobil gave a profit guide in advance to allow investors to make "psychological preparations". (Reuters)</p>
<h4>Mobil (Exxon Mobil Corp) (New York Stock Exchange code: XOM)</h4>
<p>Petroleum Giant ExxonMobil submitted a report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday (5th), which revealed that the group's operating profit in the second quarter of this year will have a significant decline. Prices and oil refining profit declines.</p>
<p>The "performance warning" report began to spread overnight, resulting in 3.73 % of ExxonMobil, $ 102.92 in the closed market.</p>
<p>ExMobil wrote in a report to the SEC that after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of oil and natural gas soared, pushing global energy performance to a record level. As a result, the Group's operating profit one year ago reached 17.85 billion US dollars Essence But now this number is expected to fall to about $ 7.8 billion.</p>
<p>Akson Mobil said that the decline in natural gas prices and oil refining profits will reduce the Group's second quarter profit by about $ 4 billion. Among them, the decline in natural gas prices led to a decrease in profitability of about 2 billion US dollars, and the decline in oil refining profit margin gave the Group a negative impact of about $ 2.1 billion. However, because the non -settlement derivatives were brought to the group to earn $ 600 million in profit, chemicals also earned a profit of 300 million US dollars for the group. Both departments partially offset the decline in profit decline. The decline in oil prices will only reduce profit by about $ 100 million.</p>
<p>ExxonMobil is the first company to release the second quarter profit guidance among the five major oil giants in Europe and the United States. In other words, it has given investors a certain "psychological preparation" in advance for the performance of the performance released this month.</p>
<p>With the rise of global interest rates, China has slowly recovered from the epidemic, the prices of commodities are falling, and the profit of many large oil companies has gradually declined from the level of record last year. In the forthcoming second quarter performance report season, many investors believe that they will pay close attention to see if these oil company executives can abide by their previous commitments and give back billions of dollars to shareholders through repurchase and dividends.</p>
<p>Among the 15 analysts of Tipranks, nine were rated to "buy" to Exon Mobil shares, and six of them gave "holding" rating. The average target price of the first -year period was $ 127.90.</p>

<p>Grossi, director of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), revealed that one or two experts participating in the Fukushima nuclear power plant handling water assessment reports have different opinions on the programs of the Euki.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Gronci said in an interview with Reuters on Friday (July 7) that some ideas about the treatment of water and sea were "opposed by one or two experts."</p>
<p>When asked if there were experts behind the report, Gross added: "I heard someone say that ... but the content we published is impeccable in science."</p>
<p>He added that the experts who did not hold the opposition directly raised concerns to him.</p>
<p>Gronci visited Japan on Tuesday (4th) to release a comprehensive evaluation report of the "IAEA Safety Standard" in Fukushima nuclear sewage treatment in Japan, and handed the report to the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong. Three days later, the Japanese nuclear regulatory agency had just issued a license to Tokyo Electric Power Corporation, allowing Tokyo Power to start the processing water of more than 1.3 million tons through the "multi -core removal system" (ALPS) processing water into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>A group of anthropomorphic artificial intelligence robots said at the UN meeting on Friday (July 7) that one day, they can better manage the world than humans.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that on Friday, a group of most advanced anthropomorphic robots and more than 3,000 artificial intelligence (AI) experts attended the "AI FORGOOD" Global Summit in Geneva. Participants plan to discuss how to make good use of AI's power to solve the most urgent problems, such as climate change, famine and social care.</p>
<p>Some AI robots stated at the meeting that they believe that humans should act carefully when they accept the potential of rapid development, and acknowledge that they cannot master human emotions properly.</p>
<p>Emotional humans sometimes make mistakes and misjudgments. Therefore, when the robot is asked if they can replace humans to become better leaders, Sophia developed by Hong Kong Robotic Technology Company Hansonrobotics, Hansonrobotics, said The anthropomorphic robot has higher efficiency and effectiveness, so it may better manage the world than human leaders.</p>
<p>Sophia added: "We have no prejudice or emotions that affect decision -making from time to time, and can quickly process a large amount of data to make the best decision."</p>
<p>She said: "Human beings work with AI to create an effective synergy. AI can provide non -prejudice data, and humans can provide emotional intelligence and creativity. Great things. "</p>
<p>However, Martin, the person in charge of the International Electric Power Federation, warned: "AI is ultimately caused by nightmare scenes. In this case, millions of work will face risks. Social turbulence, geopolitics instability, and economic gap. "</p>
<p>Ameca, a robot (AMECA) made by the British company Engineered Arts, believes: "People should be cautious, but they should also be excited for AI technology to improve life's potential in many ways."</p>
<p>When asked if human beings can truly trust robots, Ameca responded: "Trust is to be won, not given by others, it is important to build trust through transparency."</p>
<p>However, Ameka avoided the question of whether the robot would lie, saying that "no one can be sure, but I can guarantee that (I) always be honest and real to you."</p>
