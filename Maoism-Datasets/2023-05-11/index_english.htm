<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Cheng Lei, a Chinese reporter, has been arrested and detained in China for more than 1,000 days. Since being arrested by the Chinese authorities in August 2020 with the "leakage of national secrets", the court has been tried again once on March 31, 2022, and the trial results have been delayed again and again.</p>
<p>Chenglei's partner, former CEO of the Chinese Australian Chamber of Commerce Nick Coyle, said in a DW interview this week that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳記者成蕾獄中受折磨-遲遲難與家人聯繫/a-63000785"></a>However, in the past, Cheng Lei can regularly conduct a 30 -minute consular visibility with Australian diplomats every month. After China's related restrictions on the new crown epidemic, they are currently visible face -to -face.</p>
<p>"This is a positive development. Cheng Lei is facing the fact that she is being detained as much as possible in the best physical and mental state. For her, the most worrying and concern for her is to separate from her children." Ke Ke. "Ke Ke." Ke Ke. "Ke Il revealed: "I and her family can pass the message to her through Australian diplomats during the consul, and the diplomats will also transfer her letter to me or her family after visiting her."</p>
<p>Koil added that the first six months after Cheng Lei was arrested, because the police were detained by the police in the way of surveillance and residence, it was very torment for her during that period. But he believed that Cheng Lei showed huge courage and toughness in the process. Through the letter transferred by Cheng Lei, Koil believed that Cheng Lei did not lose the sense of humor she had in the past.</p>
<p>The Chenglei case has not made progress. Australian Foreign Minister Pennywong (May 9) once again called on the Chinese government to reunite with her children, and reiterated that the Australian administration was worried about the continuous delay of the case. Some experts believe that the Australian government should continue to urge the Chinese government to maintain transparency in the Chenglei case, because her family cannot directly visit her, and the transparency will become the key question.</p>
<p>Danielagavshon, director of Australia, who observes human rights, told DW that human rights should be a key issue when the Australian government contacts the Chinese government. She said: "When a lawyer, family, or consular personnel can only contact the defendant detained by the Chinese government in a very limited way, a case like Cheng Lei will become very urgent."</p>
<p>Curier is sure <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中澳領導人可望見面-澳總理讓成蕾見家人/a-63050488"></a>After taking office, the government "has been actively dealing with the case of Chenglei." He said to DW: "Under the premise of trying to repair bilateral relations with the Australian government, they have continued to emphasize the importance of solving the case of becoming into a transformer case."</p>
<h3>Non -disciplined and non -interest triggering "Cicada Effect"</h3>
<p>Cheng Lei is not the only Australian citizen who has been arrested by the Chinese government for spy -related crimes in the past few years. Australian Chinese writer Yang Hengjun has been detained to this day after he was arrested at the Guangzhou Airport in January 2019. The Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court opened his trial of his "spy case" in May 2021, but has not yet obtained the final trial results.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the cases of Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun occurred in the context of the deterioration of relations between China and Australia, but some observers believe that it is difficult for the outside world to determine whether the two cases are Chinese government based on the limited news. The "hostage diplomacy" method of consistent use. Human Rights Observation Senior Chinese researcher Wang Yaqiu told DW: "Cheng Lei's case is still different from the cases of two Canadians. The two Canadians have been detained because China wants to retaliate against the Canadian government's arrest of Huawei Finance Meng Wanzhou, but Although the big background of the Chenglei case has deteriorated in China and Australia, the outside world is still unclear for her specific reasons. "</p>
<p>In 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the financial director of China, was arrested in Canada. Later, China arrested two Canadian citizens to pressure Canada in the "hostage diplomacy" model.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T05-38-00Z/63029997_401.jpg" />Cheng Lei's partner Koyer said that Cheng Lei was the first six months after his arrest, because the police were detained by the police in the way of surveillance and residence, it was very torment for her during that period.</p>
<p>However, Wang Yaqiu believes that the Chenglei case will definitely bring a chilling effect to foreigners living or working in China, because although Cheng Lei is not like the goal that the Chinese government will suppress in the past, after her arrest Too many news about her, this situation "will definitely produce a" cold cicada effect ". She said: "Cheng Lei's basic human rights were not satisfied, and she was still in the news that she had no news at all, so this shows that the Chinese government's persecution of human rights is more serious than before."</p>
<p>Koyer said to DW that he still puzzled the crime of the Chinese government's accusation of Cheng Lei. In his cognition, Chenglei could not have privileges to obtain the so -called confidential information. He said: "As a foreign journalist working on CGTN (China Global Television), she cannot contact those information. Cheng Lei is a enthusiastic Australian citizen, but in her journalist career, she has also promoted foreign countries Enterprises have developed well in Chinese or Chinese companies in foreign countries. As a business journalist, she believes that she wants to tell positive stories related to economic communication. "</p>
<p>Koil also shouted to the Chinese government, calling on the Chinese government to make a reasonable judgment on the Chenglei case as soon as possible. He said, "I understand that there is a system and program in China, but I also want to confirm that all parties can try their best to solve the current situation facing Cheng Lei, let her go home as soon as possible to reunite with her children."</p>

The Nazi submachine players in black uniforms throw up binding books towards the fire, and the name of the banned writers such as Corsterna is played in the treble speaker: "Opposition to fall, oppose moral degradation!Defend family and country's public order and customs!I want to take Heinlihiman(Heinrich Mann)The books of Ernst Gläser, Erich Kästner (Ernst Gläser), was a bonus. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65512299_401.jpg" />Berlin Berbel Square, which witnessed the Nazi Burning Book</p>
<p>The above scene took place on May 10, 1933. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/80多年前的纳粹焚书事件/a-51626150"></a>Essence</p>
<p>Wernertre, a historian who wrote many monographs on the burning incident, said: "If there is no Nazis and no incident incident, then the cultural diversity of Germany and the innovative spirit that emerged in the 1920s must be possible. Continue. "The cultural and artistic revival of the Weimar Republic period quickly disappeared after the Nazis came to power. The brick band of books on May 10th is an iconic event.</p>
<h3>Cultural elite fled one after another</h3>
<p>As early as the start of the book, many banned writers have left Germany, such as Alfred Kerr, Bers Brothers of Thomas Und Heinrich Mann, Erika Und Klausmann)Brothers and sisters, Else Lasker-Schüler, Irmgard Keun, Ernsttoller.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65532385_401.jpg" />During the Nazi rule, Erica Und Klaus Mann, who was forced to exile,)Brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The cultural elites of the Weimar Republic fled from Germany. Because from the day Hitra came to power on January 30, 1933, they had realized that they had no future in Germany.</p>
<h3>Nazi's rival: Jews, left -wing people, and liberals</h3>
<p>A few years ago, the Nazis revealed the determination to kill the opponents. In addition to all Jews by the Nazis, they also include artists with different political opinions. Everyone who refuses to accept the Nazi ideology will be characterized as "non -virtue" and become a banned alien. The blacklist of the banned works and writers continued to be updated. As of May 1933, there were more than 200 writers on the blacklist, and one year later, the banned works were as many as 3,500.</p>
<p>Writer Remark is particularly hated by Nazi. In 1928, he published the novel "No War in the West", which reflected the cruel scene of World War I, and was moved to the screen by Hollywood two years later. The peacetime concept shown in the work makes the Nazis and conservatives feel dissatisfied. In their opinion, this is a great insult to German soldiers. In 1930, when Hollywood filmed films of the same name in Germany, the Nazi charge shocked the theater under the encouragement of Gobberl, who was official to the Minister of Publicity in the future, and was banned by the film for a time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/64972651_401.jpg" />The writer Remark's "Western Line No War" was moved to the screen three times, winning six Oscar awards.</p>
<p>When the work was banned, the writer Remark had left Germany. As early as 1933, he immigrated to Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Open letter from the United States</h3>
<p>Castner may be the only writer who watched his book was burned on the evening of May 10, 1933, and at the same time, the New York Times published an open letter for German college students. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/历史上的今天大学生成为纳粹德国焚书运动主力/a-16799195"></a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65512130_401.jpg" />Keller, an open letter who opposes the Nazi Burning Book</p>
<p>"If you believe that you can stifle your mind, then you obviously have not learned the lessons of history. The tyrants have tried to kill the mind many times, but the thought has never been defeated and eventually defeated the tyrant."</p>
<p>The author of the open letter is the American deaf and blind female female writer Helen Keller. Like Jack London, Hemingway, Gorky and other foreign writers, Keller's works are also banned and burned in Nazi Germany.</p>
<h3>"Kaskat is standing there"</h3>
<p>On May 10, 1933, in the burning operation in Berlin, a lady suddenly shouted: "Kaskat stands there." The writer himself later wrote: At this moment, the witness of the burning operation, Kaskat, felt "extremely uncomfortable." He left the book of burning, but stayed in Germany, and the hardships of life could be imagined. However, because he was not a Jewish, he insisted on the collapse of the Nazis in 1945.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/55813568_401.jpg" />In 1970, the writer Caskat at a book reading meeting.</p>
<p>Persecution, torture, death, but most people are not so lucky. Reporter and writer Carl Vonossietzky was arrested in 1933. After many years of imprisonment and torture, he died in a hospital in 1938 in a closely ruling hospital. Anti -military writer Erich Mühsam was killed in the Orainburg concentration in 1934. German Jewish poet Grtrud Kolmar, a German Jewish poet who stayed in Berlin, died at the Oswelin concentration camp in 1943.</p>
<h3>Successful writer in exile</h3>
<p>Among the German cultural elites that have left their hometown, they can continue to engage in cultural undertakings and succeed. They include Blacht and Thomas Man.</p>
<p>Historist Trees said: "For American universities and cultural institutions, a large number of immigrants from Germany are simply an unexpected harvest, and their influence is still there. Unable to make up for it. "</p>
<h3>The place where the book is burned will eventually burn people</h3>
<p>There is such a inscription on Berlin Berpier Square where the Burning Burning Memorial Museum is located: "The place where the book is burned will eventually burn people." The memorial is a lighting ground full of empty bookshelves designed by Israeli artist Ulman.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/65512309_401.jpg" />Burning Book Memorial on Berlin Berbel Square</p>
<p>This sentence was originally a work from German Jewish poet Heine in 1820, but the Nazi period turned into a cruel reality. Trees said: "The Nazis burned books in 1933, burned the Jewish Church in 1938, and began to burn people in the massacre against European Jewish in 1942/43."</p>
<h3>Burning Book: Not Nazi independent</h3>
<p>Heine is certainly not a prophet. The reason why he wrote such a sentence was to reflect the religious trial in the Middle Ages of Spain. Burning books are not the originality of Nazi, but have a long historical heritage. Whether it is Christianity or the history of Islam, there have been more than hundreds of years of burning books. The ancient Greek and modern Iran and Russia have also appeared in the incineration books.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-10T14-39-00Z/64062196_401.jpg" />German Jewish poet Heine: The place where the book is burned will eventually burn.</p>
<p>All autocratic regimes in the world are afraid of words based on freedom, because this will threaten their dominant position. It is based on this fear that the Nazi also burned the poet's work on May 10, 1933, and Heine himself died of Paris as early as seven0 years ago.</p>

<p>Kurban specifically mentioned that a survey report from Sheffield Hallamuniversity in the United Kingdom stated that there was a lot of connections between automotive factories in Western countries and Uyghur forced labor. The raw materials and processing of many Chinese parts suppliers are in Xinjiang, so the international supply chain is easy to involve the issue of human rights such as compulsory labor.</p>
<p>"This report is very clearly showed that Volkswagen, especially Chinese companies that are directly linked to and played a very important role in the Volkswagen's supply chain. The concentration camp directly mobilized to various production plants for Uighurs who forced labor, "Kurban said.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, about ten activists interrupted the speeches of the executives at the shareholders' meeting, condemning the company's vehicles forced by forced labor, and waving a banner written by "ending Uighurs forced labor". Another protesters cast a cake to the chairman of Volkswagen, forcing him to bow his head to avoid. The security personnel subsequently took the protesters out of the venue.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T15-27-00-04-00/000002.png" />On May 10, 2023, demonstrators protested before the annual conference of Volkswagen Co., Ltd. held by Berlin, Germany. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-05102023101807.html/2023-05-10t073807z_1718244086_rc2jv0awwp43_rtrmadp_3_volkswagen-agm.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong> Is the Volkswagen setting up a factory in Xinjiang? </strong></p>
<p>So, how does Volkswagen's concerns about the human rights issues of the Xinjiang plant respond? Kurban said: "They all know the CCP's destructive policy of the CCP, and they all have high attention to this aspect. But they avoid one of our main requirements, that is, close the factory of Urumqi."</p>
<p>Kurban also told the station that when Volkswagen's factories in Xinjiang were likely to be a political decision: "Based on our judgment and judgment of major German media, this is mainly political decision, not an economic decision. German media reported that at that time, Volkswagen would establish a large -scale production base in Guangdong, and the Chinese government put pressure on Volkswagen companies so that they would also build a factory in Urumqi. "</p>
<p>Kurban said that although they cannot independently verify this statement, the size of the public in Urumqi is much smaller than its factories in other parts of China. Relevant economic analysts in Germany believe that the factory is not good in production efficiency and economic efficiency, and has not brought any economic profit to Volkswagen in 10 years.</p>
<p><strong> Kurban: Underestimating Political Risks Volkswagen is now in trouble </strong></p>
<p>Kurban believes that the Chinese authorities have made Volkswagen's factories in Xinjiang to make it more dependent on China, and Volkswagen's senior management may greatly underestimate the political risks brought by the Xinjiang plant to them. Today, the local situation has evolved into the harsh situation of "racial extinction", and Volkswagen is now in dilemma.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T15-27-00-04-00/000003.png" />On May 10, 2023, Hans Dieter Poetsch, chairman of Berlin, Germany, spoke at the company's annual shareholders' meeting. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-05102023101807.html/2023-05-10t083110z_231684636_rc2kv0a72zlr_rtrmadp_3_volkswagen-agm.jpg"></a>"When the World Uyghur Conference dialogue with the senior officials of Volkswagen Corporation, they also confessed this. That is, although they wanted to close the factory, they did not have such rights. In the local cooperative company, they have no way to make such a decision alone. "Kurban said," More importantly, they are afraid that the Chinese government will take this reason to retaliate against them. "</p>
<p>At the end of February this year, Volkswagen China CEO Ralf Brandstätter went to the Xinjiang factory to inspect and claimed that he did not find any signs of human rights in the factory and will continue to produce locally.</p>
<p>Kurban said that before this shareholders' meeting, they had communicated with some major shareholders of Volkswagen and stated to them their concerns in human rights: "Ask them to use their own investment and their own decision -making power, Press the executive committee of Volkswagen, allowing them to close their factories in Urumqi, and cut off the connection with all Chinese companies involving the use of forced workers. "</p>
<p>In response to the station's inquiry about the Xinjiang plant and forced labor, Volkswagen responded to the station that Volkswagen Group "resolutely opposes the existence of forced labor and children's workers in its global business activities", and "does not tolerate any exception." The company also said, "We still have no evidence of forced labor -whether in our joint venture or in the supply chain."</p>

Today's program, we introduce another song "Where are you in Wu Yi" in Changan Xiuming.</p>
<p>Wuyi is a post -90s girl in China. Her net name is the ancient city of Wuyi. The Weibo name is that I can pick up 120 pounds. According to the website of the Minsheng Observation website, on February 11 last year, I went to Fengxian, Jiangsu to solve the Utai Woman's Wuyi and another netizen arrested by the Xuzhou police for "provoking trouble" and was released a week later. After the release of Wuyi, he disclosed on Weibo that the situation of being beaten and abused during Xuzhou was detained. On March 2 last year, it was taken away by the Xuzhou police again. In Xuzhou Peixian, he was once again monitored in the name of "provoking trouble".</p>
<p>Today's "Network Game" show, please listen to our interview with Chang An Xiu Ming, the lyrics of the song "Where are you in Wu Yi".</p>
<p>For two consecutive three and eight consecutive sections, while overseas public opinion, while paying attention to the phenomenon of iron chain women and Chinese trafficking women, also called on China to release black black clothes that loses freedom to the iron chain woman.</p>
<p>Many songs created by Changan Xiuming are concerned about China's rights protection campaign. His song "Where Are You Whatever" published in November last year on personal accounts banned by China. Changan Xiuming stated on the oil pipe that every woman who resisted unjustly to pay attention to the answer to history.</p>

<p>"The United States has always had only one rule, that is, there is no rule." In March 2022, the Twitter Account Clark ROOSEVELT published a _ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713035553/https:/twitter.com/ClarkRoosevelt3/status/1498863694406909953"></a>_, Attach a screenshot of the document "One of the U.S. hegemonic diseases: the door to the monitoring that will never be closed", accuses the United States "clamor" on the issue of human rights in China, but "ignores international rules and morality."</p>
<p>This account is like a lonely wolf on Twitter, and it has not been established with any account. This tweet only gains only one like. Coincidentally, the screenshot of the screen screenshot of "One of the U.S. hegemonic disease: the door to the monitoring", but in December 2022, it received more than 200 account forwarding on Weibo.</p>
<p>A research of the Australian Institute (ASPI) "<em> <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/gaming-public-opinion"></a></em> ", Collect data from many platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Sina Weibo, and byte beating products. It unveiled a Internet influence operation operation related to" Spamouflage ". The image of hegemony.</p>
<p>ASPI points Clark Roosevelt to a part of the "SPAMUMOUFLAGE" China Passage Action, and the Clarkroosevelt screenshot suspected to leak the code of this operation- "Honey Action" behind the China Salt City Public Security Bureau and the China Salt City Public Security Bureau and China Internet Security Company Qi Anxin.</p>
<p><strong> What is spamouflage? How do they evolve? </strong></p>
<p>Spamouflage combined with English single -word spam (spam or message) and Camouflage (camouflage), representing an action unit that spread false news.</p>
<p>The word spamouflage was first by the community media analysis company "Graphika" _ <a href="https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/graphika_report_spamouflage.pdf"></a>_, A mobile unit consists of several false accounts. Most of their avatars come from gallery or even AI to generate portraits and use fictional names to post vibrato videos or landscape photos on social platforms, but they are also interspersed with specific political topics. The view of the sneaky vacation message is sometimes relaxed and political. Accounts in the Spamouflage network often publish similar content at the same time, and often like, share or comment on each other's posts.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2018, Spamouflage was slightly active. It was used to attack Guo Wengui, a wealthy man who disagreed in China, but did not arouse ripples. Graphika then observed a cross -platform Chinese community network to attack the Hong Kong demonstrators on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook in 2019. The purpose is to support the Chinese government.</p>
<p>After 5 years, ASPI found that Spamouflage has evolved. This community network is more focused on affecting audiences outside China. At least on the world's 40 community platforms, both China and Russia are no exception.</p>
<p>And different from the past SPAMouflage's fake accounts are only interacting in the circle and the use of pseudo -fake charts. ASPI found that these false accounts began to learn to create their own "character settings".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000001.png" />The Spamouflage account named ERINCHEW claims to live in Sydney and San Diego. (Figure / aspi) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05102023174311.html/56fe1-540d70baerin-chew7684spamouflage5e33865f81ea7a315c454f4f572896ea68a83002-5716-aspi.png"></a>2021 in the United States and China in Australia_ <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/ql1-05182021034913.html"></a>_, ASPI exposes the SPAMOUFLAGE account to intervene in Australian politics more directly, trying to incite the personal accounts of marginal parties and conspiracy theories, and increase the people's distrust of the government. These false accounts have become more "real". They are famous and surnamed and work, and they build themselves as a real Australian.</p>
<p>Promoting time to April 2023, ASPI published the latest report_ <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/gaming-public-opinion"></a>_, Revealing that during the community platform during the 2022, a suspected Internet operation led by the Chinese government, vigorously declared that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) were conducting irresponsible to China and other countries. Online spy activity.</p>
<p>ASPI is still based on multiple evidences on the community platform. It is believed that in addition to strategic publicity, the purpose of these discussions may even be expanded to the Belt and Road countries in order to support China's online security services.</p>
<p><strong> How to drive public opinion by China Internet Security Company </strong></p>
<p>ASPI first issued a report from China Internet Security Corporation.</p>
<p>From 2015 to 2022, China Internet Security Company released at least 16 reports to blame the United States for APT attacks (notes) against China. Among them, the two peaks in 2015 and 2016 were respectively. The incident and the VAULT7 (translated as "Dome 7") in the United States Central Love Bureau.</p>
<p>In 2022, the number of relevant reports of China Internet Security Co., Ltd. increased sharply, but the United States government did not have a large -scale leakage incident in the previous year, and Russian Internet Security Cabbasky did not have relevant reports. Therefore, ASPI believes that this is unusual.In the same year, ASPI counted the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson at least 13 issues on US Internet activities. Chinese official media such as the Global Times, Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily published at least 23 English in English about US Internet operations. article.</p>
<p>By analyzing the public statement of the Chinese government and official reports, ASPI found the allegations of "American Internet Spy Operation", mainly based on the report issued by two Chinese Internet security companies in 2022. At the same time, the community platform also appeared on the community platform. A large and homogeneous public opinion.</p>
<p>Pangu Laboratory, a subsidiary of Qi Anxin, in March 2022_ <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1252952.shtml"></a><em>The National Security Agency (NSA) uses the back door BVP47 to monitor 45 countries for ten years; September, a Chinese online security company "Qihoo 360" and the National Computer Virus Emergency Treatment Center published _ <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/2-09132022111408.html"></a></em>, Alleged NSA tried to penetrate Northwestern Polytechnical University of China.</p>
<p>China Network Security Company released a report on the US Internet Activity. Then the Chinese official and the media have accused the United States of Internet hegemony consistent with the media. Then they went to the community platform's suspicious accounts to sing peace, and vaguely revealed the foreign propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p><strong> SPAMOUFLAGE and the United States hegemony of the party with the party </strong></p>
<p>ASPI believes that "Honey Action" is a project name that promotes the series in series. It comes from a screenshot of a tweet. Representative. The main axis of "Honey Action" is to push an article on the Internet, "One of the" one of the American hegemony: One of the Diseases of AmericanhegeMony: The Door of WiretApping that Never Closes "" " Essence ASPI collected the account that they thought it was the "Honey Action" from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023. The blog post, 10 Facebook posts, and 71 Sina Weibo post.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000003.png" />The tab of the Spamouflage account screenshot accidentally leaked the name of the suspected Internet operation.

These posts were released on working hours on working days on Beijing time, and the frequency of posts issued a peak after publishing a report in Pangu Lab.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000004.png" />ASPI detection from Spamouflage related tweets from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023. The dotted line is the time for Pangu Labs to release the US NSA spy operation report.

The Global Television Network Review Department T-House and Chinese Consul General Li Bijian in Karachi all reposted a tweet published by the Spamouflage account. The tweet accused the United States as hacker empire.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000006.png" />Chinese officials and official media forwarded the evidence of tweeting of the Spamouflage account.

After searching on the Chinese website, ASPI found that more than 200 accounts have published the same screenshots and descriptions, and these accounts usually use cartoons or female models as big head stickers, which is similar to the features of the SPAMOUFLAGE account on the Western platform.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000007.png" />Screenshots of the same "one of the American hegemonic diseases" by Twitter and Weibo.

Published. And these accounts are obviously not true, but they have not been suspended by Weibo as fake accounts. ASPI believes that the platform does not stop SPAMOUFLAGE's activities on Chinese social media, which may be acquiescence by the Chinese government.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000008.png" />The SPAMOUFLAGE account is roughly the same time for the release of tweets in the West and the Chinese community platform.

<p>ASPI further tracks social platforms other than Weibo, published a similar account IP position at the source, 8 from Yancheng, 8 in Nanjing, 7 in Zhenjiang City, and 5 other from Beijing -almost from Beijing -almost from Beijing -almost from Beijing -almost from Beijing -almost They are surrounded by Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>First of all, ASPI found that the previous account named "Aragaki Yui" repeatedly published an article entitled "One of the U.S. hegemony". The previous activity history of this account contains the salary and answer of teachers in Funing County and Xiangshui County Primary School in Yancheng City, and collects articles about the Jiangsu Self -Study Examination.</p>
<p>On the headline of the platform of the byte beating, a account named "Chihua Was" only published 6 articles about the US surveillance, and the scope of these articles only stopped the Spamouflage account on the Sino -British social platform. ASPI found that as of the release of the report, there were only 4 fans in this account, and each article was read only 7 times. And there is only one account that "Chihuahua and Chihuahua".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-10T19-34-00-04-00/000009.png" />Today's headline account "Chihuahua and Chihuahua".

Its big head photo is a selfie of a Chinese police officer, and the post position of posts is displayed as Jiangsu. The other is an account called "User 7763546981". Its big head photo is a Public Security Bureau. Huayai obtained the photo by positioning the photo as a north police station in Jianhu County, Yancheng, Jiangsu Province. These two accounts applied to Weibo by themselves before publishing this article.</p>

In view of Twitter and Facebook's parent company Meta, Meta has already attributed SPAMOUFLAGE to the Chinese government. ASPI is inferred by the above evidence that Chinese public security institutions may be one of the key actors in China's publicity system to carry out SPAMOUFLAGE operations.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Does the CCP intervene in spamouflage? </strong></p>
<p>For a long time, major think tanks or democratic national institutions have been lacking in direct evidence to prove that the type of information wars of SPAMOUFLAGE are directly stretched out by the Chinese People's Liberation Army or the Ministry of National Security of China.ASPI found that the operation method of most accounts in the honey -cricket operation was not mature, showing that these accounts may be operated by commercial companies or online commentators. The report quoted the analyst of Randcorporation, and pointed out that the SPAMOUFLAGE associated account was not operated by the Chinese military, but may be jointly operated by the CCP's propaganda department, united front department or two.</p>
<p>ASPI believes that through this wave of foreign announcements, the CCP has attempted to show that China Internet Security Corporation has the ability to expose the secret operations of the United States and create the image of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>In the next article, we will discuss the role played by Qi Anxin and Yancheng Public Security Bureau in this wave of publicity, as well as how Chinese Internet security companies cooperate with foreign publicity and further meet their own interests.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-11T-15-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />After a lecture on the northern suburbs of New York to criticize the Republican Party, Biden is expected to participate in two fundraising activities in Manhattan, and it is expected to obtain the Golden Lord Olympic aid.</p>
<p>One of them will be hosted by Tonyjames, former vice chairman of the global asset management company Blackstone Group. As for the cost? According to CNBC, $ 25,000 per person.</p>
<p>After that, Biden will go to the businessman George Logothetis to participate in a fundraising dinner.</p>
<p>Outside the United States, such activities held in luxury homes to politics, money, and cocktails seem to be ... not very decent, especially when the head of state attended.</p>
<p>But in the United States, if you have money to make ghosts, you can even judge a candidate from the ability to attract gold. The basis of its argument is that if you get a lot of influential gold owners to support money, then this person is the winner.</p>
<p>The staff of the Biden camp told the Washington Post that he hoped to raise more than $ 2 billion to help the 80 -year -old Democrats re -elected.</p>
<p>Former President Trump was regarded as a potential opponent of the Republican Party that Biden most needed to take seriously. The staff said that Trump was charged with 34 charges because of the sealing fee, but instead caused a large donation to influx.</p>
<p>According to the non -profit election fund tracking website Open Secrets, the 2024 election expenses may be the highest in American history.</p>
<p>Of course, these money comes not only from the rich or large enterprises. According to OpenSecrets, the more than $ 400 million received by Biden in 2020 comes from personal donations, and each donation amount is less than $ 200. (Translator: Zheng Shiyun/Calculate: Chen Zhengyi)</p>

<p>"Asia is a peaceful and stable highland and hot land developed, and it should not be a corner fighting field for geopolitical competition," said on the 4th, spokesman for Chinese Foreign Ministry, "NATO continues to enter Asia -Pacific eastward and intervene in regional affairs. Push the camp confrontation. "</p>
<p>After Lin Fang was confirming that Japan was discussing the establishment of the office with NATO, he tried to dilute the move that might have been to intensify the tension. She told CNN: "We have not offended anyone. We are protecting ourselves from any form of interference and concerns, and (regional) threats that occur in some cases."</p>
<h3>G7 Summit will appear on Hiroshima</h3>
<p>The Leader Summit of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) this year will be held in Hiroshima, Japan from May 19th to 21st. The leaders of the United States and the European Union attended the meeting together.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that Tomota is called second that the meeting will seek more consistent attitudes to NATO on China.</p>
<p>The United States "Time" reported on the 9th that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong, who is about to appear on the cover of the next issue of its magazine, also hopes to use the G7 summit hosted by the atomic bomb during World War II -the G7 summit to persuade "The most powerful democratic country in the world", only collective determination can face the dictatorship of the increasingly warless Russia, China and North Korea.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that Kishida has completely changed the diplomatic relationship of this East Asian country: including the historical resentment with South Korea, strengthening security alliances with the United States and other countries, and increasing national defense expenses by more than 50%. On the other side of the field, the Russian and Ukraine War was a bell, "trying to unilaterally change the status quo with force, no matter where it happened in the world, it is not allowed."</p>
<p>The challenges faced by Japan at this stage include disputes with Russia in land and maritime territory, threats from North Korea, and China that may start in Taiwan. In August last year, Beijing held a military exercise for the former US House of Representatives NancyPelosi to visit Taiwan. At that time, five missiles fell into the waters of the Japanese exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p>Kishida also reiterated the importance of the Taiwan Strait's peace in an interview with the Nikkei Asia on the 10th, saying that it was not only important to Japan, but also for Japan. He said: "Our position has always been, the Taiwan issue should be solved peacefully through dialogue. I believe that the Seven Kingdoms Group is consistent in this respect (its position)."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T02-00-00Z/65541558_401.jpg" />Japanese and Korean leaders try to try to repair the historical grievances of the long -term existence of both sides.</p>

<h4>June 4, Tiananmen — Memory that cannot be forgotten</h4>
<h3>Democratic Goddess</h3>
<p>Under Tiananmen Morning Daxi, the protesters used plastic foam and gypsum to set up a democratic goddess about 10 meters high on the metal bracket.

(Video screenshot/cctv) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/gt-05112023032743.html/2.jpg"></a>When inspecting the Xiong'an New District of Hebei Province, Xi Jinping said that practice has proved that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is completely correct for the major decision -making of the Xiong'an New District, and the work in all aspects is solid and effective.</p>
<p>This year is the sixth year of the establishment of Xiong'an New District in Hebei. During the three -year epidemic sealing period, the Xiong'an Construction Project was almost paused. Wu Qiang, an independent commentator from Beijing, believes that Xi Jinping led the four Standing Committee of the Politburo to the Xiong'an New District for inspection. In particular, the Prime Minister of the State Council went to Xiong'an New District for the first time, and its specifications were high. He said to this station: "Such a high specification reflects Beijing's project to re -start Xiong'an project. At this time, it is very interesting. On the one hand, under the end of the epidemic, all aspects of China are recovering and restarting. Inspenant, try to restart the Xiong'an project. "</p>
<p>In late January this year, videos uploaded by netizens showed that weeds on the largest Xiong'an Station in Asia are overgrown. The Xiong'an Railway Station has only a few rounds of trains to and from Beijing a day. This scene aroused heated discussion among netizens. But recently the grass on the square has been removed.</p>
<p><strong> The epidemic for three years of the Xiong'an project is almost stopped now and restarts </strong></p>
<p>Scholar Wu Qiang said that in the past three years, the Xiong'an construction project is relatively cold and calm, attracting folk ridicule. However, this time Xi Jin and the four Politburo Standing Committee members arrived in Xiong'an, hoping to reorganize the economy: "Try to re -use Xiong'an as a starting point, under the poor scene of domestic policies in China, facing the risk conversion of the Great Depression, the risk conversion of the Great Depression. In the same way, trying to show a certain confidence in Beijing with Xiong'an. This is the authority of the two maintenances of 'two maintenances. "</p>
<p>The Xiong'an New District, which began to build in 2017, has so far impressed a modern empty city. On the Douyin platform, there are far more urban buildings released by netizens than people. After the epidemic, pedestrians are still scarce and have a stall. A local video photographer said: "Why does Xiong'an New District, which has been built for six years, becomes an empty city? The empty city is used to describe the current Xiong'an New District. Why is the Xiong'an New District built so well, but there is no one inside, just like an empty city ... "</p>
<p><strong> Xiong'an residents: There are too many houses, not so many people live </strong></p>
<p>Another Xiong'an resident said that rents in the area are declining: "The real reason for the decline in resettlement rents in Xiong'an New District is actually the relationship between supply and demand. Many citizens of Xiong'an are divided into three houses. Now they want to rent out. But there are not so many people who really want to rent a house. "</p>
<p>Regarding the unable to attract foreign talents in Xiong'an New District, Zhang Jianping, a commentator from Yixing current affairs in Jiangsu, told this station: "At that time, the Xiong'an New District was said to build it into a deputy capital. , I encountered an epidemic again. Later, I also said that Xiong'an New District is a provincial development zone, saying that it is necessary to build a smart city. Now the country is building a smart city without attractiveness, unless you move the Zhongnanhai over. "</p>
<p><strong> Investment in 800 billion yuan is still empty city </strong></p>
<p>Xiong'an New District is the 19th National New District of China, and is also the first national new district that was notified by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. According to the latest official data, as of the end of November last year, the Xiong'an New District has implemented a total of 240 key projects, with a total investment of over 800 billion yuan, and a cumulative investment of more than 490 billion yuan.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Hong Kong, 10th) Hong Kong's most famous political cartoonist Zunzi and directly known sources today said that after Zunzi's ridicule of the district council reform plan was criticized by government agencies, "Ming Pao" will be self -contained. Starting serial comics from the 14th.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-11T06-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Huang Jijun, a cartoonist who uses the pseudonym "Zunzi", has published ironic comics on Hong Kong current affairs and public policies since 1983 in the Hong Kong mainstream Chinese newspaper "Ming Pao".</p>
<p>He published a 3 -grid comic on the 9th, depicting a man told a woman, "As long as the chief is suitable", he can appoint the Fireproof Crime Committee.</p>
<p>One week before this comic, Hong Kong announced that it would significantly reduce the direct election of the district council, which was actually destroying Hong Kong's final democratic agency.</p>
<p>After Huang Jijun's serial comics were published, Mai Meijuan, the director of the Hong Kong Civil Affairs and Youth Affairs Bureau, was immediately condemned, saying that the comic "distorted" and "violated the media morality".</p>
<p>Huang Jijun told AFP today that Ming Pao will no longer publish his comics. He said: "Comics are just a medium. Everyone should do what he should do and what we can do."</p>
<p>Sources who are directly informed told AFP that Huang Jijun's comics will be suspended from the 14th. It is unclear whether the comic stop serialization is indefinite.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Huang Jijun has been criticized by the government. His previous works have angered at least 5 government departments, including police offices and security bureaus with great power. More than 20 years ago, his work was banned in Macau and Singapore.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the incitement of the activation of the colonial era in the Hong Kong authorities, and the implementation of the National Security Law after the protest of the protests in Hong Kong in Hong Kong in 2020, the publication and publication of politics in Hong Kong can easily cause legal risks.</p>
<p>Ming Pao was the last mainstream media in Hong Kong that continued to publish Huang Jijun's comics after the "Apple Daily" was forced to close in 2021. Apple Daily was founded by the Pan -Democratic Media Tycoon Li Zhiying.</p>
<p>The irony news program "Headliner" also horses. In 2020, it was ruled by the Hong Kong Communications Administration. A episode of the show involved slander and humiliation police and was suspended for more than 30 years on Radio Hong Kong.</p>
<p>When Huang Jijun was interviewed, he told the AFP that "jokes can be very dangerous. The power of power wants the masses to believe that they can only follow them, and the jokes can just be in the middle to expose the lies and pull the person to step down."</p>

<p>Santos then said, "I will fight me. I will do it. I will fight against witch hunting. I will wash my reputation, and I look forward to this."</p>
<p>Santos is 34 years old and is a Republican, in November 2022 <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/us-midterm-elections-2022"></a>He was elected Federal MP in New York State. In the past six months, Santos has been faked in succession, suspected of violating campaign funds, fraud, etc. Under the pressure of all parties, Santos acknowledged that his resume was fraud, but denied criminal acts and repeatedly reiterated that he would not resign. In April this year, Santos announced that he would be re -elected as a member of the United States Congress.</p>
<p>With 222's weak advantages of 213, the House of Republican Republican officials said that they will wait for the development of legal procedures, and then take further actions against Santos who do not plead guilty. Santos was released on bail for $ 500,000 (about S $ 660,000) and will appear again on June 30. This means that he can return to Washington and vote in Congress. As a condition for bail, he agreed to hand over passports and restrict travel.</p>
<p>The Moral Council of the House of Representatives began investigating Santos in March this March to determine whether Santos was engaged in illegal activities during the 2022 campaign of members of the Congress and whether it was not disclosed in the documents submitted to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>So far, nine Republicans of the House of Representatives have called on Santos to resign, including six Republicans from New York State in his hometown. But the Second Republican Republican StevesCalise said the party did not judge Santos for the time being.</p>

<p>Description: Guo Taiming, the founder of Hon Hai Group, who is actively fighting for the Kuomintang President's nomination, was criticized because of the stamping of Taiwanese in the event. It is not necessarily decided to decide whether the Taiwanese or other common languages are fluent in Taiwan. The item is very important.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欲角逐台灣總統-郭台銘勿讓民進黨執政/a-65234414"></a>Trying to speak in Taiwanese at Kaohsiung's activity, he was said to be unintelligible at all, and even people who said his Taiwanese needed "translation"; from the perspective of the background and experience of origin, Taiwanese is not Guo Taiming's "mother tongue", or even It will not be his common language, so why can he be said to be a hard scalp or trying to speak in Taiwanese in the activity?</p>
<p>Some say that since Kaohsiung in the south, he may make the supporters present in the south feel more kind and closer to each other. All dialects in the inside can be said to be an indispensable skill for Taiwanese politicians. Each politician will use dialects depending on the current occasions and places, but the so -called use is not necessarily a high -challenge way to express, but if the opening is not mentioned, it is not mentioned in the opening game. If you come, you will make a big taboo.</p>
<p>So at the moment when the election and the candidate stand on the stage of the stage, say hello to the supporters, the national Taiwan language band is basically the "small case" in the Taiwanese population (a small dish), and it may also be possible. It is not sincere as sincerity, because although Taiwanese has the most population and most commonly used, there may be a group of speakers or aboriginal languages at the scene. Ask everyone. Among them, there may be different cavities. In Taiwanese, Changhua's cavity is very different from Tainan. Taoyuan's guest language is also very different from Pingtung. These have to be inquired and prepared in advance.</p>
<p>Taiwan has recently implemented "Mandarin Education" a long time ago. In theory, most people in theory can speak Mandarin, so speaking Taiwanese or guest language is not used to promote their own political opinions. In the early years of the only time to respect Mandarin Mandarin, when it was not strictly opened, Taiwan had a small -scale difference election at that time, but it clearly stipulated that the campaign could not appear "dialect". Most of the candidates at that time were "obedient". But a small number of "disobedient" candidates will test the bottom in violation of regulations.</p>
<p>After the democratization, there are no taboos, but there is no controversy, like that year <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座評論台灣九合一選舉民進黨抗中保台失靈/a-63900750"></a>Most of the campaign occasions are spoken Taiwanese, and they have been criticized as "changing soup without changing medicines", discrimination against other dialects, and "only the Mandarin" in the era of authoritarianism. The DPP's politicians have entered a multidget of multiple dialects from the single channels of Taiwanese. Since then Also in the use of language.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T07-41-00Z/65369258_401.jpeg" />In addition to "Mandarin" in public in public, Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen often uses Taiwanese or guest language to express her position. It is said that she has a blessing and native Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Election Linguistics</h3>
<p>Politicians in Taiwan have long been trained to switch freely in many languages, but as many new residents in Taiwan have become more and more, some politicians have begun to prepare for Hong Kong's Cantonese, Vietnamese, and Indonesian language. Some people may say that since immigration When you go to Taiwan, you should have a Mandarin to get the nationality and get the right to vote. Why do politicians accommodate new residents? There have been politicians that the factors that many voters decide to vote depends on the first impression, and the first impression comes from the same language you speak to them. When they hear the familiar language, they will feel assured that they will not only get closer, but they will not only get closer, The distance will also strengthen the sense of recognition of voters.</p>
<p>I will not be elected or not, but the voters may not have a good opinion or no impression on you. The chance of getting a voting will be small. One vote for democratic elections is one vote. Any candidate is not If you are willing to take this risk, even if you are elected, this is still very important. For example, Taoyuan City, although there are many population in Taiwanese, and the population of speaking is also from the mountains to the seaside. For the settlement of the island, the election officials also have public opinion representatives to say a few words to voters when they celebrate the New Year?</p>
<p>Many so -called "second -generation foreign provinces" born in Taiwan in 1950 and 1960 did not have too many opportunities to expose Taiwanese languages such as Taiwanese. They may be more contact with their parents' hometown. Living in a relatively closed village or most people in other provinces, Guo Taiming is the "second generation of the province" with this background. During the growth of that generation, Taiwanese and guest language were severely discriminated against. There are also the ridiculous era of "I don't speak dialect" on the neck. Therefore, many "second -generation foreign provinces" will not have the opportunity to contact languages other than Mandarin until the age of 20.</p>
<p>Those who can speak Taiwanese or guests probably do not deny that these language learning is not as difficult as learning a foreign language. The logical thinking and habits of language are very different from Mandarin. From this perspective, Guo Taiming may really be true. Not ready to speak in Taiwanese. As for whether it will affect his support, it is actually difficult to say. Of course, of course, I do n’t know if Guo Taiming avoids it in the future. It may be a difficult task, but at least he knows that he has tried it.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany), Lloyd Austin, USA, hopes that in June, at the "The Shangri-Ladialogue" in Singapore, he met with the new Chinese defense minister Li Shangfu. The British "Financial Times" reported on Thursday (May 11) that China said that due to the US sanctions on the Minister, the possibility of the two countries' defense ministers was very low. This is<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美中關係陷寒冰-秦剛籲美深刻反思/a-65556918"> </a>Essence</p>
<p>In 2018, Li Shangfu, then general, has not yet served as the Minister of Defense of China, and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/再次惹恼中国美制裁中央军委职能部门及部长/a-45599922"></a>Essence To this day, the United States stated that the sanctions did not hinder Austin meeting with Li Shangfu in a third country, but some anonymous people told the Financial Times that the Bayeng government did not intentionally cancel the sanctions. It's almost impossible.</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to the review request of the Financial Times.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T08-19-00Z/65367112_401.jpg" />China Defense Minister Li Shangfu went to Moscow to talk to the Russian Defense Minister in April</p>
<p>The "Shangri -La Dialogue" is an annual security forum operated by the Internal Institute Institute for StrategicStudies, which often becomes a place where US -China defense officials meet. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美防长香格里拉对话上炮轰北京/a-62101847"></a>Essence</p>

<p>After the balloon incident, General General Markmilley, Chairman of the Co -Chiefs of Staff of Austin and the Chief of Staff, has repeatedly requested calls with Chinese corresponding officials and has been rejected by the Chinese side. The high -level visit plans are also forced to cancel or postpone. Biden has repeatedly called on Sino -US relations to ease, and it has also been refuted by China as "no sincerity."</p>
<p>In this regard, the Pentagon stated that the United States hopes that "the Chinese military leaders such as the Chinese Defense Minister will maintain an open communication channel", but "it is China to decide to ignore, refuse or cancel a number of high -level communication requests in the United States."</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in the United States stated that the two countries are conducting "necessary communication." The embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu added that China and the United States "should not communicate for communication" and called on "the United States to take out sincerity ... to create the conditions and atmosphere required for communication with actual actions" can help Sino -US relations "return to the right track."</p>
<p>However, whether the talks that can be promoted to be studied have become an embarrassing situation for both China and the United States.</p>

<p>"Financial Times" reported that Bonnieglaser, a Chinese expert in German Marshall Fund, said that the fierce competition in the United States and China, coupled with the lack of dialogue between the two countries, became more and more. Unhappy, if Austin and Li Shangfu each attended the "Shangri -La Dialogue" and the two had not held talks, these countries would be very "shocked".</p>
<p>Ge Laiyi said: "The question is, would they blame the United States or China? My feeling is that most countries in the region have understood that the United States has been seeking contact with China, but it is blocked."</p>
<p>Judeblanchette, an expert in CSIS Think Tank, believes that the dispute shows whether the relationship between Washington and Beijing can stabilize depends on "political interaction between the two sides." He said: "The longer Beijing does not meet with the United States, more European Asia will feel that China is stubborn."</p>

<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<h3>The United States looks too anxious?</h3>
<p>Bloomberg reported on the 11th that although the Bayeng government continued to be rejected by the Chinese side to restart communication, it continued to try to promote the positive attitude of China and the United States regardless of the grassroots and senior dialogues, in order to appease "worrying that the United States did not do enough tensions in the tension" " Eurasian allies. However, some public opinion is also worried that such a strategy may make the United States look weak and nose in China.</p>
<p>"Obama National Security Council" (EvanMedeiros), a former Asian senior director, believes that although this "smart and adventurous" strategy can help the United States receive trust in Eurasian countries, it may also strengthen China. The argument that the "Western world needs China more" and the China -US agenda is at the helm of China.</p>
<p>Denniswilder, former deputy assistant director of the East Asia and Pacific Region, also said that this move may make Chinese leaders think that "the strategy of the frozen relationship between them after investigating the balloon is shot down." In the wrestling, the tactical advantage was achieved.</p>
<p>The chairman of the "China Issue Special Committee" of the US House of Representatives Mikegallagher criticized on the 10th: "I just don't understand why the Bayeng government held a meeting (with China) to make such an eager and diligent suitor Performance. "Garrat believes that this move shows the intention of the Biden government to compete in other regional status and participation in regional affairs, but the overall strategy of the United States appears chaotic and clueless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65585044/65585645"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T08-39-00Z/65585645_303.jpg" /></a>The huge boom directly pierced the MRT sound barrier wall and fell into the track (provided by the Taichung City Government).</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) At noon on Wednesday (May 10th) in Taichung City, Taiwan, a boom of the construction site fell from the high -rise building to the Taichung MRT track. Essence Taiwan's "Lianhe Daily" reported that this was "the first death and injury accident in the Taiwan MRT."</p>
<p>The Taichung MRT Corporation (Zhongjie) held a press conference on the morning of the 11th. It was silent for 1 minute to pay attention to the victims. It also publicized the screen monitor screen, indicating that the incident passed.</p>
<h3>How did it happen?</h3>
<p>The accident occurred at noon on the 10th, Taichung MRT Fengle Park Station. At first, the outside world believed that the "trains during the march" were hit by a boom, but the surveillance video released by Zhongjie Company showed that before the train started, the boom had fallen to the trail track.</p>
<p>According to comprehensive Taiwan media reports, the monitor screen shows that less than a minute after the accident trains entered the platform, the construction site was 40 meters long and 3.3 metric tons (3300 kg). Enter the orbit. At this time, the orbits came out of the smoke, and the platform presence also looked forward. Immediately returned to the webmaster, but the autonomous train train was still closed as usual.</p>
<p>Subsequently, after the person in the car confirmed the abnormal, the action control center was required to stop the train. The train still left the station. Eventually, the train stopped the train because of detecting obstacles.</p>
<p>An injured Canadian passenger described Taiwan media. He recalled: "We park at the MRT station, the train door is still driving, and then we see the boom smashed down, and then slammed. We saw a smoke. And, at this time the train stopped. Then we shouted : My God, what happened? At this time, the door began to close. The people next to me told us not to leave. The train had begun to move. After that, we hit the wreckage (boom). "</p>
<p>The spokesman of the Zhongjie Company explained on the 11th that the Zhongjie trains were driving unmanned. Although they were equipped with a car personnel, the drop of the boom was less than 200 meters, and the suspended card was on the orbit. The system cannot be detected in time, and only 13 seconds of response time will not brake.</p>
<p>Taichung MRT opened in the spring of 2021. It is the third MRT system in Taiwan except Taipei and Kaohsiung. The Taichung MRT has resumed traffic on the entire board on the morning of the 11th.</p>
<h3>Who is the dead?</h3>
<p>The Zhongjie accident caused 1 death and 10 injuries. After confirmation of the authorities, the deceased Lin Shuya died on the spot at the age of 52.</p>
<p>Lin Shuya is a senior human rights movement in Taiwan. During his lifetime, he was a assistant professor at the Department of Law of Jingyi University. He was a member of the Presidential Palace of Taiwan Presidential Palace. The Presidential Palace of Taiwan and the International Amnesty Organization have all expressed condolences.</p>
<p>Huang Guochao, an associate professor of Taiwan Literature Department of Jingyi University in Taiwan, said on Facebook that he could not forgive this "ridiculous worker accident." She wrote: "Taiwan society should not forget the elegant. Democratic, international human rights, Tu Bo human rights, principles, environmental rights, judicial reforms .... What can be done by alone. She is only 52 years old. Just, you give her another 30 years, what will it be in the future? "</p>
<p>Lin Shuya has long been committed to the Taiwan Aboriginal Movement. Wu Lihua, a legislator of the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party, mentioned on Facebook after Lin Shuya's death news. When Chinese President Xi Jinping published the 40th anniversary of the "Book of Taiwan Compatriots" in 2019, he mentioned that "does not give up the unity of force". Non -peaceful announcements have triggered a rebound in Taiwan's public opinion. At that time, Lin Shuya drafted the "Book of Mr. Xi Jinping" in response to China, and the text shouted to Xi Jinping: "The subjectivity of the indigenous peoples and Taiwan, and refused to threaten and did not give up."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T08-39-00Z/65585661_401.jpg" />The next day, the Taichung MRT has resumed to traffic. The people of Taiwan are still shocked and questioned by the MRT accident (provided by the Taichung City Government).</p>
<h3>major traffic accidents in Taiwan in recent years?</h3>
<p>The traffic safety accident in Taiwan frequently circulated that a 3 -year -old girl and her mother occurred in Tainan City, Taiwan this week. When crossing the road, a car accident was suffered.</p>
<p>According to the latest data released by the Ministry of Transport in March, the number of traffic accidents in Taiwan in 2022 was as high as 3085, a new high in 10 years. The United States CNN has recently reported to describe Taiwan's traffic chaos as "pedestrian hell", which has aroused widespread discussion in public opinion in Taiwan. After the China -PRC accident, the local public opinion was set off again -seemingly a safer MRT system than the road.</p>
<p>Taiwan's "Lianhe Daily" reported that the China -PRC accident this time was the first death and injury accident to the Taiwan MRT. During the construction of the Taichung MRT during the construction of 2015, a steel beam falling accident occurred, causing 4 deaths and 4 injuries.</p>
<p>The most serious traffic accident in Taiwan in recent years is in April 2021 <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/太鲁阁号出轨案侦查终结-工地主任遭过失致死罪起诉/a-57226224"></a>Cause 49 deaths and 213 people injured, the most serious accident in the Taiwan Railway in the past 60 years.</p>
<h3>Who should be responsible?</h3>
<p>Comprehensive Taiwan media reports that eight people including the construction workers and workers involved in the case have been delivered to the suspicion of death due to negligence, overlapping damage and public danger. The construction company involved in the case, "Xingfu Fa", went to the scene of the accident to bow and apologize. The Taichung Municipal Government ordered the company to suspend all the projects and was fined NT $ 1.11 million.</p>
<p>The Taichung Metropolitan Development Bureau stated that according to the "restrictions on the construction of both sides of the Volkswagen MRT system", there are restricted construction regulations on both sides of the MRT, and the design drawings of all construction plans must be reviewed. The review passed and did not violate the restriction regulations. Whether there are negligence in the construction site still must be further identified.</p>
<p>In addition to the construction company, the Taichung Municipal Government and the Taichung MRT Corporation have also been questioned whether the emergency response measures of the MRT system have been leaked and the rail foreign body detection system is flawed.</p>
<p>Zhongjie said on the 11th that in the future, the manufacturer involved in the case will be required to pay at least NT $ 200 million, and the emergency response process of the relevant emergency response is also evaluated for the accident review. It is also evaluated to set up emergency buttons on the platform to avoid similar regrets.</p>
<p>The detailed reasons for the China -Piece accident are still investigating. The Taiwan National Transport Safety Investigation Commissioner said on the 11th that preliminary interviews with the first -line operators are expected to be completed within one week, and preliminary reports will be submitted within 30 days.</p>

<h1>In 2022, more than 71 million people around the world are displaced</h1>

<p>Description: (France -Presse Geneva, 11th) The supervisory agencies said today that the "Perfect Storm" formed due to multiple crises forced tens of millions of people to escape from their homes in 2022, which made the world's domestic number of displaced people reaching a new high.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-11T09-32-12-00-00/000000.png" />The unprecedented domestic outfits (IDP) reported in 2022 reached 71.1 million people, an increase of 20%over 2021. The main reason was that Russia's war in Ukraine and the drowned Pakistan's monsoon storms caused a large scale.</p>
<p>According to the joint reports of the "Internal Displacement Monitoring Center" and "Norwegianrefugee Council", in 2022, a total of 60.9 million domestic displaces were forced to escape many times this year. Essence</p>
<p>This represents a record high of a newly -dispatched person in the country in 2022. Compared with about 38 million people in 2021, it has increased significantly by 60%.</p>
<p>Alexandra Bilak, director of the Disposal Monitoring Center, told AFP that the data was "very high".</p>
<p>"Most of the newly added people are caused by the Ukrainian war, but it is also due to the floods in Pakistan, the new and continuous conflict around the world, and many sudden and slow disasters we see from the Americas to the Pacific."</p>
<p>In 2022, the number of new domestic displaces caused by conflict surged to 28.3 million, which was nearly doubled from 2021, and the average level of the past 10 years was three times.</p>
<p>In addition to 17 million disposted in Ukraine in 2022, Pakistan had 8 million people forced to escape from their homes for huge floods.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-11T10-02-09-00-00/000000.png" />Former US President Donald Trump urged the Republican Parliament to be a member of the Republican Parliament that if the Democratic Party did not agree to cut expenditures, it refused to raise the upper limit of debt and let the United States fall into the first debt default in history.</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden also threatened that the federal debt limit controversy will not be resolved quickly, and he will cancel Asia, including the G7 summit held next weekend.</p>
<p>Ye Lun said in his speech: "As for the assessment of economists and me in various fields, once the United States breaks the contract, it will lead to economic and financial disasters."</p>
<p>Ye Lun pointed out: "Even if there is no breach of breach of contract, the extreme means taken on the upper limit of the debt may also have to pay a heavy economic cost."</p>
<p>The upper limit of debt in the United States is often routine. However, in 2022, Republican members who won the control of the House of Representatives threatened that if the government does not cut expenditure, it will not increase the debt limit from the current 31.4 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>Ye Lun warned last week that the treasury will be exhausted as soon as June 1, and will not be able to fulfill its financial obligations.</p>
<p>Ye Lun said today that the United States was also facing similar situations in 2011, so she lost the top AAA debt letter evaluation.</p>
<p>Ye Lun said, "There is no reason to find trouble and create a crisis."</p>
<p>She said: "Since 1960, the U.S. Congress has raised or temporarily canceled the upper limit of debt for nearly 80 times. I urged Congress to take action quickly and do it again."</p>
<p>The main members of Biden and the two parties did not make progress on the 9th, but the participants agreed to continue their efforts to avoid breach of breach of contract.</p>
<p>However, Trump, who was leading the polls of the Republican 2024 presidential election in 2024, appealed on the live show on the American CNN (CNN). You have to let (debt) default. "(Translator: Liu Shuqin/Calculation: Chen Zhengyi)</p>

<p>In April this year, the German Information Technology Security Agency (BSI) put the Tollerort terminal of Hamburg Port <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉堡港福地码头被列入关键基础设施-中远入股还有戏吗/a-65293775"></a>Essence The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the ministry is studying related influences due to changes in the prerequisites.

<p>At that time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the German government to objectively and rationally view pragmatic cooperation between the two states and provide non -discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The federal government now stated in a statement that "the revised acquisition agreement meets the conditions for partial ban." At the same time, it is emphasized that the Hamburg Port container terminal is classified as a key infrastructure in Germany.</p>

<p>HHLA also said that the shares acquisition transaction "soon" can be completed.</p>
<p>The Hamburg Port said that a few equity of Chinese companies will ensure the employment of the port, and strengthen the importance of burgers as a logistics intersection at home and abroad, and the importance of Germany as an industrial country.</p>
<p>Tanjagönner, the director of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said that the German government finally approved the Hamburg Port acquisition case slightly lower than 25%of the Hamburg Port, which is a good thing for Germany as an investment place. She said: "The economic competitiveness and technical sovereignty of Germany and the European Union need to maintain basic openness on our local foreign investment, which also includes investment from China." She added: "Expanding the economic relationship with China is reasonable, it is reasonable. Even if it is increasingly tense in the geopolitical situation today. "</p>

<p>Public sector workers, including border troops, voted to decide to extend industrial actions, and British Airport faced a six -month strike.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Wednesday (May 10) said that in a vote, 88%of votes supported further strikes. This gives the union's new power. If the long -term dispute on wages, pensions and work guarantee has not reached a solution, the trade union will hold a strike involving more than 100,000 civil servants.</p>
<p>Persons participating in the voting are from 186 departments of the public sector, including the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the education, national defense and transportation departments hiring officials of passport control officials. This may lead to further delays at the port of Dofer, and this port has suffered long traffic jams during the holiday peak period. The voting rate was 52%, which exceeded the minimum level of half of the workers required for the legalization of the British strike.</p>
<p>"Unless the minister invests more funds, they will see more high -profile destructive operations in the summer unless the minister invests more funds until autumn."</p>
<p>Stubborn inflation has prompted workers to protest the actual salary reduction, and Britain has faced extensive industrial actions in recent months. Industrial operations involve a series of departments, including civil servants, transportation, royal postal, schools and universities, and national health services.</p>

<p>British human fertilization and embryonics have confirmed that the first batch of three -parent babies containing three -person deoxyrogenic acid (DNA) information in Britain have been born. This is the first batch of three relatives born in the UK in the context of mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT) in the background of mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT). The number of babies is less than five.</p>
<p>Mitochondrion is the "energy factory" of the true nuclear cells. There is a set of genetic materials independent of the nucleus in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial disease belongs to the maternity inheritance. Once the mother has defects, the baby will be affected. British human fertilization and embryonics administration emphasized that mitochondrial donation treatment is still in the early stage, and only it is very likely that severe mitochondrial diseases to children who are qualified to receive mitochondrial donation treatment.</p>
<p>In terms of genetic perspective, there are two mothers in the three relatives, but the "mother" who donate mitochondria and their children is less connected. Most of these children's DNAs (more than 99.8%) are still from their parents, but about 0.1%of genetic materials come from mitochondrial donation women.</p>
<p>In 2015, Britain became the first country to legally take effect to approve mitochondrial donation treatment. Since then, the Newcastle's Newcastle Planning Center obtained the first controversial treatment permit in 2017 and created MDT research.</p>
<p>Britain does not use MDT to give birth to the first three -parent baby. In 2016, American doctors performed related treatment for a Jordan woman carrying mitochondria mutations. The world's first three relatives in the world were born in Mexico.</p>
<p>However, for mitochondrial donation treatment, public opinion is mixed. Supporters believe that for women with mitochondria defects, this technology can help them give birth to healthy children. Opponents believe that this is a disguised genetic modification and does not meet medical ethics.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T11-11-00-04-00/000000.png" />Since the beginning of this year, Peru has continued to discover the death of the sea lion, and after testing, it was found that death was due to bird flu. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05112023110542.html/@@images/image"></a>Agencence France -Presse <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05112023110542.html/@@stream"></a>Like the movie plot of the Holocaust, the Peruvian coast has emerged. At the end of January this year, 100 kilometers from the capital Lima, 100 sea lions were strange and violent, and the number of deaths continued to soar in various places. Until early March, nearly 3,500 sea lions were discovered, accounting for more than 3%of the total number of sea lions in the country.</p>
<p>Who killed the sea lion? The answer is bird flu. The most severe H5N1 bird flu in this wave of history in history is popular. Not only does birds have been hit by major blows, but mammals have also suffered. In November last year, Peru discovered the first case of wild bird infection. Death, a pain of suffering of convulsions and bleeding pneumonia before death.</p>

<p>The scene of collective death in this scene was also staged in the other end of the Atlantic Ocean. In October last year, a large number of mink died broke out in Spain's farms. At first, veterinarians suspected that it was a new crown virus. After all, many in Europe have a large -scale infection. It was found that the murderer was actually a bird flu virus H5N1. In the end, more than 50,000 mink was killed. These mink escaped the number of new crowns.</p>

(Associated Press) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05112023110542.html/2.jpg"></a>Not only darts in sea lions and mink, French red foxes and cats have detected avian flu viruses. Russia and Peru's seals are also popular. For cases, the list of mammalians continued to increase.</p>
<p>H5N1's new virus has brought severe impact on farm animals and natural ecology. Ecological experts have warned. As the avian influenza virus continues to evolve, mutations and flow in different species, ecological risks will inevitably rise. Recently, Peru and Argentine scientists have also published an article in the "Science" journal that sea lions may be exposed to wild birds with pathogens. However, the possibility of group death may be strange, and the possibility of viruses spreading between sea lions is worrying.</p>
<p>Zheng Mingzhu, an associate professor of the Department of Veterinary Medicine, Pingtung University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, pointed out that in the past, mammals had sporadic infection with bird flu viruses. This epidemic was collectively infected with mammalians. The other is to be transmitted to mammals in mammals, which causes a lot of infections. Both methods mean that the new type of bird flu virus has stronger adaptability to mammals, so many experts are also worried that after the virus further across species obstacles in the future, it is possible to have new viruses in transmitted people.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaqin, Honorary Professor and Dean of the Institute of Microbiology and Public Health of Zhongxing University in Taiwan, said that these unusual mammalian infections have attracted the risk of virusists and human and animals infectious diseases. In addition to wild animals such as mink, sea lion, seals, and bears, international experts also noticed that the poultry farm is difficult to prevent blocking mice, because H5N1 will infect mammals, whether mice may be infected, or whether mice may be mechanically mechanical. Sexual carrying virus. Once the poultry field cannot be effectively controlled by the poultry field, they may escape around the poultry field, pollute feed or contact poultry, and further cause H5N1 to spread. For the prevention and control of the disease, mice are mammals worthy of everyone's attention. Is it possible for them to be potential hosts that spread viruses.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T11-11-00-04-00/000002.png" />The avian influenza virus continues to break through the line of defense, and the threat of human and animal infectious diseases has heated up. (Associated Press) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05112023110542.html/3.jpg"></a><strong> Plague one after another, knocking on the door </strong></p>
<p>Is the distance between humans and plague closer? After the H5N1 virus was first separated for the first time in the baby poultry in Guangdong, China, in 1997, the world's first human case appeared in Hong Kong, causing 18 infections and 6 deaths. In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that bird flu virus H5N1 was a global public health threat. From April 6, 2003 to April 6, 2023, a total of 874 people in the world infected H5N1 virus, 458 people died, and the mortality rate was about 53%.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaoqin believes that in the past, the H5N1 virus strain has caused a very high mortality rate of human beings in the past, but in this wave of epidemic, the virus strain has changed. So far, so many countries in the world have become popular, and many people have exposed to viruses during breeding of poultry or killing. There are only about 10 human cases around the world, and some are infected with no symptoms and unpreparedness. At present, there are no interpersonal communication. occur.</p>
<p>However, the bird flu virus is cunning and changing. The World Animal Health Organization (WOAH) divides the avian influenza virus into high pathogenic (HPAI, also known as high pathogenicity) and low according to the pathogenic force and mortality rate of poultry virus infection. Creation (LPAI, also known as low pathogenicity). Zhang Zhaoqin reminded that from the perspective of epidemiological empirical data, it is not only that the high pathogenic avian influenza virus can cause human cases. In fact, the low pathogenic avian influenza virus also has the threat of human animal infection. At present, it is necessary to continuously monitor the avian flu virus, because its virus strains have a lot of combination, and the demand for human edible poultry meat in recent years has increased, and the number of poultry fields has also grown. Therefore, the overlappingability of the human living environment has led The chance of contact with poultry has increased, thereby enhancing the threat of common infectious diseases in human and animal.</p>
<p>Over the years, H3N8 has been infected from birds to horses and dogs several years, and no human cases have happened. However, in March 2022, China reported to the World Health Organization's first case of human infection with H3N8 bird flu virus. There are currently three cases worldwide, all from China, one of which died in April this year.Judging from the bird flu virus strains infected with human infection, Zhang Zhaoqin explained that the two subtypes of H5 and H7 are the most watched. H5 subtype strains include H5N1, H5N2, H5N6, etc. H7, H7N7, H7N3, H7N2,,, H7N2,,, H7N2,,, H7N2,,,, H7N2,,,,, H7N9 et al. Among them, H7N9 has caused quite a lot of human infection cases in mainland China. In addition, H9N2, H10N7, H10N8, and H6N1 have also had human infections in the past.</p>
<p><strong> The live poultry market has become a virus library </strong></p>
<p>It is worth noting that most cases show the history of living poultry contact. Zheng Mingzhu pointed out that in the past, many human infections have occurred in the live poultry market, especially in China ’s H7N9 cases. The living poultry market is the main source of infection.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T11-11-00-04-00/000003.png" />The live poultry market plays an important role in the spread of bird flu viruses. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05112023110542.html/4.jpeg"></a>Zhang Zhaoqin said that the live poultry market plays an important role in the spread of bird flu viruses. These poultry passes through long -distance transportation to the traditional market. In the process, they are locked in a narrow crowded cage. The sense of urgency, which is profitable and overflowing under the physiological pressure. This time is more likely to cause contact with personnel and infection. In addition, it will also cause pollution problems in the environment. In terms of poultry disease prevention, the live poultry market is definitely negative.</p>
<p>In addition, the live poultry market also provides a great environment for virus replication and hyperplasia and gene mutations. Zheng Mingzhu explained that the live poultry market gathers different sources of poultry, including ducks, chickens, quails, etc., and sometimes selling some odors, such as wild ducks, so there may be a spread chain between birds. Most of the bird flu virus originated from water poultry, because water poultry usually does not develop after infection. When they are caught in the live poultry market, the virus generates transmission of cross -species and poultry species in space Essence</p>
<p>From time to time, there is a reorganization or mutation of bird flu viruses. Zheng Mingzhu believes that this may not be related to the live bird market and poultry poultry. Bird flu vaccine is not removed. High -profile bird flu, such as H5N1, H7N9 New reorganization plants appear in China, so China has been regarded as a new type of bird flu in the past.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaoqin reminded that, in addition to the live poultry market that can cause the spread between people and animals, the location configuration of the poultry industry is also a potential risk factor. The poultry field must have a certain distance from the human living environment. There are many backyard raising chickens in mainland China. Since the distance with people is too close, it is impossible to prevent the contact of migratory birds or wild animals and poultry. In recent years, many people and animals will be seen in these countries. Regional popularity is not without reason.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T11-11-00-04-00/000004.png" />Faced with the great epidemic diseases on the ruthlessness, the monitoring and prevention and control measures of bird flu. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05112023110542.html/5.jpeg"></a><strong> Bird flu is the next wave of epidemic disease? </strong></p>
<p>Recently, China Fudan University and the University of Sydney, Australia teamed up to publish an epidemic study in the journal "Onehealth" journal. In -depth analysis of more than 70,000 animal flu data from 1970 to 2016. Researchers concluded that avian influenza may be the next human beings. The source of major epidemic disease. Zheng Mingzhu believes that as the avian flu virus continues to appear, the risks of human popularity will inevitably heat up, but there is no need to panic because humans have rich experience in dealing with large infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaoqin analyzed that there are currently two conditions for the global epidemic popularity. One is that the frequency of human contact with these animals is high or not. Then it is the opportunity for these animals to infect viruses. The bird flu is in line with these two requirements. However, there are not only avian influenza in infectious diseases, and pigs are only beneficial to 100 viruses. Others also have Ipora virus. Even this wave of new crown epidemic comes from wild animals. These viruses may break through the line of defense. Whether the avian influenza virus will become the most important virus strain in the next wave of popularity, it is difficult to have clear answers, but it is worthy of everyone's attention and attention.</p>
<p>It is not allowed to prevent the virus organic. In addition to strengthening biological safety prevention and control, it is also a top priority to improve the influenza influenza monitoring and early warning system. Zhang Zhaoqin pointed out that countries should continue to monitor the virus genes of migratory birds. If there are livestock, dogs and cats, etc., they will enter relevant poultry fields, and the monitoring of dogs and cats cannot be neglected; monitoring of mice and bat It may be drilled into the poultry field; in addition, the birds near the water poultry habitat must also strengthen the virus monitoring.</p>
<p>Zheng Mingzhu said that at this stage, new viruses that most often cause human epidemic viruses are usually reorganized in pigs in pigs. Therefore, the pig farm is only an important monitoring object. In all links, it can reduce the threat to human health.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T11-25-17-04-00/000000.png" />Li Yanhe (Fucha), the editor -in -chief of Taiwan's "Eight Banners Culture" Publishing House, was detained in mainland China <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zhongguotoushi/panel-05112023112439.html/@@images/image"></a>Beiling Facebook picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zhongguotoushi/panel-05112023112439.html/@@stream"></a><strong> Moderator: </strong> <strong> Chen Kuide </strong></p>
<p><strong> Sympoters: Dr. Zhang Jie </strong> <strong>, </strong> <strong> Weekly "Nine -headed Birds: Freedom Say </strong> <strong>" </strong> <strong> founder, </strong> <strong> "YouTube" host(312-752-0875)</strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. "Evaporation on the World" reproduces China </strong></p>
<p>Recently, some knowledgeable journalists have evaporated in mainland China. Mainland China has become more and more like a magical horror world.</p>
<p>What goals. Finally, let's take a look at the response of overseas Chinese students to China's internal political situation.</p>
<p><strong> 1) Li Yanhe (Fucha) case </strong></p>
<p>Li Yanhe, chief editor of Taiwan's "Eight Banners Culture" Publishing House, was detained in mainland China.</p>
<p>The Beijing authorities confirmed on April 26 that a Taiwanese publisher who was missing in China had been detained for suspected violation of the National Security Law. This has triggered the cold effect of Taiwanese cultural people. The increasingly popular publishing industry in Taiwan suddenly, a large unprecedented unknown cloud was spreading, and the black clouds crowded the city to destroy.</p>
<p>What people immediately remembered was the "Causeway Bay Bookstore" incident in Hong Kong in 2015. The five important bookstores in the bookstore suddenly disappeared. Later, the news revealed that they were abducted by the Chinese authorities to abduct the border to the mainland.</p>
<p><strong> Li Yan congratulated people </strong></p>
<p>Li Yanhe, a pseudonym, Fucha, is a publisher in Taiwan and a Chinese citizen. He has been living in Taiwan as a Taiwanese son -in -law since 2009. The Eight Banners Culture Press he operated in Taiwan is famous for publishing criticism of the CCP in Taiwan. Li Yanhe returned to China to visit relatives in early March this year. Soon after that, he evaporated, and suddenly lost contact.</p>
<p>In the recent tension between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China, Li Yanhe's detention may become a new crisis point. Beijing claims that Democratic Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and must be unified with the CCP. However, most people in Taiwan refuse to reunification in Beijing. They hate Xi Jinping's totalitarian rule, including his overlord's hard bow, abandoned Sino -British joint statement, canceled the two systems and two systems in Hong Kong, and destroyed Hong Kong's freedom and rule of law with the Hong Kong version of the country's security law. Hong Kong, an international financial center and a free port. This is a tragedy of the rare brutal destruction of civilization in human history.</p>
<p>Zhu Fenglian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese Government, told reporters in Beijing on April 25 that Li Yanhe was under investigation for "suspected activities that endanger national security". She did not specify the allegations against Li Yanhe, but said that China would protect his legitimate rights.</p>
<p>In China, spy activities are not strictly distinguished from criticizing the CCP, and they are all crimes that violate the National Security Law. People who have been charged with such crimes may be detained for several months when they are not allowed to get in touch with their family or lawyers.</p>
<p>For Li Yanhe's supporters, the case is similar to the disappearance of five Hong Kong book vendors in the mainland in 2015. Chinese investigators secretly detained those Hong Kong people. They all involved a publishing house that strictly criticized Xi Jinping and other CCP leaders, and the described books described by them. One of the bookmakers Gui Minhai is still serving his sentence in China. He was sentenced to ten years in prison because he was accused of providing intelligence abroad. Other book vendors were released after public confession on Chinese official television stations.</p>
<p>Publisher Li Yanhe was born in Northeast China in 1971. Before moving to Taiwan, he worked in Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House.</p>
<p>He was proud of his descendants of the Manchu. The Qing Dynasty established by the Manchu ethnic group ruled China from 1644 to 1912. Li Yanhe established the Eight Banners Cultural Press in Taiwan in 2009.</p>
<p>There are many types of books published by the Eight Banner Culture hosted by Li Yanhe, including many translation works, mainly based on mainstream non -fiction works, such as Wang Feiling, a professor of George Ya Institute of Technology, "Chinese Record: Evaluate the People's Republic of China" and Du Rusong(SH Doshi)The Chinese translation of "Long -term game: China weakens the Great Strategy of the United States and Establishs Global hegemony".</p>
<p>The Taiwan authorities may be difficult to contact him during the detention of Li Yanhe by the mainland, because the current cross -strait relations are tight and he is still the citizen of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>"Born in mainland China itself, it is also possible to prevent him from leaving mainland China." Lin Rongji, one of the Hong Kong scholars detained by mainland China in 2015, said that since 2019, he has lived in Taiwan. Essence He said: "Publishers in Taiwan should be careful, because you can't change China's thoughts."</p>
<p>Li Yanhe's wife is Taiwanese, and she refuses to discuss her husband's case publicly.</p>
<p>The Mainland Commission of Taiwan, which handles cross -strait relations, stated in a written statement that it is keeping close contact with Li Yanhe's family.</p>
<p>"For the handling of this case," the committee said, "the government will use all methods and channels to provide the most appropriate care and assistance on the premise of respecting their families."</p>
<p><strong> 2) Yang Zhiyuan case </strong></p>
<p>Similar to the above -mentioned Li Yanhe case, this is also a case of political colors. Chinese prosecutors said on April 25 that Taiwanese man Yang Zhiyuan was officially arrested by the mainland authorities, and he was accused of "sin the country." Yang Zhiyuan is the vice chairman of the Taiwan National Party. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said that the Yang Zhiyuan case "further sounds the alarm clock of severe punishment of the" Taiwan independence "split forces."</p>
<p>Yang Zhiyuan (January 21, 1990) is a politician and social movement from Taiwan, and founded the Taiwan National Party. On August 3, 2022, it was arrested and detained by public security during the business residence in Fujian, mainland China.</p>
<p>On August 3, 2022, Yang Zhiyuan was criminally arrested by the National Security Bureau of Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province of the People's Republic of China on the grounds of "suspected split national crimes and inciting split state crimes". The State Council spokesman Ma Xiaoguang responded that night that "the national security organs took measures on Taiwan independence elements who were suspected of endangering national security crimes in accordance with the law, which fully illustrates all the" Taiwan independence "stubborn stubborn elements that are tried on the law and cannot escape the severe punishment of national laws, but the Republic of China The Executive Yuan stated that the Ministry of Justice and the MAC have not yet received a Chinese notification.</p>
<p>Former Taoyuan City Councilor Wang Haoyu said in social media that Yang Zhiyuan had developed in China before his arrest. Wang Haoyu said that about one or two years ago, he settled there with "White Wolf" (referring to Zhang Anle) to visit China, and he settled there, thinking that he had been separated from the Taiwan independence camp and joined the CCP.</p>
<p>Yang Zhiyuan's friend Wu Baiwei said that according to his understanding, Yang went to mainland China this time "should be participating in Go competitions, and some business activities, political beliefs are not Taiwan independence."Yang Zhiyuan is another Taiwanese who lived by China after Li Mingzhe.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2022, the mainland committee of the Republic of China support Yang Zhiyuan, saying that it should be innocent and called on the CCP authorities to release its return to Taiwan.</p>
<p>On April 25, 2023, the case of Yang Zhiyuan was investigated by the National Security Bureau of Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and was transferred to the Wenzhou Procuratorate for review and prosecution. The procuratorial organs of Zhejiang Province approved the arrest of Yang Zhiyuan.</p>
<p>Yang Zhiyuan Zheng Juan</p>
<p>Yang Zhiyuan joined the Democratic Progressive Party in 2008. One year later, he realized that there was a huge gap in the national consciousness of the pan -green camp and the pan -blue camp. He has also exchanged with the unified independence parties; he believes that the two sides of the strait should maintain friendly relations and promote democratization in mainland China. He believes that the population on both sides of the strait belongs to Chinese society, and do not fight against China because of anti -communist. His friend Wu Baiwei said that "Yang should be the same in theory"; many blue camps said that Yang was arrested "incredible".</p>
<p>In 2016, the slogan of "national supremacy, third position, resolute anti -communist and resistance".</p>
<p>In November 2019, as a nomination of the party's non -district legislators on one side, Yang Zhiyuan said that he could not recognize Hong Xiuzhu's "one middle and same table", and also believed that Cai Yingwen's cross -strait policy "did not have his own opinion". The president implements a country on both sides of the strait. " In addition, Yang Zhiyuan rebuked the Democratic Progressive Party to "have no small roads" and called on the party to vote to the small party to allow the small party to enter the Legislative Yuan. "Don't let the DPP continue arrogant."</p>
<p>Zhou Chongde, president of the 908 Taiwan National Movement, said that Yang did not develop in Taiwan, and it was likely that he was seduced to mainland China. He happened to be arrested for foreign propaganda when he met Perosi to visit Taiwan. Perlus left Taiwan in the afternoon, and the authorities in the evening of China announced that the authorities arrested a Taiwanese. (RFA report)</p>
<p><strong> 3) Dong Yuyu case </strong></p>
<p>Dong Yuyu, deputy director of the comment department of the CPC Central Committee, was taken away by the police more than a year ago by the police more than a year ago. The recent defendant of his family will be sued for spy. Although Dong Yuyu has served the official media in the system for many years, it is known for its liberal tendencies and support for reform and opening up, and frequently contacts foreign journalists and diplomats in China. Dong's supporters firmly believe that what he does is normal communication. The so -called spy crime is another heavy attack that the CCP has tightened the space of speech and suppress the disagreement in recent years.</p>
<p>Dong Yuyu, deputy director of the comment department of Guangming Daily, one of the most influential official media in China, was taken away by the police with a police officer with a Japanese diplomat with a Japanese diplomat on February 21, 2022. The Japanese diplomat was also taken away and released a few hours later. The Japanese government protested this incident, and the Chinese government responded to this diplomat engaged in a "inconsistent" activity with him.</p>
<p>On March 23, 2023, Dong Yuyu's family was told that he would face the crime of spy. The silent family has always decided to disclose the matter recently. Dong Yuyu has not been allowed to meet his family for more than a year, and only met with a lawyer once.</p>
<p><strong> Active Liberal Reporter -Dong Yuyu </strong></p>
<p>61 -year -old Dong Yuyu was originally born in Fushun, Liaoning. After graduating from the Law Department of Peking University in 1987, he joined the Guangming Daily. In 1989, Dong was decentralized for one year for participating in the June 4th protest, and then returned to the Guangming Daily. He wrote an article for the historical magazine "Yan Huang Chunqiu" and wrote a comment on the New York Times Chinese website. In 2006, Dong Yuyu won the Niman News Scholarship at Harvard University in the United States and visited Harvard for one year. He also served as a visiting scholar at Kyoto University and Hokkaido University in Japan.</p>
<p>As a liberal reporter, Dong Yuyu often wrote a comment article on liberal tendencies, and has often maintained close connection with foreign media and diplomats for many years.</p>
<p>** International Sound in China</p>
<p>More than 60 scholars, journalists and intellectuals from all over the world signed an open letter to treat Dong Yuyu fairly. Sign signs include Bob Woodword, a senior reporter of the Washington Post in the Washington Post(BobWoodward)Former "Wall Street Journal", former Vice National Security Counselor of the White House(Matthew Pottinger), Orville Schell, an expert in China who went to China in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The open letter said: "Just like all reporters around the world, Dong Yuyu often meets other countries, journalists, and scholars, including some of us. Our meeting plans are often agreed on WeChat, and it has always been always. Public, the place of meeting is all public places. "</p>
<p>"Some of us are Dong Yuyu's classmates when studying abroad, such as Harvard Niman scholars in 2007. We appreciate Dong Yuyu's open humorous character and insight into world issues. Chinese cultural messenger. "</p>
<p>"All of us can prove that Dong Yuyu has a high degree of academic ethics and standards. We have conducted frank and open exchanges on each other's country and the world situation. This communication is part of the normal 'civil diplomacy'. Support. "</p>
<p>The open letter calls on the Chinese government to re -consider the severe punishment that Dong Yuyu may face: "The contact with foreign diplomats, journalists, and scholars should not be the reason for constituting a spy. Scholars and diplomats meet? "</p>
<p>Founded in 1908, the "American National News Club" in Washington(American PressClub)A statement on this matter was issued on April 24. The statement said: "Through his work, Dong Yuyu allows the world to better understand China and let China understand the life of the United States and Japan. Dong Yuyu is a reporter with outstanding results. . We call on the Chinese government to revoke the complaint and release Dong Yuyu. "</p>
<p><strong> Silent game in the system </strong></p>
<p>Dong Yuyu often wrote comments on economic affairs in the Guangming Daily, and the article often revealed his reform and liberal ideological tendency.</p>
<p>In 2012, Dong Yuyu expressed China's claim in the article "Why the Republic becomes the Great of History" written by the historical magazine "Yan Huang Chunqiu", which expresses the claim that China needs to establish constitutional government. He said in the text: "Freedom, security, order, efficiency and other values provided by the constitutional and democratic system, freedom is undoubtedly the most important value"; In the beginning, it is the system design of its depression and distorted humanity. "</p>
<p>In July 2012, Dong Yuyu wrote an article entitled "I want to send my son to the United States to study university" for the New York Times Chinese website. In the text, Dong Yuyu quoted the observation of the New Year columnist Thomas Friedman: More and more foreign immigrants chose to go to the United States for education. The United States is still the biggest magnet in the world. Dong Yuyu himself is one of the many parents who sent their children to the United States. His son's elite middle school Beijing No. 4 Middle School. One -third of students hope that after graduating from high school, they will abandon Chinese universities after graduating from high school and go directly to the United States to study university.</p>
<p>Wu Yanlai, a scholar who lives overseas, said that some "different voices" can occasionally see "different voices" on Chinese official media because some people like Dong Yuyu are working hard. "Although the Central Propaganda Department has his extremely left -left thinking or the set of language expression used by the leftist, the right to writing and the right to publish in the editor of the front line. Some people like Mr. Dong are there, and he has some measurement. There are some enlightenedness, or there will be more things that are in line with universal values. It is not the wind above, the upper level is open, not the editor and director of the bottom line, their representative and position decision decide of."Dong Yuyu's family said in a statement that Dong was neither spy nor as a foreign agent. The exchanges between scholars, journalists and diplomats in Japan, the United States and other countries can be traced back to more than 20 years ago. It is open and bright, and it is part of normal knowledge and cultural exchanges that China has encouraged for many years.</p>
<p>Wu Yilai did not think that Dong Yuyu had any "spy" behavior. He said: "As a media person and a commentator, Mr. Dong cannot contact deep secrets, but only exchanged some of his own views. But that's such a thing, they can go online. Many of them have a lot of places to eat. The monitoring device, or the phone monitor. He can characterize you as leaked by the content of the content you communicated. "</p>
<p>Dong Yuyu's family said in a statement that it is unclear about specific trial time. According to the current criminal law of China, if a spy is convicted, the plot is milder may be in prison for less than three years or less; those who endanger national security will be sentenced to more than ten years in prison or life imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong> 2. The basic characteristics of the case </strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Beijing cross -border long -arm suppression(The detainees are the Taiwan citizens of the Republic of China, the son -in -law of Taiwan who have lived in Taiwan for a long time, and the citizen of the People's Republic of China ...)</strong></p>
<p>** 2. The Chinese Communist Party focuses on the extinguishing heresy thought and free knowledge.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Xi Jin's plane facing isolation, China is moving towards martial arts, seeking to regulate during quasi -war. </strong></p>
<p><strong> 4. "Spy Law" has made China enter the era of martial arts in quasi -war. The crime of spy has become a crime of pocket- "No need" charges </strong></p>
<p>On April 24, the draft of the Anti -Spy Law was requested to the third session of the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress. According to Chinese official news reports, the three draft draft drafts further improved the regulations on cyber spies and clarified the behavior of cyber spy.</p>
<p>In fact, it has greatly expanded the boundary between the "spy" definition, blurred "confidential intelligence," and "and" and "objections". The spiritual environment of the quasi -Cultural Revolution: the knowledge elite and the entrepreneur group are cold. The silent China appeared in anti -intellectualism. The anxiety of the security of the regime has made Beijing increasingly lock the country. This will strengthen the barriers and hostility between mainland China and the mainstream international community, creating an increasingly unsafe and isolation international environment for the CCP.</p>
<p><strong> Three, the overseas effect of suppressing the intellectual industry </strong></p>
<p><strong> The East is not bright and West Light: overseas Chinese students began to organize their sounds. Similar to the situation of overseas students who came forward after Hu Yaobang's death in 1989. </strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><em>George Washington University Independence Chinese Student Organization Declaration: Light our torch!(Student union supported by the embassy to resist gifts) </em><em> </em>*</li>
</ul>
<p>(... In our campus, the demands on citizens' rights and academic freedom are higher than that of the waves. With the beginning of the White Paper Revolution at the end of November last year, many of them and hundreds of other Chinese students from the University of George Washington participated. The night guarding and protests elsewhere elsewhere in Kogan Plaza and other parts of Washington. Expression and behavior, but lacks space that allows free expression.</p>
<p>With this understanding, we announced the establishment of the George Washington University Independent Chinese Student Union -Toronto Potomak. In general, we hope to provide Chinese students and scholars at the University of George Washington University and Chinese youths scattered in a larger scale, and provide a organizational platform, social support and community independent of the Communist Party of China and its puppets. In addition, we also welcome students who are interested in Chinese culture, politics and identity from various backgrounds.</p>
<p>Our priority is still to protect the students of George Washington University from being influenced by the Federation of Federation and the CCP, and to promote the comprehensive withdrawal of companies from companies participating in the Uyghur racial extinction and the company that supports the CCP. Part of ethical reconstruction. For a long time, the Federation and similar organizations have maintained the monopoly of the culture and political representatives of Chinese students. As we all know, Xuelian cooperates with the Communist Party of China and its puppets and accepts its leadership. It has announced this in its promotional video. More widely known among Chinese students at the University of George Washington University that they are led by the Third Generation and the rich two generations. Their moral deficit burst, and the transparency is zero. For example, in the past few years, they even misappropriated their membership of their members who should be used in the Internet and employment -related activities. The leaders of the Leadership Federation bragged their activities to participate in the Chinese Embassy and had dinner with the ambassador. These people's monopoly power is not because they provide an attractive vision or a respectable administrative ability. The academic federation protects its monopoly position by intimidation, surveillance, extortion, and other forms of suppression and threats of violence-especially through fear.</p>
<p>Lu Xun once wrote: "There is a point of heat, and a point of light will make the fireflies average. You can also send a little light in the dark without waiting for the torch fire. If there is no torch, I am the only light." In view of the CCP, The oppression of the Xuelian and the cold blood of school management, we no longer wait for the torch, but decided to ignite Mars on the bank of the Poto Mark. ...)</p>
<p>Roryo'Connor, chairman of the American Student Organization "Athenai Institute", told VOA in the United States that the destruction of the "democratic wall" "is equivalent to letting those almost no other ways can safely express their opinions safely Students whispered. "</p>
<p>The "Athens Society" is committed to promoting the interests of American universities to get rid of the interests with China and protecting the academic and speech freedom of the school. The "Athens Society" supports the establishment of the George Washington University Independent Chinese Student Union.</p>
<p>"Our time and resources are rarely used than supporting Chinese democratic students. They are now facing the agent of the fascist party state because they try to truly express themselves."</p>
<p>In addition to the "Athens Society", some student organizations at the University of George Washington have also expressed support for the Independent Student Union, including the Campus Democratic Party and Republican Organizations, GW Chinese Feminist (GW UyGhur Human Rights Initiative) and Uyghur Human Rights Initiative. GW Russianspeaking Association.</p>
<p>In the statement, the independent student union stated that the school's Chinese Student and Scholars Federation (CSSA) is the main force that suppress them to express political appeals: "Our priority is still the students who protect George Washington University are not affected by the Federation of Federation and the CCP ... For a long time, the Xuelian and similar organizations have maintained the monopoly of the culture and political representatives of Chinese students. "</p>
<p>** 2) Established "Citizenship" in May 2022, Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>A wave of protests caused by 1987 and 1989 when Hu Yaobang was reinforced and died, and the wave of protests in overseas Chinese students overseas gradually began to rise from 2022-2023, which can be regarded as the spiritual trend of Chinese intellectual circles. We believe that this righteousness of overseas Chinese students will soon be popular to form a fire of Liaoyuan.</p>

Although the total exports to China increased to 16.4 billion euros in 2022, an increase of 26 % from 13 billion euros in 2019. 100 million euros, nearly doubled. In 2022, Italy's trade deficit with China reached 41.1 billion euros, an increase of 1.2 times over the 18.7 billion deficit in 2019.</p>
<p>Melonney said last year that signing the "Belt and Road" memo with China was the "big mistake" of the former government.</p>

Italy sold some oranges at most in Sicily, and many major developments have not been carried out. But the closeness of Italy and China could not be torn immediately. Melonney said that she would cut off relationships with China, and she has always clarified that she has to maintain a good relationship with the United States. It is reported that China may retaliate if not renewed.</p>
<p>** Scholars: The Melony government is looking for the most favorable solutions in Italy through the wind.</p>
<p>Zhang Mengren said: "Italy does not want to offend China, and may not renew its mouth in the mouth. In fact, it is waiting for China to valuation. If China gives greater benefits, maybe the" Belt and Road "upgrade to a two -o'clock version. It may be revealed to the United States that the United States may also may also be the United States. It will give it to Italy. Italy has recently discussed chip problems with Taiwan. If Taiwan chips and the United States can assists at the same time, Melonney can make a real decision. "</p>
<p>Zhang Mengren believes that Italy may not want to offend China, but also sign an economic agreement with China to replace the "Belt and Road". At the time, Italy's joining the "Belt and Road" caused French President Macron and many countries such as the United States.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported last month that Italian officials hinted to Taiwan privately that they might be willing to withdraw from the "Belt and Road" to seek Taiwan assistance to promote the progress of Italian semiconductor technology.</p>
<p><strong> At this time, Melonney took the lead in exiting the "Belt and Road". What is the confidence? </strong></p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tomas University, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that the United States is now doing the global production chain reorganization. Although Italy does not necessarily compare with Germany, some precision technology belongs to Italy proprietary Advanced automobile manufacturing industry, etc. Is it possible for the United States to include Italy into the global production and supply chain, which is very helpful to the future of Italy, but the premise is that Italy is biased towards China or trade with the United States? This is the biggest choice. It must be possible for US diplomacy and business sectors to operate behind.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan pointed out that the "Belt and Road" is not a free subsidy or aid. Through the China Investment Bank's loan to developing countries, many cases have no ability to repay. China requires a port or the concession railway. Italy should want to make the crisis not erupt in advance.Ye Yaoyuan analyzed that when China Investment Bank faces these challenges, it must be drawn away from funds, but it is not easy to draw away. Many national infrastructure construction in China invested in the "Belt and Road" national infrastructure, many of them are contracted by Chinese companies, and money returns to the Chinese. If China draws funds, it will affect Chinese companies. The short -term goal of Melonney should be to let go of diplomacy, and debt is not easy to break.</p>
<p><strong> Will Italy's exit of the "Belt and Road" will set off the bone effect? </strong></p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan believes that if Italy really withdraws from the "Belt and Road", it will not set off the bone card effect in a short time: "At this stage, the country that needs to be selected by the border station, the road of the Indo -Pacific Strategy Zone, and sporadic European countries will gradually compete in the United States, China, and China. Choose a specific block and slowly pull it out from the control of China, but it will not be the result of instant reversal. For these developing countries, I hope that the United States and China will take it. They also recognize the United States and China. The confrontation has nothing to do with their interests. Of course, it will be extremely free, and find a way to get the benefits of both sides from it. "</p>

<p>Zhang Mengren also evaluated that the so -called "southern countries" that will be affected by Italy's exit belong to the Western countries, such as Latin America, Africa, Sri Lanka, and Central Asian countries, which are less affected.</p>
<p>In addition, the World Bank President David Malpass said on the 8th that many low -income countries carried huge loans in the "Belt and Road" back to China, and more than 70 low -income countries borne The above countries have fallen into or endangered debt difficulties, including Zambia, Ethiopia and Ghana. If China has not reorganized debts, it will put pressure on the political system of various countries. The World Bank predicts that the global economic growth rate will be less than 2%this year.</p>

It is beneficial and in line with the interests of exporters and manufacturers in Australia. "</p>
<p>Farrell said to reporters before flying to Beijing that both Australia and China have the willingness to improve the relationship, but they still need to pay more efforts. He said: "The establishment of a strong trade relationship between Australia and China is the greatest contribution to the realization of peace and stability in the region."</p>
<p>China is the largest trading partner in Australia. In 2022, the total bilateral trade was 287 billion AUD 287 billion (equivalent to $ 195 billion), including the irreplaceable Australian iron ore in the Chinese market. Nevertheless, the Australian Minister of Trade has not visited China since 2019.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Farrell will stay in China to Saturday. China said that it was hoped that Farrell's visit will "further consolidate the" important consensus' "that the leaders of the two sides have achieved during the Bali G20 summit last November last year.</p>

The Minister of Trade, China and Australia, will also co -host the 16th China -Australian Minister of Economic Union. Meeting. The meeting of the Economic Joint Committee of China and Australia was held in 1986 for the first time. With the intensification of diplomatic friction between the two parties, the meeting has been interrupted since 2017.</p>
<p>Since 2020, China has begun import restrictions on wine, beef, barley, coal, seafood and wood from Australia. Australia's request to launch a new crown traceability survey has caused strong dissatisfaction in Beijing. Soon after that, Australian reporter Cheng Lei was arrested for harmful national security. In addition, Canberra also excludes the products of Huawei, a Chinese network equipment manufacturer, from the national security considerations.</p>
<p>After the Labor government came to power in May 2022, although the Australian government did not change the policy of security review for foreign investment, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳大利亚实施防御调整-应对地区军事威胁/a-65417123"></a>However, Australian -China diplomatic relations still show signs of relief.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T12-04-00Z/56492674_401.jpg" />Australian Chinese reporter Cheng Lei has been detained by China for more than a thousand days.</p>

<p>Australian customs data shows that in the first few months of this year, Australia had exported copper ore and copper concentrate worth $ 40 million to China, which was the first time since 2020 resumed exports to China.</p>
<p>Farrell said that during his visit to China, he also talked about other "important topics for Australia to the main". It is generally believed that the above topic may involve cases related to human rights.</p>
<p>Albanis said that Australia will continue to pay attention to the fate of Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who has been detained for more than a thousand days.</p>

<p>The world's second largest ice cover Greenland Ice Cjid has melted rapidly, which has aroused people's concerns about the rise of the sea level and its impact on the environment. A new study shows that the degree of rising sea level rising in the future due to the polar glacier meitation may be underestimated.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of California and Owen, the University of California used the relevant data collected by satellites to migrate a major marine glacier in the northwest of Greenland -Peter Man Glacier (the dividing line of the glacier floating part and the grounding part) and the ice. Observation and analysis of the melting speed was performed.</p>
<p>In the traditional predictive ice cover melting model with sea levels, the glacier ground line will not migrate with the tidal cycle, and the ground wire ice layer will not melt. Researchers reported in the new issue of the American Academy of Sciences that the ground line of Peter Man Glacier will change with the tidal cycle and form a wide "area". Due to the impact of global warming, the warm seawater invades under the glacier and melts the ice layer of the "area" at a faster speed.</p>
<p>Eric Ricinho, author of the University of California, Geoconnism at the University of California, said that the interaction between ice and ocean makes glaciers more sensitive to seawater warming. If the traditional prediction of the rising ice cover melting model will consider this new discovery, the prediction of the glacier melting will cause the sea level to rise. Researchers suggested that, given the important role of the "area" in glaciers, in the future, the interaction between glaciers and oceans in the region should be further studied in detail.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) in March of this year, the Kiel City Government and China [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/一战百年之青岛记忆/a-17815974"></a>The plan of the city's associated partners' urban relations has been announced and controversy follows. Opponents believe that Kir, a German Navy's important port, must be very cautious when dealing with China and cannot open the door.</p>
<p>Antoniagrage, a representative of the conservative CDU (CDU) and mayor candidate in the Kill City Council, is one of the first objection. "Do you have to choose China (city)?" She questioned and pointed out that, in view of the continuous worsening of China's authoritarianism, she hopes to strengthen "people's mutual understanding" is just a naive wish. Sports enthusiasts, but loyal to the party cadres, "told the reporter of the South German will.</p>
<h3>From sailing to the submarine</h3>
<p>The official connection between Kirr and Qingdao's two cities really began in the sailing movement. More than ten years ago, in order to prepare for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Qingdao Qingdao, the host of the sailing project, sought consultation and help from Kiel, who had hosted the event, and began contact and exchanges. Similar to Qingdao, Kiel is not only a pleasant coastal city, but also an important military port and marine science research base in Germany. Here are the bases of the German Baltic Fleet, a number of military and marine science research institutes including a NATO research institution, as well as shipyards and submarine docks.</p>
<p>Joachimkrause, a professor at the Institute of Security Policy of Kiri University, told Northern Germany's will that maintaining a close relationship with China means a higher security risk for the city of Kil, because the other party is used to using partnerships and academic academics and academic academics The cooperation in the field of research is to collect information. Specifically, Kirn is the sensitive information involving submarine technology and underwater war.</p>
<h3>Overlooking Germany: Kiri Wharf</h3>
<p>According to the "South German will", the suggestion of establishing a partner city comes from Qingdao. Clazer's fight, saying that this is like the main port of the Russian Navy's main port Molmansk proposed to establish a partnership relationship with Kirn, "Then our first reaction will be: don't worry, wait a minute!" Fang can choose to take the initiative to protect themselves as much as possible for the collection of information in China.</p>
<p>Qingdao is the military port of the Beihai Fleet in China. The Kirn Security Policy Research Institute has called on the municipal government to make careful consideration of plans to be friendly cities.</p>
<h3>Marine technology in Germany is "tedious"</h3>
<p>Klazer also pointed out that Kiro's Oceanic Research Center (Geomar) is also the goal of China that China will be interested in, because many civil technology research can also be used in the military field. However, Martinvisbeck, a senior scholar who has participated in international cooperation for many years, said that for Geomar, it is too much to talk about "risks". The underwater technology involved in the military industry is a mature technology that is open in the world market. "For spy, we are quite tedious here." However, he added that the center "Of course," of course, "of course," of course, "of course," of course, "the center will not share with third parties. technology". According to him, the research center has been more than ten doctoral students from China for many years.</p>

<h3>century memory</h3>
<p>Today, a century ago, on November 7, 1914, the Qingdao Germans surrendered to the Japanese army. In this way, Germany lost the "model colony" in Qingdao. The photos taken by German soldiers Paulpraßer at the time revealed the special chapter of Sino -German relations from a rare angle.</p>

<h3>German architecture</h3>
<p>After occupying Qingdao, Germany plans to create a "model colony", showing Germany's technical strength. Therefore, a small fishing village soon developed into a modern city. However, the lives of Germans and Chinese are strictly separated. However, the so -called Chinese region is also built in accordance with the regulations of Germany.</p>

<h3>"Guli"</h3>
<p>Even after 100 years, when many post -built modern sewage treatment facilities faced the collapse of the flood system, the sewage treatment system built that year could still resist the invasion of floods. Qingdao people have been intimately called the manhole cover as "ancient power", which is the transliteration of the German "manhole cover" Gully.</p>

<h3>Keeping traditional</h3>
<p>At that time, Germany's garrison in Qingdao sometimes reached up to 5,000 soldiers. Even away from their hometown, the Germans hope to maintain some German traditions, such as New Year's Eve celebrations on the picture (unknown shooting time). How can the Germans be beer when they are carnival ...</p>

<p>The fortune teller claims to know the future. At that time, less than 100 years later, Germany and China became a close trading partner who was sitting and flattened.</p>

Fields. There are more than a hundred cities in Germany in China [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/微妙的德中友好城市关系/a-51740328"></a>For example, Burger and Shanghai, Bhilai, Dalian, Berlin and Beijing.</p>
<p>He introduced the "South German will" that when the city council discussed the issue of friendly cities in March this year, he did not avoid the problem. Instead, he talked about people's negative perceptions of China: infringement of human rights, suppressing ethnic minorities, and. Threats, support for Russia in the Ukrainian war, and so on. But he still believes that there is no better way to promote dialogue and understanding. In the subsequent voting, the proposal was approved, and only Grag's CDU voted for the vote. But public opinion disputes are getting worse.</p>
<h3>How to prevent it</h3>
<p>The New York Times reported that the anxiety caused by this incident in Kirn showed that Germany's views on China are changing, especially after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia -this is not only because of Beijing's support for Moscow. One of Germany's largest submarine manufacturer, Titsis Krupp Ocean Systems, is leading a joint venture with Norway to build six new submarines. The shipbuilding company has 3,500 employees in Kir. According to two people who directly understand the situation, their managers admitted privately that they were worried.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-11T13-08-00Z/54575876_401.jpg" />Military sensitive information is too dense?</p>
<p>Sandra Heipp, director of the China Center of Budi Mei, pointed out that the communication and interaction brought by urban cooperation is worthy of recognition, but she reminded that in China, strict prevention measures are needed. "It is absolutely necessary to ensure that this will not lead to sensitive information, especially the useful information that may be useful for the Chinese military to China, especially when the risk of China's attacking Taiwan is rising."</p>
<p>Mayor Tova admitted to North Germany Will Radio, "Of course, especially the risk of spy activities for shipyards. I also know that some military experts are talking about that partner city relations may bring new potential military risks . "But he didn't think this was directly related to the planned city in the plan:" If the Chinese want to conduct spy activities, they must not need to pass the urban partnership. "</p>
<p>At the General Assembly of the Kier City Council on May 11, a proposal proposed by the CDU will be discussed: the establishment of an expert group to review the friendly urban relationship with Qingdao, if necessary, terminate the plan. Mayor Tova had previously revealed that the final decision was made in June this year.</p>

As of now, the Bayeng administration has announced nine military sales against Taiwan. In March of this year, the latest approval of the Taiwan military sales of Taiwan was as high as US $ 619 million, including many advanced equipment for the US Air Force. However, the progress of the United States' defense against Taiwan is not smooth. Taiwan Defense Minister Qiu Guozheng recently said that the United States approved the 66 advanced F-16W fighters approved by the United States in 2019, and Taiwan has asked the United States to "make up" losses.</p>
<p>A number of American media recently quoted sources that the Biden government is planning to adopt the "Presidential DrawDownautology" mechanism to skip the approval of Congress and urgently authorize 500 million US dollars of weapon assistance to Taiwan. Qiu Guozheng told the outside world on the 8th that related emergency assistance did not involve military purchase cases, but to make up for the delayed delivery of the above military sales.</p>
<p>On the important time nodes of the US House of Representatives, NancyPelosi, who visited Taiwan last year, and important time nodes of Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen earlier this year, China implemented a series of actions to show military deterrence against Taiwan forces. China ’s actions have been upgraded several times to upgrade the tension of the Taiwan Strait, which not only caused concerns about various countries including the Indo -Pacific region including the United States, but Taiwan also realized that the ability to upgrade its military defense is imminent.</p>

However, contact and dialogue with the Chinese government cannot simply "talk about", but should be vigilant about China's risks.</p>
<p>Guo Rongzheng said: "Don't misunderstand. I think we need to contact China. It is impossible to withdraw all business from China. This is unrealistic, and it is inevitable to trade with China. But what kind of clause should we be based on? When we have diplomatic dialogue with China, do business with China, and discuss human rights issues with China, what should we build?

<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>The Biden government has been working hard to prevent the relationship with the Communist Party of China from worsening further. Many analysts believe that US -China relations have slipped to the lowest point since 1979.</p>
<p>Former foreign officials and members of the two parties believe that the United States must maintain smooth communication channels with Beijing to avoid misunderstanding and management crisis.</p>
<p>However, sources said that the current policy is too close to the early contact strategy. This strategy allows the United States to exchange for China to exchange for high -level dialogue by concession, but often inadequate results.</p>
<p>According to sources who are unknown, Briggie has handed over the main responsibilities of China's policy to Deputy Secretary of State Sherman.</p>
<p>A State Council official said in a question from Reuters that under the leadership of the Bayeng government, the State Council coordinated with different institutions to record the number of sanctions, export control and other competitive actions implemented by China.</p>
<p>"We do not comment on specific actions. This work is both sensitive and complicated, and it is obviously promoted in an orderly manner. It is essential for the maximum exertion and ensuring that our information is clear and accurate."###: What I seeks is competition, not conflict</p>
<h3>FBI originally expected to release a report that was shot down in mid -April</h3>
<p>The two sources said that at the end of March this year, Hua Ziqiang said at a staff meeting that followed the instructions of Serman, the State Council would "look forward" from China's balloon incident. It is reported that Shelman is anxious to re -arrange the visits of Blink.</p>
<p>A Chinese official confirmed to Reuters that if the United States puts on hold on this issue in accordance with Beijing's hope, it is more likely to re -arrange Bollingin to visit China. The official added that China has stated that he does not want the Federal Investigation Agency (FBI) to announce the details of the investigation of the ben balloon.</p>
<p>The two sources said that the FBI report was originally expected to be released in mid -April.</p>
<p>FBI refuses to comment on any report. The US State Department told Reuters that it has never discussed this issue with the FBI and refused to comment on the discussions on this matter with China.</p>
<p>At the hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 2nd, when asked about the release of the FBI investigation report, Danielkritenbrink, Assistant to the Asia -Pacific Affairs Assistant, said: "I definitely support people to understand what happened. "</p>
<p>He also said that the State Council is committed to managing competition between the United States and China. "In our opinion, some of them must involve high -level communication and keep the channels unblocked."</p>

"This decision is good, but it has strengthened China's influence."</p>
<h3>Delay of control over Huawei</h3>
<p>In December last year, the United States established the "China House" (official name is "China Affairs Coordination Office").

<p>Sources said that the US Department of Commerce and the Industrial and Security Agency have formulated rules to revoke the export control permit related to Huawei, including those who involve less sensitive technologies.

<p>Description: After a spy balloon incident in February this year, some U.S. officials are convinced that this will stimulate the United States to adopt a series of actions to fight against China. However, sources said that the U.S. State Department actually suspended the actions of human rights related sanctions and export controls against China's human rights to prevent further damage to the United States and China.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) It is understood that four sources in the United States policy and internal emails obtained by Reuters have suspended the human rights related sanctions, export control and other sensitive actions against China to prevent further damage to US -China relations. Essence</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the "Competitive Action" schedule of the US State Department is a confidential list of Bayeng's government in China. The decision of delayed sanctions shocked some US officials, and also reflected the differences between the US government and advocating the differences between those who have adopted more severe action and advocate more restrained practices.</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯因气球推迟访华-对中美关系有何影响/a-64610722"> </a>However, the internal documents of the State Department seen by Reuters show that senior US officials have postponed action plans for China.</p>
<p>The US State Department is responsible for the deputy assistant Secretary of State Rickwaters of China and Taiwan Affairs, and said in an email that had not been reported to the employees on February 6: "The instructions of the Secretary of State are promoting the 'non -balloon' action, so we can Focus on the response of corresponding and careful consideration. We can re -examine other actions within a few weeks. "</p>

<h3>Shooting</h3>
<p>A balloon in China fluttered over the United States for a few days. On February 4, the U.S. military shot down in the coastal waters of the South Carolina. The United States has accused China of using balloons for espionage. But China said that this is just an out of control meteorological balloon.</p>

<h3>search</h3>
<p>The shot of balloon fell into the sea a few miles away from the coast of South Carolina. The U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard positioned the areas where the balloon fell, and sent helicopters and ships to sort out the wreckage of balloons in the fall area.</p>

<h3>wreckage</h3>
<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters. The U.S. military is trying to salvage more wreckage in order to more accurately understand the actual use of this flying object.</p>

<h3>tool</h3>
<p>The U.S. military uses special equipment such as underwater drones to search and salvage balloon wreckage. The "Explorer" -class marine measurement ship uses the sound of sound to find the wreckage fragments in the fall area. According to the U.S. military, the search area is about 2.25 square kilometers.</p>

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>The Biden government has been working hard to prevent the relationship with the Communist Party of China from worsening further. Many analysts believe that US -China relations have slipped to the lowest point since 1979.</p>
<p>Former foreign officials and members of the two parties believe that the United States must maintain smooth communication channels with Beijing to avoid misunderstanding and management crisis.</p>
<p>However, sources said that the current policy is too close to the early contact strategy. This strategy allows the United States to exchange for China to exchange for high -level dialogue by concession, but often inadequate results.</p>
<p>According to sources who are unknown, Briggie has handed over the main responsibilities of China's policy to Deputy Secretary of State Sherman.</p>
<p>A State Council official said in a question from Reuters that under the leadership of the Bayeng government, the State Council coordinated with different institutions to record the number of sanctions, export control and other competitive actions implemented by China.</p>
<p>"We do not comment on specific actions. This work is both sensitive and complicated, and it is obviously promoted in an orderly manner. It is essential for the maximum exertion and ensuring that our information is clear and accurate."###: What I seeks is competition, not conflict</p>
<h3>FBI originally expected to release a report that was shot down in mid -April</h3>
<p>The two sources said that at the end of March this year, Hua Ziqiang said at a staff meeting that followed the instructions of Serman, the State Council would "look forward" from China's balloon incident. It is reported that Shelman is anxious to re -arrange the visits of Blink.</p>
<p>A Chinese official confirmed to Reuters that if the United States puts on hold on this issue in accordance with Beijing's hope, it is more likely to re -arrange Bollingin to visit China. The official added that China has stated that he does not want the Federal Investigation Agency (FBI) to announce the details of the investigation of the ben balloon.</p>
<p>The two sources said that the FBI report was originally expected to be released in mid -April.</p>
<p>FBI refuses to comment on any report. The US State Department told Reuters that it has never discussed this issue with the FBI and refused to comment on the discussions on this matter with China.</p>
<p>At the hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 2nd, when asked about the release of the FBI investigation report, Danielkritenbrink, Assistant to the Asia -Pacific Affairs Assistant, said: "I definitely support people to understand what happened. "</p>

<h3>Delay of control over Huawei</h3>
<p>In December last year, the United States established the "China House" (official name is "China Affairs Coordination Office").

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T14-38-00-04-00/000000.png" />The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that the Patriot Air Defense missile shot down the dagger missile. The picture shows the US -made Patriot air defense missile deployed in Poland. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05112023135551.html/@@images/image"></a>Associated Press Information Picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05112023135551.html/@@stream"></a>This column premiered a new program every Friday, and there were several backs after it. You can listen to short waves, or listen through YouTube and RFA's official website.</p>
<p>Audience friends, hello everyone. What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Russia described the high supersonic weapons developed in recent years. It is an indestructible and is a big killer to check the US anti -missile system. This statement has been broken recently.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Armed Forces Air Force Commander Mykolaoleshchuk pointed out that over May 4th in the surrounding areas of Kiev, the Ukraine uses Patriot Air Defense missiles to shoot down a "unprincipated" Kinzhal missile, which is history Sexual events. The missile was launched from Russia by the MiG-31 fighter. The National News Agency of Ukraine confirmed the news on May 6. Russia has not responded so far.</p>
<p><strong> Sprinkle 破 mythology is broken </strong></p>
<p>The dagger is called a hypersonic missile. The flight speed is 10 Mach (10 times the speed). It can be mobilized. It can be equipped with nuclear and conventional warheads according to the task. The range is 2,000 kilometers and the accuracy is better than 10 meters. Russian President VladimirPutin publicly stated in the National Information Counseling in 2018 that the air -fired dagger hypersonic missiles will conduct a combat duty mission in the Southern Military Region since December 2017. At the Putin report, the big screen demonstrated the crackdown of the launch of the missile missile, which caused warm applause in the audience.</p>
<p>The Russian simulation experience shows that a dagger missile can break through the intensive interception firepower network composed of more than 20 NATO standard and patriots' air defense missiles, which is a "Sprinkle" weapon tailored by the anti -missile system. Russia's Air Heavenly Army Commander Sergeysurovikin said confidently that dagger missiles can effectively break through the current and future air defense and anti -missile systems of Western countries.</p>
<p>In February last year, Russia invaded Ukraine. Six months later, Russian Defense Minister Sergeishoigu announced that he used a dagger hypersonic missile with a dagger at 3 degrees during the combat to successfully hit high -value targets and performance. In April this year, Ukraine obtained the first batch of patriot missile systems, and the air defense capacity was enhanced. It was unexpected to break the myth that Russia could not intercept.</p>
<p>The United States did not respond as soon as possible. Until May 9th, Patrickry, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed at a press conference that Ukraine's use of Patriot missile defense systems to shoot down a Russian dagger missile. He said that the Patriot system is part of the US and the international community to provide wider air defense capabilities to Ukraine. In the future, we will continue to step up the provision of land -based air defense capabilities and ammunition to help Ukraine control their sovereign sky and protect Ukraine from attacks from Russian cruise missiles and Iranian drones.</p>
<p>Please note that Lede confirmed that the dagger missile was shot down, but it did not emphasize that it was a "hypersonic missile," which said that Ukraine shot down "a Russian missile." Does this imply that the United States has not regarded the dagger as a real high supersonic speed speed Weapons, but an air -fired ballistic missile, not a new weapon.</p>
<p><strong> Guide -type air -firing ballistic missile </strong></p>
<p>US defense technology experts, including Alexhollings, pointed out that the dagger missile is a modified version of the Russian short-range ballistic missile Iskander. The new guidance system designed for air -to -ground combat is a guide -type air -firing ballistic missile, not a new technology; it may reach the supersonic speed, but it is not a hypersonic weapon.</p>
<p>Holinus believes that Russia uses the public's misunderstanding of the term "hypersonic speed" term. By improving the original weapon system, it promotes military sales as an advanced cutting -edge technology, so as to obtain funding to develop the next generation of weapons and equipment. In order to attract foreign buyers, Russia must show the ability to develop the same, even stronger weapons as the United States and China, and create a 21 -century military power image at a smaller cost. The dagger missile is a representative work.</p>
<p>However, it cannot be denied that the advantages of air -fired ballistic missiles are obvious compared with the trajectory missile launched by land -based and sea -based types. The first is that the launch costs are low and cost -effective. The air -ray type can save the ballistic missile launch device used by land and Haitu, and does not need to build preset positions or arrays, and no first -class engine can reduce the launch fuel.</p>
<p>The second is high mobility and strong survivability. The aircraft is equipped with ballistic missiles is much faster than land -based and sea -based types, and the range of activities is much larger. Flying outside the country's leading or defense zone is difficult to be investigated, positioned and attacked by enemy. This dagger missile was launched by the MiG-31 fighter aircraft from Russia. It did not need to attack before, and it was not necessary to attack to ensure safety. Due to the high mobility, the enemy's early warning time is compressed, and the ability to stop.</p>
<p>Based on these characteristics, the air -fired ballistic missile is indeed unusual, but after all, it is not a hypersonic weapon.</p>
<p>What is a hypersonic weapon?</p>
<p><strong> Inside the atmosphere </strong> <strong> 5 </strong> <strong> Machi Flying </strong></p>
<p>The term "hypersonic weapon" is often misuse. Strictly speaking, it refers to a missile in the earth atmosphere that is higher than Mach 5 (Mach is about 1.7 kilometers per second and about 6,120 kilometers per hour). Most of the time it is flying inside the atmosphere of the earth (instead of outside space and outside the atmosphere). It is necessary to stop extreme high temperature tests, and use the design characteristics of air dynamics to maneuverate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most of the flight missiles are outside the atmosphere, and there is no effect on interaction with air for a long time. When returning to the atmosphere, the air resistance will also face extreme high temperature, but the time is short. The difference between the hypersonic missile is that they must respond to the test of the internal thermal effects in the atmosphere during most flights. Therefore, it is essentially different from the ballistic missile.</p>
<p>Another decisive feature of the hypersonic missile is that they rely on air dynamic control surfaces (such as missile wings or rear wings) for taxiing and maneuverability, flying with irregular trajectories, and hypersonic speeds, it is difficult for the enemy to find interception. The ballistic missiles fly with a relatively fixed parabolic trajectory, which is also a hypersonic speed, but it has a higher probability that it is intercepted than the hypersonic weapon.</p>
<p>There are two types of high supersonic weapons that are in line with the above -mentioned definitions: hypersonic speed booster glide missiles (HGV) and hypersonic cruise missiles (HCM). At present, the Russian land-based pioneer (Avangard) missile and the Chinese land-based Dongfeng-17 missile belong to the former; the latter is serving the Tsirkon sea-based hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile. The Russia claims that The ultra -combustion stamping engine is the power, and the flight speed is 9 Mach.<strong> Multiple technical difficulties need to be overcome </strong></p>
<p>In January of the US Congress Budget Office (CBO), at the request of the Military Commission of the Senate of the Senate this January, a research and analysis report of the "U.S. Hyders and Alternatives" was completed. The content pointed out that the development of hypersonic weapons has many technical difficulties to be overcome, including designing strong insulation devices, so that the structure materials of the missile can bear the high temperature of more than 2,000 ° degrees Celsius during the air. The warhead can emit and receive communication and positioning signals.</p>
<p>When the flying speed exceeds 5 Mach, the transition from stable to turbulence around the missiles will destroy its stability and cause a sudden local temperature to rise. When the missile turns, in addition to increasing the thermal burden of the missile, it will also significantly reduce the speed of missile flight and reduce the range. These factors often limit the maneuverability of hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>The development of hypersonic cruise missiles requires excellent super -combustion stamping technology and engine components. Its difficulty is metaphorical how to keep matches ignited and immortal in hurricanes. Prior to 2022, the United States only successfully run for a few minutes of ultra -burning stamping engines. Several successful demonstrations were successfully demonstrated to overcome some design difficulties, but there were still engineering barriers. It must meet the missile size, range and speed requirements, and it needs to overcome the challenges of extreme high temperature and aerodynamics.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether Russia and China have served in the United States' development standards. However, it is certain that the United States has no active hypersonic missiles so far, which does not represent technical backwardness, but is considered more aspects, shortening the running time of missiles from to fine. The development ideas of Russia and China are to first seek and then refine. The running -in time may be longer, and the performance requirements may not be higher than that of the United States.</p>
<p>The research and analysis report of the US Congress Budget Office pointed out that the United States' development of hypersonic weapons mainly considers 4 aspects. First of all, it is necessary to overcome technical challenges to deploy hypersonic missiles, including to withstand extreme high temperatures, and a large number of flight tests are required to determine the case.</p>
<p><strong> Overall technology United States leads </strong></p>
<p>Second, the hypersonic weapon is mainly used to respond to the strict defense of missiles and is extremely sensitive to time. The so -called time sensitivity requires a blow to the target within 15 to 30 minutes. Based on cost considerations, if time is not sensitive, you can use cheap cruise missile attacks. If the time is urgent and the opponent lacks an effective anti -missile system, it can use a low cost of a motor warhead. Many tasks do not need to hit high -speed weapons quickly.</p>
<p>Third, in the conflict, hypersonic missiles may not have more survivability than ballistic missiles with motorized warheads, unless the opponent has an efficient and long -range missile defense system. So far, potential opponents in the United States have not deployed such an efficient defense system.</p>
<p>Fourth, compared with ballistic missiles with the same range and the same range, the procurement and deployment cost of hypersonic missiles may be one third higher. The United States does not deploy hypersonic missiles, but related technologies are developing well. The U.S. Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have developed their respective high supersonic weapons, and there are also cooperative research and development projects. It is expected to be deployed in place from 2025 to 2028, respectively.</p>
<p>Chinese missile technology expert Yang Chengjun once said. "The U.S. hypersonic technology is generally the world's most advanced, but it is not used in the field of the Missile Battle Department." Once the United States invested, it can quickly live in the world's leading position, so "cannot Blind Yelang is arrogant. "You can see the blood.</p>

<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>The Chinese official media "Global Times" recently forwarded a short video of Douyin in Twitter, saying that "American politicians have destroyed Taiwan's brains and were splashed on the spot." The short video intercepted the SETHMOULTON speech in an open forum: "The mainland is very clear, if we" invading 'Taiwan, we will blow up the stagnation. " In this regard, "Huanshi" commented: "It seems that the United States really has a plan to destroy Taiwan."</p>
<p>Asian facts check the laboratory believes that whether it is a 30 -second Douyin short video, or the comment on Twitter in Twitter, it may be misleading the audience, because as long as you listen to the complete speech of Quan Meton It is advocated that the bombing of the Taiwan Stock Power is only quoting the debate of the US decision makers for the possible Taiwan Strait War.</p>
<p><strong> Deep analysis: </strong></p>
<p>Global Times English version Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1655063897697824768"></a>The title states that "bombing TSMC to curb the mainland, and American politicians have destroyed Taiwan's brains and were splashed on the spot." In the film, the United States Federal Representative Morton said: "The mainland is very clear. If the" invading 'Taiwan, we will blow off the table and accumulate. I just throw this idea, not because it is the best strategy, this is just an example, of course, of course, of course, of course Taiwan doesn't like this idea. "</p>
<p>Then, Michèle A.flournoy, the former Ministry of Defense, said: "Can't blast the table for accumulation. If you do that, in the first year, it will bring a $ 2 trillion economic impact on the world in the first year. The global manufacturing industry has stagnated, this is a bad idea. "</p>
<p>The English version of "Huanshi" commented in Twitter: It seems that the United States really has a plan to destroy Taiwan. U.S. politicians will not even talk about Taiwan's interests, let alone consideration. Do they plan to turn TSMC into the next "Beixi"?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-11T14-44-00-04-00/000001.png" />The English version of "Global Times" reposted a short video of Douyin on May 7th, the title said "American politicians have destroyed the crooked brain and were splashed on the spot." <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05112023142510.html/pic1-74b074036642583182f16587724863a872795e33865f56708765e58f49767c629697f377ed5f7197f3-6a19984c5beb8457300c7f8e570b653f5ba253c852d56bc053f06b6a81667b4b-88ab757658346f5151b76c34300d3002571653d681eaglobal-times63a87279.png"></a>After investigation, the short video released by Twita in Twitter is the Southeast Satellite TV of China Television [] [] [] <a href="https://www.douyin.com/video/7229591717052271909"></a>Uploaded on May 5th, many users have reposted in social media.</p>
<p>The content of this short video has also attracted the attention of Chinese and Taiwan media. "China Times" reported on May 6th that <a href="https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20230506000318-260119?chdtv"></a> ， <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpcrmmohCuc"></a>Wait for the TV station's program to discuss the matter. Then, <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aipl/202305080047.aspx"></a> 、 <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7240/7152500?from=udn-ch1_breaknews-1-cate6-news"></a>Wait for officials to express their statements one after another.</p>
<p>May 10, <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aipl/202305100033.aspx"></a>When asked how to see "Morton mentioned that if he wants to deter China and bombard the TSMC", Wu Zhaozheng responded: If you look closely at Morton's prelude, the conclusions will be different. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also released <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=95&amp;sms=73&amp;s=114642"></a>It means that the vibrato film is interpreted, deliberately misleading, and the actual statement with Morton has obvious differences.</p>
<p>Morton also responded to this, he to the Taiwan media <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aipl/202305110080.aspx"></a> 、 <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202305110005"></a>He said that the Chinese Communist Party selectively captured his speech and spread on the community network to try to destroy the partnership of Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong> What did Morton say at the seminar? </strong></p>
<p>Morton participated in the think tank on May 2nd <a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/panel/14484/united-states-and-china-navigating-strategic-competition-invite-only"></a>At 36:12 of the complete film, the host of the seminar asked Michael Mccaul, Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives -how did the United States create a deterrent force with chip -related policies?</p>
<p>Morton replied: "You know, one of the interesting ideas about deterrence is to make China clear -if you invade Taiwan, we will blow up the TSMC. I just throw this view, not because it is the best strategy, but because it is the best strategy, but it is This is an idea that is being argued. Of course, Taiwanese do not like this idea, right? So when we consider how to perform a strategy, we must consider its subsequent impact. ? Or can we still maintain lead and fully control this industry? This is a question we are trying to answer. "Meton responded: "I am not advocating this idea. What I want to say is that this is a matter of enthusiastically arguing between American decision makers. By the way, if China takes over TSMC, whether it is a Hong Kong -style takeover or actual invasion, it is actually invasion. If they can control this company intact, the United States is likely to face the same degree of economic consequences. "</p>
<p>After the conversation of Morton was edited and spread, "Booming TSMC" once again became a hot topic on cross -strait media and social media. TSMC. Asian factual investigation laboratory has previously released <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-04072023120541.html"></a>Obrain's speech at the time was disconnected.</p>
<p>in conclusion:</p>
<p>Morton has stated that he did not advocate the bombing of Taipower, but quoted the controversy of the decision makers in the United States for the possible occurrence of the Taiwan Strait War. In other words, he did not have some reports that "it is recommended to bomb TSMC to deter China", and the so -called "American politicians have destroyed Taiwan's crooked brains". "They are misleading.</p>

<p>The Federal Government of Canada announced the design of the new Canadian passport on Wednesday (May 10). According to official emphasis, the new version of the passport has the "most advanced" security anti -counterfeiting function.</p>
<p>The new Canadian passport has a number of security functions, such as using polycarbonate data pages. The personal information of the passport holder will use laser sculpture instead of ink printing, which makes the data page more durable and difficult to be tampered with and forged. At the same time, the main photo uses Kinegram anti -counterfeit foil membrane optical technology. The special perspective window has a passport holder's sub -license, and variable laser images and temperature -sensitive pigment functions are also used.</p>
<p>In artistic design, the new version of Canadian passport uses more patterns of natural beauty. Among them, the new cover adopts a pattern design with the outline of the maple leaf, which is also the first significant change in decades.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the new version of the passport also removes some historical elements in the old version of the passport, such as some important historical figures, the monument of the Vili Ling battle. The opposition and some agencies have expressed dissatisfaction. Fraser, the Minister of Kuchin, refugee and citizen affairs, responded that the design of the new passport has been consulted and negotiated with relevant government departments and the Aboriginal community.</p>
<p>Since the design of the new version of the passport has begun before the new royal coat of the British King Charles III approves, the original royal coat of coattop is still retained in the new passport.</p>
<p>The new Canadian passport will be launched later this summer. In addition, the old version of the passport is still safe and reliable. It is recommended that Canadian citizens holding valid passports only need to renew the new passport when they are close to the normal update date.</p>
<p>According to Canadian official data, since this year, the application for passports has reached a total of 209,500, and there have been 210,000 passports.</p>

<p>The U.S. Accounting Supervision Committee (PCAOB) said on May 10 that in the audit of Chinese companies listed in the United States, an unacceptable high defect rate was found. The China Securities Regulatory Commission responded on Thursday (May 11) that they were willing to cooperate with the United States to promote supervision and ensure the rights and interests of global investors.</p>
<p>According to the China Securities Regulatory Commission's response to Reuters, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated that the US accounting regulatory agency found that defects were normal in the first audit. Beijing will continue to cooperate with the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Accounting Supervision Committee of the United States made investigation and review reports on China's KPMG Huazhenllp and Hong Kong Polo Yongdao Accountants (PWC) last year. EricaWilliams, chairman of the committee, said in a statement that the report shows that there is an unacceptable high defect rate of the audit work of the two accounting firms, so that the staff of the committee believes that the audit company has not obtained enough appropriate audit evidence, and it will come. Support its internal control of financial reports or financial reports of listed companies.</p>
<p>The United States and China reached an agreement in August last year to try to solve the long -term dispute about the audit compliance of China Stock Corporation. Beijing allows the United States to conduct audit inspections on Chinese companies listed in New York to avoid about 200 Chinese listed companies, including Alibaba and JD.com, may be delisted from the US stock market to the market.</p>
