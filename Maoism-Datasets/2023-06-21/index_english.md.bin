Chinese official media reports that China is willing to cooperate with Germany to contribute to "global stability and prosperity".

[** Young unemployed and new high Chinese society is a stress cooker? What "extreme situation" should Xi Jinping deal with? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/yazhou-henxiangliao/yz-06162023135901.html)*** [China Data is exposed to economic recovery, can we still go old roads? ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/jw-06162023122715.html)**

Just as the geopolitical tension in the Asia -Pacific region and the difficulty of the Chinese economy were in difficulties, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, who took office in March this year, arrived in Germany a few days ago and launched a formal visit. Xinhua News Agency reported that on the afternoon of June 18, Prime Minister Li Qiang took a charter of the State Council and left Beijing. At the invitation of German Prime Minister, Tonalz and the French government, he went to Germany to hold a seventh round of the Sino -German government for consultation and officially interviewed Germany. Visit and attend the new global financing contract summit. Wu Zhenglong, a member of the State Councilor and Secretary -General of the State Council, left Beijing with the same machine.

Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of Sydney, Australia, said in an interview with this station on Tuesday (20) that Li Qiang's choice of European interviews was to get rid of the situation of internal and external difficulties. He said: "He is now internal and external, especially the decline in the economy can't stop, and he cannot solve it. Especially to apply the power of the Communist Party of China to a comprehensive control of society and the economy. Destroy the economy and eliminate wealth. "

Li Qiang's visit to Germany and France is just the West's support for China to support Russia, trade protection methods, and deterioration of human rights.

** Scholars: Europe believes that China does not directly threatened it **

Feng Chongyi said that Li Qiang's trip also shouldered that Europe moved closer to Beijing in the field of diplomacy to compete in the United States: "He has a united front strategic plan to combat the major enemies in the United States and all places outside the United States as the object of the United Front. Europe is a region where they have been working hard and achieved quite successful. Because Europe has an inherent needs, he needs to establish a multi -level world, and China has not threatened directly to Europe in geopolitics. "

Germany President Frank Walter Stein Melben emphasized the importance of Sino-US relations on "global security and cooperation" on Monday. After writing on Twitter. "He calls for strengthening the communication channels between the two countries."

Cai Shenkun, a financial commentator who pays attention to the situation in China and even the international situation, said that Li Qiang's visit to Europe has many considerations, mainly to save the domestic economy. He said to this station: "The economy in the first half of the year has a downturn, and exports have almost comprehensively declined. Affected by the epidemic, the consumer purchasing power of the world has slowed the rhythm. Therefore, China also imagined that the foreign trade surplus during the epidemic situation in the past three years is possible. This possibility Sex does not exist. In this case, he must maintain a connection with the economic or political aspect of the Western power. "

The United States and the European Union have become more and more vigilant on issues such as the Russia -Ukraine War. On Monday, NATO Secretary -General Yanz Stoltenberg said in Berlin that many people had previously believed that buying natural gas from Russia was "pure business decision and now tasted suffering." He also named China, "We must never make the same mistakes against other authoritarian regimes, especially China."

Cai Shenkun said that Li Qiang's visit to Europe expects to improve the relationship with the West, especially if you want to differentiate the relationship between morality and France and the United States, which is almost impossible. He said: "Especially when the Russian and Ukrainian war fiercely, you have to divide the steps of Europe and the United States, and it is impossible to succeed. Moreover, a prime minister can't finish such a task."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Li Qiang left Beijing by "charter". Unlike his former Li Keqiang, he visited the special plane. According to public information, Wang Yi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, recently visited Russia and Europe, all took special planes.

According to Chinese industry insiders, special planes are used for senior government officials or important characters, such as President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and important figures such as Huawei Finance Meng Wanzhou returned from Canada. The charter is usually renting the entire aircraft, which is paid by the government or enterprise. When the charter machine needs to go off and land in accordance with the relevant procedures of civil aviation regulations, such as security checks, registration and other procedures. Dedicated planes enjoy exemption, without having to go through these processes during the take -off and landing process.

### "Full -time Children": Under the severe employment situation in China, the reorganization of young people is it "self -anesthesia"?

* Chang Siying * BBC Chinese

June 20, 2023![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-20T02-03-53.000Z/_130154992_screenshot.jpg)Image adding text,

Chen Du has been a full -time daughter in the past few months.

** 29 -year -old Julie has made game planning in a company in Beijing, and her frequent overtime has gradually made her unbearable. In April of this year, after discussing with her retired parents, she decided to resign and go home to accompany the second elder, and also planned a good plan for the next life. **

Except for more time to accompany her parents, her family does not need her to help too much. However, she said that as the only child, herself who never did housework before starting to clean up the room.

Julie said that the daily life expenses were mainly borne by her parents. Mom also proposed to give her a living expenses of 2,000 yuan per month, but she did not collect it.

Her parents did not seem to be high in her requirements. I just hope that she can "maintain a normal state of living, don't sleep too late, don't indulge herself too late."

The "full -time children" lifestyle like Julie became popular among Chinese young people, causing heated discussions online and academic attention. Most of them were frustrated or in the bottleneck in the early stage of the workplace. They decided to return home to live with their parents and get recognition by accompanying their parents or undertaking some household chores.

Some people even signed a simple labor contract with their parents, which listed above to pay and pay -how much does it cost to accompany the parents for an hour.

Behind the "full -time children" is China's high unemployment rate. According to the latest official data of China, in May this year, the unemployment rate of young people aged 16 to 24 rose to 20.8%, which has set a record high since two consecutive months in 2018. Among them, the situation of college graduates is even worse. According to Zhuo Xian, a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council of China, the unemployment rate of college students is 1.4 times that of the overall unemployment rate of young people, and it is the main group of young people's unemployment population.

Lu Xi, an assistant professor at the School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore, said: "Full -time children are an unavoidable phenomenon in the tide of social unemployment, and behind it is the status quo of serious decline and atrophy of the entire socioeconomic economy."

The most difficult graduation season in history in 2023: Chinese young people "squeeze" temples to pray for work

[Chinese university graduates exceed 10 million "this year is really difficult"](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-61632336)* [Chinese young people struggling between "inner volume" and "lying flat"](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-57304453)
###  workplace anxiety

Julie said that in the past five or six years, overtime is a commonplace. A few months before resigning, the company was more compulsory to ask for overtime. She often leaves home at 9 o'clock in the morning, and returns at 1 o'clock in the evening. "Live like a walking dead."

"Don't take sleeping pills at night, dreaming is in the company, and the content of the dream is related to work. Then wake up in the morning and go to work again. I feel that I work in 24 hours."

In China, the 996 working system (facing 9 to 9, every Saturday day) is quite common, especially in the technology industry. In the fierce market competition, many start -ups are required to work overtime because they have no core competitiveness that they can only pursue speed and intensity, so they are required to work overtime, and they usually do not pay the corresponding remuneration.

Julie said that if there are colleagues in the company, the human resources department will receive hundreds of resumes soon, and recruiting newcomers will never be a problem, which also encourages the company's overtime atmosphere. "After three months of overtime, I found that I didn't know the colleagues of the team."

Her parents accepted her home as a "full -time daughter" because they felt that their daughter could not find the object at such a big age. The big reason was related to overtime. So she expressed her understanding of her resignation, hoping that she could find a relatively free job.

Chen Du, who engaged in real estate -related work in Chongqing, resigned early this year and returned to a small county in his hometown of Yunnan, and became a "full -time daughter".

During the new crown epidemic, her industry was particularly sluggish. The company calculates wages by the basic salary plus commission, and its income has decreased sharply in the past one or two years. The deduction of daily expenses includes 2,000 yuan per month, and there are basically few.

"The assessment is getting stricter, and when the performance is the best, the goal cannot be achieved," Chen Du, 27, said. Coupled with the depression caused by long -term control in many places during the epidemic, she felt that "suddenly I can't see hope."

"During the time last year, I felt that why workers were so sad, got up early every day, worked in unparalleled, and did a lot of salary every day. I thought it was too sad. Why would people live like this? "

###  Gap year? Old?

Some people compare the "full -time children" with the "Gapyear" popular among foreign university graduates. Many graduates use this transition time to practice themselves in the society, or plan to change or enhance the competitiveness of the workplace for the next step.

However, some scholars have pointed out that "full -time children" are suspected of being old, and the impact on family and society cannot be underestimated.

Scholar Lu Xi said that young people who choose "interval to a year" generally have very clear plans. The most common is to go out to study for a master's degree in the workplace, or participate in other vocational training, even if a few people choose to go out to travel to travel It is also a choice that has very strong expectations and confidence in the future career.

Most of the "full -time children" in China are forced to stay at home. There is no clear career planning. Social practice cannot be accumulated at home. With the increasing competition in the employment market, there are more and more people in the exams and postgraduate entrance examinations; even if they are examined, they will face greater squeezing in the future unemployed market, and may not be able to find a suitable job.Lu Xi said that in this case, many people doing full -time children are actually "self -worth without self -anesthesia when they have no way to get social affirmation and acceptance."

At the same time, from the perspective of the government, quoting new terms such as "full -time children", or encouraging the phenomenon of "full -time children" on the Internet, mainly to avoid using the words such as "high unemployment rate" to reduce society to reduce society Contradiction, he said.

But in the final analysis, "the essence of full -time children is unemployment," Lu Xi said straightforwardly.

"Considering the labor participation rate and the proportion of postgraduate entrance examinations and examinations, the unemployment rate of young people in Chinese young people will be far more than 20%. Therefore, there will be more and more full -time children in China in the future, especially in the group of fresh graduates."

Some scholars believe that the essence of full -time children in the final analysis is unemployment.

Lu Xi said that the full -time children will reduce the disposable income of the parents, especially when the parents pay a certain pay to their children, which will eventually lead to the downgrade of the consumption of the entire family.

For parents, these money can originally flow to the market to buy goods or services. For their children, taking money from their parents means that their future revenue expects decline. At the same time, due to the decrease in new wealth created, their own consumption will decline.

"The more full -time children, the faster the consumption of society," Lu Xi said.

From an individual perspective, he suggested that young people can choose to start their own business, or transfer their eyes to foreign markets, such as looking for opportunities in Southeast Asian countries with a more economical economy. He also warned that this needs to be done by personal opportunities and personality, not suitable for everyone.

Zhou Yun, a sociological assistant professor at the University of Michigan, compares "full -time children" with "full -time mothers" as an analogy. She said that more than two decades ago, a "full -time" trend in American society -the white -collar mother who had been educated "independently withdrew" the workplace and returned to the family as a full -time mother. At that time, the women had to make the choice of "ideal employees" and "ideal mother" at that time. "These mothers are not so much‘ independent exit ’, it’ s better to be ‘squeezed out’. ”

Similarly, in today's China, the "not optimistic employment situation, the workplace's requirements for 996 '" ideal employees', how will people imagine the future after the epidemic, imagine a series of social factors with society and the country. " Don't be a full -time child, she said.

### Hard employment

Julie said that her parents have retired, and each person has a pension of thousands of yuan per month. For her, being a "full -time child" can only be an appropriate measure.

In the past half a month, she has invested more than 40 resumes to the intermediary company and recruitment unit, but most of them have sinking the sea, and only two have received interview notices.

"I felt that my work was not easy to find before resigning, but after I really resigned, I found that the work was even difficult to find," Julie said.

She studied abroad and returned to work in Beijing after graduating in 2017. At that time, China's GDP growth rate reached nearly 7%throughout the year, achieving the first rise in seven years. She quickly found a decent job.

However, in recent years, the Chinese government has focused on rectifying the Internet, games, teaching and training, and many companies have revealed the news of large -scale layoffs under the impact. Coupled with strict control during the epidemic, commercial activities have stagnated, and China's economy has slowed sharply. In this case, the competition in the employment market has intensified, the depreciation of academic qualifications, low work salary, and prevalence of overtime make many young people difficulty in employment.

Julie said that she was surprised to find that more and more new colleagues around him either graduated from key universities in China or studying abroad in overseas famous universities. She said that the game planning itself does not require too high education, and the reason why these high students come in compete to compete to a large extent that they cannot find a job in a better job. Employment space for graduates of prestigious schools.

The two interviews she just received recently was eventually defeated to students who graduated from prestigious schools. She regrets her decision to be anxious to return home to employment, "I regret not going abroad to continue a graduate student."

### Reinventing?

Some people say that although the lives of full -time children are very comfortable, "lying down" is only appearance, anxiety is their norm.

"No (anxiety) is impossible," said Chen Du, Yunnan. There are two voices in her heart in the opposition: "One is very willful, I feel that there is such time, and I have not figured out the future plan, so I must enjoy the present; the other I am reminding you to give you three or four, four or four For a month, you have to start thinking about what to do next, and you can't go like that. "

Although their parents did not say anything, they also had anxiety in their hearts. My parents occasionally ask her, how to plan next.

"In fact, they can actually hear it. They are a little worried," Chen Du said, "I don't know the future plan, but I can't tell them that I don't know, I will say that I will rest for a while. "

Looking back at the experience of doing a full -time daughter in the past few months, Chen Du said with emotion: "Parents are very hard -working and diligent people. Now when I think about it, I really feel embarrassed. They got up at seven or eight and went to work. They worked so hard at the age of 50, but I lay flat at home. "

"I think if I go on for a long time, I will really be old," she said.

Her mentality has changed. From the "want to lie down" after the workplace was frustrated, she transitioned to "the volume must be rolled." She already has new goals. Forced yourself, simply set the schedule, and ended the comfort of the comfortable full -time daughter. She has left the real estate industry and returned to a big city to start a business.

Image adding text,

Chen Du, a family in Yunnan, said, "If you go on for a long time, I will really be old."

Beijing's Julie said that she would try to control the anxiety. "After all, the resignation was to maintain mental health. If she couldn't find a job to continue anxiety, it was equivalent to white resignation."

In order to avoid "old -fashioned", Julie set herself a boundary. "Consumption other than consumption other than traveling, can not use parents' money."

She sold her old book and the star -making products that she had saved when she was young, and saved some pocket money. She also made the savings of previous work into wealth management products. "If the market is good, she can earn 50 to 100 yuan a day."After finding up to work for almost a month, there were still few interviews, and Julie decided to switch to career. With the help of a full -time child, she gave her a convenient life -no need to pay for rent, and the time was relatively loose -she started to write a web article for a living, and set the goal of 5,000 words a day for herself.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-20T04-30-33/1-1687234967.jpg)Former US President Donald Trump(Anadoru News Agency)Although he left the White House two and a half years ago, due to his prosecution, former US President Donald Trump still attracted the attention of the world and attracted the attention of people at home and abroad. This person is facing two criminal prosecutions, one of which includes 34 allegations to him by the New York State Prosecutor Alvin Prague in April 2022. The allegations include forging a business records and sealing a porn actress during the 2016 campaign period. fee.

>> If it wasn't for the existence of supporting him and regarding him as a hero and a savior, Trump would not have the ability to violate the US system and standardized ability to achieve this degree of self -confidence and arrogance. Therefore, we are not dealing with a person, but we are dealing with a situation or a phenomenon. Some people call it "Trumpism"

The second prosecution was proposed by the private detective Jack Smith in Florida, including 37 allegations. The most important of which was to retain the official documents without permission, refused to transfer it to the competent department, and in certain cases, and in certain cases Published a misleading statement to hinder judicial justice. This violated the Presidential Archives Law in 1978 and a "Anti -Spy Law" issued more than a century ago. In other words, Trump is close to 71 criminal charges, which has never happened in the history of the United States for nearly two and a half centuries.

For people like Trump, these things seem to be strange. He is the first US president to be impeached by Congress during the term of the president in history. He is also the first American to not acknowledge the 2020 presidential election. President, and he still insisted that the election results were controlled.

He was also the first US president to stimulate supporters to impact the US Congress to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the presidential election. The matter led to chaos and turmoil on January 6, 2021.

He was also the first American president to refuse to disclose his financial disclosure and tax records, and he is now considered to be the first American president to contempt and the law, and even blame his Democratic opponent to frame judicial politics.

Despite all the above situations, Trump is still the most likely to win the presidential candidate to be held in 2024, especially because he is leading in the Republican election and far ahead of the closest competitors in Florida. Ron De Santis.

Therefore, we are facing an unsatisfactory rules and traditions in American political history, and Trump tried to try to break the usual rules and traditions.

The fact is that if it is not because of supporting him and regarding him as a hero and a savior, Trump will not have the ability to violate the US system and standardized ability to achieve this degree of confidence and arrogance. Therefore, we are not dealing with a person, but that we are dealing with a situation or a phenomenon, and some people call it "Trumpism."

Trumpism is a phenomenon that ZTE has been developing in the past two decades because the Democratic Party has implemented a series of policies during the administration of President Barack Obama. One of Trump's most prominent features reflected in Trump, at least in his speech: Lost confidence in the central government, his position is extremely hostile, and all democracy and all its republican ingredients for traditional political classes and its republican ingredients The strong rejection, not to mention the exclusion of immigrants and the hostility of the foreigners (outer psychology), strict social welfare plans, and striving to reduce the role of the federal government in the management economy and state affairs.

The opposite of some people may think that Trump's test is not a bad thing for him, but a gift installed on the gold disk, which reappears his hope of becoming the next US president. This person lost a lot of reputation in the Republican circle, especially after the "red wave" that he promoted during the mid -term election of the US Congress, which means that the Republican Party swept the two hospitals in the parliament in the election held in November 2022 ( House of Representatives and Senate). But this did not happen, because the Democratic Party kept the Senate, and the Republicans won the House of Representatives with a weak advantage. Democrats believed that this was an obvious victory.

Therefore, Trump has succeeded in and will continue to invest in his experiments and actively use them to make a profit for his campaign. This has happened in the following aspects:

* First: Encourage the Republican foundation to support it as the "victims" of the United States and its institutions, especially the Ministry of Justice and the Federal Investigation Agency, as well as promoting his conspiracy to be exposed to the Democrats who are afraid of his return to the White House. Obviously, this kind of words about the victim's identity have resonated with great resonance among his Republican branch. According to the latest polls conducted by Reuters last week, nearly 80%of them believe that the trial of Trump is out. Political motivation. * Second: Add campaign donation. Trump successfully raised nearly $ 34 million in four months in 2023, including the announcement of about $ 4 million on the eve of New York. With the increase of his cases and allegations, the benefits of these donations are expected to increase in the next few weeks. * Third: Greatly pulling the gap between him and Republican opponent Ron De Santis. According to a polls conducted by Reuters last week, about 43%of Republicans will vote to Trump in the upcoming election, and De Santis will only have 22%, almost twice the gap. * Fourth: Applying greater pressure on President Joe Biden, he is still the main candidate for the Democratic Presidential election until now. Trump is benefiting from these trials, and he is accused of supporting them because he is worried that he is worried about his failure in the coming election.

Therefore, the urgent question is: If Trump was convicted and imprisoned, can he become the president of the United States? The answer is: Yes.

** From the perspective of the constitution, there are 3 conditions for presidential candidates: **

* 1. First: candidate was born in the United States. * 2. Second: It must have lived in the United States for no less than 14 years. * 3. Third: The age of the presidential position should not be less than 35 years old.

These three conditions Trump meets. Therefore, he has the right to run for the president and nothing can stop him. On the contrary, there are many discussions about his rights to manage the country during the presidential period in prison. Although some people think that if he becomes a president, he can pardon his decision, but this has never happened in the history of the United States.

The most likely is that if Trump continues to participate in the presidential election, he will win the presidential election. On the contrary, Biden's political and economic performance has disappointed many people for more than two years. Therefore, Trump may once again become the next US president.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) US Secretary of State [Blinger at the end of the visit to China, I met Chinese leader Xi Jinping](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯告诉习近平拜登认为美中有义务处理好关系/a-65956287)It seems to be a positive signal in German media. "South Germany" published a comment, "Sometimes, those who determine the political climate are small words." This comment entitled "Wo Jedes World" wrote::

"'Progress" is such a word. Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping pointed out in a meeting with US Secretary of State Tony Brillings that Sino -US relations have achieved' progress ". And the significance is not only that, this is also a huge political capital, and it must be clever to bet.

The biggest perception of Bollingin's visit to China is that people realize that although there are various competitions between the two sides of the (USA), they still hope to continue their diplomatic efforts and they can still find common languages. Brinken carefully calculated the concession to be accepted by the Chinese side, and the latter also signaled to return to the predictable track -the United States and Xi Jinping under the rule of Trump to strive for the third term and China during the epidemic period. This track. Since 2017, bilateral relations have fallen into a trough. Now, a period of cautious review has begun. How dangerous is the state of nothing to say between the two most powerful economies in the world? There have been sufficient examples in the past few years. The situation that China's system is easy to cause is to cover up the internal weakness by displaying strongly. The domestic anti -China mood in the United States has long been separated from reality. The internal tribe of China has launched a strong competition to see who is more tough to make the country be at a loss.

### Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

Blingken arrived in Beijing on the morning of June 18, arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in the afternoon to talk with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang. However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."

After talking with Qin Gang, Brinken wrote in Twitter that the two sides discussed how to manage the relationship between the two countries in charge through open communication channels. The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.

On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be in the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.

Therefore, it is wise to consider how to manage this relationship. The United States took the initiative and China responded. After long -term mutual communication, this result cannot be underestimated. "

### Competitive partner

The "Daily" published by Berlin focuses on the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang led a group to visit Berlin to participate in [intergovernmental consultation between Germany and Chinese government](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/难度高悬念大德中政府磋商全面开启/a-65972739)Essence The author believes that China is launching a charm of Europe, and Germany is still regarded by China as the most important partner in the European Union. But this article entitled "Berlin's popular carpet from Beijing's opponents" wrote:

"However, the German government should not be blinded by Shun Er's words. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has undergone tremendous changes. It's right.

Beijing's increasingly offensiveness internationally shows its increasingly aggressiveness, its increasing military threat to Taiwan, the thorough suppression of the Hong Kong democratic movement, and the stronger intervention of economic activities, all of which have made Germany's domestic attitude towards China very Great impact. No one has talked about ‘it’ s a transformation with trade ’. Nonetheless, as the German Federal Prime Minister Shulz (Social Party) said last week, it was the timing of dialogue, ‘‘ in the current world situation, mutual exchanges are very meaningful. ‘

### is how to re -position relations with China

The German government holds a pragmatic optimism on this issue, and the government spokesman WolfgangBüchner said he looked forward to a 'good and constructive communication ". The theme of this consultation is ‘Common and Sustainable Action’, which is intended to emphasize the level of partners in relations with Chinese relations. Regarding Germany -China relations, Berlin is tirelessly described as the definition of "partners, competitors and strategic rivals".

However, recently, the center of gravity is increasingly biased towards the direction of strategic opponents. The national security strategy announced in Berlin this Wednesday also shows this. The strategy emphasizes that China has repeatedly adopted the interests and values of the interests and values of us (Germany) ', and at the same time, the development partnership and the possible areas of realistic possible areas are narrowing.

The article finally wrote: "The lessons of the Russian relations have been absorbed. The federal government has a huge dependence on Germany to China (compared to Russia) and chose the slogan of" de-Risking ". Reduce risks and dependence so that Beijing will be threatened to implement and attack Taiwan. However, for some German companies and multinational companies, its dependence on the Chinese market and production bases has to be so great that it has to do so, and has to do it. Long -term transformation. "

The shipping industry is the pillar of the global trade and global economy, and the number of shipping trade accounts for 80%of the global trade volume. At the same time, the shipping industry is facing severe challenges. According to IMO data, the global shipping industry emits about 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas each year, accounting for about 3%of the global total emissions, and the carbon emission reduction pressure for the shipping industry is huge. The geopolitical conflict caused by the Russian -Ukraine conflict, as well as the trend of globalization brought about by the decoupling of industries in some regions, has a huge impact on the global supply chain while disturbing the development of the shipping market.

More importantly, today, with the continuous enhancement of regional security and risk awareness, countries around the world have stepped up the protection and management of data information, and the corresponding data security bill has been introduced one after another. For industries such as deep globalization such as the international shipping industry, ships must sail globally, data must be shared globally, how to break through national geographical and space restrictions, and to achieve a balance between global sharing of data and localized protection? While continuously improving its own digital ability construction, and meeting the requirements of data security between different customers, it is a problem placed in front of all shipping companies.

During the 2023 Beijing Maritime Exhibition, FT Chinese website exclusively dialogue with Mr. Constant Digital Global CEO SHANEMCARDLE. Constant Group was established in Norway in 1814 and has now become the world's leading multinational industrial group company. The fields of coverage include military industry, automobiles, gas turbines, CNC, maritime, aviation and aerospace industry. As a subsidiary of the Constant Group, Kangsper Number is not only the digital professional and technical center of the group, but also the advanced generation of next -generation software and digital solution providers. Serve.

During the interview, Mr. SHANEMCARDLE focused on the response and challenges of multinational companies under the Russian and Ukraine War and the Global Geopolical Transformation Bureau, the interest pattern and opportunity challenge behind the energy transformation, the global sharing and localization strategy of data in the background of the national security, etc. He gave his thoughts and answers.

Here are some interview records.

** FT Chinese website **: We noticed that you were responsible for energy -related work before you served as CEO. You also have a deep energy industry experience. Can you share the prospects of climate change and energy transformation. How to cope with the changes that are here?

** SHANE MCARDLE **: Climate change has aroused global attention, and energy transformation is the top priority. Human beings urgently need to find new types of replacement energy that is both safe and economical and green, and this work is easy to work. Every industry breaks the problem, and the shipping industry is no exception. Data show that the shipping industry accounts for 3%of global carbon dioxide emissions, and accounts for 4%of global fuel consumption. According to the requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), by 2050, the entire shipping industry will meet the 50%of the greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. Obviously, this is obviously not an easy -to -reach goal, and the entire industry needs to move from now on.

We believe that we can start from two aspects to accelerate this process. The first one is of course technological innovation. We have seen that many heart technology is used in the shipping industry, such as new fuel, offshore wind energy, hydrogen energy, carbon capture, etc. Many of them are "going to the sea" in terrestrial technology, and the development of new energy and new biological energy at sea and new biological energy. Can feed the land. Another important area is digital. With digital tools, you can better obtain numbers and information. Whether it is based on traditional operations, cost reduction, efficiency, energy conservation and emission reduction, or moving towards new technologies, it will be more evident. And if these data are only isolated, they will not exert greater value. For example, just using more advanced technology and fuel management on a ship can not change the entire industry. Instead, it is necessary to encourage the creation of an open digital ecology in the industry. Everyone shared public data, not only shipping companies, shipowners, cargo owners, and even ports, cities, etc. When they formulate standards, they can pass more data through more data. As a reference and basis, more reasonable labeling and policies can be developed.

** FT Chinese website **: The Russian -Ukraine conflict is still continuing, which not only has a huge impact on the energy market, but also seriously affects the global supply chain. Can you please share your observation and understanding of this issue?

** SHANE MCARDLE **: This war that is still ongoing has a significant influence on the global business world and the industrial chain industry. I think even it has completely changed the European mentality. Safety is now the first priority of everyone. We have to achieve safety through all aspects. Of course, the safety of energy is also one of the very important parts.

In the past, Russia's energy was cheap. We bought a large amount of energy in Russia. These energy sources were transported to Europe through the gas pipeline, which is as convenient as tap water. But today's war made us realize that the safety of energy is the first place, and there is no more important thing than this. So today we are very eager to find a safer and sustainable alternative energy source, and of course its price cannot be outrageous. But we all know that the current price of replacement energy is not cheap, so this is a big challenge.

We hope to increase exchanges and technical sharing with around the world to find more secure, reliable and more affordable energy solutions.

** FT Chinese website **: You mentioned digitalization just now, so what do you think of the digitalization of Chinese companies?

** SHANE MCARDLE **: Chinese companies have a strong demand for digitalization, and 50%of our new orders are from China. This shows the market's attention and recognition of digital transformation. This time I came to China to have the opportunity to visit China Maritime Services Services, which will provide digital training for 1.8 million sea ships and seafarers in China. This number is amazing, you must know that there are at least 900,000 sea ships and seafarers. These training can largely improve the construction of marine talents, which will help the development of marine companies.

This is like today's traditional manufacturing enterprises. When facing digital transformation, it has continuously increased the digital capacity building of employees and the cultivation of digital talents. Such companies are obviously more combable in the future. The same is true of industries including the shipping industry. For example, taking the shipbuilding industry as an example, China is a global shipbuilding country, and orders in the world are the first in the world, but this depends on the scale to win. In terms of higher -end ships, or special ships, China is not the best in the world. of. In the future, China may break through with digital technology.

Of course, I think that the epidemic has accelerated the digitalization of the enterprise to some extent. Of course, this is not just in China, but the world's companies. In the past few years, because of the epidemic, we have no way to work closely with customers as in the past, and at the same time, customers have no way to ask employees to come to a fixed office space like in the past, so the digital transformation speed of the work scenario is very fast. Although the epidemic has ended, this trend will not change.** SHANE MCARDLE **: I want to emphasize it here that data security and data opening are not contradictory. It does not say that opening is unsafe. Digitalization is the cornerstone of today's information society. We generate massive data every day. Most of these data are public data, and a large part of them can be shared in the industry.

Taking the energy industry as an example, after decades of development, the entire industry has formed a very complete data system. These data include clear industry public data. It will not have any threats to enterprises. After disclosure, it can promote the whole Industry has accumulated experience and continuously developing, especially to promote industry security standards.

There are many cross -border data in different fields, which also need to be made very public. For example, the data obtained by many maritime satellites or spacecraft, which belongs to the common wealth of human beings, can help the shipping industry better sail on the sea, help the international trade and industry chain; they can also help searches at sea to search and rescue, etc. Work, protect the safety of the people, and so on. There are many trading data, price data, etc. These are like a large amount of data that can be used in the stock market and financial markets that we are familiar with. They promote transactions and promote industry prosperity.

Therefore, when we discuss data, we must not be generalized, as if the data is open is a flood beast. In fact, this is not the case. Without the openness and transparency of data, it cannot bring the development and progress of the industry. However, we need to distinguish between public data and data belonging to the company's own data. We must have a clear bidding boundary, clear industry norms, and based on the long -term industry development law. This is the first point I want to emphasize.

As a number of Constance, we provide customers with a series of digital solutions. Customers can obtain a lot of data and use it for their own enterprises. This is a key step in promoting the development of enterprises, reducing costs and efficiency. These data are owned by customers. We just provide technology and do not obtain data. We must abide by local laws in different countries, which is the second point I want to emphasize.

** FT Chinese website **: The electric vehicle represented by Tesla has changed the entire automotive industry, thereby subverting the entire industry chain. Some people have analogized ships and cars. Do you think there may be changes like Tesla in today's shipping industry to change and reshape the entire industry?

** SHANE MCARDLE **: Electric vehicles represented by Tesla do have subverted the traditional car industry for hundreds of years. Interestingly, from the perspective of many people, Tesla should be considered a software company, not a car company.

There is no doubt that cutting -edge technologies such as autonomous driving and AI are changing people's travel methods, and also promoting changes in transportation rules. The top technology giants and car manufacturers have made great bets in the field of unmanned travel. We also see the possibility of new technology. For example, technologies such as autonomous driving and AI are changing people's travel methods, and these new technologies have changed huge changes in the shipping industry. Therefore, cars and airplanes on land are entering the "unmanned era", and the water boats on the water are also facing "Tesla".

Constitution and other leading scientific and technological companies in the world worked hard in this direction. We have created the world's first unmanned ship. It not only set up many advanced technologies, but also to use clean energy, it is a sustainable green environmental protection transportation. In the future, unmanned ships have a broad prospect for freight, scientific research, and military. But in a short time, in a short time, it has experienced drastic changes like the automobile industry, and I think there are still challenges and difficulties. There are three reasons here:

The first is that shipping is more complicated than land transportation. Sailing on the vast sea is far more complicated than driving on California's highways. Therefore, the requirements for energy reliability and the requirements of technical system stability are much greater. The second is that the shipbuilding industry is much more complicated than the automotive industry. At present, international navigation ships in global operations have entered 80,000 ships. The age of service is different and the retirement periods are different. The cost of the ship is much higher than that of the car. Therefore, it is difficult to replace it at one time, and it can only be replaced slowly. At present, the good news is that the new orders have very strong informatization and digital technology equipment. Everyone has seen this trend. The third is as I mentioned before that the shipping industry is a global industry. Shipbuilding is in one country, the shipowner is in one country, and the owner is in another country. Institutions need to jointly build standards around the world to promote the change of the shipping industry.

Therefore, we call for and looking forward to work together to create a more open and transparent ecology, promote the exchange of technology and data, bring more personnel communication and collision of ideas, promote the technological change of the shipping industry, and use this with human history. The same long industry brings more future -oriented prospects.(This article only represents the author and interviewees. Editor -in -chief email: tao.feng@ftchinese.com)

# Can't choose a fund? Choose the cheapest (free version)

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-20T22-58-17-00-00/000179840_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

Many investors must have encountered similar situations: there are dozens of in front of you, even hundreds of funds or wealth management products are available. So which one should I choose?

If you take this question to ask some financial management or investment consultants, the most likely answer is: this depends on your needs. If you want high returns, you can consider choosing this technology fund. If you want to be relatively stable and the retracement is relatively small, you can consider this bond fund. If you are particularly optimistic about a certain industry, you can choose this industry or theme fund.

However, few financial consultants will tell you: You should compare the rates of these funds first, and choose a fund with a low rate.

For the vast majority of people, it is strange to buy a product or service without looking at its price. For example, whether we buy a pair of shoes, buy a car, go to the restaurant for meals, or choose a tourist package, the price is an important consideration. But in the transaction of buying funds, few people realize that they also need to carefully analyze the price of the fund (that is, the fee paid by the Kimin), and the goods are more than three.

Why is this happening? There are several main reasons behind it. First of all, many people did not realize that when they were buying funds, they were actually shopping. The actual situation is that consumers are buying financial products, but many people feel that they are investing, so he cares more about future investment returns, but forgets that costs are at least important for themselves. Secondly, some financial products reflect a certain Vanbaln effect, that is, the higher the price, the higher the demand. This is because if the seller can successfully create the scarcity of a certain financial product, then some investors will be willing to pursue their scarce investment products like chasing Hermes bags.

I remember a few years ago, a third -party financial management institution sold a fund product based on Ant Financial. The fund's investment strategy is to buy Ant Financial shares in the private equity market and hope to sell profit after the Ant Financial is listed. Although the investment strategy is simple, the fee is very high, there are purchase fees, management fees and performance sharing, and a lock -up period. At first glance, it is difficult to make people believe that investors are willing to buy such a domineering fund. However, at the time, many people were very optimistic about the stock price of Ant Financial after the listing of Ant Financial will rise sharply, and the channels for buying Ant Financial on the market are very limited. Therefore, even if the fund is expensive, many people are willing to pay. This is a typical Vanbald effect product: the scarcity of Ant Financial's shares at that time, creating investors' bidding for the product without cost.

The problem is that in reality, few investment targets are really so scarce. If you really encounter really scarce investment opportunities, you may not be able to obtain high fees. Therefore, in the capital market, many investors face the risks: pay the price of scarce products, but get a very ordinary investment product, or even a worse product than ordinary products. For example, the Ant Financial Fund mentioned above was not listed in the end, so investors not only received any return on investment, paid a lot of fees, but also lost the opportunity cost.

So in this case, how should we make rational investment decisions? A relatively simple and practical method is to buy the cheapest fund to buy. Generally speaking, buying any fund, the costs that may involve include: purchase fees, management fees, custody fees, and redemption fees. If it is purchased through a third -party wealth management consultant, you need to add the fee collected by the financial consultant. Selecting the cheapest funds to buy is to clarify all these costs, and then choose the cheapest fund to buy in the future.

I know that many readers will definitely have questions: In such a complicated financial world, use such simple rules to choose investment targets. Can you use it? In fact, this seemingly simple investment rule has great wisdom behind it.

Many statistical studies have shown that high -fee fund performance is worse, and fund performance with low charges is better. For example, the statistics of Chenxing Company (KINNEL, 2016) were all public funds in the United States from 2010 to 2015. The less expenses, the better the law, and the better the performance. Whether investing in US stock markets, US foreign stock markets, or equity bonding funds, this law is consistent.

Why do the funds that are expensive, the worse the return of Gin people? There are several main reasons behind this:

First of all, the fees of fund managers and financial consultants are contradictory with investors' investment returns, which is essentially a zero -harmony game. Fund managers' investment gross returns need to deduct various fees, and finally the net return that investors can get. The fund manager's charges are high, and the net return of investors will naturally have less net returns.

Secondly, if the fund manager's investment ability is indeed excellent and can get an excess return that is far higher than the average level, then he can collect more costs. The problem is that there are a large number of fund managers in the market. In the end, the outstanding manager who can really continue to overcome the market is rare.

For example, as of April 2023, China's public fund market had 1,314 closed funds and 9599 open funds, and the two increased up to more than 10,000. The number of private equity funds industries is larger. Also as of April 2023, there were as many as 8,658 private equity investment fund managers, and the number of management funds reached 99,775, which was close to 100,000. The above is only the number of funds investing in the secondary securities market. There is no private equity and venture capital funds that include the investment first -level market. With such a large fund manager, everyone may feel that they are the king of Buffett again, but in reality, how many people are really capable of defeating the market to create excess returns? This is exactly the dilemma encountered by Kimin investors: the price of Ferrari or Mercedes -Benz was paid, but it got a Toyota Corolla.

This is why, for investors with limited investment knowledge and experience, a better choice is to choose the cheapest fund to buy. Of course, the fund needs to meet some basic requirements. For example, it is a public fund, and the number of funds has reached a certain scale. It has a certain investment history. The investment strategy is a relatively low -diversified broad -based index with a relatively low risk. To choose a fund along this logic, you may not choose funds with good investment performance, but you can effectively avoid the pit and avoid those funds with expensive charges and poor performance.

Since last fall, with the warnings with various currency authorities, the outbreak of a series of financial disadvantages, banking institutions have continued bankruptcy, regulatory grayscale decreased, regulatory measures have become tightened and strengthened. Digital asset transactions have become more comprehensive. Global digital asset transactions are in a low tide, and the so -called "inclusiveness" supervision is going far ...

In the past few years, globally, most of the regulatory authorities have not adopted a position that banned digital asset transactions. The reason is that one is the lack of clear subjective motivation and considerable social pressure, and the other is to have a considerable degree of legal obstacles.

From the perspective of domestic law, although the digital assets itself does not have a clear legal definition, the transactions that are made around them have not violated civil law in principle. As a result, although some regulatory authorities have no clear words, in fact, the transactions are regarded as some kind of gaming -like activities. The specific regulatory regulations are like: or restrict the participation of the country's participation in the transaction, and provide transactions for foreign people; or adopt an exchange. The filing system, although the non -filing person does not specify where to deal with it, has to maintain its power to follow up; or the list of lists that can be traded for trading digital assets, and the free tailoring of the follow -up disposal for those who have not included in the list is reserved. This is the so -called "inclusive supervision", which provides certain domestic legal convenience for related trading activities because of its legal attributes of digital assets and their transactions. In fact, Japan, Singapore, and even the United States and other countries have held this tolerance or even position on digital asset transactions.

From an international legal point of view, if the major economies have a "semi -open" position on digital asset transactions, then many other small countries or offshore economies have adopted a nearly legitimate position on digital asset transactions. This brings a new pattern, the so -called offshore legal, "tolerance" supervision on the shore. As a result, the strategy route of digital asset transactions is -the offshore legitimate establishment institution has a substantial transaction on the shore, and customers and funds are widely absorbed on the shore. Such a "residence crab model" is beyond the category of tolerance supervision on the shore, and in fact, it has entered the field of gray supervision. Because the offshore source is "legal", the coastal regulatory authorities have not made a substantial judgment on the "monsters" of digital asset transactions that float and go ashore, and most of them are determined by procedures. Most of them have actually released things.

As mentioned above, the legislature has not been able to make a clear legal definition on digital assets, nor can it be completely banned from related transaction activities. Then the remaining only guards are in terms of supervision of the trading system.

From a legal point of view, since the "legitimacy" of unbearable digital assets has not been explicitly banned from the root of civil law, then, the regular trading activities that have done around it must inevitably require the "appropriateness" in business law. In other words, although there is no certificate of birth, it has not "killed" digital assets in civil law and grows up with digital assets. After all, it must be allowed to "activities" in business law and give it a "ID card".

The so -called "activity" mainly refers to trading activities, which requires corresponding regulatory arrangements. First of all, it is necessary to determine that digital asset transactions belong to commodity transactions or securities transactions. There is no essential difference for digital trading activities itself. It is just different types of supervision arrangements. The difference is that securities transactions have higher power than commodity transactions, and they must accept stricter supervision. Specifically, commodity transactions or securities transactions are just for digital asset exchanges or trading platforms, and specific transactions are not required. In other words, the trading platform needs to apply for a commodity transaction license or securities transaction permit to face different regulatory authorities. Generally speaking, first apply for a relatively easy or accurate commodity trading regulatory license license, and then apply for a relatively strict securities trading regulatory license license.

The establishment of the digital asset trading platform is not complicated, and it can be established as a corporate legal person based on the company's law. The application and approved application of its commodity trading or securities trading qualification licenses must make corresponding arrangements in accordance with the compliance guidance of the regulatory authorities. These processes are completed only with the qualifications to provide corresponding trading activities. How to conduct transaction arrangements through the trading platform requires a large and perfect compliance guidance arrangement. These arrangements include, but not limited to the operating procedures, customer protection, capital regulations, etc. of the exchange platform.

The problem is that the regulatory authorities did not give the compliance guidance in time, which lack of willingness and limited capacity; similarly, although the digital asset trading platform repeatedly expressed the attitude of embrace supervision, it also lacks their will, and they spare no effort to use the supervision. Perfect and seek benefits, or even its interest models are deeply rooted here.

The banking institutions that provide funds account services for digital asset transactions have played a more critical role. They know how to manage and avoid risks in law, and maximize the benefits. In fact, digital asset transactions occupy a large number of bank capital positions, and relevant banking institutions have also obtained abundant sources of funding. It should be noted that these funds are stored in the bank accounts opened in the name of digital asset trading platform companies or related companies. In the bank account of the trading platform and its related companies, they have substantial disposal capabilities. The banking institution fully understands this situation, and these cheap funds help ensure the liquidity of the bank and improve the asset quality of the bank institution. Therefore, it also holds the situation that may violate the status of digital asset trading customers. "The attitude, make gray choice.

In the United States, a considerable part of the customer's bank funds of digital asset transactions have been used by banks to purchase low -risk assets such as US Treasury bonds. Sexual crisis and vicious circulation are forcing many banks to closing the door continuously.

Digital asset transactions once absorbed huge amounts of bank funds, but regulatory negligence and a series of gray choices in many parties caused huge losses, which caused a series of bankruptcy and disadvantages. tight. Digital asset transactions are like mud feet giants struggling in the surging regulatory wandering. They must have fewer and less gray space because of a series of non -black or white facts ...

A few days ago, foreign ministers from seven EU member states including Germany, Belgium and Romania jointly issued the "EU foreign decisions to more effective most voting systems". Foreign ministers wrote in the article, "The Russian and Ukraine War proved the EU's ability to move, and in the long run, in the global arena that is more and more uncertain, fast and decisive action is that the EU as diplomatic forces is maintaining its forces. The key to citizen value and interests. "" The EU can reach an agreement on 10 rounds of sanctions on Russia in 10 rounds. However, the EU does not always take it quickly and decisively. The voting system sometimes slows our ability to move. This is why we advocate more effective most voting system (QMV) on the EU joint diplomatic and security policy (CFSP). "

Under the increasingly complicated geopolitical situation in recent years, and the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine Germany, how the EU shows European power in the crisis, and an important issue facing is how to quickly and decisively decide. Last year, Josepborne, a senior representative of the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy and vice chairman of the European Commission, said the response made by the European Union to the Russian and U -wars means the birth of a geopolitics Europe.

There are two main methods for decision -making in foreign policy in the European Union. One is the effective majority of voting systems, such as trade policies in external operations, immigration and refugee policies in external dimensions of internal policies. Most voting systems must meet two lowest conditions, that is, 55%of the voting support of member states, and these member states represent 65%of the European Union's total population. In some sensitive areas, the main decision -making methods adopted by joint diplomatic and security policies are all unanimous voting systems, such as the decision, sanctions, military and civil operations issued by the human rights status of the third countries.

The controversy of EU foreign decision -making mechanism has a long history. In 2017, the then European Commission Chairman Juncai expressed the use of effective voting system to make the European Union more powerful. In 2018, the European Commission announced a specific proposal, that is, through the PasserElle clauses in the EU Treaty, it will extend the scope of the application system to the three areas of the European Union's common diplomatic and security policies: human rights, sanctions and civil tasks. If most voting systems are suitable for sanctions decision -making, sanctions can become more powerful foreign policy tools. A survey at the end of 2019 shows that this proposal supported by 6 member states including Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden supports Junchen, and 10 member states including Poland, Hungary and Lithuania have opposed opinions.

In a speech in 2020, the President of the European Commission also asked the membership of the member states to use the courage to turn the courage from the whole voting system to the effective most voting system, at least in terms of human rights and sanctions.

The advantage of all the unanimous voting system is that all member states accept a certain decision, and there is no voice of any country among most countries. The disadvantage is that the decision -making time may be too long, and in the case of different interests and positions of different member states, all the unanimous voting systems often become a veto system, or the final decision content appears in the lowest limit, so Weaken decision -making. A very infectious speech from all the voting opponents is: "rebellion" with a voting on the 26 countries with other votes supported by other votes, thereby paralyzing the European Union's diplomatic decision -making mechanism.

Hungary has repeatedly appeared in the image of "rebellion" in EU member states. Last year, because of Hungary's opposition, the European Union failed to introduce the sixth round of sanctions against Russia, and finally ended in a compromise. In 2020, the European Union against Belarus on the grounds of election fraud and suppression of demonstrators was opposed by the small country Cyprus.

The opponents of all the unanimous voting system not only gave the "negative textbooks" like Hungary, but also came up with the reason for "public opinion". The European Union has launched the European Future Conference platform, so that EU citizens can give suggestions on the EU's future suggestions on the platform. Last year, the final report of the platform presented many suggestions. One of them was in the European Union's joint diplomatic and security policies to effectively replace the entire voting system with the most voting system, so that EU foreign affairs can be efficient and rapidly decided, and even more Emphasize the position of the highest representative and ensure the same sound in Europe.

In addition to the problem of decision -making efficiency, the opposition of all the unanimous voting system also comes from some kind of concerns, that is, all unanimous voting systems may become the weak link of the European Union, making the third party enter the virtuality, and establish bilateral relations with some member states, " The means to weaken and manipulate the European Union. From the perspective of effective majority voting advocates, the effective voting system can enhance the toughness of the EU foreign policy under the influence of the third country. If the third country wants to obstruct the EU's foreign policy, it needs to win more than one member country. In addition, member states do not need to make a two -choice with other member states with the relationship between the third countries.

Reducing the proportion of all unanimous voting systems in decision -making is mainly through the "constructive abandonment" and Passerelle clauses in the clauses of the EU Treaty. On the other hand, a member state that chooses constructive abstains does not need to implement the decision; and through the PasserElle clauses, a effective major voting system can be implemented in certain specific areas of common diplomacy and security policies.

However, with the effective most of the opposition to face a lot of opposition, the opponents mainly come from small member states. Although the small country can start the "emergency brakes" in accordance with the EU treaty regulations, and rejection of decision -making on the grounds of major and declared domestic policies, the small country is still worried. The risk of decisions of its own national interests. Most voting systems are effective. The more population, the greater the right to speak.

Another doubt about the effective majority of voting systems is how to ensure that member states implement decisions passed under the effective majority of voting systems. During the refugee crisis in 2015, the EU distributed places for refugee resettlement places to member states based on the GDP, population, and the number of refuge applicants for processed asylum applicants. Although the decision has been passed in a valid majority voting system, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic also also also also followed the also. No execution of it.

In the case of differences in this member country, the biggest obstacle to replacing the entire unanimous voting system with the effective voting system is that in fact, whether it is to modify the treaty or the way to activate the PasserElle clause to achieve replacement, all member states need to get all member states. The consistent adoption, this is almost a dead cycle.The answers given by the senior representative of EU diplomacy and security policy Berrely are gradual, not radical reform methods. In 2020, Berrely raised the question of "how to ensure the Different member of the member states, how to ensure the EU action", and the cancellation of the unanimous voting system is not a pitch. He thought of a compromise, advocating trying to replace one vote veto with two votes against effective ways.

As the European Union continues to reshape its geographical and political influence, the game of most voting systems and all consistent voting systems in foreign decision -making will continue.

However, in the context of the stubbornness of inflation, the driver of the latest round of jumper (the average interest rate of two -year loans exceeded 6%this week) is the crazy guess of the financial market for the central bank's next step.

The jury sentenced him to tracking and illegally serving as a Chinese special agent on Tuesday (June 20), but the crime of conspiracy to act as a foreign agent was not established. There are also two other Chinese citizens of the same case. The maximum sentences faced by three people ranging from 10 to 25 years.

The federal prosecutor of Brooklyn, New York said the defendant Michael McMahon was hired to monitor the residents of Xujin (transliteration) who moved to New Jersey for corruption due to corruption in 2010.

Prosecutors stated that this case is a series of cases [involved in China's "Fox Hunting Action"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/又有7人因猎狐行动在美国被起诉/a-63517697)Among the first cases in the United States, the prosecution will "firmly expose and prevent the Chinese government from crossing the multinational suppression plan for our border."

McMahon was originally a police officer in New York City and changed to a private detective after retirement. He refused to plead guilty and claimed that he did not know that he was serving the Chinese government, thinking that he was working for a company that recovered the stolen funds: "If I know that I am a foreign government, even if there is only one moment, I am all of me. I won't take this case. I will notify the Federal Investigation Bureau. "

In this regard, the prosecutor refuted in the conclusion of the case on June 14 that McMahon not only knew that the Chinese government was a black hand behind the scenes, but also paid with Chinese officials in the chain bakery in New Jersey: "engaged in legal business People will not receive a stack of cash worth $ 5,000 in PaneraBread.

Prosecutor said that the victim of the case Xu Jin served as a municipal official of Wuhan before moving the United States, and China accused him of collecting bribes with his wife Liu Fang. Xu Jin's husband and wife denied corruption and claimed to be the target of attack because of conflict with the CCP's power structure.

Prosecutors said that because there is no extradition treaty between China and the United States, China cannot formally force Xu Jin to return to China to be tried. Therefore, in the past few years, Zhu Yong, Zheng Cong, McMahong and eight others jointly tried to promote Xu Jin. back to China. The Associated Press reported that three of these people had pleaded guilty, but it was believed that 5 people were in China.

These methods include sending derogatory information to the friends of Xu Jin's adult daughter on Facebook and sending a massive letter to his relatives in New Jersey; a Chinese prosecutor even forced Xu Jin's eighty father to fly to New Jersey Lobbying his son returned to China. In 2018, Zheng Congying still posted a note on Xu Jin's door, which said, "If you are willing to return to the mainland for 10 years, your wife will be fine, and this is the end."

Xu Jin said that the threat of the Communist Party of China was only a spiritual level for him, but after he saw the note, he realized that it was "a personal threat."

Zhu Yong was convicted of illegal foreign agents, tracking, cross -state tracking, and conspiracy to act as illegal foreign agents. His lawyer argued that Zhu Yong was "used" by China and as an agent of foreign government without knowing it, and he should not be responsible for it.

Zheng Congying was ruled to be charged with tracking and conspiracy to follow up, but all crimes such as Chinese agents were not established. His lawyer said that although she was disappointed with the judgment of tracking sin, he was glad that the jury believed that Zheng "had nothing to do with the Chinese government."

Russia has accused Ukraine of Crimea, an annexed Crimea, an annexed in U.S. and Britain, and warned that Russia will retaliate if this happens.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Sho Guru said at a military official meeting on Tuesday that information held by Moscow showed that Ukraine plans to use the U.S. long -range rocket system and the "Storm Shadow" cruise missiles provided by the United Kingdom to attack Crimi Ya.

"The use of these missiles outside of our special military operation area means that the United States and the United Kingdom will be fully dragged into the conflict and will immediately crack down on Ukraine's decision -making centers."

Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine in 2014 and believed that the peninsula was not within its invasion -the focus was on the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, and Ukraine was fighting to recapture the territory.

Kiev said it was fighting for the survival of a colonial conquest war and stated that it wanted to recover all its territories, including Crimea, where the Russian Black Sea Navy base was located.

Sho Gulu said that since June 4, the Ukrainian armed forces have launched a 263 attack on the Russian position, and Moscow believes that this is the beginning of the Ukraine counterattack.

The Russian Ministry of Defense, Shiyu, said, "Due to the cleverness and selfless actions of our troops, all (attacks) were repelled, and the enemy did not achieve the goal."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T02-47-59/1-1687315048.png)The Russian -Ukraine Ukraine was launched to attack Ukraine, saying that the other three villages in the east of Zapolo -Novodrivka, Lavadne and Lobokovir. Earlier, Kiev's army claimed that Neskocchine, Storojev, Blahodatne and Macarifka, who had regained the edge of Donetsk

#### "Physical cleaning of Ukraine"

Ukraine said that in the early stage of the counterattack, it had regained eight villages. A national defense official promised that although Kiev's "biggest blow" was coming, although the Moscow army was stubborn.

Ukrainian President Zelei said in his night video speech, "At this time, our soldiers in the south and east are actively destroying the enemy and physical cleaning Ukraine."

"Defending terrorism means eliminating terrorists, which ensures that evil countries have never had the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine."

Ukrainian officials said Russia attacked the military and infrastructure goals of Kiev and other regions of the country on Tuesday, including the western region far from the front line.

Also on Tuesday, the local authorities in the town of New Carhofka, southern in the southern region of Russia, said that the Ukrainian drone attack caused a woman's death, the four were injured, and the wandering ammunition drone -being called " The Shenfeng Special offensive team drone " -launched an attack on public service facilities.

At the time of the air strike, people's attention has always been concentrated on the attack on the defense positions of southern and eastern Russia. The territory occupied.

Kiev said that it has recaptured the land of 113 square kilometers (44 square miles) from the Russian army, but recent air strikes show that Russia has the ability to launch war outside the front line of the south and east.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-21T03-06-58-08-00/20CHINA-TRIAL-VERDICT-lpmb-master1050.jpg)On Tuesday, the three men were convicted by the Chinese government on behalf of the Chinese government in the suburbs of New Jersey and were convicted by the Brooklyn Federal Court.

The defendant Michael McMahon (55 years old), Zhu Yong (Yin, 66) and Zheng Congye (Yin, 27 years old) were tracked and one of them were established. Zhu Yong and Mcma Hong were also sentenced to illegally serving as foreign agents, and another skewers of Zhu Yong were convicted.

McMahon was a retired police officer of the New York Police Station and later became a private detective. On Tuesday, he issued a statement outside the court, insisting that he was innocent and vowed to continue his name for himself.

"If I really know that they are from the foreign government, the purpose is to harass others. I will definitely refuse and report it to the Federal Investigation Bureau," he said.

This ruling ended a three -week trial. During the trial, the prosecutor stated in detail the role of the three men in the "Fox Hunting Action". Chinese officials said that the "fox hunting operation" that had been carried out for ten years was designed to repatriate fugitives. The Ministry of Justice advocates that the purpose of the action is to allow the CCP to control Chinese citizens from all over the world.

The Brooklyn case is the first lawsuit raised by the Ministry of Justice in response to the operation. At the time of the trial, the tensions between the two superpowers who were confrontable reached the peak. Differential. On the weekend, Secretary of State [Meeting in Beijing in Beijing](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

In recent years, the Ministry of Justice has regarded relevant cases in China as the top priority. Brooklyn Federal Prosecutor Basene S. Pis. particularly focused on the "multinational suppression" of the so -called foreign government. In a statement after the verdict was issued, Pis said that McMahong and Zhu Yong acted under the "instructions of external hostile forces".

"We will continue to reveal and crack down on the Chinese government's entry into our country, violating our laws, and the implementation of the multinational suppression plan for American victims," he said.

On Friday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin accused the Ministry of Justice accusing the Ministry of Justice who "slandered" China on the case of this case, and said that the hat of the multinational suppression "was suitable for the United States to wear it."

The Federal Prosecutor's Office stated that Mcma Hong from Mawa, New Jersey may face a maximum 20 -year imprisonment. But his lawyer Lawrence Lasberg said last week that the federal court's sentencing calculation was complicated. He believed that the maximum sentence of McMahon's four charges would not exceed three years. (McMahong's allegations were sentenced to innocence.) According to the prosecution, Zhu Yong from the Queen's District may face 25 years of imprisonment, and Zheng Congye from Brooklyn may be sentenced to 10 years.

On Tuesday, Lasberg claimed that the judgment was "unfair", and also said that the conviction of tracking behavior "will make the work of private detectives in all cases into criminal crimes."

McMahon said that he had notified the local police when he monitored five different occasions and also hired other former New York Police's detectives to assist him. Lasberg argued in the trial that these facts could prove that McMahon did not know that the case was related to the Chinese government.

Zheng Congying's lawyer Reni Huang (Yin) said that, given that Zheng Congye's two heaviest charges were convicted, she believed that the result of this judgment was good news, and her team was considering appealing to the charges of tracking.

"Zheng Congying has no intersection in any interpersonal relationship with Macmahon and Zhu Yong. They have nothing to do with them," she said.

Zhu Yong's lawyer Kevin Dong (Yin) said that such a judgment may bring more risks to all citizens or companies who have dealt with overseas colleagues.

"The information passed to the public is very disturbing," he said.

Zhu Yong and Zheng Congying are Chinese citizens holding American green cards. Kevin Dong said that his client was a retirement person who came to the United States about 20 years ago and also worked in the construction industry. Zheng Congying's lawyer claimed in court that he had worked in a pearl milk tea shop, but he had to resign from his work in order to appear in court. He currently lives with his sister.

During the trial, judge Chen Kaimei(Pamela K. Chen)The warning said that all relevant personnel must pay attention to specific allegations, rather than the international political issues related to these allegations. The jury began reviewing on Thursday.

The center of the case was Xu Jin, a former Chinese official who moved to the United States more than ten years ago. The prosecutor said that the three defendants were key figures participating in conspiracy. The Chinese government set up a plan to track and harass Xu Jin and his family, forcing him to return to China. His corruption charges may be sentenced to the highest sentence.

The jury saw a large number of communications records since the fall of 2016. At that time, Zhu Yong contacted McMahon, who was a private detective in New Jersey.

The old man who couldn't speak English found a translation company in Flushing, Queen's area to help him communicate. Lasberg said McMahon's understanding is that he is working for a private company that seek to recover funds.

McMahon conducted a five -day surveillance in six months in 2016 and 2017, and discovered records related to Xu Jin's whereabouts and assets. He also saw Zhu Yong's colleague Hu Ji (Yin), and later discovered that Hu Ji was a police officer of the Wuhan Public Security Bureau of China.

In October 2016, these people conducted face -to -face contact in the Panyi Bread Restaurant in New Jersey, and the photos taken became evidence of their direct contact.

In the photo, Mr. McMahong grinned, stood among the other two, with Zhu Yong's shoulder. After the meeting, Hu Ji began to contact Macmahon in the name of Eric Yan and gave instructions.

Lasberg argued in the trial that there was no evidence that McMahon knew that his investigation was under the command of the Chinese government. Instead, an email on the survey mentioned a "company" that requires this work.

According to Chinese official media reports, his investigation object Xu Jin was the director of the Wuhan Development and Reform Commission. These reports stated that he was wanted for embezzling public funds, abuse of power, and accepting bribes. Xu Jin testified in Brooklyn's trial, but he could not immediately contact him to comment immediately after the judgment.

McMahon was hired in 2017. During that time, Xu Jin, 82, went to New Jersey. The prosecutor said that it was forced by Chinese officials.Zheng Congying's lawyer said that he had nothing to do with the plot. Jefferson Siegel for the New York Times

The jury was told that Xu Jin's sister had been imprisoned because Xu Jin refused to return to China. Prosecutors said that Chinese officials then planned to send Xu Jin's father to New Jersey to persuade his son to return to China. Prosecutors said that these officials did not know Xu Jin's address. They used his father as a bait to lure Xu Jin out in order to track him.

Xu Jin's wife and sister testified that when the old man appeared at the door of her home in Shitshires, New Jersey, she was shocked. She said she had received several threats related to Xu Jin and knew that the Chinese government was trying to find him. In order to make them unsuccessful, she arranged to meet with Xu Jin's father in a nearby mall the next day instead of Xu Jin's house.

But in the second year, two men, including Zheng Congyue, appeared in the home of Xu Jin, located in Wallen, New Jersey, and left a threatening note. Zheng Congying's lawyer Paul Goldberg said that his parties were "just a child" and drove to his house to help another person. He quickly regretted his behavior.

Goldberg said that Zheng Congying even drove back and tried to take off the note. But it was too late: Xu Jin testified that he had taken the note in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Investigation Bureau.

In 2023, at the Barcelona World Mobile Communications Conference, the world's most influential mobile communications field, the elite from the global mobile communications industry around 5G new kinetic energy (5GAcceleration), transcendence of reality (Reality ﹢), and open network ( OpenNet, Fintech, and Digitaleverything share their industry insights. What is the logic behind ChatGPT? How far is web3 from us? Where is the realistic significance of the Yuan universe, and how can companies use the Yuan universe to shape their own business value? As a deep observer of the TMT industry and the invited guests of the Barcelona World Mobile Communications Conference, PricewaterhouseCoopers Global Technology, Media and Communication(TMT)Zhou Weiran, the industry in charge of the industry, shared his view.

The following is an interview record,

** FT Chinese website **: After participating in the 2023 World Mobile Communications Conference held in Barcelona, how do you look at the development trend of TMT (Technology, Media, Telecommunication) in the next 5 years?

** Zhou Weiran **: PricewaterhouseCoopers published an insight report on the future development of the TMT industry earlier, defining eight important cutting -edge technology, including: artificial intelligence (AI), robotics (AR), virtual reality (VR), drone (Drones), 3D printing, and blockchain (Blockchain). We believe that these eight cutting -edge technology will assist the development of the country, society, enterprises, and even individuals. We often say that digital reform and automation advancement are very important elements, and the two complement each other. Therefore, these eight cutting -edge technology do not develop alone, but to cooperate with each other. Effectiveness. For example, AI plus robots and the Internet of Things can lead the efficient development of smartmanUfacturn, which greatly improves industrial efficiency and product quality. For example, using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR), can be applied in remote medical, education, and entertainment industries. At the same time, based on different combinations, you can also design more personalized personalization Services, cater to the needs of consumers and users.

** FT Chinese website **: ChatGPT (Chat Generation Pre-Trainedtransformer) is an artificial intelligence chat robot program developed by Openai, which was launched in November 2022. Its text formation function is very popular, such as scripts, songs, projects, etc. can be generated. In terms of automatic Q & A, ChatGPT can also automatically generate answers based on the input questions. As a deep observer in the TMT industry, how do you think of ChatGPT’s’s? Blasting fire and development prospects?

** Zhou Weiran **: GPT (General Pre-TrainEdransformer) technology is an artificial intelligence tool that uses AI model data and architecture to create strong language understanding and generating ability, and interacts with text. With the upgrading and deep learning of AI technology, this technology has become increasingly mature. Among them, the reason for the hot ChatGPT is that it only needs to automatically generate answers according to the language instruction, such as generating an article, an analysis of a data chart, a computer program, or even an original art image, etc., what users need Information can be quickly responded. Compared with the search engines used now, they can only provide existing matching materials, such as broad proxy web information and images, or the content that has been published. Therefore It is the original content, and it is closer to the personal needs of the user. In addition, ChatGPT is more convenient to operate, which can greatly improve office efficiency, and it can currently be used for users to use it for free. Therefore, once the market is launched, it is sought after by many users and investors.

** FT Chinese website **: In February 2023, the University of Hong Kong decided to ban the use of ChatGPT or other AI tools in all classrooms, homework and evaluations in Hong Kong; on March 31, the Italian government announced the ban on the use of suspected violations of privacy, and announced the ban on the use of the use of privacy. ChatGPT, launched a survey of Openai, how do you think of the restrictions on ChatGPT's current development?

** Zhou Weiran **: First of all, geopolitical factors will restrict the spread and use of some foreign technology companies' GPT products in China. There are certain objective restrictions.

In addition, ChatGPT lacks a review mechanism in content generation. So far, it is still a free tool. Many people use it to assist in office, such as making analysis reports, computer programs, financial statements, and even commercial contracts. Intersection For example, it produces an investment decision. If there is a loss, is it responsible for the person who creates the program or the person who uses the program? These have not been concluded. As a new technology, it also needs a real regulatory agency to standardize it. For example, the government leads the formulation of regulations and policies. Only such GPT tools can be put into use more soundly.

This is just like unmanned driving technology. After years of research and development, it has matured, but because there is currently lack of clear legal policies to define the responsible party of traffic accidents, it can only be used in the designated areas of a small part of the country. Failure to achieve a comprehensive and extensive application. The development of GPT technology also needs to cooperate with relevant agencies to formulate a standardized industry system to qualitatively qualify for certain behaviors before they can be adopted on a large scale.

** FT Chinese website **: Which industries are the risk of being replaced after ChatGPT?

** Zhou Weiran **: I think GPT will not really replace any industry, but will improve the overall work efficiency of the industry. As a result, people and time can be used to develop new products and services. In general, the role of AI is to provide guiding direction and suggestions, so GPT can play a great role in medical diagnosis, health care, education and other fields, which greatly improves efficiency. In addition, GPT can also be more effective in the financial industry, GPT can also be more effective Land allows investors or fund managers to place funds, because big data analysis can provide deeper and accurate reference materials, which prompt them to make more reasonable investment decisions. However, the use of AI is always people -oriented, providing more convenient and efficient services based on human needs, and customized personalized solutions and services according to different needs of users. The realistic work scenario changes rapidly, and in the end, artificial participation is needed to make the best decision.** Zhou Weiran **: The biggest feature of Web3 is the decentralized network control, that is, decentralization. Taking the current social media, such as WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc., their ownership and control are affiliated with their corresponding platforms, and Web3 is to configure the ownership and control of the network to users. Web3 is based on the blockchain. All transactions on the Internet have encrypted attributes and improve the security of transactions. Therefore New business opportunities were born. Many countries around the world pay attention to the development of Web3. For example, in China's latest government work report, "Digital China" is also an important direction for future economic development.

According to the current development of Web3, domestic has a relatively mature and advanced blockchain technology. Many local governments, as well as mature or first -created enterprises, are actively exploring and developing Web3 -related industries. At present, the reason why web3 has not taken off is because the transaction or contract implementation of digital assets requires a complete set of regulations to support management, so that the rights and interests of the trader can be appropriately protected. For example, digital assets generated by web3 can theoretically transaction or sell, but what kind of benchmark should be evaluated to evaluate its value? For another example, user A and User B do digital asset transactions in Web3 environment. Who should be supervised by the transaction process? What ways should there be solved by disputes? Another problem is that while the state is gradually improving relevant regulations, the network has no boundaries. The generation and transactions of digital assets will not be limited to China, which means that in the business related to Web3 There should also be a consensus between the establishment of regulations and regulatory mechanisms between the country.

** FT Chinese website **: The word "Metaverse" in the universe was first seen in Niel Stephenson's science fiction "avalanche" in 1992. Stephenson uses this word to describe an Internet successor based on virtual reality. Metaverse users can enter the world through high -quality individual or public virtual reality glasses and interact with each other. In recent years, the boom of the Yuan universe has come again. Global technology companies such as Apple, Meta, Microsoft, etc. have deployed the Yuan universe. Some people think that this will be a disruptive change. How should we look at the development of the Yuan universe in 2023?

** Zhou Weiran **: The Yuan Universe is a surreal 3D digital world established through the network technical support of Web3. It can provide high -quality digital scenarios for people, people and things, people, and digital substitutes, and even digital substitutes. Interaction and communication with digital stand -in, have unlimited imagination space. The Yuan Universe is established in Web3 and web3 is established in the blockchain, so it also has the function of allocating ownership and encryption. This makes the commercial transactions in the Yuan universe have a security guarantee, and the customer experience will also greatly improve.

According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the development of consumer groups is our so -called Terminez, a person born from 1990 to 2000. Gen Z is very used to entertainment through the Internet, and pays great attention to his identity on the Internet. If there is a perfect virtual number character representing themselves, they will be willing to spend money to dress up and pack their own virtual image. In this regard, the Yuan universe can provide a good digital scenario, and give a better experience for consumer groups of generations Z. It can also launch many different types of digital products, or make virtual products with realistic products into digital twin twin twin (Digitaltwins), to increase the opportunity to enlarge the realization of monetization through the virtual and real echo, thereby bringing a huge interest in interest. This is why the development space of the Yuan universe is favored.

In March of this year, Pricewater -Yongdao released the "2023 yuan universe outlook", which predicts that commercial applications will occupy the leading position of the 2023 Yuan universe application scenarios. Among them, it is most likely that employment and training, interacting with colleagues, and creating virtual content for customers will be the most likely to be the most likely Exploring the application of Yuan universe. We believe that the development prospects of the Yuan universe this year are optimistic and have the following characteristics:

First of all, the development of the universe in the past two years, whether in the fields of games, online shopping or NFT transactions, basically focuses on personal consumers, that is, to C business; and since this year, it has become more concentrated at the level of TOB. For example, some large -scale consumer companies have launched virtual malls, and large enterprises also conduct corporate training through the Yuan universe, interact with customers to increase customer experience. PricewaterhouseCoopers is also using the Global Conference to use the Yuan Universe Space, or communicate with customers.

China's economic growth has been less than 5%for six consecutive quarters, and the long -awaited recovery is less than expected.

In the background of lack of effective demand and low interest rates, monetary policy is constrained by the effective lower limit, and the market expects fiscal policy to increase stimulus. However, some opinions believe that the current growth rate of fiscal expenditure is not as good as expected, and the fiscal policy is not positive enough. In fact, there is no counter -cyclical adjustment.

So, how much is the current fiscal expenditure? Is there any adverse cycle adjustment? And, how much is the future policy space?

** 1. Three deficit rate caliber **

It is generally believed that the deficit rate is an important indicator for measuring the financial force.

China implements a strict fiscal discipline. With reference to the international level, 3%sets 3%as a warning line. Except for special reasons such as the impact of the epidemic in 2020 and 2021, a brief breakthrough (3.7%and 3.2%, respectively), the deficit rate of the official caliber has never exceeded 3%. From 2010 to 2019, China's deficit rate was 2.39%average. In 2022, the deficit rate was 2.8%. In 2023, it is planned to be arranged at about 3%.

Some opinions believe that the deficit rate should be raised.

There are at least two reasons. First, 3%was the reference value stipulated in the EU "Marstrip Treaty Treaty" that took effect in November 1993. It has neither rigorous empirical inspection nor a solid theoretical basis. Force, often breakthrough; second, although the deficit rate is an index that measures debt risks, the deficit rate is not equivalent to debt risk. If the scale of deficit expansion can bring higher output and income, the expansion of the debt scale does not necessarily necessarily necessarily be inevitable Call the debt rate to increase.

We fully agree that the deficit rate cannot be simply equivalent to debt risk. However, it should be noted that the caliber of computing the fiscal deficit in various countries is different, and sometimes the deficit rate can not be able to measure the strength of the fiscal expenditure well. Although China sets 3%as a warning value, there is a large difference in the rate of deficit calculating according to different calibers. The name deficit rate of 3%is often broken.

** Direct 1: The actual deficit rate of revenue and expenditure caliber **

The deficit rate in textbooks, that is, the difference between fiscal revenue and expenditure accounted for the proportion of GDP (GDP).

China's budget system includes four accounts: general public budget, government fund budget, state -owned capital operating budget, and social insurance fund budget. Due to the "Budget Law" stipulates that the latter three accounts must follow the balance of income and expenditure or the principle of receiving the fare. Therefore, the concept of textbooks corresponds to China, and many people usually understand the fiscal deficit referring to the difference between the income and expenditure of a general public budget account within a fiscal year. The deficit rate is the proportion of the difference between the income and expenditure to the GDP.

** caliber 2: official caliber budget deficit rate **

However, the official fiscal budget deficit is actually not the result of the reduction of general public budget income with the general public budget expenditure. It is also necessary to comprehensively consider using the budget stable adjustment fund, from government fund budget and state -owned capital operation budget, use the knot, use the knot Factors such as the balance of funds. After considering the above factors, China's fiscal deficit calculation formula is:

Fiscal budget deficit = (national general public budget revenue+adjustment of budget stable adjustment fund and other budget funds+use rotary balance funds)-(national general public budget expenditure+supplementary budget stability adjustment fund+funds for the next year expenditure) The official budget deficit rate is the budget deficit/GDP.

** caliber 3: The general deficit rate of power and responsibilities **

According to the "Budget Law", the special debt belongs to the government fund budget and is not included in the deficit. This is because in principle, the project's own income is required to repay the principal and interest. However, in fact, because most projects still support infrastructure construction and industrial park construction with low yields or even no income, the interest payment of current special debt is still based on the financial funds of the project or platform company. According to the use of funds and authority, if the special debt is repaid, the local government also needs to use the general public budget income to pocket, so it should also be included in the fiscal deficit.

In addition, the local government's debt financing outside the budget should also be included in the general deficit. However, debt financing outside the budget is difficult to trace back and accurate statistics, so it cannot be calculated.

Taking 2022 as an example, the official deficit rate, actual deficit rate, and general deficit rate calculated based on official caliber, revenue and expenditure caliber, and power and responsibility caliber were 2.8%, 4.7%, and 7.7%, respectively.

The specific algorithm is as follows:

In 2022, the national general public budget revenue was 2.037 trillion yuan, the general public budget expenditure nationwide was 2.606 trillion, and the actual revenue and expenditure difference was 5.69 trillion. Therefore, according to the difference between the general public budget revenue and expenditure of the year, the actual deficit rate of the revenue and expenditure caliber in 2022 was 5.69 trillion/121 trillion = 4.7%.

However, in early 2022, the fiscal deficit disclosed in the budget report was "arranged by 3.37 trillion yuan" and the deficit rate was "arranged by about 2.8%." The fiscal deficit released by the budget implementation report is still 3.37 trillion yuan, and the nominal GDP is 121 trillion yuan. Therefore, the budget deficit rate (deficit/GDP) of the official caliber can be calculated nearly 2.8%, which is in line with the budget arrangement at the beginning of the year.

So, how can the difference between 569 trillion and 3.37 trillion? How to make up?

That is, mentioned above, replenishment of the revenue of the budget revenue of historical knots, government funds, and state -owned capital operations. Among them, from the budget stable adjustment fund, government fund budget, state -owned capital business budget transfer funds, and use of the use of 1.245 trillion yuan, and some of the funds transferred.

If the 3.65 trillion special bonds are included in the deficit in 2022, the general deficit rate of power and responsibility is as high as 7.7%.

** 2. Active financial actual strength **

From the perspective of the official deficit rate arrangement, the fluctuations of each year seem to be very small. In 2023, it increases by 0.2 percentage points compared to 2022. However, in actual operation, the financial department comprehensively coordinates the transfer of other funds. Strong may not be small. Compared with the official deficit rate, the deficit rate of revenue and expenditure caliber and power and responsibility can more reflect the financial strength.

First, according to the deficit rate of the income and expenditure diameter of the year, it can better reflect the tightness of the fiscal policy than the official caliber.

The whole society can be understood as two departments of government and private sector. Government departments are not production departments and do not create wealth. Government revenue comes from taxes and fees. In fact, it is from the private sector. Government expenditure is returned to the private sector. The official caliber budget deficit rate actually shows the caliber of the new debt scale, and cover up the funds for the replenishment of budget stable adjustment funds, government funds budgets, state -owned capital operation budget transfer funds, and residues. In accordance with the caliber of the difference between the income and expenditure of the general public budget account of that year, on the one hand, it can better reflect the relationship between the income and expenditure distribution between the government and the private sector. The allocation of funds between accounts, which relatively accurately reflect the tight fiscal policy.Second, the deficit rate incorporated into the special debt can more reflect the stimulus of the economy than the official caliber.

Special debt belongs to the budget of government fund in the four accounts and is not included in deficit. Special debt special funds are dedicated to the special debt. According to the project, it can be divided into special debt of land reserve (the use is mainly to collect land, land flat, preliminary development, etc.), shed reform debt, toll road special debt, rail transit special debt, etc. field of. Considering the important pulling role of infrastructure on economic growth, and the division of special debt according to power and responsibility, it should be included in the deficit. Therefore, incorporating the general deficit rate of special debt can better reflect the stimulus of fiscal expenditure on the economy.

Based on the caliber incorporated in the special debt, from 2018 to 2022, the general deficit rates were 5.55%, 7.03%, 9.86%, 7.17%, and 7.97%, respectively, with an average value of 7.52%, which significantly exceeded the nominal deficit rate level.

** 3. Is the fiscal policy really positive **

Some opinions have suggested that the year -on -year growth rate of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures can more intuitively reflect the intensity of active fiscal policies. This view makes sense, but it is necessary to pay attention to the abnormal disturbance caused by land transfer income and related expenditure in China with government fund budget accounts.

The relationship between the four accounts of China's fiscal system is that the earnings of government fund budgets and the surplus funds for state -owned capital operation budgets can be used to supplement the deficit of general public budgets. General public budgets and state -owned capital operating budgets have special expenditure projects to supplement society. Insurance funds budget, and social insurance funds budgets, special funds, only cannot enter.

Although the surplus funds for state -owned capital operating budgets can supplement general public budget and social insurance fund budget, the scale of this account is very small, and the income and expenditure account for less than 2%of the four accounts. When the economic influence, it usually only analyzes the two accounts of general public budget and government fund budget, because these two accounts are absolutely big heads of the four books.

Therefore, we seem to be more intuitive to measure the year -on -year growth rate of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures to measure the efforts of fiscal policies.

For calculations, from 2018 to 2022, the year-on-year growth rate of the two accounts was 14.18%, 9.54%, 10.10%,-0.99%, and 3.11%, respectively, with an average value of 7.19%. The year-on-year growth rates in 2021 and 2022 were -0.99%and 3.11%, respectively, far lower than the average value of five years, and lower than the nominal GDP growth rate of that year. Therefore, there are doubts that when the macro economy is facing multiple challenges such as demand contraction, supply impact, and expected weakness, is active fiscal policy really active or false?

If you look at the year -on -year growth rate of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures, it can be found that the positive fiscal policy in 2021 may have a period of time withdrawal too fast, but there is no significant increase in the burden on the market entity. Economy still has stimulus. In 2022, the total expenditure of the two accounts in 2022 was a year -on -year growth rate, which was mainly dragged down on the sharp decline in the revenue of state -owned land transfer revenue in the budget expenditure of government funds, and active fiscal policies were actually active.

** 3.1 In 2021, the fiscal overcome existing price factor disturbance **

The general public budget revenue in 2021 was 20253.9 billion, a year -on -year growth rate of 10.74%, an increase of 6.4%compared with 2019. The general public budget expenditure was 24632.15 billion, a year -on -year growth rate of 0.3%, an increase of 3.12%compared with 2019. The annual revenue completion (102.5%) super budget is 2.5 percentage points, and the expenditure was completed (98.5%) was less than 1.5 percentage points. Compared with two comparison, fiscal policy seemed to be shrinking. After comprehensive consideration, the budget stable adjustment fund, government fund budget, and the transfer of state -owned capital business budgets and the use knot conclusion remains, the official deficit is 3570 billion yuan, a decrease of 190 billion compared with 2020 (3760 billion). In fact Reduce.

However, it should be noted that the rapid growth of fiscal revenue is related to the rapid growth of industrial taxes caused by economic recovery and the rise in commodity prices, and the one -time income increase of key industries and enterprises is a special case. It cannot be explained that the financial situation of the provinces and cities that has emerged is steadily good, nor can it be that fiscal policy is interested in tightening.

First, the Ministry of Finance knows the phenomenon of over -collection the fiscal revenue brought by this price factors. Reasonable arrangements for this year's fiscal over -income revenue "stipulates that" if the total public budget expenditure is indeed insufficient, the general public budget expenditure can be appropriately increased in accordance with the statutory procedures ", which allows all places to use the over -income part to increase the expenditure of the year.

As one of the important neighboring countries in China, Cambodia is a mysterious country in the cognition of many people, and recently the impression of Cambodia's impression of Cambodia is mostly negatively described. What is the current situation of the business environment and society in Cambodia? What is the development opportunity of this country under the new international environment? In this issue of the "Belt and Road Hundred Top Views", the author invited the Chinese Lord of Cambodia and the chairman of ZhengngGroup, Cambodia, and Lord Oknha Deng Pibing. Environment, industrial investment and future development trends.

The following is a record of the interview with Lord Deng Yibing:

** 1. About Cambodia's business environment **

** Question: ** Please describe what advantages, challenges and opportunities are there in Cambodia's business environment?

** Deng Yingbing: From the perspective of advantages, Cambodia, as an emerging market, has the most popular foreign exchange policy and the rise of many industrial development. The Cambodian government has full awareness of opening up, its investment policy is gradually improving and open, and road infrastructure is also developing rapidly. The changes that have brought Cambodia to Cambodia from Phnom Penh to the port of Sihanouk have brought obviously for more than half a year. The second highway from Phnom Penh to East Cambodia -Vietnam border city Pakistani also started construction on June 7. The fourth city airport in Qixinghai in Western Cambodia, the National Gonghai Province, has met the conditions for navigation and is planning to open up. In addition, in recent years, many foreign companies have poured into, which fully illustrates that Cambodia's business environment is developing in the direction of investors. From the perspective of the challenge level, the most prominent challenge facing Cambodia's business environment is the serious lack of outstanding professional talent resources. This is the deepest in the process of corporate operations in recent years. In terms of opportunities, Cambodia has too many industrial opportunities to be developed, such as the cultural tourism industry and agriculture, as well as the opportunities brought about by the industrial industry transfer supported by the land to be developed. Development opportunities. Especially for agriculture, the current agriculture in Cambodia is still at the level of farming, and the degree of industrialization is seriously insufficient. Therefore, the realization of industrialization is an important direction for the Grand Exhibition of the Cambodian agricultural industry.

** Question: What powerful policies and measures do the Cambodian government take in attracting foreign investment and promoting economic development?

** Deng Yingbing: ** First of all, the Cambodian government has been constantly improving various laws and regulations related to foreign investment. At the same time, it is also actively encouraging social institutions to increase employment skills training in basic employment groups, encouraging Cambodian students who study abroad to study back to the return of their studies. It plays an important role in the development of its own country. I believe that these will play a role that cannot be ignored for attracting foreign investment. In addition, the Cambodian government is also gradually improving and increasing the legal norms and regulatory efforts of investment promotion.

** Q: ** What is the competitive advantage and lack of Cambodia in Southeast Asia?

** Deng Yingbing: ** The overall economic development level of Cambodia has not reflected unique advantages in ASEAN countries, but it has implemented a system of simultaneous circulation of Blossom and the US dollar in monetary policy, which has attracted a large number of international gold rush customers and investors. In addition, the Cambodian government's foreign exchange control policies are relatively loose, so Cambodia has outstanding advantages that attract investors that other ASEAN countries and even developing countries. It is undeniable that the national happiness index of Cambodia is still very high. The lack of part may be more reflected in the following aspects: some targeted investment incentives; lack of outstanding talents; industry laws and regulations and law enforcement supervision need to be improved.

** 2. About the industrial investment environment and opportunities **

** Q: ** Which industries do you think Cambodia has greater investment potential and development space? With the reorganization of global supply chain, what are the investment opportunities for Cambodia in manufacturing and infrastructure construction?

** Deng Yingbing: ** At present, Cambodia's largest investment potential is the traditional manufacturing industry of cultural tourism, agriculture, and human resources. In the past, due to the limits of the development and development level of the Cambodian state, the entire Cambodia did not integrate into the global supply chain system well. With the steady progress of the "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement" (RCEP), coupled with the increasingly improved trade scale in Cambodia in recent years and the increasing level of residents' consumption level, it has begun to play a more important role in the global supply chain system. In addition, the manufacturing industry in Cambodia is currently at a relatively primary level, such as light industries such as clothing and luggage, just like the level of China in the 1990s, high -end manufacturing has not formed a mature environment. From the perspective of infrastructure investment, there are indeed many opportunities. For example, highways, rail transit, urban gas, etc. are urgently needed to participate globally. The first is that basic investment can make steadily profitable long -term profit; the second is that investment can help Cambodia improve the overall living standards and social operations of residents.

** Q: ** What is the development status of Cambodia in the fields of emerging technology and sustainable development?

** Deng Yingbing: ** In the field of emerging technology, Cambodia lacks an industrial atmosphere and lacks corresponding talents. But in terms of Internet applications and e -commerce, Cambodia has achieved obvious results. In the field of sustainable development, the first thing I think of is the sustainability of the ecological environment. Cambodia now attaches great importance to environmental protection. For some high -pollution industries, the government's attitude is to give up the high economic benefits brought by it, and it also rejected its landing to destroy the environment. In addition, some new energy and new technologies, the Cambodian government is also pushing.

** Three, about future development trends and economic trends **

** Question: ** Cambodia's future development trend, how do you predict?

** Deng Yingbing: ** There is no doubt that Cambodia is in a geometric center in the ASEAN region due to geographical location, and the surrounding countries have unique advantages and convenience. Coupled with its unique monetary policy and increasing infrastructure, I believe that Cambodia's next economic development performance is worth looking forward to investors. After the Cambodian election in July, the new government gradually showed a tendency to youth. Some laws and regulations that protect and encourage foreign capital are gradually improving, so the social and economic development of Cambodia in the next 20 years will definitely be more faster than in the past 20 years.

** Question: How can Cambodia deal with the uncertainty of the global economy, especially the Sino -US trade friction?

** Deng Yingbing: Indeed, today's global situation has encountered unprecedented challenges, but because of this, Cambodia seized the opportunity to seize some favorable situations. Some time ago, I saw an article saying that geopolitics could bring new development opportunities to ASEAN countries. It was true. In the increasingly fierce competition between China and the United States, Cambodia has benefited from it.

** Q: ** Please talk about the role of Cambodia in the "Belt and Road" initiative and the prospects of cooperation with Chinese economic?** 4. About Cambodia's development opportunities in the Chinese and American games **

** Question: ** What do you think of the development opportunities that Cambodia has gained during the Sino -US game?

** Deng Yingbing: ** The Chinese government basically does not avoid support and help in Cambodia. In the process of continuously differentiation of China's relations with ASEAN countries in the United States, Cambodia cooperates with China to promote China's investment in this region with a positive attitude and action. From the above, Cambodia's development achievements have been largely conducive to the opportunity brought by the Sino -US game.

** 5. Views on Cambodia's investment opportunities, business environment and industrial development **

** Q: ** As the head of a diversified industrial group, how do you evaluate the overall investment opportunities and industrial development opportunities of Cambodia?

** Deng Yingbing: ** I have been in Cambodia for more than 20 years. I have deep feelings for this country. I am very optimistic about Cambodia's future development. From the establishment of Zhengheng Group in 2017 to the present, the investment of enterprises has involved multiple industries. These decisions I make are based on full recognition of Cambodia's future industrial development opportunities.

Another is the climatic conditions of Cambodia and the blankness of the manufacturing industry brings huge development opportunities. In addition, adopting advanced scientific management methods and planting technology will bring huge development opportunities to Cambodia's agricultural industry. Cambodia has abundant tourism resources. With the end of the new crown epidemic, global tourism will be released, which will bring a new round of super -expected value returns to tourist residential real estate investors.

** Q: ** What are the investment layouts of Zhengheng Group in Cambodia, and how do you think of the company's future development prospects in Cambodia?

** Deng Yingbing: ** At present, the industries that Zhengheng Group has done includes tourism and vacation real estate, hotels, media, communications, investment, e -commerce, green energy, culture and tourism industries. We made these investment decisions after conducting in -depth investigations and evaluations of the Cambodian market. Industrial investment in Cambodia is entering a new cycle of rapid development with the opening of the first highway.

** Question: ** What are your suggestions for Cambodia to improve and improve the business environment? How to promote Cambodia to attract more foreign capital and accelerate economic development?

** Deng Yingbing: ** At present, what is urgent to improve Cambodia is to strengthen the supervision of the group of law enforcement, formulate and effectively protect the laws and norms of the rights and interests of investors, fundamentally improve the business environment, give global investors a one Rest assured and confident business environment.

** 6. About political risk and social stability issues **

** Q: ** In recent years, the domestic political situation in Cambodia has changed to a certain extent. What impact does this have on Cambodia's investment environment and economic development?

** Deng Yingbing: ** In fact, the rumors of the outside world are more hearing. The political situation in Cambodia is very stable. In 2018, the National Salvation Party, which is opposed to the People's Party, has been dismissed. Most members of the Salvation Party have joined the People's Party, so now in Cambodia, there is a harmonious view in Cambodia. In addition, the new government will emerge a group of younger leaders, and they have a more open awareness. I believe that the new government will take more powerful measures in improving the investment environment and creating a better social atmosphere, and strengthen rectification of the behavior and forces that hinder foreign investment.

** Q: ** What is the social order and public security status of Cambodia? How does this affect foreign investors' operations and investment decisions in Cambodia?

** Deng Yingbing: ** A society will inevitably have corresponding problems during a specific development stage, but in general, Cambodia's social order is not as exaggerated as overseas media, especially from the media. Each member of our group has a large number of foreign employees, and they are very safe and stable at work and life here. As for the impact on the decision -making of investors, this is a question of insight. The key depends on how investors take off and weigh between market development opportunities and existing problems.

** Seven, about the labor market and environmental issues **

** Q: ** What is the status quo of the labor market in Cambodia? How does labor quality, cost and policy affect the investment decisions of foreign enterprises?

(Voice of Germany) The European Constitution and Human Rights Center (EUROPEAN Center for Constitutional and Humanrights (ECCHR), headquartered in Berlin, issued a press release on Wednesday (June 21) that it has been regulated to the German federal economy and export control The bureau (BAFA) submitted a complaint, accusing the Volkswagen (VW), BMW (BMW) and Mercedes-Benz. Xinjiang forced labor](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/ngo起诉德国5家大企业配合参与新疆强迫劳动/a-59101217)The problem.

In January of this year, the new supply chain law of Germany came into effect. Enterprises should pay attention to human rights and environmental protection issues of overseas supply chains in accordance with the law, and have certain responsibility and obligations. [The law passed in the Federal House in 2021](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国联邦议院通过供应链法/a-57855467)It is stipulated that if a company is informed of the obligation of DuEDILIGENCENCENCERENCE, the Federal Economic and Export Control Bureau should be investigated. In addition.

ECCHR's legal director, Miriam Saage-MAAß, calls for the German government to immediately review how the major automobile manufacturers supervise their suppliers' factories in Xinjiang and ensure that they meet human rights standards; The due diligence mechanism for effectiveness, "Enterprises should stop business activities in Uighurs."

Duolun, chairman of the World Uyghur Conference. "Dolkun ISA) said:" [Germany Implementation of the Supply Chain Law](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/防范强制劳工-德国供应链法落实得了吗/a-65438393)It is an important milestone, and now it must be proved that this is effective. Mercedes -Benz, BMW and Volkswagen car manufacturers have the responsibility to ensure that they have not made profits from the Uyghur forced labor. "

### Forced labor disputes of German car manufacturers

In August last year, MichelleBachelet, a senior commissioner of the United Nations Human Rights, will report that the Chinese government's allegations of torture to a few groups such as Uighurs in Xinjiang in Xinjiang in Xinjiang are credible, and [may constitute anti -human crimes](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/聯合國發布新疆報告-稱中國恐犯下反人類罪/a-62987574)Essence In response to relevant allegations, the Chinese government has continued to deny it.

The research released by the University of Haron, the United Kingdom in December last year, pointed out that Volkswagen Audi Group, Honda, Ford, General Motor, Mercedes -Benz Group, Toyota, Tesla and other international manufacturers, [its supply chain is related to Xinjiang](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/研究全球汽車產業續受新疆強迫勞動威脅/a-64085295)Essence

The report pointed out that more than 100 international automotive parts or automobile manufacturers have exposed to products produced by Uyghur forced labor to a certain extent. Research Reporter Lauramurphy said in a DW interview last year: "Automotive companies should be able to put pressure on suppliers collectively, saying that they no longer want these products to minimize and process in Uighurs."

Taking Volkswagen as an example, the company has a joint venture factory with Shanghai Automobile Group (SAIC) in Urumqi, Xinjiang. In recent years, human rights groups have been accused of forced labor doubts. Ralfbrandstätter, the person in charge of the Chinese region of the company, visited the factory earlier this year, [saying "there is no sign of human rights"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/大众中国ceo新疆工厂没有人权侵犯的迹象/a-64845420)Essence However, Yalkunuluyol, a researcher at the University of Haron, told DW at the time that after talking with several Uighur people in the factory, Breid said that "there is no forced labor." This statement is problematic.

### Volkswagen President said that the Xinjiang plant has no forced labor and Victoria scholars: there is a problem with the statement

Last month, [Proposal persons appeared at the Volkswagen Annual Shareholders Conference](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/大众股东大会维吾尔人代表将发言/a-65560952)The slogans such as "termination of Uyghur forced labor" protested on the court, but Bearing still reiterated its previous statement.

According to Reuters, Volkswagen confirmed on Tuesday (June 20) confirming that it was discussing whether it was an independent audit risk assessment of its Xinjiang plant with SAIC; before the company continued to be under pressure from investors and demanded independent audit.

In response to Ecchr's appeal, the British "Financial Times" sought comments from the public, Mercedes -Benz and BMW, and all three companies refused to comment on the appeal. Mercedes -Benz added to the newspaper: "Whenever someone is worried, we will ask the supplier to clarify." BMW said that the company has continued to supervise the supplier to meet its human rights standards and has been investigating possible violations of possible violations situation.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-21T03-59-35-08-00/Germany-intel-01-lcgz-master1050.jpg)German domestic intelligence agencies said on Tuesday that more and more foreign intelligence agencies have targeted targets to Germany, and warned that spy activities, cyber attacks and false information activities, especially activities from China and Russia, "constituted serious constituents in the country" constituted seriously threaten".

Although such evaluations are released every year, this year's report is unusual in terms of warning or measuring the German security environment in one year.

Earlier this month, the German government released a comprehensive national security strategy for the first time. This is part of the expanding efforts of Germany to cope with their weaknesses under the new military, economic and geopolitical threats.

The agency stated that, in view of Germany as the NATO allies and one of the most powerful countries in the European Union, in the context of invasion of Ukraine in Russia and intensified global tensions in China, Germany faced more risks of foreign interference.

"Russia's war on Ukraine also means a turning point in domestic security," said the German Internal Affairs Minister, Namshi Ferase, said at the press conference to publish a report on the Federal Constitution Protection Office at the press conference.

However, the most serious warning in the report is for China, and the report describes China as "the biggest threat in economic and scientific espionage activities."

At this time, a severe assessment of Chinese intelligence activities was very embarrassing for German Chancellor Olaf Scharsez. He was receiving Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang on the same day, which was part of the annual consultation of the German and Chinese government.

After three years of interruption due to the offline meeting of the epidemic, the talks aims to restore the relationship between the two countries. At the same time, the world has changed. The relationship between China and Russia has led to the increasing geopolitical tension in China, while Washington and other other. The Western government has also stepped up increasingly "de -risk" with Beijing's economic relations.

The report pointed out that in 2022, Germany became one of the most important legal investment goals in Europe in Europe.

The report said, "Direct investment not only provides China with the opportunity to make up for the lack of innovation and achieve technological leadership, but also opens the door for political influence, espionage and damage activities," and warned that this may also constitute risks on national security.

"These activities are involved in the wide range of faces, and it will also damage Germany's competitiveness as industry and technical bases, and to destroy the laws of market economy," the report also wrote. "In the end, this may be damaged and prosperous, thereby bringing risks to democracy, social cohesion, and independence in Germany."

The Chinese delegation is also meeting with the German business leaders, and it is expected that it will try to persuade the government not to impose more stringent restrictions on Chinese companies operating in Germany.

The Chinese delegation may also oppose restrictions on the expansion of Telecom companies Huawei to participate in the German 5G network. According to the recent release of laws that restrict key infrastructure of foreign investment, people generally expect that the German government will implement such restrictions.

Various political forces in Germany still have serious differences in the decision of the government's allowing China State -owned Shipping Corporation COSCO Group to purchase a minority equity of Hamburg Port. The intelligence department and multiple departments have opposed.

However, in the other two other transactions, the government has prevented China from acquiring two German companies involving the semiconductor industry.

The other three other countries that renamed the Intelligence Action were Iran, Turkey, and North Korea, although most of them seemed to be concentrated in their own opponents in Germany.

Tomas Haldenwon, the head of the German domestic intelligence agency, said that Germany and Europe have successfully stepped up doubt that the Russian diplomacy group of the Russian diplomacy of the intelligence personnel, Germany, expelled 40 people suspected of secret agents from the Russian Embassy last year. A total of 400 people were expelled throughout Europe.

He pointed out that more people were expelled in 2023 and said that these efforts limited Russia's ability to launch spy activities.

Russia's "future actions may be more secret and more aggressive," Haldenwang said. "This may include the use of so -called illegal personnel -intelligence personnel who use false identity to cross -increase network attacks or even destroy action."

Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war, several "illegal immigrants" have been found throughout Europe, but Germany has not found major cases so far. However, last year, Germany discovered Russian traitors in its own foreign intelligence agencies.

The Minister of the Interior Fisher said that cyber security "is a more serious risk for Germany."

She also said that Russia will focus on "mixed attacks", including encouraging conspiracy theories and supporting false information activities.

The agency has described extremely right -wing as the biggest threat of Germany's democracy for many years, including the German alternative choice party, namely AFD. The agency estimates that about 10,000 of the 28,500 party members of the party are suspected of extremes.

Even so, the party's support rate has been rising, reaching 20%in some national public opinion surveys.

Analysts said that the rise of conspiracy theories after the popularity increased the power of extremely right.

Last year, the security department suddenly inspected a coup at the planned group of right -wing conspirators, including AFD members. This group of people planned a absurd conspiracy to make a prince a leader of the country.

The conspiracy has no known connection with Russia, but shows the reason why the authorities worry. The conspirator is unlikely to pose a serious threat to the German government, but they are collecting weapons and planning to attack parliament.

At the press conference, Haldenwon was asked to state the difference in the risk assessment of Russia and China.

He refused to directly disclose which country's threat was greater, but said: "The Russian intelligence department's methods are stronger and more obvious. In fact, they work in the way of old schools. The means seen in the movie. The Russian sector will not restrain themselves to avoid extreme consequences -nor does it taboo to kill. "

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-21T04-53-06-08-00/20dc-biden-china-vflt-master1050.jpg)US President Biden said on Tuesday evening that Chinese President Xi Jinping has always been covered by the Chinese government and does not know about the spy balloon of this winter. After the balloon crossed the US airspace [shot down by an American fighter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/politics/chinese-spy-balloon-shot-down.html)Essence

At a campaign fundraising activity in California, Biden said that it seemed to be an impromptu speech on the incident that caused the rupture of Sino -US relations for several months, revealing that the American intelligence agency learned in the incident in Beijing. Internal chaos.

"When I shot down the balloon and the two computers filled with spy equipment, Xi Jinping was very angry because he didn't know where the balloon was there," Bayeng was at a grand event held in Kentfield. About 130 guests said. "No, I'm serious. For the dictator, if they don't know what happened, this is very embarrassing."

On Tuesday night, other U.S. officials were surprised by the Presidential Association's discussion in discussing these sensitive information in public, but an official who heard relevant intelligence briefings and requested anonymous to say that Biden's remarks accurately reflected the internal assessment of the US government.

The day before the president made the above remarks, [](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)[Secretary of State Anthony Brin Kenkee in Beijing and Xi Jinping](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)[Meeting](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/), To ease the cracks brought by the spy balloon incident. Blint's itinerary was initially canceled after the spy balloon incident was made public, but was considered to be a "thaw" for [Biden sought "](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230523/biden-china-g7/)The constructive step is to "thaw" includes a possible dialogue between the presidents of the two countries later this year.

"The very important point is that he is now in a situation where he wants to build a relationship again," said Biden when he talked about Xi Jin. "Our Secretary of State Tony Blins has just been there; it is good to do it. This takes time."

However, if the president's discussion of the spy balloon incident is considered to be degraded to Xi Jinping, it may complicate diplomatic contact, because Xi Jinping firmly controls power in China and attaches importance to his image to control everything. Chinese officials have never disclosed the source of the balloon, nor did they respond to Biden immediately.

"It should not appear where it appeared," Biden said when he talked about the balloon at California's fundraising event. "It deviated from the route, first flew across Alaska, and then flew across the United States. He didn't know about it," Biden added. He refers to Xi Jinping. "When the balloon was shot down, he felt very embarrassing. He even denied it there."

At that time, people found that the balloon drifted over a nuclear missile launch field in Montana, and then passed through the city of Kansas. Finally, it was shot down by a snake missile missile launched by a F-22 fighter in South Carolina. A big wave settled. U.S. officials have previously stated that they suspect that the balloon is investigated by the US military base in Guam and Hawaii](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230216/balloon-ufo-us-china/), But was blown away from the route, turned to Alaska, and eventually came to the United States, but they did not disclose that Xi seemed to be unaware of the matter.

This is not the first time that Biden has published an explanation of foreign policy at the fundraising party. In a similar occasion in New York in October, he reminded the donor that since Kennedy and Khrushchev started the Soviet Union in Cuba in 1962, the world has not been close to a nuclear destruction as much as it is now. "We have not faced the possibility of ending the end of the world since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis," Biden said at the time, which caused a moment of disturbance.

In California on Tuesday, Biden said at home donors to Democratic Party donors at the investment banker Mark Robinson and the wife of Stephani Robinson, who had been a business management consultant and an investment banker. When stating the overall view of international affairs, Biden focused on China, which was a topic he recently thought about. Through this occasion, he tried to alleviate the rise of Beijing's economy and the increasingly strong world on the world stage that made the United States anxiety.

"Don't worry about China," Biden said. "I mean, worry about China, but don't worry about China," he said in the laughter of the audience. "But I really think so. China is true -facing real economic difficulties."

After talking about spy balloon, Biden then said that he's efforts in consolidating the "dialogue between the four -way dialogue" of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India made Xi Jinping very dissatisfied, which was to counter the influence of China in the Indo -Pacific region. Bayeng met with the "Quartet Dialogue" leaders of the "Quartet Dialogue" at the Seventh -way Group meeting in Hiroshima, Japan last month.

"What really made him very uncomfortable was that I insisted on re -organizing the so -called 'Quartet dialogue'," Biden said. "He asked me to stop me for me, because it would be very unfavorable to him. I said 'We are just -we are not surrounding you, we just want to ensure international order and ensure the smoothness of the sea and air channels.' On this issue We will not give up. "

"So," he then said, "Now we are India, Australia, Japan, and the United States.

CCTV News Weibo last Saturday (17th), recently, Beijing and Guangzhou monitored the case of monkey acne virus infection. China CDC said that there are few opportunities for ordinary people to come into contact with the virus, and they do not have to worry too much about monkey acne. Early symptoms of monkey acne include fever, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle soreness, etc. About three days may occur may occur with rash and lymph nodes, and you should seek medical treatment in time.

However, CCTV news did not mention the specific number of people with acne infection. Many netizens are worried that the infectious disease monkey acne has spread rapidly in the folk. Mr. Wang, who runs a grocery store in Dongguan, Guangdong, told this station on Wednesday (21st) that there are also cases of monkey acne symptoms or suspected monkey acne infection, but no official information was found in the case of monkey acne symptoms or suspected monkey acne infection. There should be, it seems to be crazy at present. There are many places in many places last year. "

According to China's "Prevention and Control Law of Infectious Diseases", no official authorized people shall not release news about the infectious diseases. Therefore, Mr. Wang did not dare to talk about the case of local monkey acne infection.

The staff of the first hospital in Guangzhou disclosed on WeChat on WeChat on Wednesday morning that there are many cases of acne infection in Guangzhou and in the hospital where they work. It also said that the hospital specially issued a document to require infection and anorectal management to do a good job of infection.

This station called the medical and political department of the Eighth Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, which has called for infectious diseases on Wednesday, but no one has been answered.

Mr. Chen, a resident of Wuhan, disclosed to this station that there have been many cases of monkey acne in the city. Only in a school near his house, six students were infected: "Wuhan already has (cases), how much knows. Because there is no official data. . Our school once had six people in a class, and it was suspected that it was suspected. It can only be said. Because there is no official determination, it is rumor to make rumors. "

Mr. Chen said that monkey acne is infectious disease. If the official knows that he told reporters, he might go to jail. Ms. Li in Wuhan also told reporters that there are local people with acne infected, but they must be officially announced.

The Beijing Centers for Disease Prevention and Control issued an announcement on the 6th that two cases of monkey acne were found in Beijing for the first time. One of them was an overseas input case, and the other was a related case of an overseas input case. Both cases were infected through intimate contact. In the announcement, the official did not specifically mention what measures will be taken to prevent virus diffusion. On the 10th, the Guangzhou Disease Control Center announced that two cases of acne were monitored. The cases are 43 -year -old men and 29 -year -old men. The case is being isolated in a designated hospital, and the symptoms are mild.

Mr. Huang, a resident of Qingdao, Shandong, said in an interview with this station that the most worried about the local people in the near future is the new crown virus, the second is monkey acne. The new crown is infected with more people, and the case of monkey acne is unknown. He said: "Monkey acne infection, and the people are currently very nervous. Now there are many people wearing masks, mainly to prevent monkey acne."

Weibo account@微 微 微: Monkey acne is caused by monkey acne virus infection, and is close relatives with smallpox. The earliest discovery was found on the monkeys, and rabbits, natives, etc. can also be infected and passed on to people. People can spread through droplets or infection. Symptoms are similar to smallpox. Monkey's mortality rate is 1 to 10%. Express fever, chickenpox, headache, muscle pain, and lymphadenopathy. There are no targeted drugs and vaccines, but inoculating the ceiling vaccine can prevent 85%.

The World Health Organization has announced on May 11 that the epidemic of monkey acne no longer constitutes "international concerns of emergencies."

In May 2022, Gross (second from right), director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, visited Japan and stood in front of a storage tank that stored nuclear waste water.

** After many years of domestic and foreign debates and several prime ministers come and go, the Japanese government plans to discharge more than 1.3 million tons of nuclear waste water in the Fukushima first nuclear power plant this summer into the Pacific Ocean, causing global attention and Asian neighbors. **

Because this is the first large -scale nuclear waste water discharge in human history, the controversy is huge. It includes food safety, marine pollution, and radioactive substances that affect human health and other issues, which caused excitement in Asia. Japanese neighboring countries and global environmental protection people are worried that nuclear waste water containing radioactive homogenicin (Tritium) into the ocean will cause great risks to the global human health and marine ecology and seriously affect fisheries. Beijing has taken the lead in criticizing Japan to disregard the safety of neighbors, and the Hong Kong and Macao government has also threatened to expand the scope of Japanese product imports.

Analyze the dispute over Fukushima Nuclear Water, and the host of the French National Research Center in Japan, Dr. Cécileasanuma-Brice, the host of the "Fukushima Disaster" plan, accepted the BBC Chinese interview that Japan had decided to restart nuclear power on a large scale and relieve it at the same time. After the evacuation order in the Fukushima disaster area, she believes that Tokyo is wiking all the traces of the nuclear disaster accident, "making the region a model area that Japan can resist the nuclear disaster accident. To achieve this goal, the government quickly removes all traces of the accident. It is important, but the existence of huge storage tanks will be visually reminded to remind everyone that such a disaster has happened in the past. "

Dr. Asanuma-Brice questioned the decision of wastewater discharge. She told BBC that global marine scientists have expressed concern about the impact of emissions on marine life and fisheries. She believes that the more wise plan is to continue to store and waste water until the radioactivity of the cricket is naturally reduced. "There are still space around the nuclear power plant and its range, and new storage tanks can be built."

However, the Japanese government emphasized that a water channel for processing and discharge wastewater has been built at the beach neighbor of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station. After completion, it will be discharged after being checked and confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Even so, it is only one step away from the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste water.

[Japan's million -ton Fukushima nuclear waste water is discharged when you just drink a jar of peach juice? ](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65107965)* [Scientific issues in Taiwan's Dispute Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, or diplomatic considerations](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-56970000)* [China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian used Ukiyo -e -pictures to satirize the nuclear wastewater to discharge the sea and cause controversy](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-56927228)BBC Chinese compiled various issues and debates caused by the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste water, including laws, ecological controversy, and the fierce response of Asian neighbors in Japan.

### Why is the Asian reaction fierce

** China ** ** and Hong Kong and Macau **

Over the years, China has been opposed to the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste water. On June 12, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, criticized Japan to pollute the ocean and harm the common interests of human beings at a press conference, "extremely selfish and irresponsible." On May 27, the Chinese representatives criticized Tokyo's plans at the World Health Conference (WHA), asking Japan to not discharge nuclear waste water before reaching an agreement with governments of various countries.

The Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Region Government is consistent with Beijing's attitude. It is believed that Japan can only act after communicating an agreement with the affected countries and the government.

Hong Kong Environment and Ecological Director Xie Zhanhuan accepted an exclusive interview with Radio last week that as soon as Japan announced the discharge of nuclear waste water, Hong Kong would immediately prohibit the import of aquatic products from the "highest risk county" along the coast of Fukushima. Aquatic products in other risky counties will also implement severe import control.

In fact, Hong Kong has banned vegetables, milk beverages and fruits from imports from Hong Kong, but does not include fruit juice. According to Hong Kong's "Ming Pao", Xie Zhanhuan said that food imported from Japan to Hong Kong accounted for only 2%of the overall food supply of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is expected to have a small impact, but it is understood that Hong Kong people love Japanese food "emotional influence".

In addition, a spokesman for Wellcom, one of the largest chain supermarkets in Hong Kong, responded to BBC Chinese in writing, "The company has always attached great importance to food safety. We welcome the government to strengthen the pumping Japanese food to ensure the safety of citizens." Pay attention to the future policies announced by the Hong Kong government, and will cooperate with and comply with relevant import and export requirements.

Macau announced stricter measures. The Macau Municipal Administration said on June 13 that once Japan began to discharge Fukushima nuclear waste water, it would suspend import applications such as aquatic products, vegetables and fruits including 9 counties and cities including Tokyo, Chiba Prefecture. The Macau Municipal Administration also said that it will not be ruled out that fresh food in other places to import Macau in other parts of Japan must also begin to attach radiation test certificates.

**South Korea**

South Korean environmental protection groups held a demonstration in Seoul in 2022 to protest the Japanese nuclear wastewater discharge plan.

South Korea, which is separated from Japan, has not opposed Japanese discharge wastewater like the government this time, but South Korea has no plans to relieve the ban on Fukushima food. However, since 2013, the South Korean government has banned the import of all aquatic products from neighboring counties such as Fukushima Prefecture, Ibaraki Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture in Japan, and the rice and mushrooms in the production of Fukushima Prefecture to South Korea.The Hong Kong media "South China Morning Post" quoted data that a thousand people's transfer in South Korea showed that more than 85%of Koreans were opposed to Japanese discharge wastewater. 70%of the respondents said that if they continue to discharge wastewater, they will reduce edible seafood.

The nuclear sewage storage tank of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan will be used up in 2022. How to deal with more than 1 million tons of sewage will be a major issue for Japan and abroad.

Many Korean fishermen are also deeply anxious about nuclear waste water discharge.

Kim Eun'e (transliteration) from Jeju Island told the BBC Korean group, "From a broad sense, we think we are marine creatures because we use our own body to enter the water directly. When we work In our mouths, we also enter our eyes, nose and skin. We dive for about five hours a day -this means that we are at the front line of potential danger. "

Ms. Jin said, "I am in my forties and the youngest sea girl in our village. I think I stand on the crossroads. I am seriously considering whether this should be my last year. For us This is not only an economic problem, but also a matter of life and death. "

Another fisherman who lives in Toriyama Park Xijun (transliteration) told BBC that "In fact, radioactive substances may not enter our sea area. I am also anxious. Young people who come here to work here are just waiting and watching. They are ready to return to the city. "

Many people think that there are land next to the Fukushima nuclear power plant to continue to store nuclear waste water (May 2023).

**Taiwan**

It is also located in East Asia, and the Taiwan government does not discharge the wastewater in Fukushima in Japan. The Taiwan Executive Yuan Atomic Energy Committee stated that it would pay close attention and emphasize that the discharge of nuclear waste water from Fukushima will mainly move with the North Pacific Ocean to the East Pacific and the United States. Only a small part will flow to Taiwan. The sea area has been further diluted.

In February last year, Taiwan announced the loosening food control measures in Fukushima in Japan and five counties around the world, but mushrooms and wild birds and beast meat were still prohibited. Former President Ma Ying -jeou attacked the Cai government at the time to disregard public opinion. However, the Kuomintang is also asking the Taiwan government to restart the nuclear power, and Hou Youyi, a 2024 presidential candidate representing the Kuomintang, recently said that he will support the continued use of nuclear power. The wealthy Taiwanese businessman Guo Taiming also said that the nuclear power is clean and safe. A nuclear power plant has caused public opinion.

The "National Waste Nuclear Action Platform" of environmental protection groups voiced last year and actively opposed Japan to discharge nuclear waste water into the sea, saying that Japan should not consider the cost of filtering wastewater, and put the environmental ecology, marine fisheries and people's health in neighboring countries on the threat of radiation pollution. Among them. A fisherman surnamed Wang in Wanli, the North Coast of New Taipei City, told Taiwan Union News Network that "it is best not to be discharged into the seawater." Mr. Wang said that the fishermen next to him have opinions on Japanese emissions of nuclear waste water, which will inevitably affect fisheries: "In Japan, the floating stone floated to the north coast of Taiwan, and the fishermen were damaged. If you can't see it, the impact will exceed imagination. "

### Can the law prevent emissions?

In June 2020, UN human rights experts have publicly called on Tokyo's human rights obligations for the process of nuclear waste treatment. After the United Nations hopes that Japan will start an appropriate international consultation after the new crown epidemic crisis is over, and then decide whether to discharge nuclear waste water. Based on this, Greenpeace emphasized that how nuclear waste water handles the far -reaching impact on humans and the earth for several generations, and it is also related to the livelihood of local fishermen in Japan and human rights of people in other countries.

However, in addition to calling for negotiation dialogue, can outsiders prevent Japanese discharge nuclear waste water through legal channels?

Regarding Japan's "whether it is really harmless to the marine environment, ecology and human health", there are major differences in different countries and groups.

Professor Rao Ruizheng explained to the BBC that this is a scientific factual issue that must be handled and demonstrated through scientific methods. In terms of international law, if the Convention of the International Nuclear Energy Damage, or Article 194 of the United Nations Marine Law Convention in 1982, can all require Japan's legal liability for pollution prevention obligations and damage compensation. "However, the premise must be scientifically harmful in science and cause and effect."

According to the convention, countries can apply to the International Oceanic Court for a ban to prevent the nuclear waste water discharge plan. But no country has filed a lawsuit.The Green Peace Organization stated that its position is unchanged and believes that the Japanese government should use surrounding land to build more water storage sinks, store waste water, and seek more secure solutions.

### "何" is the key?

Regarding the Fukushima nuclear waste water, many scientists focus on the controversy of "氚" residue. Simply put, 种 is a kind of radioactin of hydrogen, which generally exists after nuclear reactions. After 311, water contaminated with high concentration of radioactive substances after nuclear disaster. Although purified and diluted, the wastewater still contains crickets. The Japanese government emphasizes the treatment of nuclear waste water without residual radioactive pollutants except radioactive. In other words, only wastewater containing waste water will be excreted into the ocean. Moreover, Tokyo believes that the nuclear waste water containing crickets will only produce very weak radiation, which will not be harmful to ocean or human health.

However, green peace emphasizes that 氚 is indeed a low -energy radioactive substance, but it does not mean that its influence is weak, and once plants, animals and humans are intake, it may cause damage. The organization's nuclear energy researcher Shaunbernie wrote that 氚 is not harmless as the Japanese government's propaganda.

The Japanese government decided to discharge Fukushima nuclear waste water in the spring of 2023. The Japanese fishery industry was opposed, and neighboring China, South Korea and Taiwan also expressed questioning.

Regardless of its position, if Japan discharged nuclear waste water this summer, in Japan and Asian countries, it will inevitably have a great impact and controversy. Dr. Asanuma-Brice told BBC that she believed that the most seriously affected local residents of Fukushima, especially fishermen. "For them, this decision is catastrophic and causes harm to their work."

She said that although Tokyo has implemented active publicity policies to allow the public to accept nuclear waste water discharge, polls show that about half of the people in Japan still have about half of their objections.

Dr. Asanuma-Brice said that the marine ecosystem will also be affected because even if similar pollution already exists elsewhere, the discharge of nuclear waste water will still form additional pollution. She emphasized that some scientists (such as the Director of the Kavaro Marine Lab, Richmond) also said that radioactive nuclear may spread with the ocean flow and will bring marine creatures (such as floating plants) who migrate long -term migration in the ocean for a long time. And floating plants are the basis of all marine biological food chains.

"The current problem is uncertainty. It is better to take more time to consider various possible solutions." She told BBC.

The picture shows a scene of Shanghai Bund. (Data photo)

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The EUROPEAN Union Chamber of Commerce Inchina (June 21) announced the annual survey report on Wednesday (June 21), saying that "the confidence in Europe in China has declined significantly." Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, JenseSkelund, told the media that the business confidence of enterprises in China "almost reached the lowest level since record", and it is expected that the regulatory environment will not really improve in the next 5 years.

According to the report, 62%of the 570 companies surveyed said that they had missed business opportunities due to regulatory obstacles. And 64%of companies believe that operation in China has become more difficult in the past year, and 30%of corporate revenue has decreased year -on -year. These two numbers have reached a record high. The number of enterprises that regard China as the first three future investment destinations decreased by 13 percentage points year -on -year and fell to 55%. This is the lowest level since the investigation proposed in 2010.

The report pointed out that in the past year, "China's business environment has intensified", and 26%of companies have faced challenges in this area. Sell products that do not contain Chinese or American parts. In addition, due to the impact of the Russian and Ukraine War, many companies "re -examined the Chinese market" and thought about whether its business would be affected by the upgrading of the tension of the Taiwan Strait.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-21T08-11-52-00-00/000155006_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

The new 618 ended, and the e -commerce platforms were not announced by the GMV without exception.

According to the latest data of the National Bureau of Statistics, in May, the total retail sales of social consumer goods was 3780.3 billion yuan, an increase of 12.7%year -on -year, a 5.7 percentage point from the previous month; and a 0.42%increase from the previous month. From January to May, the total retail sales of social consumer goods was 187.636 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.3%, which was 0.8 percentage points accelerated from January to April. The national online retail sales were 5690.6 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 13.8%, which was 1.5 percentage points accelerated from January to April. Among them, the online retail sales of physical goods were 4805.5 billion yuan, an increase of 11.8%, accounting for 25.6%of the total retail sales of consumer goods. The above data shows that the trend of national consumption recovery is not clear. To some extent, the platform does not announce the 618GMV reasons for each platform. Furthermore, the era of e -commerce GMV theory has ended.

As the first e -commerce shopping festival in the post -epidemic era, it is also an important opportunity for recovery and expanding consumption at the moment. Participated in the e -commerce platform of this year's 618. In addition to traditional e -commerce Alibaba, JD.com, and Pinduoduo, there are also Social e -commerce vibrato, fast hands, and other new e -commerce companies that have risen in recent years, as well as other zero -zero total and forms. In general, after 20 years of development, the e -commerce industry has become a traditional industry. The market competition is quite sufficient, and it has reached the level of fierceness.

Obviously, the competition between the Chinese e -commerce market platform before the epidemic is layered. If there is a portrait portrait for consumers focusing on the traditional e -commerce giants, they will get different answers: they shop in Alibaba Tian, a 30 -year -old city married woman, to get an old and younger food. Dressing, Ali gave her enough richness; who was keen to shop in JD.com was a 35 -year -old middle -class man who focused on 3C digital products. Duoduo wool is a middle -aged woman who lives in third- and fourth -tier cities in the age of 50. The most concerned is the low price. Nowadays, this layered competition has been broken, and the portrait portrait portraits of various platforms are becoming more and more blurred, or they are becoming more and more unified. Competition between platforms is becoming more and more similar, and there are no more distinctive divisions.

As a result, cheap, practical, living and work needs rather than exquisite enjoyment needs, and unintentional pursuit of brands have become the basic characteristics of national consumption in the present and future periods. The reason why national consumption demand will show this trend that is centered on price (low -cost) as its core, and it is inseparable from the macroeconomic situation in the short term. It is important to point out that the consumption demand for middle -income groups has been significantly declined in the post -epidemic era, which shows that consumers are smoothly arranging their consumption expenditure in a long period of time. Orient conservative strategy. Therefore, the platform that focused on the middle -income group had deeply realized that relying on this group alone was not enough to support its traditional share in the e -commerce market. To this end, Ali and JD.com have made corresponding adjustments. Ali will rename this year's 618logo from the previous year's "Tmall 618" to "Taobao Tmall 618" (Tmall targets medium and above income groups, Taobao targets the sinking market) The root cause of JD.com's previous coach is also in the neglect of Xu Lei's strategy.

According to CICC's data, the population with a monthly income of less than 5,000 yuan in 2022 accumulated 1.328 billion, accounting for 94.8%of the total population of 1.4 billion. The largest number of equivalent. In fact, the needs and preferences of Chinese consumers have not changed substantially, and the sinking market has always been the core market of the Chinese consumer market. Only in the era of economy, the consumption concepts of medium and above income groups dominated the entire e -commerce market. The surface prosperity made the real consumption demand of the sinking market was not valued by the platform and merchants.

As the well -known Austrian school economist Ludwig von Messeis advocates the 20th century, the price of goods and services on the market is ultimately determined by the market supply and demand relationship. Therefore, consumer demand and desire have a Decisive influence. There is no need to say that in the process of market economy, the main body of market exchange activities and consumer activities is consumer, that is, consumer consumer demand and consumer behavior starts the reproduction process of social production. Therefore, the market economy must not only be based on consumer sovereignty, but also directly reflects the consumer's sovereign economy. Consumer sovereignty is a key factor in organizing production under the conditions of the market economy. Specifically, each consumer purchase goods or labor is to vote with the "currency votes" they own, so as to indicate their needs and choices of various commodities or labor services. In this way, consumers' "currency votes" for purchasing goods or labor services not only indicate the direction of products and its structure adjustment of the production and operations of production operators, but also provide motivation for production and operation activities for production and operators.

Based on the reality of consumer sovereignty theory and consumption shrinkage, the platform and merchants have made corresponding adjustments, that is, the supply side changes with the changes in the consumption side. The core concept is that users are first. Taking Taobao as an example, during 618 this year, the comprehensive support for small and medium -sized merchants exceeded previous years. In my opinion, the ultimate goal of supporting small and medium -sized merchants is to achieve ecological prosperity. Only by opening up the upward path of small and medium businesses can small and medium businesses help small and medium businesses go hand in hand with brands. The brand solves the problem of certainty, while small and medium -sized merchants solve rich and creative problems. After all, in a better ecology, there should be more fish and more fish. This has changed the practice of pursuing GMV in the past to pursue GMV, and blindly tilting traffic into brand enterprises and brand businesses, making small and medium businesses and sinking markets really see. In fact, the truth is very simple. We know that private enterprises, especially small and medium -sized private enterprises, have provided the largest proportion of employment for the Chinese economy. Similarly, the consumption level is the same. Essence Small and medium businesses have the mentality of entrepreneurs and have the advantages of "small, fast, spiritual". They can respond very quickly for scattered and long -tail demand. They are naturally suitable for rich tracks.

In terms of price, this year's 618 platforms have made every effort to restore and expand consumption. Various subsidies are dazzling, in order to maximize the benefits of consumers. It should be emphasized that not all platforms are blindly pursuing "low prices", and some platforms have proposed "good prices". The premise of "good price" must be good goods, that is, special products with price advantages. Back to the platform support, small and medium -sized businesses also hope to make a balance between consumers' experience guarantees such as commodity quality and service links and prices.Of course, from the perspective of consumer sovereignty theory, the role of the government is also crucial. The government should properly handle various complex economic relations under the fundamental interests of consumers under the fundamental interests of consumers. We see that on June 20, the Symposium on the Restoration and Expansion of Consumer Research and Consultation was held in Beijing to negotiate about the relevant research results carried out by the Democratic Party Central Committee, the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the representatives of non -party parties. Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He said that it is necessary to deeply understand the restoration and expanding consumption is the deserved meaning of the modernization of Chinese -style modernization, the inevitable choice to achieve high -quality development, and the inherent requirements of realizing the expected goals of the year's economic development.

###  Beethoven D small violin concerto

Beethoven's "D Great Violin Concerto" was created in 1806. The first violinist Franz Clement (1780-1842) of the Vienna Theater premiered in Vienna on December 23, 1806.

At the time of the premiere, the work did not get a good response. The comments believed that the structure of the work was weak, and the endless repetition easily caused fatigue. With the changes in the times and the change of aesthetic interest, people began to recognize the profound connotation in this concerto. It is elegant and large -scale, and has a king's style. On the basis of following the principles of Mozart's classical concerto, it absorbs the creative style of the French school, coupled with the rigorous tradition of German, and also shows the delicate and tender side of Beethoven. The violin and orchestra not only talk in the beautiful melody, but also achieve harmony and unity in the interweaving and changes in each other.

This concerto can be called the highest level of the violinist's highest state of the violinist, and it is also known as the first of the four -major violin concerto.

Please listen to the performances of Violinist Augustin Hadelich and West Germany Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra.

Shortly after the Myanmar coup leader Min Aung Lai came to power in February 2021, ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and ASEAN and Myanmar reached a five -point peace plan.

ASEAN plans to call for immediately stop violence, provide safe humanitarian access, and restore peaceful to inclusive dialogue, but the military did not show their willingness to implement the plan.

After failed to implement the five -point peace plan, ASEAN banned the Myanmar general from attending the summit, while Myanmar joined ASEAN in 1997 under the military regime.

When speaking at a fundraising activity in California, Biden talked about the "balloon incident" that had continued to fall into the freezing point in the freezing point. He said, "The reason why Xi Jinping was particularly angry was that I shot down the two spy equipment filled with two spy equipment. When he is a balloon, he doesn't know where it (balloon) is there.

"Bayon also mentioned in his speech that China was facing economic difficulties.

U.S. President's remarks about China have caused great dissatisfaction in Beijing. The next day, Mao Ning, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference, "The United States' remarks are extremely ridiculous, irresponsible, seriously violated the basic facts, seriously violated diplomatic etiquette, and seriously violated Chinese political dignity. This strong dissatisfaction, resolute opposition. "

### Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.

(Voice of Germany) In the past 26 years, the Asia New ZealandFoundation (Asia New ZealandFoundation) conducts such public opinion surveys every year. The latest questionnaire survey results show that 37%of the respondents regard China as a threat, which is significantly decreased compared with the 58%ratio of a 58%of the poll in 2022.

As a member of the "Five Eye Alliance" (other members also include the United States, Canada, Britain, and Australia), New Zealand has traditionally tended to adopt a relatively soft policy in China. However, since the signing of a security agreement on Beijing and Solomon Islands, New Zealand's criticism of Chinese diplomatic measures has gradually increased.

[The United States and its allies are seeking to prevent more Pacific Island countries and China conclude a security agreement](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/斥資抗衡中國-澳洲擴大與太平洋國家合作/a-65568233)In the context of the continued tension of the United States and China relations due to Taiwan's issues and trade disputes, this move in Beijing also brought anxiety to Western countries.

"The New Zealanders have always been vigilant about the geopolitical development of Asia, and many of them are concerned about the potential possibilities of large -scale conflicts in the Taiwan Strait." Simondraper, executive director of the New Zealand Foundation of Asia.

This year, the foundation first raised the New Zealanders about the situation in the Taiwan Strait in the questionnaire survey, and found that nearly two -thirds of the respondents said that at least the conflict of Taiwan Island was "very worried".

China regards Taiwan as its national territory and said that it does not rule out the use of unified use of force. The Taiwan side strongly opposes China's sovereign demands, and declares that only the people of Taiwan can determine the future future of Taiwan.

Last year's relevant polls were carried out shortly after visiting the Solomon Islands in the Solomon Islands at the time of China (currently the director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China).

[New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/希普金斯将接棒成为新西兰新总理/a-64475078)It is expected to lead the trade delegation to China this weekend. Prior to this, US Secretary of State Broskel just ended his trip to China. In the context of the tension between Sino -US relations, Brinton's visit aims to stabilize bilateral relations and avoid contradiction upgrades.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T09-59-48/1-1687338806.jpg)A photo of an unprepared date shows that the Titan submersible is diving. The submersible is operated by Oceangate Expeditions and used to explore the wreckage of the Titanic sinking in Newfoundland coast.(Reuters)The United States Coast Guard said that a Canadian aircraft involved in the search for the missing deep -sea vessels in the Titanic wreckage found "underwater noise in the search area."

On Wednesday, on Wednesday, the Coast Guard stated that the remote control submersible (ROV) was re-placed due to the noise of the P-3 maritime reconnaissance aircraft detected and "trying to explore the source of noise."

The Coast Guard stated in a tweet that so far, the remote control submersible "has brought negative results", but they are still searching.

It added, "In addition, the data of the P-3 aircraft has been shared with our U.S. Navy experts for further analysis, which will be considered in the future search plan."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T09-59-48/2-1687338814.jpg)What we know so far: looking for the missing Titanic submersible

The coast guards did not explain the nature or range of the sound detected, or how these sounds encountered.

The "Rolling Stone" magazine, which quotes the internal communication of the US government, is the first media to report the news of the so -called "impact sound every 30 minutes".

The magazine quoted an internal email issued by officials issued to the US Department of Homeland Security, saying "an additional sound is deployed four hours later, but it can still hear the sound of impact."

According to the official, the missing Titan submersible is operated by the headquarters of Oceangate Expeditions in the United States. According to its specifications, it can stay underwater for 96 hours to allow 5 people on the boat to stay on Thursday morning until the air consumption until the air consumption until the air consumption until the air consumption. All.

In April 1912, the wreckage of the Titanic sinking in Virgin Airlines was about 1450 kilometers east of Keddar, Massachusetts, 644 kilometers (400 miles) south of Saint Johns, Newfoundland.

A spokesman for the American Air Command of the United States said that the three C-17 transport aircraft of the U.S. military have been put into use in order to transport commercial submersible and supporting equipment from Buffalo, New York to St. Johns in Newfoundland to assist in the search.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T09-59-48/3-1687338822.png)Where is the wreckage of Titanic Titanic? The wreckage of the luxury ocean passenger ship is located at the bottom of the Atlantic, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) from Newfoundland, Canada. The expedition to visit the wreckage starts from St. Johns.(Peninsula TV Station)The Canadian military said it has provided a patrol aircraft and two surface ships, one of which is equipped with a diving medical expert. In addition, it puts a sound buoy to listen to any sound from Titan.

Earlier on Sunday, a pilot and four passengers were in a miniature submersible. At that time, it began to sneak into the sea to visit the Titanic, but lost contact with the mother ship with the water on the water after sneaking in about 1 hour and 45 minutes.

It is believed that the per capita cost of the Titan expedition is 250,000 US dollars, including Hamishharding, a 58 -year -old British billionaire, and a 48 -year -old Pakistan -born businessman Shahzada Dawood. And his 19 -year -old son, British citizen Suleman, 77 -year -old French explorer Pierre Nargeolet, and OceangateExpeditions founder and CEO Stolkon Rash (Stockton Rush), the authorities have not confirmed the identity of any passenger.

#### "Let passengers face potential extreme danger"

With the crazy search on Wednesday, it is reported that according to a 2018 lawsuit, Oceangate's former maritime operation director has put forward security concerns about the Titan before being fired.

David Lochridge's doubts about the safety of the missing submersible are included in his response to Oceangate's lawsuit to him.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T09-59-48/4-1687338828.jpg)Canada continues to look for the missing Titanic tourist submarine(Peninsula TV Station)According to a lawsuit filed by the US District Court of Seattle at that year, Rockridon wrote an engineering report in 2018, saying that the submarine that is developing needs to perform more tests, because when it reaches "extreme depth", passengers may may being threatened. Oceangate prosecuted Rockridge for this and accused him of violating the confidentiality agreement. The latter also proposed a counterclaim, claiming that he was wrongly dismissed for asking questions about testing and safety.

After a few months of submission, the case reached a reconciliation.

The main concerns of Rockridge are that the company decided to rely on sensitive acoustic monitoring (Titan hulls will break or burst under pressure) to detect defects instead of scanning the hull. He said the company told him that there was no equipment that could perform such testing equipment for 5 inches (12.7 cm) thick carbon fiber hulls.

Rockridge's counterclaim said, "This is a problem, because this type of acoustic analysis only shows the time of the component that is about to fail. It is usually a few milliseconds before the inside explosion, and it will not be pressured by pressure on the hull before it will not be pressured by the hull. Test any existing defects. "

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T09-59-48/5-1687338838.jpg)High details scanning 3D appearance provided by Titanic Ship Ship(Peninsula TV Station)In addition, the design depth of the ship is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles), where the Titanic is moored. However, according to Rockridge, the passenger vision area is only certified, and it can only reach 1.3 kilometers (0.81 miles) in depth, and Oceangate will not pay the cost of the manufacturer to build a 4 -kilometer certification area.

The counterclaim also pointed out that Oceangate's choice will "let passengers face potential extreme danger in experimental submersibles." However, the company stated in his complaint that Rockridge was "not an engineer, nor was it hired or asked to provide engineering services for the Titan."

The complaint also said that he was fired for refusing to accept the guarantee of the chief engineer of Oceangate, that is, in fact, acoustic monitoring and testing agreements are more suitable for detection defects than scanning.

Experts said they should be cautious because they have not been reviewed by colleagues.(Reuters)Scientists first used stem cells to create a structure similar to human embryo in the laboratory, which prompted people to call on scientists to implement stricter supervision of rapidly developing stem cell research.

In the past 7 days, many laboratories around the world have released a pre -print version of research reports to explain their research, and experts have said that they should treat such studies with caution and have not yet been reviewed by peer.

These laboratories use different technologies to encourage human embryonic stem cells (can be differentiated into any type of cells) to self -develop into a structure similar to embryo without sperm, eggs or fertilization.

The purpose of this study is to provide a model in line with ethics for scientists. Unprecedented ways to study human embryos, and hope to obtain new insights on birth defects, genetic diseases, infertility and other problems during pregnancy. Essence

The first announcement of this research was released on Wednesday (14th this month). At that time, the professor of Cambridge University and the California Institute of Technology Magda Lenica Zenica Gotz introduced the research by her team at the Annual Meeting of the International Stem Cell Studies Society in Boston.

The British "Guardian" first reported her related introduction.

Subsequently, the team of Jacob Hannah at the Institute of Science in the Institute of Science in Israel released a pre -printed version of the study on the 15th to introduce their research on human embryo models based on stem cells.

Zenica Gotz's team subsequently released their pre-print version research and provided more information. China and other laboratories in the United States have also followed suit and released different pre -printed version research later last week.

The researchers refuted the media reports called "synthetic embryos", and said that they were not synthesis in the strict sense, but grew from stem cells, and should not be regarded as embryo.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T10-00-46/image-1687339197.jpg)Edit Human Genome: Scientists meet to discuss rare diseases(news agency)#### "It's almost incredible"

A large amount of data highlights the high competitiveness of research in this field.

In August last year, Zenica Gotz's team and Jacob Hanna's team have published research papers on their first embryonic structures on their use of mice stem cells.

Both teams told AFP reporters that their latest research has been accepted by the famous peer review journals -and they have shown their work at academic conferences a few months before the recent media attention.

Hana refused to accept the views of both teams as "first" and claimed that they had achieved very different achievements.

He told AFP reporters that his model structure has the characteristics of "placenta, yolk, amniotic cavity" and other embryo characteristics, while Zenica Gotz's structure lacks such characteristics.

Other researchers also seemed to agree that Hanna's model was more advanced, and praised its team to induce cells into embryo -like structures by only chemical rather than genetically modified.

Jesse Vifrite, a researcher at the Institute of Biology and Genetics of Max Planck in Germany, said, "Henna's model has obvious similarity with natural embryos, which is almost incredible."

Grand River Vidella, a stem cell biology expert in Reading University in the United Kingdom, told AFP that it is best to wait for colleagues to review these studies.

But he added that "the impact of these two studies is huge."

"We should try to avoid unhealthy hype, because this technology is still in the early stages, but new guidelines have been needed."

####  In the "Black Box Period"?

The two laboratories stated that the embryo model they developed reached 14 days, which is also the statutory period for many national laboratories to cultivate human embryos.

After 14 days, the embryo will begin to form different organs including the brain, and this period is also known as the "Black Box" because people know very little about embryo development at this stage.

Research regulations in this field vary from the country or region, but most of them are suitable for fertilized embryos, and new embryo models can be empty.

The University of Cambridge said on Friday that it had launched a project to develop the first stem cell management framework in the UK based on human embryo models.

Related scientists emphasized that they have no intention of implanted their embryo models into the human uterus -and even if they do so, they will not produce babies.

Vidella said that as a part of early research, the embryo model implanted with female macaques did induce some signs of pregnancy, but did not survive.

James Brisco, a Francis Crick Institute in Britain, called on researchers to act "cautious, careful, and transparently act.

He also emphasized that "the danger lies in mistakes or unreasonable claims, which will have a chilling effect on the public and policy makers, and this will be a major setback in the field."

For international audiences, the Secretary of State Brosky visited Beijing [Two days](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/blinken-china-xi-diplomacy/)These scenes are not surprising. Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs (or even never even) is welcomed by the airport. Meeting with the head of state itself is a very important and respectful symbol.

But for Chinese nationalist tendencies, especially people in social media, these scenes tell a different story. For them, Blindken received an invitation to visit China after several months. During his visit, he was educated to respect China's interests and played the role of Xiang Xi Ping. Chinese social media users gloatedly pointed out that Brins arrived on Father's Day. According to the Internet, Xi Jinping was the American father.

Nationalist reviews published by Bollingken's visit to China emphasized the view that Xi Jinping expressed when he met with the highest diplomat in the United States on Monday: "Competition of big powers does not meet the trend of the times." Means: the United States gather security partners to block China and cut off China to obtain advanced technology The way is not a benign competition, but encouraging conflicts.

Xi Jinping refused to accept the recent statement of the two US presidents on US -China relations, allowing people to doubt whether these two world super powers can reach strategic reconciliation in the next few years.

"They obviously do not agree with this framework at all," Ge Laiyi, director of the Indo -Pacific Project Director of the Marshall Foundation in the United States(Bonnie Glaser)explain.

"This triggers a question: What is the possibility of stability?"

It is unclear to how much the Chinese government has promoted the victory narrative on the Internet. However, China's censorship agencies have extensive control in influencing public opinion. When reporting this interview, the official news media, which is more old -fashioned and issued by the government talks, also emphasized the view of the Chinese government, that is, Brincken's trip is to reassure China. questionable.

Analysts say that China is portrayed as a powerful and responsible country, and is willing to alleviate tension with the good United States, which may help to cover the reasons for Beijing to re -contact with Washington.

This scene is well displayed to domestic audiences that China is a global country. It not only requires respect for other big powers. And also get it, "Tang Anzhu, a senior visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore, Li Guangyao,(Drew Thompson)explain.

He pointed out that Blindken's two previous Secretary of State -Mike Ponhar and Rex Tillerson -when they met Xi Jinping, they were sitting on the armchair next to Xi Jinping.

U.S. officials say that Brinken's visit to China is necessary, because the two world superpowers (also two largest economies and two largest troops) as competitors (also two largest economies and two largest troops) will maintain regular high -level diplomatic contact. Public conflict is very important. Not only are the government's governments seeking relationships, their allies and other countries also hope that the two countries will do so. Diplomatic contact allows both parties to express their views clearly in closed doors and public talks.

"If you want to defend the value of the United States on human rights issues, if you want to be released by the Americans who are detained here, or fight for China for help in response to the Finaster crisis, it is not possible to stand outside." Ens said in an interview on Tuesday. "Need to talk to them, pressure them, and do it as the Secretary of State Brinkeng visited China. The dialogue is not concession."

"The Chinese received the Secretary of State very solemnly," Bernus added that he participated in all the talks of Brinken. "President Xi Jinping is very polite during the meeting."

Chinese officials really want to turn their attention to business as the pillar of Sino -US relations. They have promoted the Minister of Finance Jennite Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Gina Raymond to visit, but U.S. officials insist on making Brinken First of them. It is now expected that the two US cabinet officials will visit China this summer, and John Kerry, a special envoy of climate change affairs, will also visit China.

Analysts say that China hopes to talk to US officials to help boost business confidence. Many traditional leverage (such as the real estate industry) of China's economic growth (such as the real estate industry) currently face severe challenges.

In addition, China wants to emphasize to the Biden government that it opposes [curbing China to gain](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221014/biden-china-technology-semiconductors/)Trade restrictions on important technologies such as advanced semiconductor chips.

"Xi Jinping's main motivation to receive Americans is because China's economic situation is very bad," said Linheli, a senior researcher at the Washington Research Institution Jameston Foundation, and Chinese political analyst. "Exit declines significantly, and more and more US and Western companies are transferring production bases from China."

China's reception Broskens also tried to lay the foundation for Xi Jinping to go to the United States to attend the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in November this year. This may bring Xi Jinping's face -to -face talks with US President Biden. This visit will help enhance Xi Jinping's global politician image.

Beijing may also be driven by another sense of urgency. The Chinese government wants to put pressure on the Biden government and ask them to make more guarantees. It will not incite independence in Taiwan, especially before the United States and Taiwan will hold the presidential election next year. Political personnel in the two places have increased their efforts to criticize the CCP in the presidential campaign year because they believe that this is helpful for winning votes.

China feels angry about the increasing support of the Bayeon Government's islands to democratic autonomy. Blingken's visit to China has the opportunity to show that it has warned the United States not to anger Beijing on the issue of Chinese leaders' call "core interests in China."

Although Brinken's visit to China may help ending the frozen bilateral diplomacy, this trip also highlights the fact that China ’s attitude towards Taiwan and the continuous expanded military and economic competition between the United States and China still threatened the two countries of the two countries.

Last August, after visiting Taiwan, the then Speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States, Beijing frozen the official interaction with Washington on military issues, climate change and drug issues.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) Reuters reported that according to the three internal reports of the Taiwan government they obtained, Taiwan believes that China tries to interfere with candidates who are beneficial to Beijing through illegal funding to interfere with the [Taiwan election] next year's [Taiwan election](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣總統大選戰爭與和平之間的抉擇/a-65415439)Essence Specific methods include using WeChat platforms or group tourism transportation funds.

The DPP government has repeatedly warned that China has tried to influence the public opinion in Taiwan society. Taiwan government officials, including Gu Lixiong, Secretary -General of the National Security Council, issued a warning this year, saying that China may try to influence the presidential election and the legislature election through activities including the dissemination of false information. However, the details of Taiwan's believe that China may use illegal funding have not yet been reported.

### to draw the swing voters

A Taiwanese security department officials who have a direct information about this matter told Reuters that China "hopes to influence the people of Taiwan by passing information to the grassroots community." He said: "They want to affect the uncertain voters. The fixed political faction tend to be, whoever gives them benefits, will they vote for whom. "

One of the security reports shows that the Taipei government's attention list is ranked in the front position.

Another report pointed out that Beijing may provide free travel opportunities for thousands of Taiwanese participating in election activities to "affect the voting decision". The targets include local politicians and administrative representatives, such as district chiefs and village chiefs.

### How to solve the problem of Taiwan in Beijing

Two security department officials revealed anonymously to Reuters that the Taipei government set up a cross -ministerial security working group called the "Pingshun" this year to pay attention to the activities of possible elections that may occur. Taiwan law prohibits funds provided by "external hostile forces" including China, including China.

###, WeChat, UnionPay card

A report based on the information of Taiwan's emotional consulting department states that China may use social application WeChat as a channel to transport funds. This application can also be downloaded and used in Taiwan, and its users can directly remit money very conveniently.

According to the report, the Chinese authorities may allow relevant candidates to establish a WeChat public account, and then mobilize users to give money support through the "audience reward". WeChat allows individuals to transfer up to 50,000 yuan (6971 US dollars) to others in single transactions, up to 200,000 yuan per day.

The report quoted an intelligence analysis that China may also cooperate with travel agencies to ask tourist group members to return to Taiwan with cash. The report also said that the underground bank in Taiwan can assist in exchange.

Another report pointed out that the CCP can financially support some specific groups or individuals in Taiwan to provide them with political contributions or funds required for elections.

The Taiwan MAC told Reuters that China "uses various means to actively interfere with elections to affect the election results." The purpose is to promote China's political agenda, including promoting "unification" with Taiwan.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-21T10-57-00Z/65754001_401.jpeg)For a period of time, the Taiwan Strait has been tense. Taipei said that the Chinese aircraft carrier "Shandong" formation passed the Taiwan Strait (data picture) on June 21, which is the second time in one month

In recent years, some Taiwanese have been prosecuted for accepting illegal support in China in the campaign. In the local election of New Taipei City last year, a government unit in Fujian Province, China, funded a number of new crown virus fast screening kits from a district chief candidate. This month, the candidate was ruled to violate the law of anti -bribery and reverse osmosis.

Another possible conveying channel listed by the report is a payment card supported by the UnionPay card system. In this way, Taiwanese can legally withdraw money from a bank account located in mainland China. In addition, direct transfer to Taiwan's Charity Foundation is also a possible way.

Representatives of the Labor Legislative Council questioned the Hong Kong Government. Under the slogan of "Patriotic Governing Hong Kong", their opinions were excluded by the Hong Kong Government.

[** Hong Kong pro -Beijing "Labor Federation" to withdraw from the May 1st Parade Application Democratic School? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf-04182023074123.html)*** [Can the former union backbone submitting the application of the May 1 Parade Hong Kong Government can tolerate it? ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf2-04122023075929.html)**

The Hong Kong Government announced earlier that the restrictions on the introduction of foreign workers caused a large -scale "blood change" for Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong government did not consult with pro -Chinese groups in advance, which also caused dissatisfaction with many pro -Chinese unions. The Hong Kong Legislative Council discussed the meeting of the laborers entering the foreign labor plan on Tuesday (June 20). Huang Guochi, a member of the Legislative Council of the Communist Party of China, asked the Hong Kong government why the Hong Kong government rejected their voice.

Huang Guo: "Chief Executive said that after improving the election system, the implementation of the patriotic governing Hong Kong is also a patriot and can be quantitative, but the government regards workers as floods. Active consultation, there is no participation and supervision in the labor community. I want to ask the authorities how to see the role of the labor industry in Hong Kong? Is there any rejection behind? "

Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao said that he understands the concern of the labor industry, but in the past few years, Hong Kong has decreased by 200,000, and the low -tech labor population owes more than 100,000. Attract the return of labor and solve the problem of Hong Kong's labor shortage.

** Comments: Implementing "Patriot Governance Hong Kong" Beijing has fully controlled the Hong Kong and Hong Kong government without using pro -China groups to support the policy **

Current affairs commentator Sanpu said that the dissatisfaction of the pro -Chinese groups to the Hong Kong Government reflected in the improvement of the election system, Beijing has fully controlled Hong Kong. The rubber charter has no political value in the eyes of the Communist Party of China.

Sanpu: "Comprehensive control of control, the governance of the patriotic governance, no longer have the autonomous space of the Hong Kong government, and all decree cannot be separated from the requirements of the Hong Kong and Macao Office and the China United Nations Office. In terms of the overall situation, it is insignificant. From the perspective of decision -making, how much is the remaining value left after these Hong Kong Communist forces? Of course, there are not many. Fewer and fewer."

** Comment: The incident highlights the internal contradictions of the Hong Kong -made school.

Current affairs commentator Liu Ruishao said that the incident highlights the internal contradictions of the Hong Kong -made faction, especially in the power of democratic factions. After being cleaned in Hong Kong, the ICBC and other traditionalist spokespersons were weakened. The representatives of the grassroots and grassroots are only sacrificed by the authorities.

Liu Ruishao: "There is no political contradiction between the Hong Kong -made school and the mainland. Everyone has the same nostrils, but it involves the problem that involves grass -roots workers and no political factors. The contradiction between the interests of different circles and factions, these two contradictions are now coming out. In the system, if you do not have the cost of bargaining, the weak grassroots workers will become a sacrifice person, especially now on the mainland economy. So how to obtain benefits from Hong Kong is a natural thinking. "

Financial commentators Li Shimin said that at this stage, for China and Hong Kong, ensuring social stability and stimulating economic rebound are the most important tasks. It is also expected that the cost of reducing the low operator through exploitation is also expected.

There is really no corruption in the Mao era? Unscrupulous cadre privileges **

Hello everyone, welcome everyone to listen to "History of the Great", I am the host Sun Cheng. Today, we will continue to carry out a series of historical programs of the Cultural Revolution to tell the social background of the Red Guards Movement.

In the previous lecture, we mentioned that in the middle school campus on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, there was a strong irrational worship of Mao Zedong. At that time, young people did not even dare to imagine that Mao Zedong would conduct daily physiological activities like the general public, and looked at Mao Zedong like looking at the gods. On the other hand, after repeated brainwashing hate education by the authorities, these young people have been taught to hate the so -called "American Emperor", "Su Xiu" and "Class Enemies", and have been informed that China is the most advanced and beautiful in the world. The country and Beijing are the center of the World Revolution, and the "US Emperor", "Su Xiu" and "Class Enemies" are said to be trying to carry out a subversive activity that can make "millions of people landing", thereby destroying this so -called world " The most advanced and beautiful countries destroy the world revolution. And such a absurd worldview, in fact, was dominated by the whole society at that time, and was highly unified at all levels of society.

However, in the previous lecture, we also talked about a very strange question: If the whole society was accepting a highly uniform brainwashing narrative at that time, why in schools with extremely serious brainwashing education, those who also shouted the same shouting The Red Guards of "Long live Mao" slogan will be divided into multiple opposite factions during the Cultural Revolution. Is there any social foundation for these opposite factions? Under the high -intensity brainwashing of the authorities at that time, did people really lose all their personal rationality? Today's lecture, let us continue to see what social differentiation is in the middle school on the eve of the Cultural Revolution.

The first thing to note is that as the capital of the Communist Party of China, Beijing has always gathered a large number of children of the CCP cadres. Their existence has something to do with the birth of the Red Guards in the Affiliated High School of Tsinghua University. After we stay in details, we will be described in detail after staying. Here, we must first understand that the Mao era is by no means a romantic era of so -called "everyone's equality", but an era of unbridled privileges given by the political system. These high -ranking children have extensive privileges in schools before the Cultural Revolution, and the source of these privileges is their parents. As for their parents, what privileges have it? Let's give a few examples here. Scholar Yang Jizhong, in his masterpiece of the history of the Cultural Revolution, once described the situation of a CCP cadre entertainment venue in Beijing, saying:

"The Beijing Beekeeper Taoism Club, which was put into use in October 1958, is a place for senior cadres to eat, drink, and fun. The building is luxurious, and the quiet Houhu Lake is connected to the North Sea. The beautiful actresses selected from the arts groups make dance partners for the central leaders. The top ten restaurants in Beijing have tuned the entertainment and senior chef, hairdresser, and senior athlete. All, and they are all customized according to the requirements of the head. In less than a year, the beekeeping roads cannot be accommodated. The leaders of the central and Beijing cities decided to occupy seven hectares on the west and expand three buildings for senior cadres to eat and drink. Play and wait. They ask this so -called '08' project to "not lag behind" for twenty years. Such a huge project, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee cannot bear it in manpower and material resources. With the banner of the central government, we will engage in building materials and equipment in various places. During the construction process, they dismantled the heavy cover as soon as they saw the unpleasant place. It has been built for six years and it took nearly 10 million yuan to be completed before the Cultural Revolution. The basement in the building has a range of 50 meters in the shooting range, and there are sound insulation equipment around. There are rooms of central leaders. The hospitality fee will be reported by the state financial reality. "

From the descriptions above, we can see how high the CCP ’s high -drying at the time was. It was shocking. It can be said that it is not as much as the rotten life of the contemporary CCP cadres disclosed today. There is no difference between the "Red Mansion" of the enrollment cadre. So, is it only the Gao Gan who lived in Beijing to live such a life? The answer is of course negative. Yang Jizhong's book also cited other places in other places:

"In the era of the Great Famine, Sichuan Province starved to death tens of millions of people. Li Jingquan, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, listened to the court every night in Panjiaping, Chongqing (called the actor, singing for him), and after listening to eating supper. Zhang Zhongliang, the secretary of the committee, went to the countryside to inspect. At that time, Lanzhou Hotels, the most advanced hotel in Lanzhou, sent a car to him for a meal. He starved more than 1 million people in Xinyang. The local party committee expands the meeting, and the location is selected in the famous summer resort, Jigong Mountain. In the summer of hungry, officials in the provincial and prefectures, while avoiding the responsibility of the summer. , After eating full watermelon, meet again. At that time, there were no cars that went up the mountain. Officials were hungry farmers with sliders to lift up the mountain. "** 2. Mao Zedong and the cadres have unscrupulous privileges **

So, does such privileges and poor desire exist only on cadres? Is Mao Zedong himself "very clean"? This does not exist. In fact, Mao Zedong's own luxury and extravagance are extremely desired. Compared with the cadres, they can only say that they are more than ever. At that time, Mao Zedong would live in a luxurious "palace" with a full -scale equipment when he was inspecting. For example, the Secrets of the Miyaling Building Club built by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China for Mao Zedong and Jiang Qing in Wuhan East Lake are surrounded by trees and sitting in the lake. In the Meiling Building Group, in addition to the areas for Mao Zedong and Jiang Qing, various entertainment facilities are also available, including the swimming pool built for Mao Zedong, as well as a variety of entertainment activities such as performances, films, dances, banquets and other entertainment activities. Small Hall. Among them, the areas of Mao Zedong and Jiang Qing's living are called "Meiling No. 1", and the small venue and swimming pools are collectively referred to as "Meiling 3". In addition, there are "Meiling 2" that is not included in this construction area, which is an independent building designed as the residence of Mao Zedong's accompanying personnel.

It is worth noting that the Meiling Building Group began construction in 1958 and was completed in 1961. Mao Zedong himself stayed in Meiling 1 in 1962 and lived in this place 17 times before he died. The love of the Meiling Building Group. And this luxury mansion that he loves is built during the giant leap forward of countless people's tragic starvation. (About Mao Zedong's residence Meiling Building Group, see Yu Ruxin: "Yesterday's Secret -Wuhan East Lake Meiling Chronicle")

It should be pointed out that Mao Zedong's palace like Meiling Building Group was not only one place at the time. Many Maoists today said that many palaces are just public -funded hotels, and senior cadres such as Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, and Hu Yaobang have also lived. However, the information they talked about could only show that the entire leadership of the Communist Party of China had huge privileges at that time. People with superior and luxurious living conditions through privileges include Mao Zedong and veteran cadres.

** Three, abnormal cruel totalitarian system **

In addition to living a luxurious and corrupt life, cruelly squeezing the people's fat and people's cream, and completely regardless of the people's life, the entire system and cadres of the Chinese Communist Party at that time also had the power to kill the people. If some people can't bear their brutal squeezing and start resistance, they will be brutally suppressed, including large -scale collective massacre. Law scholar Cheng Qianyuan, in his memoir "Little Hui Hometown Love", recorded an outrageous atrocities that happened in his hometown of Jixi, Anhui. He wrote like this:

"In the spring of 1960, a small number of rural households in the country broke out of riots due to anti -hunger. In the Lingbei area of Jixi County, our hometown was called 15 capitals. The grain management office in the nearby township was grabbed hundreds of thousands of pounds of grain depots. All the villagers signed together with 4 or 500 people to be responsible and died together. When the county public security bureau sent a police officer to catch the village cadres, the village generals, the generals of the village, the militians, Weapons, big knives, and earthen artillery came together to build a defensive work and keep the village entrance. Due to the dangerous terrain of the mountain village, 'one man is the same, Wanfu Mo Kai ", a few public security weapons cannot enter at all. Siege the village, use the mortar and the heavy weight machine gun to raid the whole village to the ground, set fire to destroy the house, and the village men, women, and children will not leave a living. This matter is used as a bandit riot incident, and there is a provincial confidentiality bureau. The village disappears from the map overnight. "

From this record, it can be seen that the CCP's entire system treats the people, as if treating ants, completely ignoring life, and will be unscrupulous to carry out brutal massacre. Under this kind of totalitarian tyranny that does not comply with any rules and will not be subject to any supervision and restrictions, cadres, including Mao Zedong, can starve to death in a large number of people, not only are they still luxuriously carried out all kinds of Those who enjoy all kinds of enjoyment will also use the most cruel means to suppress and kill the resistance.

Understanding such a cruel social structure at the time, we actually understood the overall social background why the Red Guards movement appeared. In fact, the power structure and social form in a school at that time were also projected for the entire social structure. In the society, the entire Chinese Communist Party system and cadres have unscrupulously show the power that will not be restricted. In a school, the children of these cadres actually have huge privileges. It was under the leadership of these cadres and children that the earliest Red Guards movement was soaring, and at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the movement was painted with a very strong bloody atmosphere. After understanding the entire social background at the time, we can understand why these cadres and children have the leadership of the Red Guards movement at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, and start a terrible persecution of their teachers, classmates, and civilians in the society. Killing behavior.

Thank you everyone. This is here this week, we see you next week.

### How to identify?

It is reported that in 2016, the German government launched the so -called hybrid work group, which belongs to the Ministry of the Interior, but its purpose is to strengthen the flow of information between ministries and commissions and security departments. Since the Ukrainian war, the working group has paid close attention to the propaganda activities of distorted errors in the war. In addition, the working group also pays attention to the possible consequences of energy shortage and the protection of key infrastructure. In addition to Russia, another focus of the working group lies in China. Experts in the working group are also concerned about the possible risks of Chinese investment in Hamburg Port or Huawei to participate in 5G construction.

It is reported that the German government tries to identify false news and error information in the Internet world as soon as possible. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has used a IT tool called "Talkwalker" for a systematic monitoring of the Radiosphere. Now that the relevant contract expires, it is looking for new tools. Relevant bidding materials wrote that new software will be used to analyze social media networks to "confirm the conduct, automatic, or manipulated" behavior ".

Some workers sent out from the scene [video](https://www.douyin.com/video/7232096082895981824)From the "Party Mass Service Center" and "New Era Civilization Practice Station" brand, the camera slowly moved to the five -star red flag on the top of the building. Intersection

[Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd.](http://www.szsuccess.com.cn/yxwl/index_13.aspx)Established in 2004 and listed in 2009.

Three years later, in February last year, the company received a written notice from the Changzhen community, requiring the lease relationship before May 31 last year, and August 10th.

So, for the first time in 2019, the company has received the community relocation notice for almost 4 years. Has the Yushun Factory Trade Union conducted negotiations on the compensation plan on behalf of the employee?

In addition, the factories were relocated to the Changzhen community, and the Changzhen Community Trade Union Service Center worked with the Community Party and Mass Service Center. So, is the Changzhen Community Trade Union on the relocation plan that may affect the rights and interests of the workers, and negotiate with the community service center to ensure that the interests of employees can be guaranteed during the relocation process?

In particular, the Changzhen community requires the Yushun plant to relocate before the lease expires, which will inevitably affect the factory's operation, thereby affecting the company's ability to make reasonable compensation for workers. Does the Changzhen Community Trade Union participate in the negotiation of the company's participation in the enterprise and the Changzhen community on behalf of Yushun Factory. It is suggested that the Changzhen Community suspend the lease early to make additional compensation to the enterprise to ensure that the company has the ability to make reasonable compensation for workers?

Furthermore, when the workers have gathered in the Changzhen Community Party and Mass Service Center (office with the Changzhen Community Trade Union) for help, do the community unions come forward to represent the workers and negotiate with the community and the factory?

Half a year ago, on December 13, 2022, Yushun Co., Ltd. issued the relocation [Announcement](https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H2_AN202212121581022248_1.pdf?1670882016000.pdf)It is mentioned that employees will follow the factory area to relocate and fail to follow the factory area relocation personnel.

According to the data, the Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions announced a legal service that cost 170,000 yuan last year [work plan](http://www.szgm.gov.cn/xxgk/xqgwhxxgkml/gzgg/content/post_10136621.html)Essence This plan was announced in September, and in October, the goal was that by the end of 2022, the coverage rate of legal consultants in the first and secondary community trade unions in the street reached 100%. Level -level labor communication and negotiation mechanism.

So, did Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions assist Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd. to negotiate the relocation compensation plan in accordance with the work plan that he formulated and announced?

There is another thing. In June last year, [more than 50 workers in Yushun plant have complained](https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html)At the Shenzhen Housing Provident Fund Management Center, the factory said that the factory had not paid the housing provident fund for front -line production workers. Before that worker went to the Provident Fund Management Center to complain, did he come to the union for help and ask the union representative workers and the enterprise to complete the supplementary payment through negotiation?

The Yushun Factory was established for 19 years and was listed for 14 years. It did not pay the housing provident fund for front -line workers. Are the corporate unions, Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Unions, and Guangming unions knowing this?

Please listen to these questions and talk to the Changzhen community staff.

Following the recent report that Xu Yan was charged with incitement and subverting the state power, Yu Wensheng was reportedly charged with charges involving national security. In the outside world, Yu Wensheng, who has already "incureded the crime", will be re -sentenced once the crime is successful.

Chen Jiangang, a member of the China Human Rights Lawyers and a lawyer who lives in the United States, said that the so -called "crime of harming national security" is essentially political crime.

Chen Jianang: "Its real essence is that the CCP must suppress and persecute the person and family. As for what charges to him, the randomness is relatively large, mainly to set them as harmful national security."

At the end of last month, the Shi Jingshan Detention Center also rejected her representative lawyer's request for the context of Xu Yan's charges of incitement and subversion of the state power.

Chen Jiangang: "State organs, detention centers, etc. There are no reasons, and on the grounds of‘ still handling cases, we must add crimes to suspects ’, do not allow the meeting. This statement itself violates China's criminal procedure law."

Yu Wensheng, 55, was arrested for revising constitutional amendments in 2018. He was later ruled that he was convicted of subversion of the state power, sentenced to four years, and was released from prison last year. Chen Jiangang said that whether Yu Wensheng would be re -sentenced due to the pre -department depends on the development of China's political situation.

Chen Jiangang: "If according to this state of rule, constantly stepped up the control of the people and tighten the freedom of the people. Even if nothing happened like Yu Wensheng, it may bring heavier punishments."

Yu Wensheng and Xu Yan went to meet with the European Union in mid -April this year, and were forcibly summoned and detained. At that time, the outside world speculated that the Yu Wensheng was likely to become a political chip. Wu Shaoping, a lawyer in the United States, said that the Chinese authorities' spears also aimed at the Western countries in addition to the Yu Wensheng couple.

Wu Shaoping: "As long as the past foreign envoys are visited in mainland China, many times they will invite human rights lawyers to understand the more real human rights situation in Chinese society. When you meet them (human rights lawyers), we will sentence them. "

In the court, Ji Xiaolong blatantly insulted the country's leaders as a crime, but the outside world believed that his real name was the real fuse to Li Qiang's accountability of Shanghai Fengcheng.

[** Shanghai rights protection person Ji Xiaolong was charged with "provoking trouble crime" case opened on Wednesday **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/8-06182023170604.html)*** [Eating is a problem with the problem of Shanghai Human Rights defenders, Ji Xiaolong, the dental disease is not treated](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/7-04282023162353.html)**

Ji Xiaolong, suspected of provoking trouble, was tried in the Pudong New District Court on June 21. His father, Ji Xinghua, said after the interrogation that the prosecutor had publicly criticized the state leaders as a crime on Twitter.

Ji Xinghua: "The procuratorate said that he (Ji Xiaolong) sent a Twitter, what insulting the country leaders. Ji Xiaolong said he did not send it, and it might be reposted by others. The lawyer also said that the procedure for investigation and evidence to investigate did not meet the requirements. There are problems. I think it does not cause chaos and riots in public order. It does not constitute a provocation. "

In 2018, some people in the Internet called on the toilet doors of democracy in the toilet door of the hospital, university and other public places to write a slogan against the government. Ji Xiaolong, known as the "toilet revolution", was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.

Last summer, Ji Xiaolong, who was released in prison for less than a year, issued a real -name petition to then Li Qiang, the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, criticized Shanghai Fengcheng to lead to humanitarian disasters. Afterwards, Ji Xiaolong was taken away by the authorities and then criminally detained.

Ji Xinghua expressed his support for his son's petition to Li Qiang's name, and believed that he only fulfilled the freedom of speech given by the Constitution.

Ji Xinghua: "I definitely believe in him (Ji Xiaolong). Of course it is good to not seal the city. It is a good thing to come and go. It is a good thing for the people. It is normal for a grievance to speak. I think he is helping the people. The sealing control brings a lot of inconvenience to the people.

Involved in the Netherlands Lin Shengliang pays attention to the progress of Ji Xiaolong's case. He believes that Ji Xiaolong has been involved in the vortex of provocations. The real fuse is that he petitions on Shanghai Fengcheng. The so -called "insulting state leaders in social media" is only covering up.

Lin Shengliang said: "It (the authorities) will not mention the thing that indicates him (Ji Xiaolong) in the judgment or court (the real reason), which is often the same. Crime fuse) is to question Li Qiang's measures in Shanghai at that time, but Li Qiang has now been to the Party Central Committee as a member of the Standing Committee, and it is impossible to mention these things. "

Lin Shengliang said that opposition to the city is not enough to touch the authorities of the authorities. The key is to publicize Li Qiang and ask him to step down.

Lin Shengliang said: "That petition mainly points to Li Qiang, plus a lot of media reports. The following people will also think it is aimed at him. For politics, Ji Xiaolong must be caught."

Four years ago, Ji Xiaolong spent about 20 minutes to read the defense words during the trial of the toilet revolution, which involved the disadvantages of governance in the current regime. The outside world still remembered his performance at the time.

Chinese officials responded to the US President Biden on Wednesday that Xi Jinping said that Xi Jinping's speech was "extremely ridiculous and irresponsible." These lips and swords swords made Blingken's slightly eased relationship between Bollingin's visit to Huamei and China again.

According to the Associated Press, President Biden talked about the campaign to California's campaign on Tuesday in the California campaign to enter the United States. He said that this was a very embarrassing thing for the dictator Xi Jinping.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Mao Ning on Wednesday at Biden on Wednesday. "The United States is extremely ridiculous and irresponsible. It seriously violates basic facts, diplomatic etiquette, and the dignity of Chinese politics. It is public political provocation."

In February this year, Chinese spy balls flew to Vietnam to lead the United States, and then many American and Taiwan officials visited each other. US -China relations fell into nervousness.

The day before Biden made the remarks, US Secretary of State Brills just ended his visit to Beijing and met with Chinese leaders Xi Jinping. The two sides agreed to stabilize bilateral relations while competing to avoid conflicts. Brinken said that there are many huge and deep contradictions between the United States and China, and the United States does not have fantasies about it. Although Brinken did not obtain any major breakthroughs this time, the two sides agreed to continue diplomatic contact to pave the way for the next time in the United States.

Taiwan's investment in mainland China hit a single month in April this year, a single month of 21 years, and this year's total investment in China may fall below $ 4 billion. Analysis is related to the reduction of China's demographic dividend, the rise of ASEAN, and the US -China trade war.

[** US Taiwan Trade Initiative Preliminary Negotiations Complete Scholars: Copy Chinese Economic Coercion **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/tj-05192023094904.html)*** [Carefully deal with China's epidemic, Indonesia welcome Taiwan investment](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/9-12212022153338.html)**

The Latest report released on the 20th that the CRIF Company (CRIF) stated that after the US -China trade war, the global layout of Taiwanese businessmen's global layout has changed. According to the investment and review meeting of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in the first four months of this year, Taiwan's foreign investment was innovative, but the willingness to invest in mainland China has dropped to the freezing point. In April this year, the investment amount of mainland China hit a new low in nearly 21 years in a single month, and it is not ruled out that it will not be ruled out.

Liu Ren, the editor -in -chief of the China Credit Credit Institute, said in an interview with Radio Free Asia and said: "In the first April of this year, Taiwan approved the investment in mainland China of only 904 million US dollars, which was only US $ 811 million in the same period of 2021. The same period is low. In addition, the amount of investment in mainland China in April this year fell to $ 146 million. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-21T11-54-00-04-00/000002.png)On March 30, 2016, 100 yuan banknotes displayed on a commercial bank in Beijing, China.

Liu Ren analyzed that since 2003, Taiwan has invested in mainland China 5 times to below 200 million US dollars. Except for August 2003 in August 2003 21 years ago, the amount of investment fell to US $ 196 million, the other four appeared in June 2019 and February 2021, each invested only 174 million US dollars, and the investment amount in February 2022 dropped another drop. To $ 165 million, a new low appeared in April 2023.

Liu Ren said: "The amount of investment in mainland China in a single month is less than 200 million US dollars, and 4 densely appeared in the past five years. This is by no means accidental. "Treatment Scene" new consensus and new trends in other regions. "

The China Credit Investment Institute stated that Taiwan's investment trend in mainland China can be traced back to 2015, and Tsai Ing -wen has not yet come to power. At that time, Taiwan's foreign investment (did not include mainland China) exceeded $ 10 billion for the first time, reaching US $ 10.931 billion. In the same year, investment in mainland China was US $ 10.965 billion. Since then, Taiwan's foreign investment amount has exceeded the investment in China, which has been 9 years.

** This year, Taiwan's total investment in mainland China may fall below ** ** 40 ** ** billion US dollars **

Liu Ren pointed out that in 2010, Taiwan's foreign investment amount was only equivalent to 19.32 % of the investment in mainland China, but the amount of foreign investment in 2022 was 1.97 times (197.40 %) of the investment in mainland China. In 2022, the investment income of Mainland China in the market was NT $ 528.743 billion, a decline of 14.36 % from 2021. In the first quarter of this year, mainland investment income was NT $ 79.5 billion, a decline of 26.43 % from the same period in 2022.

Liu Ren analyzed that Taiwanese businessmen have the most foreign investment to the United States and the country, such as Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. The proportion of investment in India is rising.

Liu Ren said: "In the first April of this year, Taiwan's foreign investment was US $ 7.449 billion, of which TSMC invested in the US Alexonna wafers in the United States, accounting for 3.5 billion US dollars. The US dollar far exceeds 904 million US dollars that invest in mainland China. Looking at the new southward country in April this year, the country has reached US $ 1.685 billion. The investment amount of the mainland has settled behind the United States and Singapore. "

Liu Ren pointed out that although mainland China (including Hong Kong) is still the largest export area in Taiwan, the proportion of exports to mainland China in the first five months of this year has fallen to 35.2%. The lowest proportion of exports reflects that the Taiwan industry is unavailable to balance global investment and decentralized export markets.

** Mainland China Population Dividend Reduce **

Liu Ren analyzed: "Because of the rise of ASEAN countries, ASEAN is 6.5 billion people, and is regarded as a very potential market by the world. After the Special ASEAN and mainland China signed FTA (free trade agreement), the ASEAN countries exported to China to China. The mainland enjoys 95 % of the tariff -free. Some of the investments are scattered to ASEAN countries, which is beneficial to Taiwanese businessmen. Recently, since the US -China trade war, Taiwanese businessmen realized that Taiwan's industry may be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced Selecting the side station, you can also see the risk of geopolitical warfare, you must do a decentralized risk action. "

Liu Ren mentioned that the increase in the cost of land, labor, and factories in mainland China is the main reason for Taiwanese businessmen to turn to ASEAN countries in the early days.Zhang Hanwen mentioned that the three -year epidemic was cleared and closed, and the supply chain could hardly move, unable to circulate, and was serious than any incident. Most manufacturing Taiwanese businessmen, including himself, narrowed the scale, otherwise they would not be able to support it.

** Persist in old Taiwanese businessmen in mainland China: During the transition period, it will be resumed ** ** prospects should still be optimistic about **

Zhang Hanwen said: "Now that the epidemic has passed, the old customers feel stable, and they have begun to get in touch again, and they have continued to return to place orders again, and they have been launched in all aspects. Now the situation in all aspects of the mainland is also tense. All aspects of the province are moving, actively coming out of investment promotion, and output a lot of preferential conditions. "

Zhang Hanwen believes that the quality of the manufacturing workers in Southeast Asia still does not work. Vietnam is more climate, but Vietnam has only 80,000 to 90 million people, which is equivalent to a province in China. So many factories have poured into Vietnam and have limited labor force. Taiwanese businessmen who have moved out will not be transferred out. They will still stay in the Chinese mainland. The supply chain materials will go out from the mainland and open a branch in Southeast Asia to save labor costs.

Zhang Hanwen said: "Many old Taiwanese businessmen with high quality and brand still want to stay on the mainland and believe that it is guaranteed to manufacture on the mainland. Old Taiwanese businessmen who keep on the mainland believe that the mainland is still there in the end, and the industrial chain and fundamentals are relatively complete. Now that it is only a transition period, it will slowly, and the future prospects should still be optimistic. "

It highlights the EU's search for China's entry into sensitive markets and obtaining industry secrets as the United States, and it also reflects concerns about the deepening of the China -Russia Alliance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images On Tuesday, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang (left) and German Chancellor Olav Santhaz made speeches to the news media in Berlin.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-21T12-14-46-08-00/20eu-china-02-ljzp-master1050.jpg)The European Commission announced a new trade principles on Tuesday, which aims to curb China's ability to squeeze the European economy and prevent European companies from exporting to China with military -related technologies that may bring advantages to China.

The policy is still in the early stages, highlighting the EU's sought of consistency with the United States in restricting China to enter the sensitive market and obtaining industry secrets. It also reflects people's increasingly worried alliance between Beijing and Moscow.

Brussels announced that the news was a week when European -China relations were frequent. Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang was visiting Germany. He met with German Chancellor Olaf Tumolz and business leaders on Tuesday and then went to France to attend the meeting.

The initiative also emphasizes that the EU as one of the world's largest economies and important trading partners in China and the United States is trying to manage its economic dependence on Beijing, and try to avoid the economic economy between the European Union and Russia after Ukraine's invasion break.

The committee is the EU's administrative department, which is on page 14 [File](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/%20en/ip_23_3358)China said that weak coordination between member states and weak trade rules may allow opponents to restrain the EU economy or manufacturer in economics, so it is necessary to resolve urgently.

The document says: "Our national security is closely connected with our ability to maintain economic security and elasticity than before."

This document does not mention China or any specific country at all, but it is mentioned "a country related to the strategy of military -civilian integration."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-21T12-14-46-08-00/20eu-china-01-ljzp-master1050.jpg)On Tuesday, the European Commission President Usula von Delin (right) and EU budget and administrative commissioner Johannes Hayne were in Brussels. Olivier Hoslet/EPA, Viashutterstock

The European Commission Chairman Ulusala von Delay said in a comment on reporters that the policy "non -specific country" is not a way to completely reform the European Union to deal with the economic power. On the contrary, she said, "We consider a set of limited, small -scale cutting -edge technologies." She also said: "Here, we want to ensure that they will not enhance the military capabilities of some related countries."

But European diplomats said the economic strategy in this proposed proposed was obviously about China. They said that it may take several months to become a specific policy, but this is an important step in preventing economic goals from destroying the security of the European Union.

Nevertheless, diplomats said that in terms of important economic relations with China, the EU's largest economic power -Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands -are not in a hurry to accept Brussels that may have destructive intervention. These concerns may cause the committee's proposal to be diluted.

The meeting held in Germany on Tuesday was relatively low -key and avoided obvious problems: [German economy dependence on China](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230619/germany-china-relations/)Essence More than one million German jobs rely on China directly, and almost half of German manufacturers rely on some parts of its supply chain.

After meeting the Prime Minister's palace, Shuorz and Li Keqiang read the statement, but did not answer any questions.

"Direct dialogue, private conversation, and real communication -in a very important period of global challenges and crisis, all this is more important than ever before," Sngrz said. Choose to pay attention to climate and green energy.

"We have no intention of decoupling with China," he said. Shuerz also avoids "de -risk" treatment of China's economic relations -this is a relatively gentle way to reduce dependence, and soon becomes widely used diplomatic terms.

But later that day, Li Qiang mentioned the word. According to Germany, Li Qiang said: "Implement discrimination measures in the name of risks to restrict or exclude other countries, which violates market principles, fair competition rules, and the rules of the World Trade Organization."

The European Commission's proposal on economic security stated that the European Union should exclude potential hostile countries and their companies on some key infrastructure, such as ports and pipelines, and prohibit EU companies from exporting high -tech products with military use for potential opponents.

This document also aims to ensure that the supply chain of safe and sensitive products will not rely on these countries excessively, and prevents European exclusive technologies in artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing or biotechnology.

The European Union has developed a set of rules, which aims to solve some of these concerns, but the committee stated that it needs better and stricter rules, and should be applied to these rules in 27 countries with the same enthusiasm and standards. The document says that the goal is to ensure that no backdoor may not damage European security.

"In the field of export control, the necessity of taking a faster and more coordinated action at the EU level has become urgent," the proposal stated that it also pointed out that "the uncoordinated expansion of national control will cause loopholes."

Some European countries have tightened trade relations with China. The Netherlands prohibits Acemi from exporting its advanced chip production technology to China on the grounds of security.

The European Union also considers sanctions on some Chinese companies because they provide chips for weapons for Ukraine for Russia.

One person died and dozens of people were injured, and what happened in the Ashraf-3 (ASHRAF-3), all kinds of statements and theoretical comparison.

So, what is the "People's Holy Warrior Organization"? What do they do in this Westbargan country? How does the United States integrate into it? Why are these issues important?

#### What is the "People's Holy War Organization"?

The "People's Holy Warrior Organization" was originally an organization with a left -wing revolutionary thought. It opposed the rule of the last king of Iran, Mohammed Lisa Ballevi, and the latter has been overthrown by the 1979 Islamic Revolution -it is this revolutionary revolution. The current regime of Iran is born.

They initially formed an alliance with other revolutionaries, but had a dispute with Iran's first supreme leader, Ayatra Hotini, and launched an armed uprising against the government that had just established, including creating explosions and implementing high -level assassinations.

In the end, they had to leave Iran and formed an alliance with the dictator of the neighboring Iraq. During the 8th year of the 1980s, the members of the organization launched a number of armed offensives on the Iranian territory.

The Iranian government regards it as a "terrorist organization" and claims that it should be responsible for the death of nearly 17,000 Iranians.

![](ConvertedIMGs/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T12-40-39/maxresdefault-1687350454.png)The "People's Holy Warrior Organization" who opposes the Iranian regime(Peninsula TV Station)Members of the "People's Holy Warrior" have been stationed in a camp in Iraq for many years, but in the end, they had to be transferred to Albania in the mid -century because Iraqi officials were increasingly hostile to them.

Over the years, the narrative of members of the organization and a large number of reports from international media described in detail how the organization "operates like cults" and exerts severe restrictions on their members, causing them to suffer from physical and spiritual abuse.

Due to the lack of legitimacy and the support of Iranians, the organization was also accused of operating online giant farms, and repeatedly boasted that relevant institutions of Iran's national institutions entered hackers' invasion or penetration. After the Albanian police conducted an assault search, some of their accounts were closed this Tuesday.

#### Why do you want to start a raid?

Dozens of Albanian police raid the Ashlav-3 camp near the mountain town in the mountain city about 30 kilometers west of the Albania capital.

The Albanian police said the raid was conducted based on the court's order. This order was released after the country ’s special anti -corruption agency Spak was released after investigating the“ People's Jihad Organization ”without approval. protocol.

The Alfonian Ministry of the Interior supported the raid, and the National Police Director Muhammed Lunbraku said he felt "angry and offending" because members of the organization tried to prevent the police from seizing their electronic equipment and his leaders did not cooperate.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T12-40-39/32D43UK-highres-1687342674-1687350511.jpg)On June 23, 2022, former US Vice President Mike Pence delivered a speech to the "People's Holy Warrior Organization" at the Ashlav 3 camp in Manze(French media)The video and reports about the raid showed the chaotic scene at the time- the members of the "People's Holy Warrior" shouted and confronted the police and the media angrily.

After a member squeezed into the camera, a reporter from the Albanian TV station on the scene said, "I want to know whether the Albanian policeman is a protector or a terrorist."

The organization stated that one member of his 65 -year -old Ali Mosahali -has died on the 20th, and more than 100 residents of camps were injured by pepper spray. Police said the death of the man had nothing to do with the actions of the police, and the police noticed that he did not use force.

#### What do you think?

The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Nasis Canni welcomed the news, saying that the "people's jihado organization" will always pose a threat to the security of its host country due to its "terrorist nature".

"This is why the Iraqi government expelled them and other governments to refuse to accept them. We hope that the Albanian government can make up for the mistakes that receive this terrorist organization," he said in a tweet released on the 21st.

Interestingly, the US government's response is to keep a distance from the "People's Holy Warrior Organization", although the organization has received strong support from many senior US officials including former US Vice President Mike Pence for many years.

The United States said that Albania has guaranteed it that the raid was carried out in accordance with the law and had serious concerns about the organization, including allegations on the abuse of their members.

More than ten years ago, the United States and the European Union had removed the "People's Holy Warrior" from the "terrorist organization" list. Previously, the organization had promised to abandon its violence. Last year, Iran listed dozens of U.S. officials who supported the "People's Holy Warrior" on the blacklist.

In September last year, Albania had a diplomatic relations with Iran after accusing Iran's launch of major cyber attacks, but Iran denied it. The United States and the European Union support Albania in this incident.

The raid occurred on the 20th prompted the Affiliated account of the "People's Holy Warrior Organization" to accuse Albania in accusing Albania to engage in the Iranian government.

Since this raid occurred one day after the French people from the "People's Holy Warrior" held a July 1st day in Paris -they had rally there many times before, and some users on the Internet connected these two incidents on the Internet Essence At the same time, as the protective umbrella of the organization, the Iranian National Resistance Committee accused France of "pressure" in the Iranian government.

** Scholars: Taiwan peace is a major interest for the United States **

At the meeting, scholars talked about the importance of Taiwan. Michael Glennmullen, the retired U.S. military general and former US Staff Joint Congress Chairman, said: "One of the most important points is that Taiwan Island is located in the four major big big big. The center of the economy, compared with the economic recession in 2000 and 2008, or the new crown epidemic, leads to economic stagnation. If a war broke out on both sides of the strait, the economic impact brought by the United States, China and the world will be more serious than the above situation. "

"If the United States allows large authoritarian countries to do whatever the small democratic country, such as Ukraine and Taiwan, the existing international order is over, this is why the United States and the United States must stand up ... ...

The company's stock price has fallen sharply from the peak of 2020.

As the founder of Ali, Billionaire Ma Yun criticized the Chinese regulatory agency's innovation of the Chinese regulatory agency. In 2020, he was driven out of the public vision. Ant Group was Ali's fintech sister company. After his criticism, Chinese officials suspended the Ant Group's listing plan.

Zhang Yong said in a full letter on Tuesday that he had to be "whole -hearted" into the spin -off work. He also pointed out that it is necessary to clearly distinguish his positions in Alibaba and Cloud Smart Group.

Some former employees stated that Cai Chongxin, the chairman of the new board of directors, has an inseparable relationship with Ma Yun. They met in 1999. At that time, Alibaba was just a free portal. Cai Chongxin joined the company that year. He helped Ma Yun get an early investment of Goldman Sachs and SoftBank, and presided over the company's listing of New York in 2014, creating the first public -funded records at the time.

Cai Chongxin has served as the vice chairman of Ali since 2013, and he is also the main owner of the NBA Brooklyn Nets.

Wu Yongming, who has been an executive of Ali E -commerce Department for many years, was promoted. Analysts said that this was a signal that Ali would continue to purchase online as its core business.

The nearly fifty -year -old Wu Yongming helped Ali transform from an e -commerce giant to a mobile Internet giant, and turned Alipay's digital payment application to one of the most common payment methods in China. He will continue to serve as the chairman of Taobao and Tmall, two major e -commerce companies in Ali.

Zhang Yong told investors that Ali split its business to reduce the degree of centralization and improve efficiency. However, Ali has recently announced the establishment of a high -level committee to be responsible for the fund distribution decision of the new business group. Some analysts believe that this shows that the company's power will still be in the hands of a few key characters.

Zhang Yong replaced Ma Yun as the chairman of Ali Board in 2019. At that time, he was a rising star in the company, creating Ali's most successful "[Double 11](https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20191112/alibaba-singles-day/)"Shopping festival. Zhang Yong is famous for paying attention to details and the ability to solve problems. It is generally considered to be very complementary to Ma Yun, and the latter is known within the company's insight.

In China, Alibaba is synonymous with online shopping. But from digital payment to delivery services to entertainment, the company has expanded a series of extensive businesses. In recent years, Ali has expanded the size of the e -commerce department, and its cloud computing department has also promoted the vigorous development of artificial intelligence.

Jacob Cook, CEO of Weibo Leading E -commerce Consulting Company, said that Cai Chongxin has invested extensively worldwide. Considering that Ali has recently paid attention to international business, it is a logical choice for him to re -control his power.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-21T14-11-00Z/63550377_303.jpeg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65991127/63550377)(Voice of German in Chinese) U.S. Secretary of State Broskerer visited China and Bank ofchina (Bank ofchina) decided to restrict Russian customers with transfer transactions related to banks in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland, and Britain. The two may be a coincidence. But on the other hand, it may also be a concession made by Beijing to cooperate with Brinken's China. Another possibility is that the importance of Russia's strategy and economic considerations in China is gradually disappearing.

Russia ’s national media RBC and another media Frankmedia quoted FINAM banks that Bank of China began to terminate Russia’ s transfer by Russia through its agency accounts in RMB, USD, Hong Kong dollars, and euros. Unicredit and Akibank also informed the news.

According to the current regulations, the banks that implement sanctions countries are banned from direct transactions with the sanctioned Russian entities, but third -party countries such as China have not been banned from doing so.

The West has so far been unwilling to implement second -level sanctions, that is, it is forbidden to transfer transactions by sanctioning Russian entities and non -Western countries.

Russia has criticized the West to be responsible for this. Pavelsemyonov, chairman of Modulbank, said: "This decision is not made by China, but in Europe and the United States. They want to increase the pressure of sanctions and cut off the alternative channels carried out in the form of Yuan."

### Western sanctions on Russia are useful?

[Brussels for the first time in April to impose sanctions on Chinese companies that support the "Russian War Machine"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705)Essence The EU list includes Jinpai Technology Co., Ltd. The company has been sanctioned by the United States.

In early June, Beijing stated that it would pay close attention to the European Union's discussion on Russia's 11th round of sanctions. The discussion sanctions include trade restrictions on third countries that are regarded as bypassing existing sanctions.

### Analysis: China may be worried

Erichontz, head of the "Center for Accountable Investment", told Germany: "I think the Bank of China does not reject the Russian account, but only limits some activities participating in Western banks."

Robert Person, an associate professor of international relations of the US Military Academy, believes: "This shows that China is worried that it may be threatened by second -level sanctions."

Former EU diplomat Albrecht Rothach said: "After all, China, the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom are much more important than Russia, except for oil and gas, wood and minerals."

Lotah believes that the sanctioned Russian entities may try to implement transfer transactions through the smaller banks in China or other countries, such as Turkey, [India](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印度狂买打折原油后-俄罗斯看着一大堆卢比发愁/a-65647590)wait.

Hongzz said that there has been a period of time that has been bypassing sanctions: "For example, we see [the significant increase in trade and financial flow between Russia and Central Asia](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/哈萨克斯坦否认违反西方对俄制裁/a-65670504)Essence Chinese banks also have business sites in Central Asia. "

However, some experts believe that Beijing's strategic interests means that the importance of economic and trade relations with Russia is limited. This seems to be seen from a series of events. UnionPay Payment once became the Russian lifeline after Visa and MasterCard withdrew from Russia in March 2022, but now they have cut off the connection with Russia's sanctions banks. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and two other China -led Development Bank cut off financing of Russia's trade in 2022.

The Voice of the Think Tank "Atlanta Commission" said to Germany: "Even if China has weakened its sanctions on Russia, Beijing's actions have always been limited by its strategic interests, and they are also worried that they will induce the secondary of the United States. Sanctions. "

Taiwan Central News Agency reported on the 21st that many cities in China have recently set off a "leftovers lunch box" boom. Many businesses will be cheap Selling them to the people, as long as consumers search for "leftovers blind box" on the Internet, they can search for various leftover vegetables, including milk tea and light food.

** "Living Blind Box" to see the opportunity to seize the young people's market **

The report pointed out that through the "blind box", the public can buy a sushi that is usually priced at 50 yuan at 19.9 yuan. Such a price was originally unable to buy a bowl of beef noodles, but by purchasing the "leftovers blind box", The amount of sushi obtained is enough for two meals.

The sales form of the "leftovers blind box" is widely welcomed by young Chinese, because it sees that young people want to save money, but they do not want to reduce the characteristics of life quality. Young people.

According to reports from Kyodo News Agency on the 21st, young people from university graduates generally cannot find their favorite jobs, and they can only go to an industrial employment without interest. In addition, after the Beijing authorities lifted the new crowns and controlled control, China's economic performance continued to weaken, and the people's expected pessimism of the public made consumption conservative. At the same time, young people lost their real estate investment capabilities because of the new crown unemployment. The effect of reducing money such as interest and other currencies does not see the effect of returning to spring.

[At first glance, everything is as usual](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/难度高悬念大德中政府磋商全面开启/a-65972739), Back to the past.

[Published in "Time Online" entitled "Let's continue becoming a friend"](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2023-06/deutsch-chinesische-regierungskonsultationen-berlin-olaf-scholz-li-qiang/komplettansicht)The author wrote, "Slow!Isn't it a cold, criticism of Germany and China relations?"

In the field of electric vehicles and hydrogen energy, the two countries hope to strengthen cooperation. "The author noticed that, unlike previously, (Tuesday) the agreement signed in the Ministry of Economic Affairs was not a billion -dollar list.

"The clear goal of the German federal government is to reduce the damage that may be suffered due to dependence on China. Germany is China's most important trading partner in Europe.

The Prime Minister's Palace said to Li Qiang: 'We have no interest in the decoupling with China'.

At the German -China Economic and Technological Cooperation Forum in the afternoon, Shulz emphasized that risk does not mean giving up globalization and world trade, and its significance lies in fair trade. "

### ** China’s self -sufficient dream has already begun **

"Focus" magazine published an article pointed out that [Berlin and Washington are trying to get rid of the situation of economy dependence on China](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/scholz-und-biden-traeumen-von-china-trennung-doch-xi-dreht-den-spiess-einfach-um_id_196998229.html), But Xi Jinping's counter -control strategy has been implemented.

The author believes that Premier Shaws said that when the Ministers from China conducted government consultations, "supporting risks and opposing decoupling", this is just an echo of the White House tone. "Using this kind of words, Western politicians want people to know that they are the promoters of history. But do not know that Beijing's deeper self -sufficient dream has already begun." "We will have two scholars in front of us, involving culture and culture, Economy and military ", and the process of gradually drifting in China includes a number of steps: control the Internet, value -added chain nationalization, the establishment of a bank payment system that creates super borders, and develop the southern hemisphere country:

"China is working hard to develop the southern hemisphere country: this is particularly important for China. As early as 2012, China replaced the West to become the largest direct investment country in Africa-an annual investment of up to 4 billion U.S. dollars. China When hardware and software products, they also consolidated their own standards, including monitoring of the Internet.

China has established 25 economic and trade cooperation centers in 16 African countries. McKinsey Consulting estimates that the output value of Chinese companies accounts for 12%of African industrial production, with a total value of up to $ 500 billion per year.

China's business in the economic field has continued to promote in the military field. At present, China plans to build a military base with Cuba. This set of facilities will become an integral part of the overseas global military network of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is also a answer to the United States' relations with Taiwan. As a famous saying in the Bible: It also cures its body with its own way.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-21T14-48-00-04-00/000000.png)On November 14, 2022, US President Biden met with Chinese leaders Xi Jinping during the 20th National Summit of Indonesia.

Some scholars believe that this confrontation may affect the subsequent US -China contact.

According to the US media Bloomberg, US President Joe Biden talked about this on Tuesday that when Chinese balloon invaded the United States, the Chinese President Xi Jinping was called "dictator".

"The reason why Xi Jinping was angry is that when the balloon was shot down, he didn't even know where the balloon was." Bayndon said: "This is great for the dictator because they don't know what happened."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that China has strong dissatisfaction with the United States and resolutely oppose that "it is an open political provocation."

During the visit to China from June 18th to 19th from June 18th to 19th, US Secretary of State Broskere held a meeting with Wang Yi, the Chinese President Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Qin Gang, and Wang Yi, director of the Office of the CPC Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Bynden's remarks just after the end of Brinton, less than a day, and pushed the bilateral relations that had been eased to the tension again.

Zack Cooper, a senior researcher at the Washington Think Tank American Institute (AEI), said in an interview with this station that Biden's remarks were improvised and may not expect to be reported publicly.

"I guess that China may insist on letting Shalin and Wang Yi, or Biden and Xi Jinping call to solve these comments -but it's still early, so we have to see how to deal with it in the future." He said: "This may lead to Delays the upcoming views, such as the plan to visit Beijing, Janeteellen, USA. "

Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of the stability of US -China relations when meeting with Brinden. Although the meeting showed that both the United States and China are preventing the further deterioration of bilateral relations, it has not made significant breakthroughs in key issues such as sensitive technical control and military forces, which also caused criticism from politicians in Washington.

(Federation of the Associated Press)

The information revealed by Biden's remarks shows that Xi Jinping did not know before the balloon incident, which led him to "angry" and "embarrassing", which also caused a wide range of debates about whether Xi Jinping achieved absolute leadership. Wang Juntao, a Chinese political scholar in the United States, told this station that Xi Jinping's knowledge of this rarely did not mean that he was not a dictator.

"It is impossible for dictators to get everything (care). In ancient dictators, even if farming social management countries are simple, they will not be in love."

Wang Juntao believes that Xi Jinping, who has already existed through balloons, may know through the balloon monitoring of other countries, but this is not within his dictatorship, but the fermentation and response of the balloon event shows Xi's dictatorship.

"But how to deal with high air balloons, because the United States turns it into a big event, then this is within the scope of Xi Jinping's dictatorship. Passion balloon to Xi Jinping may not know how to do this. The response was slow, and it was not completely frozen until Xi Jinping had a statement. "

Cooper said that in terms of the recovery of high -level contacts in the United States and China, the United States has basic differences in the value of dialogue, and the voice that supports contact with China will continue to coexist with the opposition. He pointed out that this difference will affect the interpretation of the contact with high -level and middle -aged officials who will be held in the next few months.

In view of the significance of Sino -German economic relations to the economic and trade relations between the two countries and even the China -Europe, the seventh Sino -German government consultation in Berlin is undoubtedly attracted great attention from the international community. These concerns are around a core, that is, will China and Germany and even China -Europe relations be alienated? The profound influence of the Russian and Ukraine on geopolitics and economy was also the result of the re -judgment of China in Europe and the United States through the three -year epidemic.

However, looking at the current situation of the world and China and Europe will find that the prospects of the international community are unlikely to happen. Basically, the two countries can basically keep the current status of China -German economic and trade relations, and there will be no big ups and downs; but in turn, China -Germany economic and trade relations will never return to the sweet past, because after the past three years, the world has been different. People are wrong.

** Germany is "not decoupled", only "risk" **

Basically, it can be very clear that the Sino -German government's consultation can maintain the existing bilateral economic and trade pattern and scale, but if you want to go further, especially on this basis, especially in key supply chain and core technologies Cooperation has improved, and it is not difficult.

First of all, whether it is the European Union or the German government, the economic and trade policy that has just been determined to China is "risks", not "decoupling". As far as the European Union is concerned, the European Commission Chairman Feng Delin determined this principle when he visited China in April this year, which defines the boundary between the EU in terms of economic and trade relations with China and the Sino -US economic and trade relations. Last month, the Seven Kingdoms Group also responded to the position of major industrial powers, that is, "risks" to China rather than "decoupling".

Similarly, the German government is the same. Tsubitz once said that he hopes to avoid excessive relying on Chinese trade, and he hopes that key products in Germany are diversified, and he calls this method "risk." He promised that the Prime Minister of the State Council of the Chinese State Council promised: "We are not interested in the decoupling with China." Therefore, Germany has no plan to "decoupling" with China. Although U.S. officials have repeatedly urged Germany to do that, Germany tends to accept " The concept of risk ".

Moreover, the reality of the German internal economic situation does not allow Germany to interrupt the economic and trade relations with China.

Due to the impact of the Russian and Ukraine War and Russia's interruption on Germany's energy supply, in the first quarter of this year, after the German economy in the first quarter, in fact, it has entered a technological recession, and it cannot be eased in the second quarter. The United States adopts a common blockade policy to China or keeps a distance from the Chinese market.

Secondly, all German companies that have developed in China are unwilling to leave China, such as large German automobile companies, chemical companies BASF, and industrial leading enterprise Siemens. These companies have resolutely defend their investment interests in China in Germany and threatened that they are not in Germany to "decume" with China, but that large German companies are "decoupled" with the German government.

Moreover, according to the author's understanding, the recent opposition to the German Green Party in Germany is also related to these large German companies. These public opinion threatened: the next session will never vote for the Green Party. The most famous representative of the Green Party is the controversial foreign minister Berbque in Germany because of anti -China.

A recent survey conducted by the German Chamber of Commerce found that nearly 55%of German companies planned to invest further in China. The focus of the international media's emphasis on this data is that the number is far lower than the level of 72%in the early stage of the epidemic, although the Beijing side has lifted the severe "clear zero" epidemic prevention restriction measures. But in fact, after the three -year epidemic blockade of China, more than half of German companies still intend to further invest in China, which has reflected that the Chinese market is quite attractive to foreign companies.

In addition, other data released by the United States media can also explain the problem: more than 1 million German jobs directly depend on China; more positions also indirectly depend on China. In Europe's investment in China, nearly half of Germany; some of the supply chains of nearly half of German manufacturing companies depend on China.

As for the "de -risk", in the understanding and implementation of the "risk" scope, the German government is actually inconsistent.

Hu Yongkong, Executive CEO of the German Reserto China Research Center, believes: "The core priority of Germany's risk is the key raw materials and supply chains." The relevant matters also include evaluating the role and technical management and control of Chinese companies in key infrastructure in Germany. Measures (including foreign investment review) and German companies' excessive dependence on China.

According to the "Financial Times" report, German officials believe that Souls agrees with the vision of the "small courtyard wall" of the national security adviser Sha Liwen, that is, closely protecting key technologies, and at the same time, it does not scatter the net.

In this regard, a German Chamber of Commerce confirmed to the author: Tsumerz must face the reality of the domestic economic recession in Germany, and it is necessary to drive away from the United States policy to China. But in any case, he will not forget to "protect key technologies".

That is to say, Germany will not be "decoupled" with China, but it will protect the key technologies of Germany. This is "risk".

** The heart is more powerful and can't catch it **

In addition to the visual view of the "small courtyard high wall" in the "small courtyard", China also faces its own problems. This is: the negative impact of the Russian and Ukraine War on China, the weak economic recovery of China, and the inadequate management of foreign investment in China. The overall situation It looks like a little bit more powerful and insufficient. The issues of the two countries will restrict the further development of China -German economic and trade relations.

The first is the negative impact of the Russian and Ukraine on Sino -European relations. In fact, Germany hopes to maintain a good relationship with its largest trading partner in China, but China is affected by its own position in the Russian and Ukraine War, which has led to the always development space in Germany's anti -China forces, and sometimes this space will expand. Therefore, the recently announced national security strategy of Germany described China as "a partner, competitors and systemic competitors." This constitutes a constraint on any German government, of course, including the economic and trade relations between China and Germany.

Shurz told Li Qiang: "I once again called on the Chinese government to impact Russia in this war." "As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has a very special responsibility here."

"What is important is that China must continue to transport weapons to the invaders Russia." He added that he "thanked" China continued to make it clear that there is no room for using nuclear weapons.

According to reports, Li Qiang did not respond directly or mentioned Ukraine in the statement, and the two leaders did not answer any questions.

The above situation has allowed the economic and trade relations between the two countries to further advance the obstacles, including the German government to strengthen the review of Chinese investment companies.

The second is that China's own economy resumes slowly after the epidemic.Moreover, China has insufficient management in foreign investment in China, and some problems have been difficult to improve over the years.

In the interview with Li Qiang, Shuerz said: "Entering the Chinese market and the fair competition conditions of Germany and other foreign companies in China are still a challenge, and we are promoting specific improvements."

According to the results of a rapid investigation by the German Chamber of Commerce in China last month, 45%of the enterprises interviewed by the upcoming government consultation were expected to give more legal guarantees.

Wooddker, the president of the EU Chamber of Commerce, who is about to step down, mentioned that many problems have been in many years, but there are no signs of resolution.

The above problems make it difficult for German capital to enter China.

Since both China and Germany have their own problems, the economic and trade relations between the two countries can only show the current situation, and it is difficult to improve greatly in the short term.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T15-54-59/IMG_0171-1687246972-1687362122.jpeg)In the election in May this year, dozens of women were elected to the Thai Parliament(Peninsula TV Station)In the historic elections held last month in Thailand, the Progressive Party won the most seats in the parliament, and it seems to usher in a new generation of young politicians -assuming that conservatives accept the results of the election.

The Move Forward of Thailand is still facing many obstacles to form a government for the Thai party with its main alliance partners and populist party parties.

However, the election results alone show that the country's political pattern has undergone fundamental changes. Now, voters have requested a thorough reform of the political system led by the army and the monarchy for many years.

Chiang Mai Province in the north is a good example.

The far -reaching party is traditionally for the Thai party's stronghold. It won 7 seats in 10 seats this year, using deeper reforms as its campaign basis. The result of this round of elections also shows the increase in intergenerational alternative and gender diversity -among the 10 candidates, 7 candidates -including 5 women -in their 30s.

Rueengrawee Pichaikul, director of the Institute of Gender and Development, said that a total of 96 women were elected this year, accounting for 19%of the lower seats of the parliament, which was slightly higher than the 2019 election results.

She also pointed out that far away from the party is a leading position for 36 women, and the Thai party is elected with 29 women.

Layerrawa said, "This is a new generation, a new paradigm change." She also added that the higher the degree of democratization in Thailand, the more women participating in politics. "If there is a more open society, women will have more opportunities. Compared with military rule, this is a very different point. In the Senate appointed by the military, only 6%are women."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T15-54-59/33F4237-highres-1687246589-1687362217.jpg)The election results show that the Thai people want to make a thorough change(French media)She also said that women still face some challenges politically, including "sexual violence." She gave an example: a male candidate put the photos of female competitors to a nude model to "damage and discredit her popularity."

She added, "Most of them have been bullying on social media, such as Facebook", "the last election is even worse. Some political parties use women as sexual objects, and they only nominate beautiful candidates for candidates. And talk more about her appearance, not her thoughts or the problems she fought. "

Ruayegravi said that she was particularly happy to see young people far away from the party regard gender equality as a key topic.

She also said, "We believe in the new generation of voters. I think the country will be better until there is a form of regime change."

Of course, such results cannot be ruled out.

The last election government, the Thai government -was overthrown in the coup in 2014, and then Thailand ushered in the nine -year -old rule.

The following are three women who occupy the seats in the Thai Parliament held in the next few weeks.

#### Putta Chaianun

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T15-54-59/IMG_0222-1687246849-1687362298.jpeg)Putita Channu said that she decided to become a politician, to "create a better society" for her children(Peninsula TV Station)Putita Qianshan met a reporter at the Peninsula TV station in a bookstore 12 years ago. At that time, she attended a seminar on democracy during his study at Chiang Mai University.

This course has inspired the interest of the 36 -year -old politician and was elected as a parliamentarian as a representative of the party last month. Although she is satisfied with the results of the election and is optimistic about the development direction of Thailand, she has experienced a certain loss to her personally for many years as an activist.

She said, "Looking at my friend was sent to the prison and escaped from the country, or disappeared, I was very uncomfortable." What she refers to is a democratic activist Wan Charam Sasaciste(Wandamosit)——The latter was abducted in Cambodia in 2020 and has never appeared again.

Putita himself has also violated the law, including the protest on the anniversary of the 2014 coup and was prison. Although she said she was never scared, she felt a certain degree of disillusionment due to the differences and uselessness in the parent movement and a sense of uselessness.

She said, "For my mental health, I have to rest. I am desperate for the democratic situation in Thailand." She had moved to Shanghai to learn Chinese before, and stayed there for about two years. The rise ignited her hope.

In the predecessor of the party, the Future Moved Party suddenly won the third place in the 2019 election, and was subsequently dissolved. Its leader ThanathornjuangroongRuangkit was banned from participating in politics due to financial improper behavior, but supporters and human rights organizations have been Condemn this for political motivation.

Putita said, "In the future, the Party and Tanatong gave me hope again. When I saw Tanatong, I wanted to come back to fight."

She moved to Bangkok after the 2019 election, served as an assistant in the future party, and returned to Chiang Mai when the new crown epidemic came.

Putita said, "I never want to be a politician," but when she was pregnant with her first child, her choice became "completely clear."

"I realize that I need to create a better society for my children."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T15-54-59/image-1687362337.jpg)Thailand: The results of the election agency certification election(Peninsula TV Station)Putita said that now she has entered the parliament, she will support the plans of far -reaching party, rewrite the constitution drafted by the military, and solve the problem of income inequality. At a more personal level, she hopes to "help friends who face political motivation -based allegations" and "revive justice in Thailand."

Putita pointed out that she also plans to cooperate with other female politicians to set quotas for women in parliament. She also pointed out that the gender concept of Thailand is changing.

She said, "In the past, they thought that female politicians were just a flower, but now, it is clear that the Thai people trust us." Although the problem still exists.

"A man from another political party even called me a maid, and tried to discredit me, saying that I was just my husband's shadow." She also pointed out. "I think as a woman and a mother, this is a kind of power. Very gentle and sincere. "

She will attribute to the party's victory in Chiang Mai, thanks to her more aggressive reform appeal.Putita described herself as an introverted person, and she said she liked art, peace and quiet. "I like to stay at home with my family", "If I am not a politician, I want to have my own art museum."

But she has almost no time to pursue her hobby. After graduating from college, she joined a civil society organization dedicated to mining and environmental issues. Since then, she has invested most of the time into human rights and radical activities.

Although she had previously stated that there was nothing to be happy in those turbulent years after the coup, she now saw a hint of dawn at the end of the tunnel.

She said, "I feel stronger, full of hope and happiness. I can see that some things will change."

She believes that even if the establishment faction has found a way to prevent the government from entering the party, some things have been released and cannot be curbed again.

"This is Thailand. Everything is possible. Most Thai people are now realized."

#### Srisopha Kotkhamlue

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T15-54-59/IMG_0142-1687246727-1687362394.jpeg)Srushachalu is a daughter of a famous politician. She said that her goal is "better than him"(Peninsula TV Station)The 30 -year -old Srushachalumu was interviewed by a reporter from the Peninsula TV station one day before his master's degree test. The next day, the energetic party approved her exam for parliament members of the Thai party and flew back to Chiang Mai in time to participate in the sex minority group (LGBTQ) parade that night.

As a daughter of a well -known politician, Srusha has been paying attention to political undertakings for a long time, and even considers participating in the 2019 election.

"I'm really young, so I decided to spend some time to learn from more experienced people." She explained that she had served as secretary of the Chiang Mai Provincial Government and the team manager of the local football team.

She said, "I need to work with many men, this is not always easy, but I have learned a lot of leadership skills."

Srusha was elected as the representative of the 10th district of Chiang Mai, and this is a rugged mountain area, which is mainly composed of protected forests. Locals often have no proof of property rights. She hopes to change this situation and say that the granting property rights will help locals to become safer and better protect the forest, because the boundaries of the farm will be clearer.

She said, "Some people think that women go to the forest alone are dangerous, but I don't mind."

Srusha said that she had encountered the situation that people did not treat female politicians seriously as male politicians, or they thought they were not so smart or very weak, but she believed that "most people have changed their changes "Views on women".

Like Putita, Srusha also regards her gender as an advantage, saying that voters may find that women are more graceful and "easier to discuss with them" their questions. "We are better at understanding people's feelings."

As an outstanding young daughter of a male politician, this identity also brought some challenges to Srusha. But she was still not frightened.

She pointed out, "At the beginning, this is very difficult because people have their own views on me, and this is because they think of my father." "When you have not achieved any achievements, they certainly think so. "

But she said that as she continued her political career, she was building her own achievements.

"The work will prove everything", she said, "I only need to do better than him."

Although Srusha won the campaign with a weak advantage, this election was disappointing for the entire party, especially in Chiang Mai, and she believes that this should be a lesson.

Srusfa, who has a degree in economics from the University of Kingston in the United Kingdom, said that although she believes that the Thai party is the best party to solve the Thai economic problems, voters think that "this is not enough."

She said, "It's not just economy, we need to pay more attention to human rights," including same -sex marriage. Srusfa said she "fully supports this."

She said that if the Thai party must fail, she is glad to see the party far away from the party instead of being supported by the military.

"This shows that the core of Chiang Mai is democracy."

#### Karanic Chantada

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-21T15-54-59/IMG_0364-1687246916-1687362456.jpeg)Karanik Chartada hopes to improve social welfare and public medical care(Peninsula TV Station)Before Caranik Chaotada became a candidate for the party, he was interviewed by a reporter from the Peninsula Television in a cafe next to the pharmacy.

After graduating from the pharmacy, the 32 -year -old woman had been serving as a stewardess for China Airlines for 3 years in Bangkok, and then moved back to Chiang Mai after being fired during the epidemic. She returned to the pharmacy during the new crown epidemic, and this is also the key factor in her political awakening.

"During the new crown pneumonia's epidemic, the shortage of sanitary products such as masks, and the price of all products is rising. Previously, the price of a box of masks was 100 baht (about 2.9 US dollars), but now it has risen to 700-1000 baht (about approximately about He $ 20-28). "

When senior government officials were suspected of inventory and raising prices, they were aroused anger across the country, including Karanik, who began to participate in volunteer services far away from the party under the inspiration.

She said, "I am one of the staff who help organizations and promotion of public debates and speeches." The process from volunteers to candidates includes interviews and personal papers.

She said, "You don't need to be a rich or powerful businessman to become a candidate far away from the party."

Unexpectedly, Caranik said that for her, the most important problem is to improve Thai social welfare, especially public health services.

She also said, "Everyone, whether the rich and the poor, should be able to obtain appropriate benefits from the government, rather than the need to save money to prepare for medical care."

Karinik said that although she has experienced some "sexual harassment" during the campaign, most of them come from older men. They are rude or "bad jokes", but the situation is improving.

She believes that youth is more important than gender. "As a young man, I can better adapt to different people and communicate with young people and elders in more formal ways." She also added that it is a challenge to achieve a balance between professionalism and approachable people.

She also attributed the results of the election to the will of the new generation.

She said, "Young people are not bound by the traditional hierarchical system. They are not afraid of asking questions, asking their rights, or expressing their own opinions."

Karinik said that in her free time, she likes to jog and read Thai novels, but when she was asked what book she was currently reading, she smiled and took out a thick live pages. Protocol.

She also said that she only planned to serve one or two term and then let the "fresh blood" take over.

She pointed out that "I hope that politicians will be the public servants of volunteers or people, not to enter the parliament for personal interests or business relationships." "Farly entering the party is fighting such political and cultural."

Under the obstruction of Turkey, Sweden has not been able to join NATO as expected so far. After fulfilling the requirements of the Turkish "contract" request, the Swedish authorities called on Turkey to start the contract as soon as possible.

Reuters reports that Swedish Foreign Minister Tobiasbillstrom said on Wednesday (June 21) that Sweden has fulfilled its obligations in the agreement reached with Turkey. It is now a approval procedure for the Turkey Parliament to allow Sweden to allow Sweden to allow Sweden It's time to join NATO.

"Our judgment is that we have completed (Turkey )'s expectations for us, and now it is time to launch the approval procedure for the Turkish Parliament."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Sweden has implemented more stringent counter -terrorism laws from June 1, listing more activities related to extremist organizations as illegal crimes. The analysis believes that this move is to obtain the support of Turkey to join NATO. On June 4, NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg stated that Sweden had "fulfilled its responsibility" while visiting Turkey and had taken action to solve Turkey's concerns. Local media reported that all parties hope that Turkey will approve the Swedish "contract" application before the NATO summit in July.

In May last year, Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO at the same time. However, because Turkey and Hungary have not yet officially approved, Sweden's "enrollment" process was blocked. Turkey has always been dissatisfied with Sweden's attitude towards the "Kurdish Workers' Party", and the organization has been identified as a terrorist organization by Turkey.

When the 20th round of talks held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan are about to end, the country's move on the 21st may also surprise other participants.

Since 2017, Kazakhstan, a former Soviet country, has provided talks on the way of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iran, and provides a place for talks on Syria's conflict.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan said that the Asta talks have completed their mission, "the initial goal -including the establishment of a conflict downgrade zone, the end of the bleeding incident, and the reduction of the number of casualties have been fully implemented."

Abeck Smartiarov, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, pointed out that Syria has recently returned to the Arab League and his efforts to restore relations with Turkey, which is exactly the evidence that Astana talks have achieved its purpose.

However, the Russian President Syrian Sydinary Special Envoy Alexander Laverv, which led the Russian delegation to participate in the talks, said the decision announced by Kazakhstan was completely unexpected.

"The move of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan was unexpected," he told reporters after the talks.

Raf Lianyev said that the location of future talks has not yet made a decision, but he added that they may hold talks in Moscow, Akara, Tehran, and even Damascus in the second half of this year.

A round of talks held this week were carried out after the relationship between Syria and Arab countries continued to improve, although these countries have supported opposition groups fighting in Syria and called on the dismissal of Syrian President Bashar Assad Essence

Raf Lianyev praised Syria to return to the alliance during the Arabian Summit held in Saudi City in May this year, and believed that this was an important step towards the end of the conflict.

Representatives from the United Nations and neighbors of Syria -Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraqi attended Asanana talks as observers. They expressed their hope that the conflict would end quickly, and hoped that millions of Syrian refugees living in their own country could return their homes.

Turkey, Russia, and Iran issued a statement saying that the latest round of talks held in Astana were "constructive" and discussed "the progress of the preparation of planning for the restoration of Turkey and Syria".

Since September 2015, Russia launched military operations in Syria and co -organized with the Iranian government to re -control the country's region. During the Syrian war, Turkey has always supported the armed factions against Assad.

Although most Russian armed forces have been busy fighting in Ukraine, Russia has always maintained its military foothold in Syria and helped Assad to rebuild relations with Turkey and other countries in the region.

Turkey has an army in northwestern Syria to support the opposition militants in the flying land under the control of the opposition.

Syrian Assistant Foreign Minister Eman Su Sang said on the 20th that Turkey should formulate a "clear timetable" for the withdrawal of Syria.

In May this year, a few days after this war -torn country returned to the Arab League, Turkish and Syrian Foreign Ministers agreed to formulate "roadmap" after a talks in Moscow to improve the tension between the two sides. This is the highest level of contact between the two countries since the Syrian uprising more than 10 years ago. It should be pointed out that the Syrian uprising has gradually expanded into war involving multiple foreign forces.

Syrian conflicts have killed nearly 500,000 people. Among the 23 million people before the country's war, half of them are in a state of loses.

Lyrics

(Author: Changan Xiuming)

A city is freely gone,

A piece of land was eroded by lies and violence.

Unyielding citizens have never stopped resisting the tyranny,

It's better to die in jail.

The righteous people in this city succeed,

The people are not afraid of death.

Unable to seek compassion for the general election citizen's resistance,

We continue to go on the injured person who is dead.

Go on behalf of TA to fight on behalf of the TA on behalf of the TAs,

Raise the umbrella to support the mission of resisting tyranny.

On behalf of TA, we will fight back on behalf of TA.

Do not give up for freedom, do not give up,

This land will not admit fate,

The black police eagle dog cannot escape the fate of being tried,

Citizens' resistance is not fate because of slavery.

All the blood should let the illegal regime be repaid.

Go on behalf of TA to fight on behalf of the TA on behalf of the TAs,

Raise the umbrella to support the mission of resisting tyranny.

On behalf of TA, we will fight back on behalf of TA.

Defend my freedom without cutting mats and not give up,

Democratic freedom and totalitarianism are not different,

Citizens will not shrink back and make dictators proud,

Reflect the shame of the Communist Party with freedom and justice,

Demonstrate our will to the world to let the totalitarian ritual in fear.

Go on behalf of TA to fight on behalf of TA, and on behalf of the TAs to resist,

Raise the umbrella to support the mission of resisting tyranny,

End this autocracy together.

Our generation is not allowed to continue to continue,

Our generation must end the autocracy by ourselves.

Dai Lingjie went down to Di Xinnn to fight,

Complete Xiaoxin’s wish,

For the people in the prison, they worked hard for Zile Yanlin.

Live well to fight for them,

Slavery is never fate,

Restore the Revolution in the Hong Kong Times,

Lighting this land is our mission.

The British "Guardian" reported that this was part of the "Photo" reduced the cost plan of 100 million euros (about 147 million yuan).

Publisher German Newspaper Group AxelSpringer said in an email sent to employees that the "Photo News" will "unfortunately with those, the responsible work can be in the digital world. Executive colleagues, part ways. "

The "Frankfurt Report" of "Photo" reported that the email stated that some of the "editors, print producers, text editors, school counterparts, and picture editors will no longer exist."

In February of this year, President Spiringle, Diffna, announced that the publisher will become a "pure digital media company". He said that artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT can "make the independent journalist better or replace it at any time."

He predicts that artificial intelligence will "summarize information" better than human reporters, and say that only the "best original content", such as investigators who investigate news and original comments, can survive.

"Photo" is the best -selling newspaper in Europe. The newspaper has not estimated how many jobs may eventually cause the loss of artificial intelligence.

White Ross launched a 10 -day "mobilization exercise" on Wednesday (June 21).

Reuters reports that the Bloss Ministry of Defense said that the purpose of the exercise is to evaluate the preparation of national institutions to mobilize reserve personnel. According to the White Ros law, all Beloel men must take military service and stay in the reserve after serving the military service.

Since the outbreak of Russia and Ukraine's conflict, Beros has strengthened border defense in the southern and Ukraine regions, and is preparing to deploy Russian tactical nuclear weapons in the country. It also allows Russia to use White Ross as one of the launch bases that invade Ukraine.

Since then, Beros and Russia have frequently held joint exercises, which has also allowed the Russian forces to train in the base of Beros. In June, White Ross officially received Russian tactical nuclear missiles.

The Broas Force did not directly participate in the Russian and Ukraine War, but President Lukashenko said that if White Ross was "full aggression", they would join the conflict.

White Ross is located in northern Ukraine, so when Ukraine launch a counterattack in the south and east of the country, it also needs to be vigilant against new attack risks from the north.

As for the progress of replacing the US dollar as the main trade currency in various countries, Ahmad Maslan said that when China, Thailand and Indonesia and Malaysia have traded, they have used their local currency to settle.

He said that last year, the amount of trade settled with RMB accounted for 16%of the total trade in Malaysia and China.

Sources pointed out that Mu Yuding, a member of the National Unity Party of the National Alliance (National Alliance), and the acting chairman of Han Sha Tading for the future direction of the Tuling Party. Their differences include whether they continue to support the races and religious topics led by the Islamic Party, as well as the role of Azmin's highest director of the Turkistan party in the party.

Han Sha Zi Noudin served as the Minister of the Interior during the Muyudin government and is currently the leader of the Congress opposition. According to the online media "Malaysiangazette", the dispute between Muyudin and Han Sha Zi Nu Ding is likely to lead to the position of Han Sha Zindin's loss of Congress's opposition leader.

According to reports, the national alliance led by Muyudin is considering the use of Sarah Shin, a member of the Glass City Aslo District, or Kirilno, a member of the Congress of Dangi, Jilan, to replace Han Sha Zi Noudin's leader of the Capitol.

The leader of the anonymous Turban Party revealed that there are differences in the direction and operations of the National League and the Tuandan Party in Muyudin and Han Sha Zaidin. These issues include the discussion when opposing the Prime Minister's Anhua government, and which seats should be given priority in the upcoming state elections.

He said: "The leadership and grassroots of the Iraqi Party and the Turkish Dragon Party have close connections. However, some people are uncomfortable with the strategy of 'green tide'. The practice of religious' topics. This is the difference between Muyudin and Han Shajinding. "

The news pointed out that most of the leaders of the Tuling Party believe that the party mechanism must be strengthened, because the Turkish party's party strength is not as good as the Iraqi Party, and the party management of the Iraqi Party has also done well. "We can't blame the Iraqi Party. We are just a seven -year -old party. The Iraqi Party has been more than 60 years."

Another source of the Turkish Party pointed out that the cracks between Muyadin and Han Sha Zi Nu Ding also originated from Azmin's role in the party.

It is reported that Azmin is regarded as the "poster man" of the Earth Group's future party. Some of the high -level meetings he participated in were eliminated Hansha and Noudin. The news pointed out that these decisions were Muyudin's consultant. "Perhaps the new team led by Han Sha again should take over, but the person Muyudin wants is Azmin."

Description: Despite the blacklist of the Chinese regulatory agency, Micron Technology, the leading chip of the United States, has invested in more than 4.3 billion yuan (about 600 million US dollars) to expand the factory in China. At the same time, it also spent $ 2.7 billion to set up a semiconductor packaging plant in India. Analysts said that Micron's focus on the Chinese market after the economic recovery is expected to change the policy of foreign capital in the future. Therefore, adding investment at this time is actually a good face for the Chinese government. However, if China is expected to revoke the ban on Micron, it is "don't know much about the Chinese government."
