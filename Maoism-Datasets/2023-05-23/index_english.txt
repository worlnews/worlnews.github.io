The China WeChat public account announced on the evening of this Sunday. The review found that Micron ’s products have more serious network security issues, causing major security risks to the supply chain of key information infrastructure in China and affecting China’ s national security. Therefore, the Cyber Security Examination Office makes a conclusion that it does not pass the network security censorship in accordance with the law. It also said that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the "Network Security Law", operators of key information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing Micron's products.
 
Forbidden to buy similar products to similar products is more expensive 
Ms. Chen also said: "For example, the most common dynamic random access to memory, flash memory and other products are currently urgent needs in the industry. Now you need to buy from other foreign companies. The price may be more expensive. It may seem more than 'eight thousand' now. "
Agence France -Presse reported that Miguang issued a statement saying that the China Internet Information Office notified the above review conclusions. Micron will evaluate the content and follow -up operation of the conclusion. When the reporter asked Meiguo if he would appeal, the Meiguo spokesman said: "We look forward to continuing to discuss with the Chinese authorities."
 Micron Technology Company(Micron Technology Inc., MU)(Reuters) [] Micron ranked sixth in the global semiconductor company last year. Last year's revenue reached 30.8 billion US dollars, of which about 10%came from China. However, analysts pointed out that many products sold in China are purchased by foreign manufacturers. At present, it is unclear whether the decision of the Cyberspace Office will affect these foreign buyers.
Forbidden Micron's sale in China to see it for domestic people 
Li Ang, who is concerned about the development of China's semiconductor industry, said in an interview with this station that Micron's key products have long stopped selling to China, so the ban in the Internet Information Office has no practical significance. He said: "People Americans have long said that they will not provide chips to China. If you say that before you say that in the United States, I think you (China) may be resisting him. It is just a posture, mainly because it is done See it to the people in the country, it gives domestic people a explanation. "
China needs to import a large number of chips from foreign countries to produce electronic products such as mobile phones, drones. Last year, China used to buy chips from foreign countries to hundreds of billions of dollars, which was the same as the amount of purchasing crude oil and natural gas.
American company chip manufacturing migration division Japan 
The representative of Micron Technology Company announced on Thursday that with the support of the Japanese government, the company will invest about 3.6 billion US dollars in Japan for the production of advanced storage chips. The company said the cutting -edge storage chip invested in 2025 will be put into production.

U.S. Secretary of Secretary of the U.S. Secretary of State Blint support Taiwan to participate in the Chinese "resolute opposition" * 
The World Health Conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland on the afternoon of May 21. Prior to the discussion, in Walk Thetalk organized by the WHO, the Taiwan parade accidentally encountered Tedros Adhanomghebreyesus, Director -General of the WHO. Do you support Taiwan to enter the WHO? But Tan Desai did not respond positively.
 
Director of the WHO Tan Desai: "You know, this is the resolution of a member country. Member states have to vote for votes, and Taiwan should talk to them."
Tan Desai's answer is like playing Tai Chi. The Taiwanese who participated in the parade were unacceptable. They shouted the slogan "Taiwan for WHO".
Chen Naiyu, a member of New Taipei City, Taiwan: "Overseas Chinese from the United States and Europe, constantly shouting slogans around Tan Dezai, Taiwan for WHO, I will return to Tan Dezai again. The virus cannot vote. Voting to vote, of course, our health human rights, of course, can not be voted by voting. "
 The Taiwan Legislative Councilor Self -organized Visiting Group participated in the parade. (Chen Naiyu is exclusively provided) Taiwan's overseas Chinese, folk, and doctors from all over the world.

International power to support Taiwan to enter the WTO China and suppress 
In fact, from 2009 to 2016, Taiwan participated in the WHO as an observer. After 2017, under the suppression of China, it has been refused to the WHO's door for seven consecutive years. However, in recent years, in view of the anti -China and China of various countries, coupled with the results of Taiwan's epidemic prevention, it has been affirmed by the world. Therefore, this year's European Parliament, the EU 27 countries, the seven major industrial countries (G7), the United States, Australia, and the British station in Taiwan have supported Taiwan. Participate in WHO and participate in the World Health Conference as an observer. Although the international support level has improved, Taiwan has not received an invitation letter.

 The total investment in Germany has been announced in foreign countries to US $ 25 billion, and most of them come from the US semiconductor processing company Intel (Intel)
(Voice of Germany Chinese), despite the energy crisis, the level of foreign investment attracted by Germany is still stable, thanks to a strong interest from the United States, Britain and Turkish companies. In the past year, there were 1,783 new registered branches in Germany and extended business in Germany. Although this decreases by 23 than the total amount in 2021, it is 101 more than in 2020.
Roberthermann, general manager of Federal Trade and Investment Agency, told Reuters on Monday: "In view of the current unfavorable situation -Ukraine War, Energy crisis, and sequelae of epidemic, it is successful."
This is also reflected in foreign companies' investment in future technology -such as semiconductor industry, battery manufacturing and recycling industries. About 15%of international companies hope to set up production lines in Germany or conduct research and development.
The countries that have the most investment in Germany are still the United States, and 279 investment projects come from US companies. "This is a phenomenon worthy of attention. After all, after the United States introduced the so -called" InflationReDuction Act ", it strongly supports local investment," Herman pointed out.
The second and third ranking is Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with 208 and 170 investment projects. "Both countries do not belong to the European Union, but they hope to stand in the European Union market, and often choose Germany as a foothold."
"The new crown epidemic must have a certain impact on this," Herman said. During the implementation of strict zero -epidemic prevention policies in China, business travel between China and Germany was almost impossible, which has created difficulties for enterprises to achieve transactions, which will cause project progress to delay or even hinders.
Turkey ranks fifth with a record of 139 investment projects.
How does the German industry rely on China? 
German advantage and disadvantage 
These new jobs created in German investment projects reached 33,500, an increase of about 10%. The announced total investment has reached US $ 25 billion, most of which come from American semiconductor processing company Intel. However, Herman also pointed out that even if this investment is planted, the remaining total investment is 8 billion euros, which is 1 billion euros than the level in 2021. He said, "This is a very good number."
In terms of attracting investment, the channels of renewable energy have become increasingly important, such as wind and solar energy.
"Whether it is Microsoft, Apple, or a smaller data center operator or battery manufacturers like Northvolt -renewable energy is an important reason for them to choose." Achimhartig said, In 2022, the proportion of German renewable energy in total energy consumption increased to 46%. By 2030, this proportion will increase to at least 80%.
In contrast, the lack of land area is a disadvantage of Germany. "The availability of the factory area is a problem." Herman, the general manager of the Federal Trade and Investment Department, pointed out that large companies like Intel or Tesla in Germany often need to cover 100 hectares of land or even larger entire land, and while, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and larger, the entire land, and the entire land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the entire land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger, the entire land, and the larger land,,,,,, Such industrial land, especially in western Germany, is almost impossible. The scarcity of professional and technical talents is not a factor to prevent enterprises from investing in Germany, "because all European countries have this problem," experts Haltich pointed out.

Comment | Chen Po Kong: Speak from Xi Jinping's peace, see his abnormal thinking

 On May 10, 2023, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, led the prime minister Li Qiang and other senior officials to inspect Xiong'an New District. (Video screenshot/cctv) On May 10, 2023, Xi Jinping appeared in Xiong'an, and he hugged and hugged. The news itself is surprising. Because, as we all know, the so -called Xiong'an New District has become one of the major rotten projects in Xi. Xi Jinping has no taboo and publicly appeared in this abandoned place full of weeds? What is even more surprising is Xi Jinping's speech. Not only did he not acknowledge Xiong'an's failure at all, but he also praised himself: "In 2017, I came to Xiong'an for the first time and stood on a field plan. In, from scratch, from the blueprint to the real scene, a high -level modern city is rising, which is a miracle. "
Small 800 billion!Which land can't smash a new building? Even in the desert, Gobi Beach, and no man of no one, you can simply hit a large high -rise building -the so -called high -level modern city, commonly known as "ghost city" (such as Ordos, Inner Mongolia). What miracles are at all?
Xi Jinping also said: "The functional positioning of the Xiong'an New District is the first to dissolve the concentrated bearer of Beijing's non -capital functions. This is the original intention and mission of building the Xiong'an New District." The locals all said that this was a layman. Because Beijing is the capital, and the establishment of Xiong'an is to relieve Beijing's capital or some capital functions; as for non -capital functions, it is economic activity, people's livelihood guarantee and social space that every city has. Citizens also need to work and eat.
When it comes to many units and millions of people in Beijing and the relocation to Xiong'an, Xi Jinping said: "You can't rely on your own or evil, you need to move. . It can not be added by the way to set up a second -level unit in Beijing and other methods. "
What is the collective good and evil behind Xi Jinping's decision -making? If there are collective good and evil, then many units and millions of people refuse to migrate, isn't it the collective good and evil itself? And the so -called "good and evil", Xi Jinping's decision to make his head is precisely his personal "self -ordered", which can not represent any collective good and evil.
Xi Jinping's words seemed to make some reason in the small circle. In addition, no one dared to return to his mouth, which caused the effect, as if he was authoritative and mastered the absolute truth. But carefully weighing, but just: abnormal people say abnormal words. Personal expansion and head fever. Not only is it out of reality, but also from reality.
Xi Jinping claimed that the construction of the Xiong'an New District was a "millennium plan", and did not say what is so defined? Is there any Xi Jinping, Xi Jiajun and the Communist Party after a thousand years? Just say how much do you need to invest in this millennium project? Party media revealed: 3 billion trillion!It is now 800 billion yuan. It's just a zero, and it has to be smashed.
It was ten years in the Xi era. It was precisely the most lack of money after Mao Zedong. The overall economy declined, and all provinces and cities and autonomous regions bankruptcy; civil servants were reduced in salaries, teachers' wages were arrears, and older white -haired elderly people were cut off for medical insurance; foreign investors have evacuated one after another. , The production line and the supply chain transfer to other countries, foreign exchange reserves void; Chinese society has entered a high unemployment, and the younger generation generally lie flat ... Just when the most money is lacking, it actually has to continue to build a huge sum of money. The Xiong'an of the Internet!
Can't help but remind people of the Qin Dynasty and Qin Shihuang. After unifying the world, we must build a huge project, the Great Wall and the Afang Palace, and do not hesitate to exhaust the human resources and financial resources of the world.
Qin Shihuang was self -superstitious and thought that since he could attack the Six Kingdoms and unify the world, there was nothing that could not be done, because there was nothing more difficult than attacking the six countries, including longevity. As a result, the Afang Palace had not been completed, and Qin Shihuang had already brought back to the West. The Afang Palace was torch and turned into ashes by the uprising. The Great Wall has become a thousand -year -old decoration to marry clothes for others (other dynasties). The Qin Dynasty itself died, only fifteen years before and after.
Xi Jinping has self -superstition and thinks that since you can win the victory of power struggles, there is no incomparable thing, because it is not more difficult than flattening the party (that is, the rush to seize power, the party's power, the uniqueness, the power of one person)) The incident, so it was forcibly clearing the zero -sealing city, strengthening the Xiong'an, strong engaging in the Beijing Stock Exchange, Qiang Lai toilet project, and pushing the Belt and Road Initiative ... Xi Jinping said the thousand -year plan, and he had the taste of Qin Shihuang. Although, no one thinks he has Qin Shihuang's dominance and prestige.
Xi Jinping inspected Xiong'an and brought three members of the Politburo Standing Committee: Li Qiang, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and the Xi family. It seems to finally realize the world. It is rare to bring three members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Among them, psychology has both derogation and high. Degraded Li Qiang, Cai Qi, and Ding Xuexiang, which caused their status to shrink the status of the Standing Committee. The subtext: The Standing Committee of the Politburo today is Xi Jinping's follow -up. Xi Jinping has been raised, and today's general secretary is beyond the members of the Standing Committee, and it is no longer a one -person super leader. It is no longer a collective leader of Qilong Water or Kowloon Water.
However, the logic of psychology is that they have degraded others and reduced themselves. Xi Jinping thought that he was already at the peak state of "it will be the top of the top of the mountain". I don't know? In the world's population, Xi Da has become a classic figure of "Wu Dalang's opening".

 (Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Business Daily" commented that the summit may become an important turning point for Western policies for Western China in the 21st century. This article entitled "The Turn Point of the West to China Policy" wrote:
"Compared with the tough wording of all parties before the same summit, the description of the China policy in the summit statement may be too gentle, balanced, and blurred. The stressful relationship between the host Japan and China may be one of the reasons why this summit focuses on Chinese issues. For speaking, Western democratic countries have never condemned Beijing's military and economic expansion with such a clear wording, and formulated the basic outline of common strategy to China under the theme of "risk", reaching consensus on this issue on this issue The speed of speed is shocking.
Strengthening the statement of foreign investment control and protecting sensitive technologies marked the fundamental change of Western trade policy. For China, it is a red cloth, [] On the issue of dealing with China, a new realism is occupying the upper hand in the West. The seven western nations have finally realized that the era of globalization has ended, and an era with the main line with each other in the West and China is coming. The world economy will not become more open in the future, but will become more blocking. This new era will be more uncomfortable than the era of open markets. But it also provides opportunities for the West. China is becoming an increasingly destructive country, which is not only manifested in intimidation of Taiwan or sovereign disputes in the East China and South China Sea. "
Comments point out that the new strategy for China will never achieve the expected results in the short term, but Western countries do not have better choices.
"Of course, the new strategy will not be smooth. [] Essence The metaphor of Su Liwen, President Biden, is just right. He said that the seven Western countries are the "Guiding Committee of the Liberty World". The Seventh Kingdom Group is evolving from a debate to a political machine that promotes Western decision -making. At the beginning of the G20 mechanism, some people asserted that G7 was in the end of this life. But now, the G7 may have become unprecedentedly important. "
 Seventh Kingdom Group: We have no intention to hinder the development of China's economy.
For the G7 summit just closed in Japan, the Frankfurt Report published a comment:
"Some of the expressions in the statement are bland, but their significance is not small. The Seventh Kingdom Group's statement stated that the goal of the Seventh Kingdom Group's policy is not to harm China. 'We have not intentionally prevented China's economic development and economic progress. 'Especially Americans have also participated in this statement, which is particularly noticeable. After all, the export ban on chips and chip manufacturing equipment introduced by the United States is precisely because of this purpose: to prevent China from replacing the United States as the number one economic power in the world. Factory policy. Whether it will be eased in the future still needs to be further observed. But the corresponding signal has been issued.
It is hoped that Germany's upcoming Chinese strategy will continue this spirit. It is correct to reduce dependence on China and drugs in the fields of raw materials and drugs. Due to national security considerations, the significance of doing so in Germany is strictly reviewing the Chinese state -owned enterprises in Germany. However, the German government should never go to the pressure of the United States and isolate China with high -tech products in the West. Because this does not meet the fair game principles in international trade. "

 (Voice of Germany) Tiktok has more than 1 billion users around the world, but in many countries, it is considered a security risk. Essence Although Beijing has denied it, the short video platform is still restricted in some countries.
U.S 
The U.S. government under Biden banned its staff from using the app on government equipment. More than half of the federal state, as well as the US Congress and the military also have such regulations. What is currently reviewing is whether the platform can be banned throughout the United States.
Essence Since 2024, Tiktok will no longer be allowed there to "prevent citizens from being monitored by the Communist Party of China." However, users who have installed the APP will continue to use them.
Canada 
Canada is banned from using TIKTOK on government equipment. The reason is that the video app can get a lot of content on the mobile phone. However, there is no evidence to date that the secret information of the Canadian government has been stolen.
 The concerns about the security of Tiktok are the reasons why most countries restrict the use of the APP
Europe 
The three most important agencies in the European Union: the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Parliament banned employees from using Tiktok on work equipment at the end of February 2023, because they are worried that the Chinese government may obtain data on the equipment. The European Parliament is also prohibited from using Tiktok on private devices.
Since then, many EU countries have followed this regulation that government personnel are prohibited from using the app on work equipment. These countries include Belgium, Estonia, Latvia and the Netherlands.
In Germany, the federal government has no principled regulations to use Tiktok on work phones, but government equipment neither pre -installed the app nor download.
, Tiktok is prohibited on the working phone.
In addition to banning civil servants from using TIKTOK on work equipment, France also prohibits the use of Twitter, Instagram, Netflix and game CandyCrush. The reason is also the lack of security and concerns about data protection. According to Agence France -Presse information, this affects 2.5 million civil servants in France.
Ireland recommends that civil servants do not use Tiktok on their working phones.
Denmark banned the staff of the Ministry of Defense from using the platform.
The Swedish military prohibits the platform on work equipment.
Non -European member states Norway prohibit government personnel from using Tiktok or Telegram on work equipment because they are worried about the stolen information.
Non -EU countries Britain also prohibits the use of Toktok on government mobile phones, because the "sensitive government data must be ranked first." The country's public law radio institution BBC also told employees: "If you are not for Tiktok for business reasons, you should delete Tiktok." However, BBC itself has several channels on the platform.

 Police in many places in China have issued a notice asking parents and teachers to check whether the children's mobile phones are installed in overseas communication software such as Telegram and Twitter. Screenshots of the network Recently, the police in many places in China issued a notice asking parents and teachers to check whether the child's mobile phone installed overseas communication software. Some comments believe that the authorities are suspected of preventing the tide similar to white paper sports on the eve of June 4th.
Children's mobile phones can not install "telegraphs" in many places in China to request for parents According to Chinese media reports, the Public Security Bureau has recently issued an announcement saying that the suspects of overseas telecommunications network fraud have recently used "paper aircraft (Telegram)", "WhatsApp", "Seagull Twitter) "," Too Mida "and other overseas mobile phone chat software to induce minors to engage in telecommunications network fraud and help crimes. The announcement stated that teachers and parents need to check whether the child's mobile phone is installed with such software. Your child may be assisted by overseas scammers to engage in illegal crimes. "
Police announcement also said: "If you find that the child has been installed, pay attention to the harm, and take the child to the recent public security organs to find out whether the child is engaged in illegal crimes." The guardians of higher vocational students), do not wait for the child to crimes in violation of the law, affect the future and regret it. "
 Police in many places in China have issued a notice asking parents and teachers to check whether the children's mobile phones are installed in overseas communication software such as Telegram and Twitter. (Internet screenshot) Experts criticize infringement and suspects that the front of June 4th to prevent the formation of white paper sports academic tide 
Society legal person Taiwan Youth Rights and Welfare Promotion Alliance Deputy Secretary -General Lin Yu Sheng accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and pointed out: "The principle of violation of the proportion is like buying a kitchen knife. To what extent, they are not assured of encrypted communication software alone. Whether it will be in the sixth or fourth, students are the conscience of national society. Will they feel that students and student ethnic groups will get something that they want to cover up the truth. They are not assured? Because they are afraid of the people know the truth. "
Lin Yusheng emphasized that the installation software itself is not committed to the law, and requires force to bring them to the police station to infringe on personal freedom and privacy, and also violate the country's principles of law. The Convention on the UN Children's Rights stipulates that there must be a clear fact that criminal facts must take forced measures to adopt adolescents. Standing on the position of protecting and respecting privacy, parents cannot even peek at their children's diary, and the Chinese government has become a habit of infringing citizens' privacy.
An expert of the security security: China ’s network management is incompetent to ask for parents and teachers to check children mobile phones 
Taiwanese security worker Wu Yiting accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty: "China does this, which in turn does not end up with these software, which means that their online monitoring layers have no way to catch the side and keyword filtering of these software. It can only be done from the most native and most original way; it also shows that the Chinese network management is incompetent, so that parents and teachers will help solve this. China has more parents or more police? Chinese police are not OK to use these softwares for parents. Call the child to delete it, and he will do what the government told him to do it in the future. "
Wu Yiting asked, from the perspective of "prevention of crime", many scams in China were carried out on WeChat and QQ. Why did not see the authorities check on domestic software?
Radio Free Asia recently disclosed that Skype hit all over China to present the "signal too weak" problem. Wu Yiting said that these are all Chinese authorities intentionally intercepting overseas information, and the ultimate goal is to consolidate the regional network with national characteristics.
Wu Yiting pointed out that the Chinese authorities also warned the public that the public could not use these software. It was reported that some software that could communicate in China in China could not be prohibited. Among some well -known cases such as "Programming and Thinking" sentenced to seven years in prison for inciting charges, they were used to use overseas software, and the mobile phone was deducted and cleared when the arrest was arrested. When white paper moves, many resistances use Telegram and Twitter to spread videos and pictures to the outside world.
** Parents: Advocating each other is like the Cultural Revolution.
Ren Ruiting, who fled China, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that children would also use overseas software with adults, and she used WhatsApp, Telegram, and other software that the CCP could not reach. Overseas democratic people, such as Wang Dan, will build groups to release information activities such as June 4th, democratic constitutional government, and embrace freedom; many netizens mentioned that they have realized that the Communist Party is so bad to contact Twitter. The Chinese Communist Party uses relatives to report each other and grabs all places where the network supervision cannot be regulated, completely separated.
Ren Ruiting criticized the authorities to advocate the social atmosphere of mutual reporting as each other: "The most terrible thing is that parents and teachers are going to check their children's mobile phones. Parents can not give their mobile phones, but they will not give their mobile phones. Destroy the trust between parents and children. Today, the parents can take it to the police station. In a few days, the child can peek at his parents' mobile phones and sue his parents. "
Ren Ruting found that Telegram had a lot of stolen numbers. "It is not sure if it was a malicious attack on the Communist Party. Many groups were stolen and friends were almost lost. If you are doing it, it is possible that someone may deliberately teach students how to stole numbers and give you how much money to help overseas fraud, and then warn parents and teachers to investigate students' mobile phones to grab crimes.

 NATO will hold a leader summit at Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania a month later, and is currently intensifying strengthening the eastern defense capabilities.
The American forces drilling air strikes, the British Marine Corps conducted night grabbing landing, and the French paratroopers fell from the sky after flying over Europe. Under the shadow of Russia's war against Ukraine, NATO conducted training in Estong Wing member State Estonia.
The message conveyed this move is quite clear. The French Army Commander Edouardbros, the commander of the French Army in the NATO "Spring Storm" joint military exercise, said: "This means that we can deploy very quickly in a short time."
Christophercavoli, the highest commander of NATO European Allies, said this month: "This change will turn us from an alliance for the optimization of emergencies outside the region to Alliance of the allies per territorial alliance. "
Kristjan Mae, director of the Policy Planning Office of the Ministry of Defense, said: "Obviously, NATO has changed its strategy. Collective defense is the most important task. We need to restore our homeland to order."
Since Russia has invaded Ukraine in February last year, NATO has sent thousands of soldiers in East Wing. As early as Russia won Crimea in 2014, NATO sent troops to enter the border between Poland and the Baltic countries and Russia; now, it has deployed more than 4 "fighting groups" in Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.
NATO member states are currently planning how to expand their strengths deployed in the Baltic countries and Poland to the scale of the brigade level, which means that there will be thousands of soldiers in the "necessary place and time".
NATO is also pre -deploying military equipment in the East Wing to prevent these equipment timely and laboriously for these equipment. At the same time, it has also stepped up to practice.
In order to reinforce about 1,000 British and French forces in Estonia, Britain will allow troops stationed in the British military base to be on standby in order to rush to the local area at any time.
British commander in charge of the relevant deployment operation in NATO, Giles Harris, said: "This is a key change that allows the additional troops to add additional combat power in time before the conflict broke out."

 The US Congress and the state government have become increasingly alert to TIKTOK, and they are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform
(Voice of Germany Chinese) Tiktok filed a lawsuit on the US Federal Court on Monday (May 22), demanding that Montana prevent the comprehensive ban on Tiktok. The company claims that the ban violates the right of speech protection of the US Constitution. A spokesman told AFP: "Based on a series of powerful precedents and facts, we think we will win this legal war."
Tiktok wrote in the complaint: "The state's formulation of this special, unprecedented measure is based on noble speculation." The platform spokesman BrookEoberwetter said on the 17th that the bill was unconstitutional and "violated the violations The freedom of speech of the people of Montana. " She said, "We want to guarantee the people of Montana, and they can continue to use Tiktok to express ourselves, make a living, and join the community, because we continue to work hard to defend the rights of users inside and outside Montana."
On the 18th, five Tiktok users and creators also filed a lawsuit, hoping to prevent the ban from being implemented. Tiktok users believed that the state tried to "exercise the national security power that Montana did not have, and banned the freedom of remarks without the right to suppress the state." It has violated the basic rights guaranteed by the American Constitution.
The lawsuit will be submitted to Democratic Judge Donald Mollay; Morro was nominated by the former Democratic President Billclinton in 1995 as a judge. Some Democrats are not tough for Tiktok.
 TIKTOK filed a lawsuit against the Federal Court, accusing Montana's ban in unconstitutional.
GreggianForte, governor of Montana, officially signed legislation on the 17th of this month to prohibit Tiktok from operating in the state, saying that this move will further "protect the Mongolian people from the CCP's monitoring." After the bill takes effect early next year, Essence
Emily Flower, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of Montana, said on the 17th: "We expect to have legal challenges and have been fully prepared to defend the law."
Agence France -Presse quoted the view of the university of Richmond, CALTOBIAS, and believes that the progress of these cases should be progressing quickly because its core legal issues do not need to collect a lot of evidence.
"These constitutional arguments are very convincing and conducive to the prosecutor." Tobias said: "First of all, freedom of speech, and second, if the ban is based on national security as legitimacy, it is the federal government, not anything, not anything Yizhou. "
In 2020, the then US President Donaldtrump tried to stop downloading Tiktok and WeChat through the norms of the Ministry of Commerce, which was blocked by multiple courts and never took effect.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全盘禁止tiktok-美国民主党内有反对声音/a-65213817)It also supports American users to maintain the right to use Tiktok in order to exercise freedom of speech.
Disabast 
Tiktok's ban is feasible? 
The ban stipulates that Tiktok will not be downloaded in Montana, which means that applications such as Google and Apple are not allowed to "illegally" to provide TIKTOK. Whenever someone uses TIKTOK, whether it is "providing the ability to use this application" or "download it", TIKTOK or App Store will touch the France, which will face a fine of up to $ 10,000 a day.
The bill is expected to take effect on January 1, 2024, and punishment will not apply to the user.
The Associated Press quoted an analysis of online security experts. This ban has no incentive measures except for the fines, and no incentive measures make relevant companies willing to comply with regulations, so "full law enforcement will be very difficult."
In addition, compared with China's control of citizens' access to the Internet, the United States does not have any similar means or tools. The decree also excludes online service providers.
A member of the members included a representative of Apple and Google's trade group TechNet that the Associated Press told the Associated Press that the application store was unable to "geographical fence" in specific applications in different states, so it was impossible to prevent Tiktok from being downloaded in Montana. The organization also said that the application itself should decide the running range, not an app store.
Odedvanunu, the product vulnerability director of the Internet Security Corporation, also believes that it is difficult for app stores to isolate the application download of a single country. He suggested that it is more feasible to comply with the rules by Tiktok, because the application itself has the right to "adjust the settings according to the user's geographical location or IP address."
 In March of this year, the chief CEO of Tiktok went to the US Congress to testify, and the hearing president has been in the past 6 hours.
American Stepping Tiktok 
They are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform and thus requires the application of the application nationwide. However, it is not easy to face many difficulties in Montana, a Montana, which is more than 1 million; it is not easy to expand the scope of the ban to more than 150 million TIKTOK users throughout the United States.
March this year, The hearing president has been in the atmosphere for nearly 6 hours. Both members of the parliament questioned that the Tiktok's parent company Bytedance will enable the Chinese government to obtain user data or affect American users in the application.
In this regard, TIKTOK constantly denied that it had shared data with the Chinese government and said that if it was asked, the platform would not do so.
At present, TIKTOK is undergoing an initiative called "Projecttexas". It wants to create an independent entity to store data from American users on the US server and operate by American technology company Oracle.

 Douyin set off a "opposition to Chongyang Mei" activities. Network screenshot/ancient pavilion provides On the Chinese social platform Douyin, some netizens initiated the challenge of "anti -Chong Yangmei". However, when the number of participants participating in the challenge was close to one million people, the network management authorities deleted relevant content on Tuesday morning.
[Xi Jinping these ten years] Three: Ten years of nationalism: from the "Chinese Dream" to the gentle village of power * Ban "Chongyang Meiwai" is prohibited from the name of foreign place names In the past week, the Douyin Platform has launched an anti -Western event with strong nationalist colors, called "Anti -Chong Yang Mei" challenge. The event received a hundred thousand netizens responded. As of the evening of this (22nd), there were more than 800,000 participants.
The reporter of this station searched on Douyin. Some netizens still posted videos with strong national colors, such as the slogan in the anti -Japanese TV series: "Long live the Chinese nation, the Chinese nation will win ... Together, all the supreme glory we do today. "
In the early morning of Tuesday, when the number of participants challenged one million people, netizens found that related topics were deleted. Douyin netizens "No regrets" posted that the challenge of "Anti -Chong Yang Mei Wai", which was just brushed yesterday, was deleted ... I really don't know what the platform thinks. Today, I continue to challenge "I love me my country. Power.

Middle map: Netizens have launched the challenge of "Anti -Chong Yang Mei" and were deleted, and changed to "Love Me China to Strong and my country." Right: Some netizens complained that nearly one million people joined the "Anti -Chongyang Mei Wai" challenge. (Network picture/ancient pavilion provided) The Chinese government educated young children from national educating children from the kindergarten. 
In this regard, Ms. Zhang, a Douyin netizen, said in an interview with Radio Asia on Tuesday that the Chinese have received nationalism and so -called patriotic and Chinese education from entering kindergarten. It is good to say that the United States, the West, and Japan are good. These countries are better than China. They are all admirable. The official feels that Chongyangmei is not good. This is associated with patriotism. Some people really believe that the official speech may be. For traffic. "
In the Douyin comment area, some netizens posted that they hope that the government has issued policies and voluntarily marry foreigners as voluntarily abandon Chinese nationality.

"
Forbidden patriotic activities are prevented from getting out of control. 
As for why the authorities prohibit the promotion of so -called patriotism, Zheng Xuguang, a scoreer of the current affairs, told this station that in China, any action beyond officially controlled, even if it publicize "patriotism", the authorities will prohibit. For example, he said, "For example, like you initiated a rally to support the Communist Party of China in Tiananmen Square, you try it. No matter what the topic is, once it shows a strong organizational and incitement, because this exercise can easily point the finger to the party country. They are the first to be afraid that you will go to the streets, and the second is afraid that you will organize. He is not the content of your activities, but in your form and energy. "
Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China in 1949, nationalism and patriotism have become an important part of political education for the people. According to Wikipedia, the "Outline of Patriotic Education Implementation" issued by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 23, 1994 and promulgated by the CPC Central Committee Committee. The following year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs determined the first batch of patriotic education bases, and many ministries and commissions such as the Central Propaganda Department and the Communist Youth League jointly released a hundred patriotic education books. Because the outline clearly stated that patriotism education is guided by the basic line of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party, it is considered by the overseas academic community to be the context of the collapse of communism.

The Taiwan Central News Agency reported that two reporters of the agency applied for an interview certificate in accordance with the normal process in advance and received approval. ) When he received a certificate at the Geneva Office of the United Nations, he was suddenly rejected.
"A few weeks ago, the Central News Agency reporter has applied for our reporter's certificate through the United Nations media application platform. When applying for a reporter's certificate, we already provide our Taiwan passport from the Republic of China. , Reporter is from the Republic of China. "One of the Central News Agency reporters Zeng Tingxuan, one of the central agencies, said:" But today we were queuing to get a certificate, and the other party felt a little puzzled. Tell us, "Sorry, although we have received the notification, we can't give you a reporter's certificate."
According to the Central News Agency, two reporters from the agency, Zeng Tingzhang and Tian Xi, applied for a reporter's certificate through the official platform a few weeks ago. Because the national fence menu did not have the "Taiwan" or "Republic of China" option, he chose "Thailand" and reminiscent of remarks. The column clearly noted that the reporter was from "Taiwan (Republic of China)" and received a license notice in mid -May, but was blocked when receiving an interview certificate.
Zeng Tingxuan said that the other party admitted that "receiving pressure from China" said that "WHO no longer recognizes Taiwanese passports", "the People's Republic of China tells us that we need to see Chinese passports, or Taiwanese passports and Taiwan compatriots can be released." When the reporter responded, there was no Taiwan compatriot certificate, and when he asked China how to know the application of Taiwanese reporters, the other party responded: "They (China) knows everything, I am very sorry."

According to the official website of the Central News Agency, the agency is the "National News Agency of the Republic of China". According to the Central News Agency, the agency is not an official representative. "It is just a reporter who wants the freedom of the press and the right to know that the right to know.
Taiwan ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed severe condemnation on the 23rd, saying that the United Nations has long rejected Taiwan media reporters to enter the United Nations field interview and report, which obviously violates the universal value and principles of fairness and justice of the UN Charter, as well as the“ World Human Rights Declaration ”. The freedom of claiming and expressing opinions, and the basic human rights through any medium, is not limited by national borders ".
The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the Chinese government of "pressure behind" and stated that "the United Nations Geneva branch was under pressure under China and failed to do it publicly and rejected the media in our country to interview the WHA." "It hurts the evil deeds of the people of Taiwan", and calls on the United Nations to "do not improving the unreasonable politics of a specific country."
In March of this year, a UN Secretary -General spokesman Stephanedujarric was asked at a routine press conference. Why did Taiwanese not enter the United Nations building and was also questioned by the media "China is managing the United Nations?" Dugrik responded unreasonable at the moment. This was the most "absurd" problem he heard that day. After the words, he hurriedly ended the press conference.

Chinese representatives criticized "the DPP authorities put political maps on people's welfare and seek independence", saying that the "hype" prevention gap of "speculation" of individual countries is "nonsense." The decision to get the majority of support for the Health Conference.
Taiwan Foreign Minister Wu Zhaozheng reposted WHO Secretary -General Tedros Adhanomghebreyesus on the evening of the 22nd.

Listening to it: Only Taiwan's election governments can represent Taiwanese, not China of the Communist regime."From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was allowed to participate in the WHA as an observer. But since 2017, Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen has no invitation to attend the WHA during his administration.

 Micron's products are banned by China, and Korean companies such as Samsung Electronics may be the opportunity to fill the vacancy of the market. (Experience diagram)
(Voice of Germany Chinese) US Semiconductor Company It was banned; Korean officials said on Monday (May 22) that the follow -up of Korean companies should be judged by the enterprise by themselves. In this regard, the British "Financial Times" interpreted that the South Korean government was unwilling to rush into the US -China dispute, but to rely on the decision of the company.
The Yonhap News Agency reported that Zhang Yingzhen, deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry of South Korea, said that the targets of China are not Korean companies, so new measures will not cause significant damage to Korean companies; when asked if the Korean government has responded measures. How to do it, "I believe Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as a multinational company will take into account the interests of both parties to conduct comprehensive consideration."
"Financial Times" quoted anonymous insiders last month that the United States requested South Korea, ; May 22 also said that the latest statement in South Korea implies that the authorities will not intervene in the matter, and will not prevent Korean enterprises from filling the vacancies in the market.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning was asked on the 22nd that how to respond to U.S. companies asks South Korean companies to "do not sell Korean semiconductors as alternatives of Micron to China." She said: "The United States coerces other countries to engage in export restrictions on China, which is completely to maintain to maintain the maintenance. Weighing the interests of our own hegemony ... We resolutely oppose this approach, and we also hope that the relevant national governments and enterprises will work together with China to jointly maintain the multilateral trading system and maintain the stable supply chain of the global industrial chain. "
 Micron's online security censorship in China failed. In this regard, the US government said that "restrictions that have no factual basis". The picture shows Micron's factory in Edhata. (Data photo)
Meiguo has been banned from Korean companies? 
Micron produces dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash chip (NAND). The main competitors include South Korea's Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Japan's Kaidi Company.
China " "For key information infrastructure", related companies related to "key information infrastructure" stopped purchasing Micron's products; but some analysts believe that Micron's customers in China are mostly consumer electronics companies, not infrastructure suppliers, so they have not been impacted.
In addition, Micron does not rely on the Chinese market compared to other American companies. Bloomberg analyzed that the Chinese market in 2022 accounted for 11%of the company's revenue, NVIDIA was 21%, super micro (AMD) and Intel were 22%and 27%, Broadcom (Broadcom ) He) Qualcomm (Qualcomm) is 35%and 64%, respectively.
Nevertheless, the news that Micron was blocked by China still caused the stock price to fluctuate. On the 22nd, it fell 5%, and eventually fell 2.8%. In contrast, the stock price of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix rose slightly, rising by 0.2%and 0.9%, respectively.
Reuters analysis pointed out that in the short term, Micron's competitors will benefit, but , Also make the semiconductor industry shadow. Kim Sun-Woo (transliteration), an analyst at the South Korean investment consulting company Meritz Securities, pointed out that under the United States and middle corner, the Korean chip factory "was sandwiched in the middle and faced the troubles from all parties."
 South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are the first and second -largest memory chip manufacturers in the world. Today, the wrestling of the US -China science and technology around the semiconductor industry has also caused Korean companies to be in a dilemma. (Data photo)
The subtle situation in Korea 
Samsung, Hynix, and TSMC have all imported chip manufacturing equipment from the United States; in October last year, when the United States announced that it restricted chip manufacturing technology to China, it had given these companies for one year for exemption to allow them to obtain US equipment to continue production in China. Whether this exemption continues is still unclear.
Under the administration of South Korean President Yin Xiyue, South Korea has gradually moved closer to the United States, participating in a number of economic alliances led by the United States and excluding China, such as the "Chip4) and the" Indo -Pacific Economic Framework "(IPEF). However, South Korea is not like So far, it has not followed up the US chip technology export restrictions on China.
The Wall Street Journal pointed out on the 22nd that any pressure from the United States will impact Korean and Korean governments because South Korea has many investments in China. China is the largest trading partner in South Korea. Samsung and Hynix have settled factories in China. Two companies added up. A total of 22%of NAND flash chips in China produced in China.
"Nikkei Asia" also pointed out that the Micron incident will cause Korean companies to fall into a dilemma. Markli, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, believes that Chinese memory suppliers lack competitiveness in terms of technology and production capacity, and they are bound The replacement of Micron; however, these companies are all American allies. They are not likely that they are expanding in China regardless of the pressure of the United States and the use of Micron.
Why does the United States invest in the chip industry?

 The Iraqi government has announced a new decree to prohibit individuals or enterprises from using US dollars. The picture shows the protests of the Iraqi in Baghdad in February 2023 to protest the depreciation of the local currency on the local currency on the US dollar
(Voice of Germany Chinese) Who would be surprised if he wanted to buy a car or house in Iraq recently. The Iraqi government has announced a new decree to prohibit individuals or enterprises from using US dollars.
Usually Iraqi people are used to using US dollars when they purchase large -piece goods. Because Iraq's own currency Denar has devalued it seriously, if you want to buy a house or buy a car, people may have to carry a few hemp banknuts to pay. So they will choose to use the US dollar, as long as they are packed in a wallet.
For decades, the US dollar has become the best currency in the Middle East -if you do not have enough Diram (UAE currency), Danar, Rial (Saudi currency) or pound.
But this situation may be about to be the past. In the past few months, the political circles of a number of Middle East countries have already stated, suggesting that the dominant position of the US dollar in the region may gradually weaken.
In Iraq, the US government has been increasing the difficulty of entering the country in the country-they are obviously worried that too many US dollar cash will be smuggled to neighboring Iran. Essence The shortage of dollars has caused drastically fluctuating in Iraqi, which is linked to the US dollar.
Such turbulence has prompted the Iraqi government to issue a US dollar transaction ban recently. In February this year, it was also due to the shortage of US dollars. Iraq said that it would use RMB settlement and trade between China without using the US dollar.
The Middle East country is looking for alternative options 
Earlier this year, the Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia said the country held a "open attitude" to the use of multiple currencies to settle its oil exports, including the use of euro and RMB. The UAE stated that it would cooperate with India to settle with India rupees. Last year, Egypt also announced a plan to issue RMB bonds. The country has issued government bonds that have been priced at the yen in the past.
In addition, some Middle East countries-Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Algeria and Barin-have expressed their desire to join the BRICS countries. The emerging country organization consisting of the first letters of English names of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa will discuss the topic of creating a new currency to make new currencies for cross-border trade settlement in June- This is the news disclosed by Russia.
Since 2021, the UAE has joined a project that is run by Bank for InternationalSettlements in Switzerland. The project focuses on digital cross -border payment channels that may bypass the US dollar. Thailand, Hong Kong and mainland China have participated in the project.
China Accelerates the footsteps of digital RMB 
Is it going to end in the era of dollars? 
The moves of the search for the US dollar alternatives have recently aroused a lot of concerns, and they have also appeared on the news headlines. An article in February of New York Times asked: Is the dominant position of the US dollar threatened? "Financial Times" wrote in March: "Be prepared to welcome a world of polar currency." Bloomberg analyzed at the end of April that "de -US dollarization is being carried out at the speed of 'amazing'."
This article from Bloomberg reported that the proportion of US dollars in foreign exchange reserves in various governments around the world is about 58%. This decreases significantly compared to 73%in 2001. In the late 1970s, the US dollar accounted for 85%of foreign exchange reserves.
However, most experts insist on stating that the process of going to the US dollar is far less than that of these news headlines, including in the Middle East.
USD still ruled the Gulf area 
Since the 1970s, oil -producing countries in the Gulf area have been maintaining partnerships with the United States. The United States has provided security guarantee for the region, while Saudi Arabia and the UAE countries have exported oil. Except for Kuwait, most of the currencies of most Gulf countries are linked to the US dollar.
"A major indicator of the process of de -US dollar will be the decoupling of currency and the US dollar of these countries", and Hasanalhasan, the Middle East Political expert of the London Think Tank International Strategy Institute (IISS) See such a measure. "
"The keywords here are 'declaration' and 'potential intentions'", Danielmcdowell, a professor of political science at Xuecheng University in New York, was asked if the leader of the Arab country's leader indicated that the US dollar answered when the US dollar was died in the Middle East. road.
"The publication statement is easy, but it is much more rare to take action." He said to the Voice of Germany. "For the oil producer, such as Saudi Arabia, these statements and provocations are also a way to attract the attention of the United States. 'It may promote the interests of US policy makers to pay more attention to the interests of the Gulf countries. "
Macorwell does not rule out the possibility of the US dollar's dominant position. "All the empires have a day of collapse." He joked, but at present, "most of the remarks are symbolic and political. Any change we see is weak and slow."
 Many Iraqi politicians complain that their country is too dependent on the US dollar
Ukrainian war gave birth to the US dollar? 
All experts interviewed by Voice of Germany agreed that there were two main factors that prompted the Middle East countries to threaten the use of other currencies.
Essence Macorwell believes that sanctions are a very important part of the debate. His new book, "Contrary to its way: US financial sanctions and the Bucking The Buck: us Financial Sanctions and the International Backlash Against THEDOLLAR" analysis pointed out. To use diplomatic weapons, the more its opponents need to transfer its international economic activities to other currencies. "
Alhasan also analyzed: "There are currently a large amount of Russian funds flowing in the Middle East and Asian countries. This is basically a country that does not comply with or does not implement the US and European sanctions."
but And to upgrade to the so -called secondary sanctions, then it is more difficult to avoid sanctions. The second-level sanctions are aimed at third-party-including countries and enterprises that cooperate with the sanctions entity. Any entity who wants to continue to do business with the United States or the European Union will find it difficult for you to bypass the second -level sanctions.### Threat of oil trade 
Alhasan also proposed Essence He explained: "I think there is a feeling that the United States is trying to rewrite the global oil market-in order to target Russia-and this is a strategic threat to Saudi Arabia."
In March of this year, Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman said that if any country tries to set the price limit on Saudi oil exports like Russia, then Saudi Arabia will no longer conduct the country with the country. trading. One day later, the Minister of Energy Algeria also concluded this statement, saying that it would be a dangerous precedent.
Professor Mariademertzis, an expert in EUI Economic Policy in Florence, Italy, believes that this is why this is also the reason for how long the sanctions are implemented and the process of de -US dollar. But all this is not an overnight thing. Even if some countries want to bypass the US dollar and replace the setting infrastructure dominated by the US dollar, it is difficult to add.
 In the past few months, the political circles of multiple Middle East countries have already stated, suggesting that the dominant position of the US dollar in the region may gradually weaken
Bank as a weapon 
"For example, if you are India and if you want to export products to Chile, you are likely to settle in US dollars. But the reason you do is not only because it is more convenient to use the US dollar to deny the product, but also because you use it to settle the settlement The infrastructure is based on the US dollar. "Demulqis analyzed that the so -called settlement is a legal behavior of" extracting funds from one account and depositing it into another. "
To complete this step, there must be a trusted infrastructure, and these are what the United States has been provided for decades. Any alternative has "major legal and political influence". Demolqi pointed out, "For example, will Chile accept India's legal framework? Even if the central banks of the two countries are going to settle bilateral settlement, it is a long process."
She explained that the United States and Europe frozen the Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves within its jurisdiction. This operation has made the central bank a weapon and may damage the international financial system. And Alhasan believes that this has been transformed into "a real concern, that is, the United States and the European Union adopt unprecedented ways to use international trade and finance as weapons to deal with Russia." This is why the Middle East countries are "preparing for a more polarized world, and they hope that they can maintain their actions freely within and outside the US dollar."

Brazil is unwilling to inhibit the spread of avian influenza through vaccination, because the importers are worried that importers will resist poultry products that vaccinate vaccines, making Brazil inevitably face trade barriers.
Reuters reported that Brazil, the most exported country exporter in the world, has confirmed that eight wild birds infected infected diseases (HPAI) case, which appeared in Rio de Janeiro, and no poultry in farms were infected.
The Brazilian Minister of Agriculture officially announced on Monday (May 22) that the 180 -day animal hygiene emergency state.
But Brazil represents Eduardocunha at the World Animal Health Organization Conference in Paris on the same day: "At present, there is no HPAI in Brazil (farm). If our epidemiological state changes, we will eventually implement vaccination ... … We strongly believe that this will cause us to face some trade barriers. "
If the poultry breeding field in Brazil has an outbreak of bird flu, Brazil's chicken export market worth nearly 10 billion US dollars (about S $ 13.46 billion) will face risks.
Cunha, director of the Department of Animal Health of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, said that Brazil exports poultry and poultry products to more than 130 countries to persuade these countries to accept vaccine products.

 Data Picture: On March 8, 2016, during the National People ’s Conference on the People's Congress, the Xinjiang delegation answered questions from reporters. Associated Press picture It is only fifteen kilometers away from Shihezi in Manas County and belongs to Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture. Manas means Mongolian patrol. Many places in Xinjiang come from Mongolian, including Urumqi, and can see the impact of the Mongolians in this land in history.
The Manas Civil Affairs Hotel opened on the third floor of the County Civil Affairs Bureau. The second floor is a charging gym. It seems that the Civil Affairs Bureau has used most office buildings to make a profit. The phenomenon of leased revenue for this type of financial funding is quite common. The hotel room is simple and there is nothing. Fortunately, it is relatively quiet. Outside the window is a tree, and the sun flashes in the gap of the leaves.
The vast majority of Hanas Street is Han people and cannot see several ethnic minorities. Enter the back of the mosque. The Great Scripture was built in 2003. Seeing people said that the original old temple had a history of seventy -eight years. During the chat, the people who saw the gatekeepers were familiar with Ma Zhongying and Ma Bufang of the Northwest Hui, and they were proud of them. His name is Ma Zhongying's "Commander", which is the name of the Hui people. Next to the Hui Mosque is the Mosque of the Uighur. It has a history of hundreds of years and is being repaired. Seeing people say that the proportion of maintenance is costly, but now the government does not allow the dismantling of the old cover and requires the retaining the old. It is considered a progress.
Each county in Xinjiang is engaged in communities. Disassemble the old house to build a new building and implement property management. The community has lost its characteristics of the county seat, but it can vacate large land to engage in real estate development, add output value, tax and economic activities, and also add points to county officials. Therefore, the county governments must have great enthusiasm. As for the loss of cultural characteristics and the unique living environment, officials who are eager to gain profit are ignored.
Passing by Hutubi County the next day. Special off -car traveled in the county seat for several hours. The place name of Hutubi was imaginative, but found that it was fooled again. There are almost no traces related to nation and history. I transferred to the main streets in the urban area, and I saw a total of a family selling meals, and a man who sold milk in the residential area was a Uighur. It seems that the northern Xinjiang cities are completely the world of Han people, and ethnic minorities have been completely excluded.
Go to Urumqi bus. The owner is a Chinese husband and wife. The Hutubi Passenger Bus Station strictly limits overloads, and there are several inspections in the outlet. However, as soon as the car drove out of the door of the passenger station, it began to solicit passengers waiting for cars by the road, regardless of how much overloading. As soon as he went out of the county, before entering the entrance of the highway, the couple desperately arranged for all standing people to squat and shrink themselves to the smallest. At the entrance of the highway, there is a traffic police responsible for checking whether the passenger car is overloaded. His inspection method is to see the window of each passenger car below. If there is a figure in the inner aisle in the car, he instructed the parking inspection and a fine of the overloaded owner, and the overloaded passenger got out of the car. The owner two let the people who were not seated squatted down. The purpose was to prevent the police below see someone from the aisle. In addition, the female owner used the passenger's luggage to cover it in the window. However, he did not see at least a dozen people in the car, so the passenger car passed smoothly and ran on the high -speed highway.
This process gives me quite strange. When the passenger cars and the police are over, the distance between me and the police is less than two meters, and my seat is squatting over and after. Check. After passing the level, the car people looked very happy, and seemed to have completed a successful conspiracy. The female owner is no longer the rustic look before passing the level. She becomes kind of kindness and is kind and talks. She said that she had only four passengers when she returned from Urumqi yesterday. It seemed to be a reason to explain that she had to be overloaded.
Passing through Changji City, it is the capital of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture. I did n’t get off the car. From the window, I was full of the outsider image pursued by government officials. Chinese government officials have the biggest ability in this regard, and they will make everything the most interesting. The characteristics of today's era are everywhere. The whole of China seems to have only one mind, and the will, methods and languages of the mind can be seen in any corner, and even the problem is the same. Today's globalization also has the same characteristics. The difference is only one is power dominance, the other is capital -led, the other is a compulsive way, and the other is the induction method. Today's double ways are working. The space that does not occupy or give up in power is the marketization and commercialization under capital induction.

Although there are some sporadic criticisms -such as supplying weapons and ammunition, there is no sign of showing that Putin's power system is shaken or collapsed from the inside. Although the possibility of this situation in the future cannot be ruled out.
"Russia, like the past, still has the ability to fight long -distance long -term operations," Karl pointed out that they rely on the soldiers who are constantly reconciled. The same is true of arms and ammunition. So now we can't talk about weakening or collapse. Although , Even a surprising weakness -for example, in terms of the combat effectiveness of the army. However, if the West cannot support Ukraine with a very organized manner and coordinate against fighting, then the long -term tug -of -war and naval tactical strategies adopted by Putin may succeed.
 BRuno Kahl, director of the German Federal Intelligence Agency
When did Germany observe that Russia is going to invade Ukraine? 
In a Monday speech, Carl was asked that the Federal Intelligence Agency was [] The person in charge of the German intelligence agency replied: "About 14 days before the start of the war, we also observed that there are some other interpretations except for war preparation." Some criticisms pointed out that intelligence agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom earlier predicted Russia's invasion plan earlier than the German Federal Intelligence Agency. Carl refuted that the United States and Britain's colleagues used some phenomena as indicators to judge the chance of the outbreak of the war. However, the German Federal Intelligence Agency attaches more importance to that all invasive decisions are eventually made by Putin. The owner of the Kremlin palace is based on many factors, "These do not rely on the number of rockets or tanks to analyze it."
How does the German industry rely on China? 
"It takes time to de -risk to China policy" 
When talking about China, Carl said that Germany should reduce dependence on China, but also warned people not to imagine that it would happen overnight. "This cannot be carried out in a destructive way, not something that can be completed overnight," he emphasized in the lecture of the Federal Security Policy Academy. The Federal Intelligence Agency does not advocate that Germany is completely decoupled with China, which will cause losses to German companies. He at the same time The Federal Intelligence Agency Director Karl believes that Germany's current 5G communication network legislation is enough. He believes that it is wise to introduce the so -called "Huawei Act" to fully ban this Chinese network equipment supplier. He added that as an alternative, people can "identify and remove risk components with risks on key infrastructure" and "there is a possibility of legislative in this regard." There is a voice in the German Federal House call for more stringent restrictions.

 The picture shows the elderly in Dingxing County, Hebei Province, waiting for free vegetarian Chinese food in the public cafeteria in the community. The Associated Press Information Picture of China official media Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd commented that the current population development of China's population has shown the trend characteristics of "young childization, aging aging, and regional population increase or decrease", and emphasizes that "the aging of the population is a longer section in the future in the future. "The basic national conditions of China" should actively respond to this phenomenon. At the same time, the Economic Observation Network stated that the long -term population of population means that the overall growth of the economy will inevitably slow down, but the problem of "not rich first" in China's population structure needs to be paid more attention. The State Council of China issued the "Opinions on Promoting the Construction of the Basic Pension Service System" on the 21st, and formulated the goal of achieving the basic pension service system in 2025. Economic Observation Network said in related articles that according to the definition of academics, the proportion of Chinese aging population exceeded 14%in 2021, and it has become a standard aging society. China's per capita GDP was about $ 12,700 in 2022, and it is still at the level of medium -income countries, and has not yet reached the level of high -income national standards. Based on the early arrival of the turning point of the population, the article quotes the concerns of scholar Cai Yan, that is, the Chinese economy may face the problem of "slow, rich, fast and old": aging will intensify by the expected amplitude, and economic growth may also slow down from the expected amplitude deceleration. Essence The article pointed out that the structure of China's labor population will appear in the next period of "two ends, weak in the middle", and the increase in the proportion of young people will increase employment pressure. One of the reasons for up to 20.4%. Decreased population growth and the acceleration of the labor age "The era of relatively loose employment situation in China has ended", because the structural contradictions of the population are more prominent. The article also emphasized that in the middle and long term, in 2035, China's labor population (18-60 years old) will decrease by 10%, and by 2050, it will decrease by 35%. The aging will increase at the same time. By 2050, it is expected that the average age of the Chinese will exceed 50 years, which is 12 years higher than now. The decline in labor population and increased support ratio brought about by aging and declining childization means that "increasing social security investment is imperative."

 Chinese human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong Jin Buling Twitter picture Human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong has been seeking to go to the United States to reunite with his wife and children after being released four years ago. The family members revealed that although the deprivation of political rights has expired, the authorities still control Jiang Tianyong's whereabouts.
* * * *** Lawyer Jiang Tianyong was released from prison for more than two years, and he has not been re -obtained by freedom Henan citizens to visit and be sentenced to being detained Ten years ago, after Jin Buling moved to the United States with her daughter, she could no longer meet with her husband Jiang Tianyong. Because Jiang Tianyong's hometown of Xinyang, Henan, the national security of Henan has already stated that Jiang Tianyong will not be allowed to go abroad and Jin Buling advises her husband to die, but Jiang Tianyong does not listen to advice. In order to escape the follow -up of the National Security, he deliberately did not take the train and went to Beijing in other ways to go to Beijing to apply for a certificate at the Tongzhou District Entry -Exit Authorization Bureau.
 Jiang Tianyong's wife Jin Buling (pictured) has been unable to gather with her husband since the United States. (Kim Juling is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) [] Kim Juling: "I said, it is useless to do it, they will not give you (passport), but he still does not die. When he goes to the window to collar on May 22, the personnel say that the passport cannot be done for you. Take it. Take it. No. (Jiang Tianyong) Ask the leader, the leader said for a long time, and said that the original nationality is not approved, so the original registration is the same. The same is true for the Hong Kong and Macau Pass. I didn't pass it. "
In December 2016, Jiang Tianyong went to Changsha, Hunan to visit the lawyer who was arrested for the "709 Capture" and was monitored by public security; he was later charged with "inciting subverting the crime of state power" for two years.
In the past year, Jiang Tianyong has been closely monitored by the authorities. 
Since its release in February 2019, Jiang Tianyong has been living in Xinyang's parents' house. To implement monitoring, the authorities set up small houses outside his house. Although the deprivation of political rights has expired three months ago, the authorities did not let him go.
 After Jiang Tianyong was released, the Xinyang authorities of Henan once built small houses outside his house for a long time to implement monitoring. (Kim Juling is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) [] Kim Juling: "After three years of deprivation of political rights, they had to dismantle that small house, but the camera has always been there, because his mobile phone was followed. As long as he went out of this village, those people would secretly follow him. The second time he went to Guangzhou relative's house, and those who took the train and bought tickets were followed. After arriving in Guangzhou, the relatives had no cameras, and then his relative's house had a camera everywhere. "
According to Jin Buling, the prison disaster caused Jiang Tianyong to hurt his vitality. He originally planned to let him go to the United States to condition his body. However, it seems that this is just a wishful wish.
Jin Buling: "He(Jiang Tianyong) The body is not good. I want to let him see a doctor and raise his body, but after depriving political rights, he is still not free. The child has no feelings for him now. I haven't seen it in 10 years. "
_ Video: Wang Qiaoling, a victim of the 709 case, visited Jiang Tianyong in Xinyang, Henan, and was questioned and investigated by Guobao on the outside of his house. (Jin Buling is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) _
Pan Jiawei, a researcher at the University of Tokyo, Japan, said that Jiang Tianyong's encounter reflected the randomness of Chinese law.
Pan Jiawei: "The authorities do not need to explain according to any law. For the victims and their families, they are unsatisfactory. It is completely unclear how to meet the authorities to meet the so -called requirements, so that the family can be reunited. Obviously, the Chinese government adopts adoption The measure is to make Jiang Tianyong unable to reunite. "
He said that Jiang Tianyong's release only represented him into the "big prison". Under the monitoring of national security personnel, he had no personal freedom.

Xi Jinping asked at the time to "comprehensively strengthen the modernization of the army's revolutionary and modernization, and strive to build a people's army that listened to the party's command, can win, and excellent style. "
With Xi Jinping said to the PLA, he opened a joke about dogs. House set off a warm discussion on whether the joke was insulted on the Chinese network. Xiao Guo Culture Hurry up It was recognized that this was an "inappropriate metaphor" and immediately apologized, and stopped house's work endlessly. China's official response further upgraded the severity of this incident. First of all, the Beijing Cultural and Tourism Bureau determined that House and its company violated Article 25 and 26 of the "Regulations on the Management Management of Business Performances", and made corresponding administrative penalties in accordance with Article 46 of the same "Regulations": warning, confiscation of illegal income from the laws, confiscated illegal income 1.32 million yuan and fine 13.35 million yuan.
Subsequently, the Beijing Public Security Bureau announced on the 17th that he launched a case investigation on House's individual, [] House has seriously insulted the people's army during the performance, "causing bad social impact." Once House constitutes a crime, criminal responsibility can be investigated in accordance with the law. Article 32 of the "Military Persons and Rights Protection Law" that may be cited by the public security organs is clearly determined that no organization or individual may slander and degrade the honor of the soldiers in any way, insult and slander the reputation of the soldiers; Through Volkswagen Communication Media or other ways, slander and degrade the honor of soldiers, insult and slander the reputation of soldiers, or deliberately destroy or defile the honor of the soldiers, public security, culture, tourism, film and publishing, film, radio and television, online information, or other information Relevant competent departments ordered corrections in accordance with their respective powers and responsibilities, and handled them in accordance with the law; if they cause mental damage, the victim has the right to request mental damage compensation.
How to deal with out -of -words storm 
After the incident, there were many criticisms in China and abroad that the government had excessive response, but some people supported the government's disposal, including Sina Weibo bloggers with nearly 7 million fans, "Lonely Smoke Twilight Cicada". In a post, she said that even if it was the United States, there was a red line that could not humiliate soldiers. She cited the well -known American TV show "Saturday Night Live" (SNL) in 2018. Dan Crenshaw, a discharged actor Pertdavidson, who was elected by the Republican Republicans, was elected as a killer in pornographic films. It was also resisted by millions of netizens, and officials also appeared to call on Davidson.
Caren Shaw lost his right eye while serving in Afghanistan in the U.S. Navy. Davidson made a joke with his injuries due to public injuries. It did cause uproar. Both parties had politicians condemned. Publicly requires the production unit to expel Davidson.
This post on social media such as Weibo caused discussions. Some netizens commented on this, "people who tout the freedom to the United States will never mention that there are also bottom lines in the United States."
Asian facts check the laboratory verification, the "serious consequences" experienced by the American talk show actor is not the same as the administrative and criminal penalties faced by House and Xiao Guo.
 After Davidson and Caren, the show was on the show after the controversy and jokes, and continued to solve the previous controversy with a joke. (/Youtube screenshot) Cran Shaw also took the opportunity of this dispute to educate and call on the American people not to find a consensus in different opinions because of the different political stance. He also mentioned that Davidson's father was the "911" incident. The sacrificed firefighters, in order to call on the American people to understand how to forgive them, and to forget the country for the country, the police, and the consumer.
Davidson is not the only case for the US military joke. Another American talk show Billburr also questioned in offline performances in 2018, the hero's status of American soldiers. At that time, he was looking at the fighter aircraft take -up and landing instructor on the aircraft carrier, and he realized that such a job was just like "the" Warrior One "posture of yoga exercises", and the same paragraph also caused controversy.
Some audiences should respect the soldiers directly at the scene, but there are also audiences who are veterans to let Bor finish the words, and Bor not only did not pay, but also appeared on the show afterwards Critical critics, don't want to use patriotic flags to accuse him of hating the United States.
Although Bor also often caused controversy in topics such as feminism, he still has the opportunity to perform, and he also hosted Essence
US government agencies have no ability to investigate or directly punish companies or individuals because of a criticism of an official. Where the boundaries of this type of cultural performance are still determined by the laughter of the market and the audience in the context of different times.
in conclusion: 
"Then you still ..."(The words of whataboutlism) are often used by many Chinese opinion leaders to criticize the American "different" argumentation skills, but in the example of Xiaoguo Culture and Li Haoshi this time, solitary smoke and twilight cicadas involve soldiers with US talk shows involving soldiers. For example, for reference, it deliberately not mentioned that the US government's public power will not punish the content of the performance, let alone call judicial investigations.

 The "Sedberghschool" in the British private school "Sedberghschool" co -organized in Fuzhou, China. A kindergarten student recited patriotic poetry in military uniforms and said that he was a "little army doll". When he grew up, he would protect the motherland Essence Video screenshot In recent years, a large number of well -known British universities have opened international schools in China. Even if they charge high tuition fees, many Chinese leaders are still rushing. However, some British media found that these private schools with the British school sign have allowed students to receive Chinese -style "brainwashing education".

When I grow up, I must protect the motherland like my father. It is beautiful." The five -star red flag and the "National Guard" youth who is playing Zhengbu. They are not "patriotic teenagers" who are undergoing military training, but students from British International School in China.

The above -mentioned little boy wearing military uniforms and saying that he must "guard the motherland" when he grows up, studying the "Sedin School" co -owned by the famous private school "Sedberghschool" in Fuzhou, China.

Among them, there are many videos of primary school students who "sing praise" for Chinese National Day and wearing camouflage uniforms in young children.
These pictures shocked Zhou Fenguo, the executive director of Chinese human rights: "Even Chinese schools, military education and slavery education for these children are unacceptable, let alone international schools? Of course, this is the consistent brainwashing education of the Chinese Communist Party. Extension. "
He told this station that in the past, many Chinese parents did not hesitate to send their children to international schools, and they hope that children can receive "relatively normal" education. However, these international schools that should have educated students' universal value, or the gap that the CCP is regarded as ideology, forced them to become the accomplice of the CCP brainwashing education, making Chinese school children nowhere to escape.

** "Education Business" with a famous British school signboardAccording to the British "Daily Mail" report, these British private schools have been required to use the official history, geography, and ideological and moral courses of ideas. Historical textbooks teach students to "the unity of the motherland" and the "correct understanding" of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Geographical textbooks say that Taiwan is a province in China and "the sacred territory of the motherland". Governance for the people. "
According to the information of this station, according to China's "Regulations on Sino -foreign Cooperation Schools", Chinese and foreign cooperative schools must "implement China's education policy, meet China's public ethics, and must not harm China's national sovereignty."

These British private schools must implement the CCP ideological education, but Ma Jian, a Chinese writer in Britain, believes that British private schools will still make money in China "with the signboards of famous British schools", and Chinese parents will continue to take their children to international schools On the one hand, it highlights wealth and status, and on the other hand, it also allows children to better connect foreign universities. He believes that the more important point is that parents who have the ability to send their children to private schools are mostly benefited from the Chinese system and will not resist the CCP's ideology.
Ma Jian said: "Chinese parents may also be Xi Jinping's fans. They only think that the West is good and can make their children be better educated, but they are completely unacceptable for political views, democracy, freedom, and human rights. They have benefited from this system, and they will become the guardians of this system. "
Ma Jian said that he knew many British people who lived in China and also sent their children to international schools. He was worried that after the brainwashing of these foreign children, he would become the "spokesperson" of the CCP overseas in the future.
BENEDICTROGERS, the founder of Human Rights Organization, London's human rights organization "Hong Kong Supervision", believes that even if a British institution is running in China, it should teach students' freedom, democracy, and human rights as in the UK. And if they are forced by the Chinese government to compromise and must follow the Chinese Communist Party's education model, they should withdraw from the Chinese market.
He was worried that these British institutions rely on Chinese business too much or let Chinese partners affect their decisions in the long run and may even affect the education of these universities in the UK.

 Cao Xun's "Fatty Freedom" (also known as "Errine Scholar") cover and profile Screenshot of Citizenship In the literary works describing the 1989 Democratic Games and the "June 4th" massacre, Cao Xun's "Deadly Freedom" (also known as "Errine Scholar") has its unique features. This autobiographical novel was widely praised after the launch of the 30th anniversary of the "June 4th". Recently, I re -read this book, with a lot of emotions and imagination.
The book "Fortune Freedom" has a long time span, the scene changes greatly, the events are complicated, and the characters are complicated. The author combines his personal experience with the changes of the times, and witnessed the huge changes in history from a personal perspective.
Cao Xuyun was born in Hukou County, Jiangxi. He studied in Jiujiang Teachers College. After graduation, he was unwilling to be in the dull and mediocre system. In the spring of 1989, Cao Xuyun left Hainan all the way north to Beijing and was catching up with the Tiananmen School of Studies. Cao Xunyun immediately devoted himself to exercise, and became the head of the Chinese people from all walks of life in the square that promoted the army to Beijing. He personally participated in the hunger strike and witnessed the "June 4th" slaughter.
There are two highlights of "Fatal Freedom". One is the on -site testimony of the "June 4th" massacre, and the other is the writing of the author's personal growth, especially the journey of mind. Democratic Wall's senior democratic movement, Ren Takamo, met with the author at Tiananmen Square on the eve of the "June 4th" and wrote a preface for this book. Wu Hongsen, a famous critic and author Jiangxi Jiujiang Division, wrote a post for this book.
The last chapter and 5 of "Deadly Freedom" recall the old people 30 years later. Cao Xuyun narrated the story and ending of dozens of old people. The author wrote: "Some of the vivid scenes of that year gradually blurred. The lively figures of that year were gradually drifting away. Some of them, some mediocre, some expensive Qingxiang, some cheap dogs, some of them, some people are full of people, some grievances, some are still struggling, and some are treating injuries ... ".
Yeah, a "June 4th", how many people have changed the fate!How many people left the original track and took another way; how many people seemed to be on the original road, but the mentality and mentality were very different, and it turned into another person.
For our generation of Chinese, major historical incidents like "June 4th" are not the first time. The Cultural Revolution is once and the reform is once again. There are very few such people in ancient and modern China and foreign countries. In more than half a century, they have experienced so many such big changes.
Contemporary China has a huge change and frequent changes. When we look back on the past and try to give us a overall description of our past few decades of life, we found that our lives are so separated and lacking. It is a few short stories that are not connected to each other: Except for the characters in it, everything is changing, from scenes to vocabulary. Our mentality, our concepts, our status and situation in society, and the attitude and way of treating each other, have repeatedly changed.
So I often think that I often look forward to having such a novel or script, and write down several classmates in a certain class in a certain school, a classmate society in 65 years, a classmate society in 75 years, 85 years, 95 years, 95 The classmates of the year, 2005, or 15 years are still those people, but their respective thinking and mood have changed. Some persistence and evasion, forge ahead and depression, friendship, love, betrayal and betrayal, rising and ups and downs, highlights and darkness. At different ages, the topics of everyone will talk very differently. The respective values will be different, and the tone of each other will be very different. Even the popular vocabulary will be very different. But there are some kind of changes in such changes. Through these complex changes and constant changes, it can deeply reveal humanity and reveal the times.
"The country is unfortunately a poet, and the words of vicissitudes are working." Our cultural person knowledge person has contributed such a huge system to be worthy of our time, worthy of our struggle, and worthy of our suffering. Through this historical review and reflection, we discover and create our future.

The Rights Protection Network's "Mainland China in Politics and Conscience in Mainland China" stated that the cruel suppression of the CCP authorities on Falun Gong is still continuous, but the resistance of Falun Gong practitioners is still as always without fear. Falun Gong practitioners are the largest groups in the case collected every month.
It is generally believed that the relevant statistics of Chinese folk platforms are only the tip of the iceberg. In reality, more Falun Gong may be persecuted by the Chinese authorities.
Member: Falun Gong practitioners are persecuted just because of faith 
To this end, the International House of Representatives The Core Religious Freedom Group (The International Religious Freedom Caucus)A briefing was held on Tuesday. At the briefing, Gusbilirakis, a member of Florida in the United States, condemned the long -term history of the Chinese Communist Party to compress and extinction the long -term history of the Chinese Communist Party. The culture, Falun Gong is one of the main goals of the Chinese authorities. In the hands of the Communist Party of China, Falun Gong practitioners have been sued, threatened, reviewed, detained, forced labor, abuse, strong organs, and even death. They simply because of their faith. "

(Photo by reporter Tang Yuanyuan) Ninashea, director of the Religious Liberty Center of the Washington Institute of Washington Think Tank, also said at the meeting: "Among all religious oppression in the world, the violence of the Communist Party of China for Falun Gong is not often the outside world. It was discussed, but it was very serious, even the degree of religious extinction ... ... The Chinese authorities persecuted 70 million to 100 million Falun Gong believers in China, and the Chinese government arrested them, forced labor, torture, and abuse on them. Many believers disappear or die. "
West Asia also pointed out that in the illegal overseas police station established by the Chinese authorities in Manhattan, New York, their overseas police stations have illegally oppressed and harassed Falun Gong practitioners in the United States.

However, after his father returned to China from the United States recently, he was secretly detained by the authorities for participating in Falun Gong for 8 years. There is not much difference between the primary and criminals, so I sentence my father for 8 years. "
Zhou Zixing said: "My grandfather died last year. I couldn't go to his funeral because if I returned to China, I would be put in jail. My father could not go to the funeral because he had been in prison."
Falun Gong practitioner Ji Yunzhi was persecuted for a long time because of his belief and died during his sentence in March last March. Ji Yunzhi's son Simon Zhang also attended the Ninthon of Tuesday.
Simon Zhang said that his mother has been imprisoned many times due to Falun Gong. In prison, Ji Yunzhi was tortured by electric shock abuse, forced labor, etc., and serious malnutrition: "((the first two of my mother was detained) Only when she died, she could take her home. Her life was dying because of torture and abuse. In the Lunar New Year in 2022, she was arrested again. This was 3 days before the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The police rushed into our house and found the relevant Falun Gong's books. Then, she tried to protest in a stride at the detention center, but the guard forced to feed, abuse and humiliate her, causing her to be sent to the hospital for rescue. "Ji Yunzhi died unfortunately after spending a month in the hospital.
American Member: The Chinese government must be responsible for infringing human rights 
Regarding the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, MPs of Billy Rakis called on the US government and Congress to take action: "The United States and the United States should pass a firm signal to defend basic human rights together. Freedom of belief should be protected worldwide. The United States is a free country. We have the responsibility and obligation to do this. No one should be intimidated, driven away from the land of the ancestors, detained, or even murder because of faith. We should not be afraid of the Chinese government, but should ask China to bear the responsibility of infringement of human rights. "
Simon Zhang called on the US government to sanction Chinese officials who persecute Falun Gong practitioners: "Many Chinese police and officials are afraid of being sanctioned because if they are sanctioned, their children cannot come to the United States to study, and they cannot immigrate to the United States after retirement. They will also lose the property of the United States. Therefore, I hope that the US government can sanction these Chinese officials. "

 The picture shows the protesters rally in Taipei in Taiwan, and expressed dissatisfaction with the World Health Organization's exclusion of Taiwan The 76th World Health Conference (WHA) is held in Geneva this week, and Taiwan has not been invited to participate for 7 consecutive years.

 Modi's Sydney Olympic Park, which can accommodate 21,000 people today, held a campaign -like rally and was the host of Anthonyalbanese, Australian Prime Minister.
India is the most populous market in the world, and it can compete with China's increasingly increasingly increased military, diplomatic, and economic influence. The Australian government is greatly attracted and is trying to show it to India.
In the shout of "Modi!Modi!Modi!", Angonis introduced Modi to the Indian Australians with the title of "Dear Friends" and praised Modi to make Australia "stronger, more more tolerate".
Anganis said that he saw the last stage on this stage the American rock singer Bruce Springer, but "he was not as popular as Prime Minister Modi."
Angonis smiled and called Modi with the nickname "The Boss" of Brucestine, boasting that they had met 6 times in the past six months.
This is an unusual personal support for Modi. Modi, who will strive for re -election next year, is a nationalist leader. He is criticized for democratic retreat and discrimination against non -Indianism.
When Modi responded to Angonis's praise, it enumerated the common preferences of many people in series, from crickets to curry, yoga to TV show cheff (Masterchef), and pointed out: "The most important cornerstone in Indian -Australia relations is the cornerstone is the cornerstone is the cornerstone is the cornerstone of Australia. Trust and respect each other. "
Modi has visited the first Australian visit since he took office yesterday in 2014. Behind each other's compliments, there are rational strategies and political considerations.
When Australia, in the face of increasingly tough China, it is also looking for economic and political partners in the turbulent regional relations.
India's economic performance has been undulating because of some wrong policies. But hundreds of millions of people got rid of poverty.
Ianhall, a professor of international relations at Griffith University of Brisbane, told AFP: "What we have jointly seen in this co -monument is the integration of Australia and India's domestic and foreign policies."
Hall said: "Both leaders are seeking funds and support. They are centered on Indian diasporas scattered in Australia and use the advantages of bilateral cooperation."

 Chinese comedian actor House said on the stage that he saw two wild dogs chasing pine rat, thinking of "can win the battle and excellent style", causing a big disaster. Reuters picture Recently, Li Haoshi, an actor of China Xiaoguo Culture Company, was reported and was reported by the police for the so -called "insulting the people of the people's children". Some scholars have pointed out that the phenomenon of reporting has been in the past political movements in China, and this time the "laughter incident" was resolved, it was another political expression.
talk show quoted Xi Jinping's "excellent style can win the battle" was accused of insulting the army * Sichuan University Student Military Training During Military Training, "reporting" with each other Teacher's supplementary classes were reported to be expelled from students: "Although benefited a lot, the last network is exhausted" [ Hong Kong's "post -National Security Times": The academic reports are reported to be the objects and students of the wind.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/ac-07092021070220.html) Li Haoshi talk show content was reported to the authorities for investigation *
In the middle of this month, a Chinese talk show caused a sensation in public opinion. Netizens uploaded the performance video clip of House, a talk show actor of the Guo Culture on May 13, showing that Li Haoshi ridiculed in the performance. He picked up two wild dogs from the mountain. When he saw the wild dog chasing pine squirrels, " I just want to say eight characters in my heart: excellent style, can win the battle. "
The discussion of netizens caused by these eight words once rushed on Weibo hot search. Some netizens believe that "this is an insult to the people of the people's children" and "this manuscript is not appropriate, and it can be joked with nothing."
As soon as the incident came out, although Li Haoshi and Xiao Guo culture issued an apology statement for the first time, it still attracted a number of official media. On the afternoon of the 16th, Xinhua News Agency's Weibo official number posted: "'Listening to the party's command, can win the battle, and excellent style', each word cannot be offended!" The People's Daily also released a comment on the same day, "One -sided pursuit of laughter fruit and At the expense of stepping on the line, you caught up with a misunderstanding. "
With the fermentation of public opinion in the past few days, Li Haoshi and the smiling fruit culture company belonged to the relevant departments by Chinese netizens. The Beijing and Shanghai Cultural Tourism departments immediately involved in the investigation, and the police quickly followed up.
Wang Juntao, a Chinese political scholar in the United States, said in an interview with this station that reporting itself is not a problem, and Western democratic countries also generally have a "whistle" system. However, in China, whether the punishment mechanism after reporting can follow laws and regulations is the focus.
"I think the report is not a problem. The main problem is persecution. In the rule of law society, all reporting materials must be disclosed in the procedure and approved. The two parties must debate. Based on. "He said," Under the dictatorship of Xi Jinping in China and the Communist Party, they regard the safeguarding the preservation of the regime and dictatorship as the standard of the right and non -standards, and the persecution of citizens does not follow the procedures for public and reasonable China Criminal Procedure Law. "
The police of Beijing Chaoyang District reported on the 17th that "the plot of serious insults of the people's army during the performance for actor Li Moumou (male, 31 years old), a cultural company actor Li Moumou (male, 31 years old), which caused bad social impact. "
At the same time, the Beijing Municipal Cultural Tourism Bureau also announced an administrative penalty on Swordsman Culture on the same day. It confiscated more than 1.32 million yuan in illegal income and fined more than 12.25 million yuan. The personnel and its performance brokerage agencies and the operating units operated by the performance field "further accountable in accordance with laws and regulations." The relevant Shanghai municipal departments also announced that they were discussed simultaneously and severely trained the company involved in the first time.
 On May 17, 2023, the notice of canceling the performance of Xiaoguo Company was canceled outside a theater of Shanghai. (Agencelet) [] After the official shot, the former editor -in -chief of the party media "Global Times", Hu Xijin posted on Weibo, supporting Xiao Guo culture. He wrote: "Is the culture of the Chinese People's Liberation Army challenged? I don't think it!" But this time, Hu Xijin's public opinion guidance work was collectively discussed by many netizens. Later, Hu Xi changed his stance to change his tone to support the punishment of laughing fruit culture. He also said that "the bottom line will pay a heavy price!"
Hu Ping, editor -in -chief of the honorary editor -in -chief of overseas political journals living in New York, USA, told the station that the authorities were strictly, fast, and re -handled the reports of Li Haoshi and Swordsman culture, and released a dangerous signal in China today.
"This incident is a very dangerous signal, that is, the authorities must strengthen the text prison and strengthen the crime of language. Using the so -called masses to disclose, it will cause a wider fear effect. This is no stranger to us as the person in the Cultural Revolution." He said, "Things have now reached this step, in this sense, it is completely the deadly repetition of the practice of the Cultural Revolution."
However, Hu Ping believes that the political high pressure of the Cultural Revolution for ten years directly caused the liberation of ideological liberation in the later system, which is currently concerned by Xi Jinping authorities. He said: "Now Xi Jinping is going to re -engage in this set, it will definitely evoke many painful memories of the humanities revolution, and many people will resist this approach."
The news disclosed by the Internet on the Internet shows that the personal information of the "laughter incident" reporter is also exposed by netizens, and it is also questioned and attacked by many netizens. Reporting the most prosperous Cultural Revolution: the collective trauma of a generation 
Under political high pressure, the reporting behavior seems to be the sequelae since the establishment of the Communist Party of China. During the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, the incidents of their children and couples that caused their deaths to cause their families to be broken. Under the harsh political oppression, everyone has become an eternal trauma for a generation since everyone is in danger.
China ’s official Media’ s Daily Online has reproduced an interview report from the Beijing News, telling that a Red Guard in the Cultural Revolution reported his mother and was shot after being shot.
In this report, Zhang Hongbing, who has become a lawyer of Beijing Bosheng Law Firm, tells his wishes. In 1970, Zhang Hongbing's mother, Fang Zhongmou, said at home with some remarks that supported Liu Shaoqi and criticized Mao Zedong, and was reported by Zhang Hongbing. Fang Zhongmou's remarks were characterized as "anti -revolutionary" and were shot dead two months later. In 1980, the case of Fang Zhongmou was rehabilitated. At that time, the court ruled that "the killing was unjust, and Zhao Xue should be given."
Zhang Hongbing said, "At that time, everyone was wrapped in a kind of atmosphere, and they couldn't run. The kindness, beauty in my human nature was completely and irreparable." It was tortured by the inner pain and applied to the relevant departments since 2011. I hope that the mothers' cemeteries are cultural relics, but they have not been successful.
Zhang Hongbing emphasized that the disclosure of the painful experience was to hope that people remember the cruelty of the history.
Chen Chuangchuang, the executive chief of the Chinese Democratic Party Committee and a lawyer in New York, pointed out that China's reporting phenomenon did not begin with the Cultural Revolution, but the Cultural Revolution was the most prosperous.
"Reporting this atmosphere, environment, habits, or even culture, is not just to have the Cultural Revolution. This does not allow you to be peaceful in any private small environment. In the performance of the entire political system, loyalty is the most important. This loyalty is just a personal loyalty to Xi Jinping. In the past few years, Xi Jinping is very concerned about improving the image of the soldiers. In fact, he just wants the army to play Taiwan for him. It becomes more sensitive. "
Chen Chuangchuang believes that, in view of the Chinese public opinion environment under Xi Jinping, the results of the "laughter incident" are not optimistic, and Li Haoshi himself may also face unreamulated persecution.

 On May 23, 2023, the new Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng arrived at Kennedy International Airport, New York. Reuters China's new ambassador to the United States Xie Feng has arrived in the United States on Tuesday. Does Xie Feng, 59, go to Washington and take office. Does it mean that China's policy of US policies will change?
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is expected to be the ambassador to the United States? Xie Feng as a signal of the Chinese ambassador to the United States, the ease of relations between the two countries? 
Xie Feng worked at the United States of the North American Oceania Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China. Later, he went to the Chinese Embassy in the United States in 2000 and held a number of positions there. In 2008, Xie Feng served as the ambassador to the Chinese Embassy in the United States. In 2010, he became the director of the North American Oceania Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China. In 2021, he served as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China.
Bonnieglaser, Director of the Indian Program in Washington, Washington, DC, said in an interview with this station that Xie Feng was different from the previous Chinese ambassador Qin Gang. She said: "Xie Feng has been dealing with the United States for a long time. He is an expert who has been responsible for American affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Qin Gang has no strong background in the United States and China. So I think this is a one Important differences. "
In the video meeting between the US President Biden Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last November, Xie Feng attended as a participant. In recent years, Xie Feng has also exchanged and meet with representatives of the American industry, overseas Chinese, and local states many times. The US "Wall Street Journal" reported that Xie Feng became the Chinese ambassador to the United States "may release a signal", that is, under the recent series of diplomatic frictions, "the Chinese government is still willing to improve communication."
Qin Gang, the last ambassador to the United States in China, has left him on January 2 this year. Ge Laiyi said that since China has not sent the ambassador to the United States for several months, this has hindered the communication between the US -China governments to some extent. She said: "There is a Chinese ambassador to discuss the various progress that happened, and meet with ordinary public, talk to think tanks, and talk to other states to talk to the business community. This is important."
 On May 23, 2023, the new Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng arrived at Kennedy International Airport, New York. (Reuters) [] Scholars' point of view: Ambassador is an executor and not the decision to policy 
Ge Laiyi also pointed out that the role that the ambassador can actually play is limited: "Ambassador can help set a positive tone for the relationship between the two countries, but the ambassador does not really make a decision to make relevant policies. This is not the ambassador's ambassador Role. He will be an executor, but he can still have a positive or negative effect on the relationship. "
According to several media reports, Xie Feng had previously established a solid relationship with the former Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the Chinese Embassy in the United States and became Yang Jiechi's relatives. During the 2019 Hong Kong Removal Sports Movement, Xie Feng, a special agent of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, was appreciated by high -level appreciation for "daring to fight". In addition, when Xie Feng accompanied Latin America and the Caribbean National Envoy to Xinjiang in 2021, he expressed his tough diplomatic position, saying "Anti -China forces to disrupt Xinjiang, provocate the contradictions between religious nations, destroy China's stability, curb China's development, and carefully. Designed a 'full industry chain' from the manufacture of lies to launching attacks. "
Wang Dan, head of the "Dialogue China" think tank in Washington, USA, believes that Xie Feng's appointment as a Chinese ambassador to the United States cannot be judged as a signal of eased relations between the United States and China. He said: "After Xi Jinping is re -elected, (diplomatic attitude) has basically become Xi Jinping's attitude. What kind of person he changes to be an ambassador, I don't think it can be regarded as some political signals, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part. Still see Xi Jinping's attitude. "
Wang Dan said that in the context of Xi Jinping adopting a confrontation and competitive strategy with the United States, even if a relatively mild diplomat was originally milder, she would "change the sheep to fight the wolf." He said: "We have seen such experience like this in the past. I believe Xie Feng will follow the same way."
The reporter also sent an email to the Chinese Embassy in the United States, hoping that the other party would comment on the impact of China's foreign policy on US foreign policy on the Chinese ambassador to the United States. The Chinese embassy in the United States did not comment on the incident in the response email, and said: "We will publish relevant news in time. Please pay attention to our museum website and the official social media platform."

 On May 23, 2023, the new Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng arrived at Kennedy International Airport, New York. Reuters pictures
Xie Feng, the new Chinese ambassador to the United States, arrived in the United States on Tuesday (23rd). He said that he would seek to strengthen Sino -US cooperation, but bilateral relations are facing severe challenges.
According to Reuters, Xie Feng told reporters after arriving at the Kennedy International Airport on New York on the 23rd: "I come here to protect China's interests. This is my sacred duty."
Xie Feng also said, "I am also the messenger of the Chinese people, so I come here to strengthen exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States." But he also acknowledged that the relationship between the United States and China faces "serious difficulties and challenges."
Xie Feng, 59, previously served as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China and was responsible for supervising the policies against the United States.
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller(Matthew Miller)At a regular press conference on Tuesday, the United States welcomed Xie Feng's arrival. He said: "We look forward to cooperating with the Ambassador and its team. As we said on many occasions, we are still committed to maintaining communication channels with the People's Republic of China to manage competition responsibly."
Xie Feng's former Qin Gang was promoted to Foreign Minister at the end of last year, and the position of ambassador to the United States has been vacant. The arrival of Xie Feng may help Beijing to avoid being criticized for being ignored by the Bayeng government to increase contact.
Qin Gang told the US ambassador to China this month that the relationship between stability is very important. US -China relations continued to deteriorate after the Chinese spy balloon incident. Biden once expressed his hope to talk to Chinese leaders Xi Jinping, but it has not been fruitful. Last Sunday, Biden said at the news session after the Seventh National Group's summit that the relationship with China would soon be "thawed."

Yonhap News Agency reported that Zhao Taiyong put forward the above views on a program of Yonhap News Agency's TV on Tuesday (May 23). He said that if the DPRK launch a reconnaissance satellite, we will further strive to make North Korea more isolated from international diplomacy, and call on the international community to effectively implement sanctions on North Korea. It will also adopt unilateral sanctions from North Korea. He emphasized that it is more important to make North Korea clearly realize that he can no longer have a sense of existence in the international community with acts such as stars and nuclear tests, nor can he obtain economic benefits.
Zhao Taiyong said that North Korean leader Kim Jong -un announced that he would launch a reconnaissance satellite by the end of April, but he had not yet implemented it, and the North Korean side seemed to have encountered various problems.
