At the same time, Micron Technology has announced an investment of US $ 3.6 billion in Japan for the production of advanced storage chips.</p>

<p>The China WeChat public account announced on the evening of this Sunday. The review found that Micron ’s products have more serious network security issues, causing major security risks to the supply chain of key information infrastructure in China and affecting China’ s national security. Therefore, the Cyber Security Examination Office makes a conclusion that it does not pass the network security censorship in accordance with the law. It also said that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the "Network Security Law", operators of key information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing Micron's products.</p>

US policies will not sell high -level nano -chip and high -tech to China, which are controlled by the US government. This time the Internet Information Office prohibits domestic companies from buying Micron's products. Micron's sales in China will decline, but Chinese companies buy Micron The cost of similar products will rise. "</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Forbidden to buy similar products to similar products is more expensive </strong></p>
<p>Ms. Chen also said: "For example, the most common dynamic random access to memory, flash memory and other products are currently urgent needs in the industry. Now you need to buy from other foreign companies. The price may be more expensive. It may seem more than 'eight thousand' now. "</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that Miguang issued a statement saying that the China Internet Information Office notified the above review conclusions. Micron will evaluate the content and follow -up operation of the conclusion. When the reporter asked Meiguo if he would appeal, the Meiguo spokesman said: "We look forward to continuing to discuss with the Chinese authorities."</p>

Last year's revenue reached 30.8 billion US dollars, of which about 10%came from China. However, analysts pointed out that many products sold in China are purchased by foreign manufacturers. At present, it is unclear whether the decision of the Cyberspace Office will affect these foreign buyers.</p>
<p><strong> Forbidden Micron's sale in China to see it for domestic people </strong></p>
<p>Li Ang, who is concerned about the development of China's semiconductor industry, said in an interview with this station that Micron's key products have long stopped selling to China, so the ban in the Internet Information Office has no practical significance. He said: "People Americans have long said that they will not provide chips to China. If you say that before you say that in the United States, I think you (China) may be resisting him. It is just a posture, mainly because it is done See it to the people in the country, it gives domestic people a explanation. "</p>
<p>China needs to import a large number of chips from foreign countries to produce electronic products such as mobile phones, drones. Last year, China used to buy chips from foreign countries to hundreds of billions of dollars, which was the same as the amount of purchasing crude oil and natural gas.</p>

<p>The representative of Micron Technology Company announced on Thursday that with the support of the Japanese government, the company will invest about 3.6 billion US dollars in Japan for the production of advanced storage chips. The company said the cutting -edge storage chip invested in 2025 will be put into production.</p>

Therefore, this year's European Parliament, the EU 27 countries, the seven major industrial countries (G7), the United States, Australia, and the British station in Taiwan have supported Taiwan. Participate in WHO and participate in the World Health Conference as an observer. Although the international support level has improved, Taiwan has not received an invitation letter.</p>

<p>Description: According to statistics from the German Federal Trade and Investment Agency, despite the influence of war and energy crisis, the number of foreign companies in Germany in 2022 remains stable, and the total investment has increased significantly. Among them, the United States is still the country with the most investment. Switzerland and Britain ranked second and third, and China slipped to fourth place. The number of investment projects from China fell to the lowest level since 2014.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), despite the energy crisis, the level of foreign investment attracted by Germany is still stable, thanks to a strong interest from the United States, Britain and Turkish companies. <a href="https://www.gtai.de/cn/invest"></a>In the past year, there were 1,783 new registered branches in Germany and extended business in Germany. Although this decreases by 23 than the total amount in 2021, it is 101 more than in 2020.</p>
<p>Roberthermann, general manager of Federal Trade and Investment Agency, told Reuters on Monday: "In view of the current unfavorable situation -Ukraine War, Energy crisis, and sequelae of epidemic, it is successful."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国仍然对投资者具有吸引力/a-64235264"></a>This is also reflected in foreign companies' investment in future technology -such as semiconductor industry, battery manufacturing and recycling industries. About 15%of international companies hope to set up production lines in Germany or conduct research and development.</p>
<p>The countries that have the most investment in Germany are still the United States, and 279 investment projects come from US companies. "This is a phenomenon worthy of attention. After all, after the United States introduced the so -called" InflationReDuction Act ", it strongly supports local investment," Herman pointed out.</p>
<p>The second and third ranking is Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with 208 and 170 investment projects. "Both countries do not belong to the European Union, but they hope to stand in the European Union market, and often choose Germany as a foothold."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中资在欧洲投资总体大幅退潮/a-47791396"></a>"The new crown epidemic must have a certain impact on this," Herman said. During the implementation of strict zero -epidemic prevention policies in China, business travel between China and Germany was almost impossible, which has created difficulties for enterprises to achieve transactions, which will cause project progress to delay or even hinders.</p>
<p>Turkey ranks fifth with a record of 139 investment projects.</p>
<h3>How does the German industry rely on China?</h3>
<h3>German advantage and disadvantage</h3>
<p>These new jobs created in German investment projects reached 33,500, an increase of about 10%. The announced total investment has reached US $ 25 billion, most of which come from American semiconductor processing company Intel. However, Herman also pointed out that even if this investment is planted, the remaining total investment is 8 billion euros, which is 1 billion euros than the level in 2021. He said, "This is a very good number."</p>
<p>In terms of attracting investment, the channels of renewable energy have become increasingly important, such as wind and solar energy.</p>
<p>"Whether it is Microsoft, Apple, or a smaller data center operator or battery manufacturers like Northvolt -renewable energy is an important reason for them to choose." Achimhartig said, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国绿色能源比例创新高/a-51917232"></a>In 2022, the proportion of German renewable energy in total energy consumption increased to 46%. By 2030, this proportion will increase to at least 80%.</p>
<p>In contrast, the lack of land area is a disadvantage of Germany. "The availability of the factory area is a problem." Herman, the general manager of the Federal Trade and Investment Department, pointed out that large companies like Intel or Tesla in Germany often need to cover 100 hectares of land or even larger entire land, and while, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and larger, the entire land, and the entire land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the entire land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger, the entire land, and the larger land,,,,,, Such industrial land, especially in western Germany, is almost impossible. The scarcity of professional and technical talents is not a factor to prevent enterprises from investing in Germany, "because all European countries have this problem," experts Haltich pointed out.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-22T14-02-00-04-00/000000.png" />On May 10, 2023, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, led the prime minister Li Qiang and other senior officials to inspect Xiong'an New District. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-05222023135712.html/@@images/image"></a>(Video screenshot/cctv) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-05222023135712.html/@@stream"></a>On May 10, 2023, Xi Jinping appeared in Xiong'an, and he hugged and hugged. The news itself is surprising. Because, as we all know, the so -called Xiong'an New District has become one of the major rotten projects in Xi. Xi Jinping has no taboo and publicly appeared in this abandoned place full of weeds? What is even more surprising is Xi Jinping's speech. Not only did he not acknowledge Xiong'an's failure at all, but he also praised himself: "In 2017, I came to Xiong'an for the first time and stood on a field plan. In, from scratch, from the blueprint to the real scene, a high -level modern city is rising, which is a miracle. "</p>
<p>Small 800 billion!Which land can't smash a new building? Even in the desert, Gobi Beach, and no man of no one, you can simply hit a large high -rise building -the so -called high -level modern city, commonly known as "ghost city" (such as Ordos, Inner Mongolia). What miracles are at all?</p>
<p>Xi Jinping also said: "The functional positioning of the Xiong'an New District is the first to dissolve the concentrated bearer of Beijing's non -capital functions. This is the original intention and mission of building the Xiong'an New District." The locals all said that this was a layman. Because Beijing is the capital, and the establishment of Xiong'an is to relieve Beijing's capital or some capital functions; as for non -capital functions, it is economic activity, people's livelihood guarantee and social space that every city has. Citizens also need to work and eat.</p>
<p>When it comes to many units and millions of people in Beijing and the relocation to Xiong'an, Xi Jinping said: "You can't rely on your own or evil, you need to move. . It can not be added by the way to set up a second -level unit in Beijing and other methods. "</p>
<p>What is the collective good and evil behind Xi Jinping's decision -making? If there are collective good and evil, then many units and millions of people refuse to migrate, isn't it the collective good and evil itself? And the so -called "good and evil", Xi Jinping's decision to make his head is precisely his personal "self -ordered", which can not represent any collective good and evil.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping's words seemed to make some reason in the small circle. In addition, no one dared to return to his mouth, which caused the effect, as if he was authoritative and mastered the absolute truth. But carefully weighing, but just: abnormal people say abnormal words. Personal expansion and head fever. Not only is it out of reality, but also from reality.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping claimed that the construction of the Xiong'an New District was a "millennium plan", and did not say what is so defined? Is there any Xi Jinping, Xi Jiajun and the Communist Party after a thousand years? Just say how much do you need to invest in this millennium project? Party media revealed: 3 billion trillion!It is now 800 billion yuan. It's just a zero, and it has to be smashed.</p>
<p>It was ten years in the Xi era. It was precisely the most lack of money after Mao Zedong. The overall economy declined, and all provinces and cities and autonomous regions bankruptcy; civil servants were reduced in salaries, teachers' wages were arrears, and older white -haired elderly people were cut off for medical insurance; foreign investors have evacuated one after another. , The production line and the supply chain transfer to other countries, foreign exchange reserves void; Chinese society has entered a high unemployment, and the younger generation generally lie flat ... Just when the most money is lacking, it actually has to continue to build a huge sum of money. The Xiong'an of the Internet!</p>
<p>Can't help but remind people of the Qin Dynasty and Qin Shihuang. After unifying the world, we must build a huge project, the Great Wall and the Afang Palace, and do not hesitate to exhaust the human resources and financial resources of the world.</p>
<p>Qin Shihuang was self -superstitious and thought that since he could attack the Six Kingdoms and unify the world, there was nothing that could not be done, because there was nothing more difficult than attacking the six countries, including longevity. As a result, the Afang Palace had not been completed, and Qin Shihuang had already brought back to the West. The Afang Palace was torch and turned into ashes by the uprising. The Great Wall has become a thousand -year -old decoration to marry clothes for others (other dynasties). The Qin Dynasty itself died, only fifteen years before and after.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping has self -superstition and thinks that since you can win the victory of power struggles, there is no incomparable thing, because it is not more difficult than flattening the party (that is, the rush to seize power, the party's power, the uniqueness, the power of one person)) The incident, so it was forcibly clearing the zero -sealing city, strengthening the Xiong'an, strong engaging in the Beijing Stock Exchange, Qiang Lai toilet project, and pushing the Belt and Road Initiative ... Xi Jinping said the thousand -year plan, and he had the taste of Qin Shihuang. Although, no one thinks he has Qin Shihuang's dominance and prestige.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping inspected Xiong'an and brought three members of the Politburo Standing Committee: Li Qiang, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and the Xi family. It seems to finally realize the world. It is rare to bring three members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Among them, psychology has both derogation and high. Degraded Li Qiang, Cai Qi, and Ding Xuexiang, which caused their status to shrink the status of the Standing Committee. The subtext: The Standing Committee of the Politburo today is Xi Jinping's follow -up. Xi Jinping has been raised, and today's general secretary is beyond the members of the Standing Committee, and it is no longer a one -person super leader. It is no longer a collective leader of Qilong Water or Kowloon Water.</p>
<p>However, the logic of psychology is that they have degraded others and reduced themselves. Xi Jinping thought that he was already at the peak state of "it will be the top of the top of the mountain". I don't know?

After the game, he also said in an interview: "As a Chinese, I am very proud and proud!"</p>
<p>Taiwan media reported that Li Dongxian grew up in Tainan, but he lived and worked in mainland China for a long time, and rarely returned to Taiwan. There are also reports that Li Dongxian has joined the Communist Party.</p>
<p>This time it is not the first time that Li Dongxian showed the five -star red flag after the game. After winning the bronze medal in the Malaysia World Club Taekwondo Organization Contest in 2017, he also held the five -star red flag to celebrate.</p>
<p>Li Dongxian recently said in an interview with Mainland China "Straits Herald" that he was "besieged" by the Internet for his national flag. He said that the Taiwan authorities said that Taiwan's "democracy and freedom" and "freedom of behavior" were "free" in various aspects. "But is there really freedom of speech? Does he agree with the sound of opposition? If he agrees, then he should not be able to stop us from speaking or doing this."</p>
<p>He also said, "If I am cited today, the Korean flag, or the Japanese flag, or the US flag, do they give me a palm? Right. Because I am a good (national flag), they Just make difficulties and siege. He does not allow the voice of dissidents. He does not allow the people to follow his inner thoughts and do what he wants to do. Then I think that, what is it to be on this place? Well. Just like what Taiwanese people are talking about, this really becomes a 'ghost island'. "</p>
<p>Li Dongxian also said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency in 2021: "Only by achieving unification at an early date can the people of Taiwan proudly look up.</p>
<p>Today, when the president of the Taiwan Executive Yuan Chen Jianren was asked how to view Li Dongxian's remarks and practices today, he responded: "Mr. Li signed up for this competition in South Korea. Representatives. Whether he serves as a member of the Communist Party, and then develop related organizations in Taiwan, we must ask relevant units to check and clarify. If we do engage in such a work, we will definitely deal with it in accordance with relevant laws. "</p>
<p>He also emphasized: "I hope Li Dongxian's actions will not cause misunderstandings of Chinese people and everyone around the world. In fact, Taiwanese people love Taiwan and do not allow similar situations to slandering Taiwan."</p>
<p>The Taiwan MAC also stated yesterday that whether Li Dongxian joined the Communist Party of China, or in Taiwan for the development of the Communist Party of China, etc., "after the relevant government agencies clarify and confirm the facts, it is handled according to law."</p>
<p>The MAC also called on Taiwanese people to "go to land to develop or engage in cross -strait exchange activities, and should not cooperate with the local united front propaganda or become a pattern of land united front."</p>
<p>According to Article 33 of the Regulations of the People's Relations (Cross -Strait Regulations) of Taiwan and the Mainland China, the people, groups or other institutions of the people of Taiwan shall not serve as the party affairs, military, administrative administrative agencies that the competent authorities will announce the ban on the prohibition of the competent authorities.

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65700674/65688748"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-22T14-11-00Z/65688748_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Business Daily" commented that the summit may become an important turning point for Western policies for Western China in the 21st century. This article entitled "The Turn Point of the West to China Policy" wrote:</p>
<p>"Compared with the tough wording of all parties before the same summit, the description of the China policy in the summit statement may be too gentle, balanced, and blurred. The stressful relationship between the host Japan and China may be one of the reasons why this summit focuses on Chinese issues. For speaking, Western democratic countries have never condemned Beijing's military and economic expansion with such a clear wording, and formulated the basic outline of common strategy to China under the theme of "risk", reaching consensus on this issue on this issue The speed of speed is shocking.</p>
<p>Strengthening the statement of foreign investment control and protecting sensitive technologies marked the fundamental change of Western trade policy. For China, it is a red cloth, [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不满g7-中国召见日本大使-批英国鹦鹉学舌/a-65696505"></a>On the issue of dealing with China, a new realism is occupying the upper hand in the West. The seven western nations have finally realized that the era of globalization has ended, and an era with the main line with each other in the West and China is coming. The world economy will not become more open in the future, but will become more blocking. This new era will be more uncomfortable than the era of open markets. But it also provides opportunities for the West. China is becoming an increasingly destructive country, which is not only manifested in intimidation of Taiwan or sovereign disputes in the East China and South China Sea. "</p>
<p>Comments point out that the new strategy for China will never achieve the expected results in the short term, but Western countries do not have better choices.</p>
<p>"Of course, the new strategy will not be smooth. [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7联合公报政策方针不是为了伤害中国/a-65684805"></a>Essence The metaphor of Su Liwen, President Biden, is just right. He said that the seven Western countries are the "Guiding Committee of the Liberty World". The Seventh Kingdom Group is evolving from a debate to a political machine that promotes Western decision -making. At the beginning of the G20 mechanism, some people asserted that G7 was in the end of this life. But now, the G7 may have become unprecedentedly important. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-22T14-11-00Z/65143584_401.jpg" />Seventh Kingdom Group: We have no intention to hinder the development of China's economy.</p>
<p>For the G7 summit just closed in Japan, the Frankfurt Report published a comment:</p>
<p>"Some of the expressions in the statement are bland, but their significance is not small. The Seventh Kingdom Group's statement stated that the goal of the Seventh Kingdom Group's policy is not to harm China. 'We have not intentionally prevented China's economic development and economic progress. 'Especially Americans have also participated in this statement, which is particularly noticeable. After all, the export ban on chips and chip manufacturing equipment introduced by the United States is precisely because of this purpose: to prevent China from replacing the United States as the number one economic power in the world. Factory policy. Whether it will be eased in the future still needs to be further observed. But the corresponding signal has been issued.</p>
<p>It is hoped that Germany's upcoming Chinese strategy will continue this spirit. It is correct to reduce dependence on China and drugs in the fields of raw materials and drugs. Due to national security considerations, the significance of doing so in Germany is strictly reviewing the Chinese state -owned enterprises in Germany. However, the German government should never go to the pressure of the United States and isolate China with high -tech products in the West. Because this does not meet the fair game principles in international trade. "</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65700672/65678412"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-22T14-13-00Z/65678412_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany) Tiktok has more than 1 billion users around the world, but in many countries, it is considered a security risk. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/前高管指控字节跳动充当中国政府宣传工具/a-65612568"></a>Essence Although Beijing has denied it, the short video platform is still restricted in some countries.</p>
<h3>U.S</h3>
<p>The U.S. government under Biden banned its staff from using the app on government equipment. More than half of the federal state, as well as the US Congress and the military also have such regulations. What is currently reviewing is whether the platform can be banned throughout the United States.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/法律戰開打-tiktok控告蒙大拿州違憲/a-65666897"></a>Essence Since 2024, Tiktok will no longer be allowed there to "prevent citizens from being monitored by the Communist Party of China." However, users who have installed the APP will continue to use them.</p>
<h3>Canada</h3>
<p>Canada is banned from using TIKTOK on government equipment. The reason is that the video app can get a lot of content on the mobile phone. However, there is no evidence to date that the secret information of the Canadian government has been stolen.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-22T14-13-00Z/64591922_401.jpg" />The concerns about the security of Tiktok are the reasons why most countries restrict the use of the APP</p>
<h3>Europe</h3>
<p>The three most important agencies in the European Union: the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Parliament banned employees from using Tiktok on work equipment at the end of February 2023, because they are worried that the Chinese government may obtain data on the equipment. The European Parliament is also prohibited from using Tiktok on private devices.</p>
<p>Since then, many EU countries have followed this regulation that government personnel are prohibited from using the app on work equipment. These countries include Belgium, Estonia, Latvia and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In Germany, the federal government has no principled regulations to use Tiktok on work phones, but government equipment neither pre -installed the app nor download.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/奥地利宣布禁止公务手机使用tiktok/a-65577074"></a>, Tiktok is prohibited on the working phone.</p>
<p>In addition to banning civil servants from using TIKTOK on work equipment, France also prohibits the use of Twitter, Instagram, Netflix and game CandyCrush. The reason is also the lack of security and concerns about data protection. According to Agence France -Presse information, this affects 2.5 million civil servants in France.</p>
<p>Ireland recommends that civil servants do not use Tiktok on their working phones.</p>
<p>Denmark banned the staff of the Ministry of Defense from using the platform.</p>
<p>The Swedish military prohibits the platform on work equipment.</p>
<p>Non -European member states Norway prohibit government personnel from using Tiktok or Telegram on work equipment because they are worried about the stolen information.</p>
<p>Non -EU countries Britain also prohibits the use of Toktok on government mobile phones, because the "sensitive government data must be ranked first." The country's public law radio institution BBC also told employees: "If you are not for Tiktok for business reasons, you should delete Tiktok." However, BBC itself has several channels on the platform.</p>
<h3>Oceania</h3>
<p>New Zealand also restricts the use of Tiktok in March. All devices that can access the parliamentary network are prohibited from using the app.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳大利亞禁止政府設備使用tiktok/a-65222959"></a>The reason is that the APP collects a large amount of user data, which constitutes a significant risk for security and privacy.</p>
<h3>Asia</h3>
<p>Afghanistan has completely banned Tiktok since 2022. In 2021, Taliban, who came to power after the country withdrew from the country, came to power, the platform made young people go astray.</p>
<h3>Disabast</h3>
<p>India has banned the platform since 2020. At that time, the Sino -Indian army conflicted at the Himalayan dispute border, and 20 Indian soldiers died. Soon after that, India announced the ban saying the APP endangered India's sovereignty and security. The Indian video platform MOJ and Josh were replaced by great success.</p>
<p>Jordan has banned Tiktok from December 2022. At that time, the country broke out due to the sharp rise in fuel prices, causing a police officer to die and more than 40 security forces injured. A government spokesman accused the platform of release a large number of videos "call for murder and chaos". It is reported that Tiktok and the Jordan government are still in negotiations.</p>
<h3>tiktok in Taiwan: The unified "pioneer" on both sides of the strait?</h3>
<p>At the end of 2022, Taiwan banned government staff from using other Chinese social networks such as TIKTOK on mobile phones, tablets and computer equipment. According to the Taipei Times, the Ministry of Education tried to preach to the public that the Chinese government may use the platform to spread error information, including information about Taiwan.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 23rd) According to a decree issued by the French government today, France has banned some domestic short -range routes. As long as the journey between the two places can be completed within 2.5 hours, the related routes will be abolished.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-23T-1-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Agence France -Presse reported that, in order to fight climate change, the French government launched a bill that had a wide range of influence and President Emmanuelmacron. The cancellation of the short -term domestic route was a part of the entire bill. Although this move has been included in the 2021 climate law and has been put into practice, some airlines are asking for the European Union Executive Committee to investigate whether the relevant provisions are legal.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new law, domestic routes between Paris to NANTES, Lyon and Bordeaux will be abolished, but the transfer flight is not limited to this.</p>
<p>Critics pointed out that the cancellation distance is not enough for a 2.5 -hour train of a train drive. It should be incorporated into routes equivalent to 3 hours of high -speed railway, such as Paris to Marseille from Paris to Marseille.</p>
<p>The new law stipulates that the train team that replaces the route must be frequent, timely, and well connected to meet the needs of the original aircraft passengers and can absorb more passengers.</p>
<p>Passengers who are doing such travel should complete the train round trip within the same day and stay for 8 hours in their destinations.</p>
<p>The French government is known to delete short-range flights related to the French Airlines to obtain a public relief gold and spend the economic difficulty caused by the 2019 COVID-19). And after the route is canceled, other airlines cannot ask for flying these routes.</p>
<p>At the same time, French politicians have been discussing how to reduce carbon emissions of private aircraft.</p>

To what extent, they are not assured of encrypted communication software alone. Whether it will be in the sixth or fourth, students are the conscience of national society.

The Convention on the UN Children's Rights stipulates that there must be a clear fact that criminal facts must take forced measures to adopt adolescents. Standing on the position of protecting and respecting privacy, parents cannot even peek at their children's diary, and the Chinese government has become a habit of infringing citizens' privacy.</p>

<p>Taiwanese security worker Wu Yiting accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty: "China does this, which in turn does not end up with these software, which means that their online monitoring layers have no way to catch the side and keyword filtering of these software. It can only be done from the most native and most original way; it also shows that the Chinese network management is incompetent, so that parents and teachers will help solve this. China has more parents or more police? Chinese police are not OK to use these softwares for parents. Call the child to delete it, and he will do what the government told him to do it in the future. "</p>
<p>Wu Yiting asked, from the perspective of "prevention of crime", many scams in China were carried out on WeChat and QQ. Why did not see the authorities check on domestic software?</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia recently disclosed that Skype hit all over China to present the "signal too weak" problem. Wu Yiting said that these are all Chinese authorities intentionally intercepting overseas information, and the ultimate goal is to consolidate the regional network with national characteristics.</p>
<p>Wu Yiting pointed out that the Chinese authorities also warned the public that the public could not use these software. It was reported that some software that could communicate in China in China could not be prohibited. Among some well -known cases such as "Programming and Thinking" sentenced to seven years in prison for inciting charges, they were used to use overseas software, and the mobile phone was deducted and cleared when the arrest was arrested. When white paper moves, many resistances use Telegram and Twitter to spread videos and pictures to the outside world.</p>
<p>** Parents: Advocating each other is like the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>Ren Ruiting, who fled China, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that children would also use overseas software with adults, and she used WhatsApp, Telegram, and other software that the CCP could not reach. Overseas democratic people, such as Wang Dan, will build groups to release information activities such as June 4th, democratic constitutional government, and embrace freedom; many netizens mentioned that they have realized that the Communist Party is so bad to contact Twitter. The Chinese Communist Party uses relatives to report each other and grabs all places where the network supervision cannot be regulated, completely separated.</p>
<p>Ren Ruiting criticized the authorities to advocate the social atmosphere of mutual reporting as each other: "The most terrible thing is that parents and teachers are going to check their children's mobile phones. Parents can not give their mobile phones, but they will not give their mobile phones. Destroy the trust between parents and children. Today, the parents can take it to the police station. In a few days, the child can peek at his parents' mobile phones and sue his parents. "</p>
<p>Ren Ruting found that Telegram had a lot of stolen numbers. "It is not sure if it was a malicious attack on the Communist Party. Many groups were stolen and friends were almost lost. If you are doing it, it is possible that someone may deliberately teach students how to stole numbers and give you how much money to help overseas fraud, and then warn parents and teachers to investigate students' mobile phones to grab crimes.</p>

<p>The American forces drilling air strikes, the British Marine Corps conducted night grabbing landing, and the French paratroopers fell from the sky after flying over Europe. Under the shadow of Russia's war against Ukraine, NATO conducted training in Estong Wing member State Estonia.</p>
<p>The message conveyed this move is quite clear. The French Army Commander Edouardbros, the commander of the French Army in the NATO "Spring Storm" joint military exercise, said: "This means that we can deploy very quickly in a short time."</p>
<p>Christophercavoli, the highest commander of NATO European Allies, said this month: "This change will turn us from an alliance for the optimization of emergencies outside the region to Alliance of the allies per territorial alliance. "</p>
<p>Kristjan Mae, director of the Policy Planning Office of the Ministry of Defense, said: "Obviously, NATO has changed its strategy. Collective defense is the most important task. We need to restore our homeland to order."</p>
<p>Since Russia has invaded Ukraine in February last year, NATO has sent thousands of soldiers in East Wing. As early as Russia won Crimea in 2014, NATO sent troops to enter the border between Poland and the Baltic countries and Russia; now, it has deployed more than 4 "fighting groups" in Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>NATO member states are currently planning how to expand their strengths deployed in the Baltic countries and Poland to the scale of the brigade level, which means that there will be thousands of soldiers in the "necessary place and time".</p>
<p>NATO is also pre -deploying military equipment in the East Wing to prevent these equipment timely and laboriously for these equipment. At the same time, it has also stepped up to practice.</p>

Experts believe that the opportunity is not a coincidence at this time. (Data photo)</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) China Internet Information Office (referred to as the Internet Information Office) released on Sunday (May 21) that the product of the US Semiconductor Corporation, Micron, "has more serious network security issues", which is for China. The supply chain of key information infrastructure constitutes a major risk and affects national security. Therefore, the online security review fails, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北京恐禁美光芯片-媒體美籲韓勿填補缺口/a-65414199"></a>Essence</p>
<p>According to the China Network Information Office, reviewing Micron is a "necessary measure to maintain national security" and said that foreign companies "as long as they comply with the requirements of Chinese laws and regulations", they are welcome to enter the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Mark Murphy, the chief financial officer of Micron, said on the 22nd that it is not clear what the Chinese government's doubts are. He said that Micron's direct and indirect sales of companies headquarters in China accounted for about a quarter of Micron's income.</p>
<p>"The scope of the current estimation of our current estimation, in terms of low-end market, accounts for the company's revenue ratio in the front of the single digit (Low Single-Digitpercentage). (High Single-Digit Percentage). ".</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that Murphy's remarks can help US light to stop bleeding. The company's closed stock price fell 2.8%on Monday to fall to $ 66.23 per share.</p>
<h3>US response</h3>
<p>The U.S. government said it has firmly opposed the "restrictions that have no factual basis." A spokesman for the US Department of Commerce said on the 21st: "There is still recent [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國加強反間諜-諮詢公司涉危害國安遭查/a-65557271"></a>It is not consistent with the claim that it is open to the market and committed to creating a transparent regulatory framework.

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce said that it will communicate directly with the Beijing government and clarify the matter, and contact the allies to ensure that they can closely coordinate and "distort the memory chip market in response to China's approach."</p>
<p>Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, believes that Micron's products are banned, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國突擊美企上海辦公室-掀外商憂慮/a-65447816"></a>Essence Michael McCaul, chairman of the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Commission, described that China's legal system is like the "Mandarin Party" and criticized Beijing "Bullying American Enterprise".</p>

<h3>Chinese statement</h3>
<p>In response to Micron's failure to pass the Chinese Internet security review, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning reiterated on the 22nd: "Relevant review is to prevent product network security issues endangering key national information infrastructure security, and it is a necessary measure to maintain national security."</p>
<p>On the same day, Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao hosted a symposium in Shanghai to listen to the operation of US -funded enterprises in China. According to Chinese media reports, the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce and representatives of American -funded enterprises such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, 3M, Dao, Merke, Honeywell attended the discussion.</p>
<p>Wang Wentao said that China has unswervingly promoting high levels of opening up, accelerating the establishment of a new development pattern, putting attracting foreign investment in a more important position, and steadily expanding the system of institutions such as rules, regulation, management, and standards.</p>
<p>He said that at present, China's economic operation has maintained a good trend and market potential continues to be released. These will provide more opportunities for enterprises, including US -funded enterprises, to develop China. The Ministry of Commerce will protect foreign investment rights and interests in accordance with the law, build a first -class business environment for marketization, rule of law, and internationalization, and share the dividends of China's huge market and open development with enterprises in various countries.</p>
<p>He also emphasized that the economy of China and the United States has deeply integrated the economy, and the two sides are respecting mutual respect and mutual benefit to carry out economic and trade cooperation, which is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and the peoples, and it is also conducive to the entire world. China will continue to welcome US -funded enterprises to develop in China to achieve win -win.</p>
<h3>New measure may affect limited</h3>
<p>The China Internet Information Office did not announce the specific national security risks it found, nor did they mention which beautiful light products will be affected. Micron said on the 21st that it has been notified of review results, and is currently evaluating and considering the next step. When asked if he would raise any objections to this, the Meiguo spokesman responded: "We look forward to continuing to discuss this with the Chinese government."</p>
<p>Micron is a large American memory chip factory. Reuters pointed out that with the upgrading of the chip technology war between the United States and China, the China Network Information Office's move may affect the transportation and finance industries. According to the definition of the Chinese State Council in August 2021, the "key information infrastructure" involves energy, transportation, water conservancy, finance and other fields.</p>
<p>According to Micron's data, the company's revenue of about $ 30.8 billion last year came from China. However, AFP quoted analysts that Micron's sales in China were sold to non -Chinese manufacturers. At present, it is not clear whether the decision of the China Internet Information Office will affect foreign companies.</p>
<p>Analysts of the investment consulting company Jefferies believe that the impact of this matter has a limited impact on Miguang because its main customers in China are companies that make smart phones and computers such as consumer electronics, not infrastructure suppliers Essence</p>
<p>Jefurui's description: "Micron's dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and NAND flash memory chip products are rarely used on the server, so we think that most of the company's income in China does not come from telecommunications companies and government ","</p>
<p>Micron's production of DRAM and NAND flash chips, which has a competitive relationship with South Korea's Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Toshiba of Japan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T00-32-00Z/56683753_401.jpg" />The chip became the core of the US -China science and technology war. The picture shows the US President Biden signed an administrative order on a critical supply chain in February 2021, holding a microcroof chip in his hand.</p>
<h3>Time "Not coincident"</h3>
<p>The book "Tufts University), who is the book" chip war ", believes that the timing of the Chinese Internet Council's decision is important, that is, the leader of the Seventh Kingdoms (G7) leader in Japan At the time of the summit.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted Miller: "When China was selected at the G7 Summit ... to retaliate against the US chip factory, this is not a coincidence."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T00-32-00Z/65688748_401.jpg" />On the 21st, the leaders of G7, the European Union and Ukraine gathered in Guangdao. On the same day, China announced that Micron's online security review failed.</p>
<h3>Meizhong Science and Technology War</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制美國北京以國安為由審查美晶片商/a-65224796"></a>; Meiguang said that it was working hard to cooperate with the investigation, but the business in China was still operating normally. In response to new measures in China on the 21st, US officials did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p>Earlier, the United States made a series of export controls on Chinese chip manufacturing technology, and adopted actions to prevent Micron's competitors from buying specific American parts.</p>
<p>The United States is also <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美日荷協議限制芯片出口中國要求澄清/a-65232052"></a>; Dutch and Japan have recently announced the restrictions on the export of new semiconductor technology, but it has not directly named China. In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has criticized the United States for "long -arm jurisdiction" with financial hegemony as a "concept of generalization of national security, abuse of export control measures", and asked the Netherlands and other countries to "keep a sober understanding" on the matter. If the measures damage to China, China will "take action to safeguard its own interests."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Tiktok filed a lawsuit on the US Federal Court on Monday (May 22), demanding that Montana prevent the comprehensive ban on Tiktok. The company claims that the ban violates the right of speech protection of the US Constitution. A spokesman told AFP: "Based on a series of powerful precedents and facts, we think we will win this legal war."</p>
<p>Tiktok wrote in the complaint: "The state's formulation of this special, unprecedented measure is based on noble speculation." The platform spokesman BrookEoberwetter said on the 17th that the bill was unconstitutional and "violated the violations The freedom of speech of the people of Montana. " She said, "We want to guarantee the people of Montana, and they can continue to use Tiktok to express ourselves, make a living, and join the community, because we continue to work hard to defend the rights of users inside and outside Montana."</p>
<p>On the 18th, five Tiktok users and creators also filed a lawsuit, hoping to prevent the ban from being implemented. Tiktok users believed that the state tried to "exercise the national security power that Montana did not have, and banned the freedom of remarks without the right to suppress the state." It has violated the basic rights guaranteed by the American Constitution.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will be submitted to Democratic Judge Donald Mollay; Morro was nominated by the former Democratic President Billclinton in 1995 as a judge. Some Democrats are not tough for Tiktok.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T01-43-00Z/65003694_401.jpg" />TIKTOK filed a lawsuit against the Federal Court, accusing Montana's ban in unconstitutional.</p>
<p>GreggianForte, governor of Montana, officially signed legislation on the 17th of this month to prohibit Tiktok from operating in the state, saying that this move will further "protect the Mongolian people from the CCP's monitoring." After the bill takes effect early next year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全面禁止tiktok美国蒙大拿州先行一步/a-65333928"></a>Essence</p>
<p>Emily Flower, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of Montana, said on the 17th: "We expect to have legal challenges and have been fully prepared to defend the law."</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse quoted the view of the university of Richmond, CALTOBIAS, and believes that the progress of these cases should be progressing quickly because its core legal issues do not need to collect a lot of evidence.</p>
<p>"These constitutional arguments are very convincing and conducive to the prosecutor." Tobias said: "First of all, freedom of speech, and second, if the ban is based on national security as legitimacy, it is the federal government, not anything, not anything Yizhou. "</p>
<p>In 2020, the then US President Donaldtrump tried to stop downloading Tiktok and WeChat through the norms of the Ministry of Commerce, which was blocked by multiple courts and never took effect.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全盘禁止tiktok-美国民主党内有反对声音/a-65213817)It also supports American users to maintain the right to use Tiktok in order to exercise freedom of speech.</p>
<h3>Disabast</h3>
<h3>Tiktok's ban is feasible?</h3>
<p>The ban stipulates that Tiktok will not be downloaded in Montana, which means that applications such as Google and Apple are not allowed to "illegally" to provide TIKTOK. Whenever someone uses TIKTOK, whether it is "providing the ability to use this application" or "download it", TIKTOK or App Store will touch the France, which will face a fine of up to $ 10,000 a day.</p>
<p>The bill is expected to take effect on January 1, 2024, and punishment will not apply to the user.</p>
<p>The Associated Press quoted an analysis of online security experts. This ban has no incentive measures except for the fines, and no incentive measures make relevant companies willing to comply with regulations, so "full law enforcement will be very difficult."</p>
<p>In addition, compared with China's control of citizens' access to the Internet, the United States does not have any similar means or tools. The decree also excludes online service providers.</p>
<p>A member of the members included a representative of Apple and Google's trade group TechNet that the Associated Press told the Associated Press that the application store was unable to "geographical fence" in specific applications in different states, so it was impossible to prevent Tiktok from being downloaded in Montana. The organization also said that the application itself should decide the running range, not an app store.</p>
<p>Odedvanunu, the product vulnerability director of the Internet Security Corporation, also believes that it is difficult for app stores to isolate the application download of a single country. He suggested that it is more feasible to comply with the rules by Tiktok, because the application itself has the right to "adjust the settings according to the user's geographical location or IP address."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T01-43-00Z/65096240_401.jpg" />In March of this year, the chief CEO of Tiktok went to the US Congress to testify, and the hearing president has been in the past 6 hours.</p>
<h3>American Stepping Tiktok</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体不断升级的tiktok之争/a-65171272"></a>They are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform and thus requires the application of the application nationwide. However, it is not easy to face many difficulties in Montana, a Montana, which is more than 1 million; it is not easy to expand the scope of the ban to more than 150 million TIKTOK users throughout the United States.</p>
<p>March this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/抖音执行长赴美国会作证前夕-专家怎么说/a-65078532"></a>The hearing president has been in the atmosphere for nearly 6 hours. Both members of the parliament questioned that the Tiktok's parent company Bytedance will enable the Chinese government to obtain user data or affect American users in the application.</p>
<p>In this regard, TIKTOK constantly denied that it had shared data with the Chinese government and said that if it was asked, the platform would not do so.</p>
<p>At present, TIKTOK is undergoing an initiative called "Projecttexas". It wants to create an independent entity to store data from American users on the US server and operate by American technology company Oracle.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) China and India held the 18th round of military -level meetings on the border against military confrontation last month. The Indian "The Telegraph" quoted the intelligence department news on Monday (May 22) that China demanded that a 15-20 kilometer buffer was established in the conference in the conference. The prerequisites of fighting out of contact.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted intelligence officials of the "Indian -Tibet Border Police Force" (ITBP) that China hopes to set up a buffer in the DEPSANG (DEPSANG) and India's border lines in the eastern region of Ladakh. "During the negotiations, India rejected this request and agreed to set up a buffer of 3 to 4 kilometers, but China refused to make a concession."</p>
<p>An Indian Ministry of Defense officials told the newspaper that India rejected China's "unfairness" request and was negotiating to solve the problem of confrontation.</p>
<p>The ITBP official revealed to India's "Telegraph" that after the Chinese -18 -wheeled military -level meeting made a request, the Chinese side reiterated the requirements at a subsequent low -level military conference. The anonymous official said: "The Chinese army has grown 18 kilometers in India's defense line, and now she wants a buffer of 15 to 20 kilometers. Obviously, they are actively working hard to follow the actual control line of the region. , Try to build a new status quo. "</p>
<p>Ladaka has a sensitive area with sovereignty disputes in China and India. In 2019, India classified the Radak area in the Kashmir region as the central area of the central government, causing strong dissatisfaction in China; <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中印45年来首度致命冲突-印方死者升至20人/a-53836917"></a>The military confrontation has not been completely alleviated so far, and the two sides have held multiple rounds of military conference negotiations for this.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>2000 kilometers border, 120,000 square kilometers dispute</h3>
<p>The total length of the China -India border is nearly 2,000 kilometers, and there are also 120,000 square kilometers of territorial disputes. The border with territorial disputes involves three parts: Western (600 kilometers), mid -section (450 kilometers), and eastern section (650 kilometers). In May 2020, there was a conflict (mid -section) in northern Sikkim; on June 16, a soldier conflict in the Palestin Valley (western section) of China and India caused dozens of casualties, at least India, at least India, at least India. It was said that 20 soldiers died.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>McMahon Line</h3>
<p>Markma Hong Line(Mcmahonline, the eastern section line)It is a border between British India and Tibet, which is drawn by a British adventureist to measure India. In 1914, the British diplomat McMahon convened the three -party meeting of Central, India, and Tibet. Because the Republic of China did not agree to divide the McMahon line in Tibet, and the Tibetan party failed to get an independent change in advance discussion, he also gave up the recognition of the McMa red line. As a result, Tibetan did not sign the "Simra Treaty". India and Myanmar believe that the McMahon line is a historical boundary. To this day, although the People's Republic of China refused to recognize the McMahon line, it regarded it as the actual control line. In the 1962 Battle of the China -India, although the Chinese army once occupied Darwon, the area, it was later withdrawn to the north of the actual control line.</p>

<h4>The origin of conflict between the border between China and India</h4>
<h3>South Tibet (India: Arunechal)</h3>
<p>The southern Tibet is known as "Arunachalpradesh" in India, with an area of about 60,000 square kilometers and is located on the south side of the Himalayas. The west is Bhutan, Myanmar east is India, and the south is Tibet in China. China calls the south of Tibet and belongs to the administrative division of the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, according to the division of the "McMahon Line", the place belongs to India, and India also actually controls the place. However, the Tibetan side and the Republic of China refused to sign on the treaty. This route continues after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1948, India, which was just independent, began to send troops into this area. In 1960, India completely occupied the south of the wheat line, and China controlled north. In 1972, India established Arunechal's central area in the area. In 1987, the district was changed to "Arunecal Pradesh".</p>

When the Chinese army launched an offense at the same time from the east and west places on October 20 of that year, the military force was 5 to 10 times that of the Indian army. The Chinese army had been deeply deepened to India today's Arunachal and Himalayas. The entire war continued for a month, causing a total of 2,000 people to be killed. On November 20, 1962, China unilaterally announced a ceasefire and withdrew it to 20 kilometers after the McMahon line.

<p>The reporter of this station searched on Douyin. Some netizens still posted videos with strong national colors, such as the slogan in the anti -Japanese TV series: "Long live the Chinese nation, the Chinese nation will win ... Together, all the supreme glory we do today. "</p>

<p>In this regard, Ms. Zhang, a Douyin netizen, said in an interview with Radio Asia on Tuesday that the Chinese have received nationalism and so -called patriotic and Chinese education from entering kindergarten. It is good to say that the United States, the West, and Japan are good. These countries are better than China. They are all admirable. The official feels that Chongyangmei is not good. This is associated with patriotism. Some people really believe that the official speech may be. For traffic. "</p>
<p>In the Douyin comment area, some netizens posted that they hope that the government has issued policies and voluntarily marry foreigners as voluntarily abandon Chinese nationality.

<p><strong> Forbidden patriotic activities are prevented from getting out of control. </strong></p>
<p>As for why the authorities prohibit the promotion of so -called patriotism, Zheng Xuguang, a scoreer of the current affairs, told this station that in China, any action beyond officially controlled, even if it publicize "patriotism", the authorities will prohibit. For example, he said, "For example, like you initiated a rally to support the Communist Party of China in Tiananmen Square, you try it. No matter what the topic is, once it shows a strong organizational and incitement, because this exercise can easily point the finger to the party country. They are the first to be afraid that you will go to the streets, and the second is afraid that you will organize. He is not the content of your activities, but in your form and energy. "</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China in 1949, nationalism and patriotism have become an important part of political education for the people. According to Wikipedia, the "Outline of Patriotic Education Implementation" issued by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 23, 1994 and promulgated by the CPC Central Committee Committee. The following year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs determined the first batch of patriotic education bases, and many ministries and commissions such as the Central Propaganda Department and the Communist Youth League jointly released a hundred patriotic education books. Because the outline clearly stated that patriotism education is guided by the basic line of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party, it is considered by the overseas academic community to be the context of the collapse of communism.</p>

<p>(Voice of German in China) The 76th World Health Conference (WHA) was held in Geneva, Switzerland this week. The Taiwan Central News Agency reported that two reporters of the agency applied for an interview certificate in accordance with the normal process in advance and received approval. ) When he received a certificate at the Geneva Office of the United Nations, he was suddenly rejected.</p>
<p>"A few weeks ago, the Central News Agency reporter has applied for our reporter's certificate through the United Nations media application platform. When applying for a reporter's certificate, we already provide our Taiwan passport from the Republic of China. , Reporter is from the Republic of China. "One of the Central News Agency reporters Zeng Tingxuan, one of the central agencies, said:" But today we were queuing to get a certificate, and the other party felt a little puzzled. Tell us, "Sorry, although we have received the notification, we can't give you a reporter's certificate."</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, two reporters from the agency, Zeng Tingzhang and Tian Xi, applied for a reporter's certificate through the official platform a few weeks ago. Because the national fence menu did not have the "Taiwan" or "Republic of China" option, he chose "Thailand" and reminiscent of remarks. The column clearly noted that the reporter was from "Taiwan (Republic of China)" and received a license notice in mid -May, but was blocked when receiving an interview certificate.</p>
<p>Zeng Tingxuan said that the other party admitted that "receiving pressure from China" said that "WHO no longer recognizes Taiwanese passports", "the People's Republic of China tells us that we need to see Chinese passports, or Taiwanese passports and Taiwan compatriots can be released." When the reporter responded, there was no Taiwan compatriot certificate, and when he asked China how to know the application of Taiwanese reporters, the other party responded: "They (China) knows everything, I am very sorry." The reporter asked: "Do you want to report everything to China?" The other party nodded in response.</p>
<p>According to reports, the staff of the United Nations office helplessly said that I wanted to help, "But I was restricted. If you let you go in, I will be fired." The reporter appealed to the WHO office.</p>
<p>The Voice of Germany has been reported from the Central News Agency that since 2016, Taiwan can no longer participate in the World Health Conference with observer status. The reporter of the agency in Europe cannot obtain an interview certificate. However, this year is the first time that the Central News Agency reporters have completed the online application and received the approval notice, but the scene was canceled.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency stated that the fact that the incident and the Taiwan passport holders were unable to enter the United Nations New York Headquarters, showing to what extent the United Nations and its relevant agencies were infiltrated by the CCP, and the degree of obedience to Chinese officials.</p>
<p>Before the deadline, China's official response has not yet publicly responded to the allegations of "not allowing Taiwan journalists" to interview WHA.</p>
<h3>WHO Conference Focusing on the new crown "anti -epidemic model student" Taiwan missed Taiwan</h3>
<h3>Taiwan Foreign Ministry: discriminatory treatment</h3>
<p>The incident caused widespread discussion in Taiwan, questioning that the United Nations institutions have been suppressed by China and the freedom of press. According to the official website of the Central News Agency, the agency is the "National News Agency of the Republic of China". According to the Central News Agency, the agency is not an official representative. "It is just a reporter who wants the freedom of the press and the right to know that the right to know.</p>
<p>Taiwan ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed severe condemnation on the 23rd, saying that the United Nations has long rejected Taiwan media reporters to enter the United Nations field interview and report, which obviously violates the universal value and principles of fairness and justice of the UN Charter, as well as the“ World Human Rights Declaration ”. The freedom of claiming and expressing opinions, and the basic human rights through any medium, is not limited by national borders ".</p>
<p>The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the Chinese government of "pressure behind" and stated that "the United Nations Geneva branch was under pressure under China and failed to do it publicly and rejected the media in our country to interview the WHA." "It hurts the evil deeds of the people of Taiwan", and calls on the United Nations to "do not improving the unreasonable politics of a specific country."</p>
<p>In March of this year, a UN Secretary -General spokesman Stephanedujarric was asked at a routine press conference.

(Experience diagram)</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) US Semiconductor Company <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國封殺美光-美反對無事實根據的限制/a-65693360"></a>It was banned; Korean officials said on Monday (May 22) that the follow -up of Korean companies should be judged by the enterprise by themselves. In this regard, the British "Financial Times" interpreted that the South Korean government was unwilling to rush into the US -China dispute, but to rely on the decision of the company.</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reported that Zhang Yingzhen, deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry of South Korea, said that the targets of China are not Korean companies, so new measures will not cause significant damage to Korean companies; when asked if the Korean government has responded measures. How to do it, "I believe Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as a multinational company will take into account the interests of both parties to conduct comprehensive consideration."</p>
<p>"Financial Times" quoted anonymous insiders last month that the United States requested South Korea, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北京恐禁美光芯片-媒體美籲韓勿填補缺口/a-65414199"></a>; May 22 also said that the latest statement in South Korea implies that the authorities will not intervene in the matter, and will not prevent Korean enterprises from filling the vacancies in the market.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning was asked on the 22nd that how to respond to U.S. companies asks South Korean companies to "do not sell Korean semiconductors as alternatives of Micron to China." She said: "The United States coerces other countries to engage in export restrictions on China, which is completely to maintain to maintain the maintenance. Weighing the interests of our own hegemony ... We resolutely oppose this approach, and we also hope that the relevant national governments and enterprises will work together with China to jointly maintain the multilateral trading system and maintain the stable supply chain of the global industrial chain.

<h3>Meiguo has been banned from Korean companies?</h3>
<p>Micron produces dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash chip (NAND). The main competitors include South Korea's Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Japan's Kaidi Company.</p>
<p>China "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制美國北京以國安為由審查美晶片商/a-65224796"></a>"For key information infrastructure", related companies related to "key information infrastructure" stopped purchasing Micron's products; but some analysts believe that Micron's customers in China are mostly consumer electronics companies, not infrastructure suppliers, so they have not been impacted.</p>
<p>In addition, Micron does not rely on the Chinese market compared to other American companies. Bloomberg analyzed that the Chinese market in 2022 accounted for 11%of the company's revenue, NVIDIA was 21%, super micro (AMD) and Intel were 22%and 27%, Broadcom (Broadcom ) He) Qualcomm (Qualcomm) is 35%and 64%, respectively.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the news that Micron was blocked by China still caused the stock price to fluctuate. On the 22nd, it fell 5%, and eventually fell 2.8%. In contrast, the stock price of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix rose slightly, rising by 0.2%and 0.9%, respectively.</p>
<p>Reuters analysis pointed out that in the short term, Micron's competitors will benefit, but <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國突擊美企上海辦公室-掀外商憂慮/a-65447816"></a>, Also make the semiconductor industry shadow. Kim Sun-Woo (transliteration), an analyst at the South Korean investment consulting company Meritz Securities, pointed out that under the United States and middle corner, the Korean chip factory "was sandwiched in the middle and faced the troubles from all parties."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T08-20-00Z/60619140_401.jpg" />South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are the first and second -largest memory chip manufacturers in the world. Today, the wrestling of the US -China science and technology around the semiconductor industry has also caused Korean companies to be in a dilemma. (Data photo)</p>
<h3>The subtle situation in Korea</h3>
<p>Samsung, Hynix, and TSMC have all imported chip manufacturing equipment from the United States; in October last year, when the United States announced that it restricted chip manufacturing technology to China, it had given these companies for one year for exemption to allow them to obtain US equipment to continue production in China. Whether this exemption continues is still unclear.</p>
<p>Under the administration of South Korean President Yin Xiyue, South Korea has gradually moved closer to the United States, participating in a number of economic alliances led by the United States and excluding China, such as the "Chip4) and the" Indo -Pacific Economic Framework "(IPEF). However, South Korea is not like <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美日荷協議限制芯片出口中國要求澄清/a-65232052"></a>So far, it has not followed up the US chip technology export restrictions on China.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal pointed out on the 22nd that any pressure from the United States will impact Korean and Korean governments because South Korea has many investments in China. China is the largest trading partner in South Korea. Samsung and Hynix have settled factories in China. Two companies added up. A total of 22%of NAND flash chips in China produced in China.</p>
<p>"Nikkei Asia" also pointed out that the Micron incident will cause Korean companies to fall into a dilemma. Markli, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, believes that Chinese memory suppliers lack competitiveness in terms of technology and production capacity, and they are bound The replacement of Micron; however, these companies are all American allies. They are not likely that they are expanding in China regardless of the pressure of the United States and the use of Micron.</p>

<p>Description: Iraq prohibits US dollar transactions, while Saudi Arabia and the UAE plans to abandon US dollars for oil export settlement. At the same time, plans to build a new currency to bypass the US dollar are also brewing. Why is there a trend of "going to the United States" in the Middle East? This should be started with the Ukrainian war.</p>

The picture shows the protests of the Iraqi in Baghdad in February 2023 to protest the depreciation of the local currency on the local currency on the US dollar</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Who would be surprised if he wanted to buy a car or house in Iraq recently. The Iraqi government has announced a new decree to prohibit individuals or enterprises from using US dollars.</p>
<p>Usually Iraqi people are used to using US dollars when they purchase large -piece goods. Because Iraq's own currency Denar has devalued it seriously, if you want to buy a house or buy a car, people may have to carry a few hemp banknuts to pay. So they will choose to use the US dollar, as long as they are packed in a wallet.</p>
<p>For decades, the US dollar has become the best currency in the Middle East -if you do not have enough Diram (UAE currency), Danar, Rial (Saudi currency) or pound.</p>
<p>But this situation may be about to be the past. In the past few months, the political circles of a number of Middle East countries have already stated, suggesting that the dominant position of the US dollar in the region may gradually weaken.</p>
<p>In Iraq, the US government has been increasing the difficulty of entering the country in the country-they are obviously worried that too many US dollar cash will be smuggled to neighboring Iran. Essence The shortage of dollars has caused drastically fluctuating in Iraqi, which is linked to the US dollar.</p>
<p>Such turbulence has prompted the Iraqi government to issue a US dollar transaction ban recently. In February this year, it was also due to the shortage of US dollars. Iraq said that it would use RMB settlement and trade between China without using the US dollar.</p>
<h3><strong> The Middle East country is looking for alternative options </strong></h3>
<p>Earlier this year, the Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia said the country held a "open attitude" to the use of multiple currencies to settle its oil exports, including the use of euro and RMB. The UAE stated that it would cooperate with India to settle with India rupees. Last year, Egypt also announced a plan to issue RMB bonds. The country has issued government bonds that have been priced at the yen in the past.</p>
<p>In addition, some Middle East countries-Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Algeria and Barin-have expressed their desire to join the BRICS countries. The emerging country organization consisting of the first letters of English names of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa will discuss the topic of creating a new currency to make new currencies for cross-border trade settlement in June- This is the news disclosed by Russia.</p>
<p>Since 2021, the UAE has joined a project that is run by Bank for InternationalSettlements in Switzerland. The project focuses on digital cross -border payment channels that may bypass the US dollar. Thailand, Hong Kong and mainland China have participated in the project.</p>
<h3>China Accelerates the footsteps of digital RMB</h3>
<h3><strong> Is it going to end in the era of dollars? </strong></h3>
<p>The moves of the search for the US dollar alternatives have recently aroused a lot of concerns, and they have also appeared on the news headlines. An article in February of New York Times asked: Is the dominant position of the US dollar threatened? "Financial Times" wrote in March: "Be prepared to welcome a world of polar currency." Bloomberg analyzed at the end of April that "de -US dollarization is being carried out at the speed of 'amazing'."</p>
<p>This article from Bloomberg reported that the proportion of US dollars in foreign exchange reserves in various governments around the world is about 58%. This decreases significantly compared to 73%in 2001. In the late 1970s, the US dollar accounted for 85%of foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>However, most experts insist on stating that the process of going to the US dollar is far less than that of these news headlines, including in the Middle East.</p>
<h3><strong> USD still ruled the Gulf area </strong></h3>
<p>Since the 1970s, oil -producing countries in the Gulf area have been maintaining partnerships with the United States. The United States has provided security guarantee for the region, while Saudi Arabia and the UAE countries have exported oil. Except for Kuwait, most of the currencies of most Gulf countries are linked to the US dollar.</p>
<p>"A major indicator of the process of de -US dollar will be the decoupling of currency and the US dollar of these countries", and Hasanalhasan, the Middle East Political expert of the London Think Tank International Strategy Institute (IISS) See such a measure. "</p>
<p>"The keywords here are 'declaration' and 'potential intentions'", Danielmcdowell, a professor of political science at Xuecheng University in New York, was asked if the leader of the Arab country's leader indicated that the US dollar answered when the US dollar was died in the Middle East. road.</p>
<p>"The publication statement is easy, but it is much more rare to take action." He said to the Voice of Germany. "For the oil producer, such as Saudi Arabia, these statements and provocations are also a way to attract the attention of the United States. 'It may promote the interests of US policy makers to pay more attention to the interests of the Gulf countries. "</p>
<p>Macorwell does not rule out the possibility of the US dollar's dominant position. "All the empires have a day of collapse." He joked, but at present, "most of the remarks are symbolic and political. Any change we see is weak and slow."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T08-40-00Z/65663516_401.jpg" />Many Iraqi politicians complain that their country is too dependent on the US dollar</p>
<h3><strong> Ukrainian war gave birth to the US dollar? </strong></h3>
<p>All experts interviewed by Voice of Germany agreed that there were two main factors that prompted the Middle East countries to threaten the use of other currencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印俄石油交易正在削弱美元的主导地位/a-64921007"></a>Essence Macorwell believes that sanctions are a very important part of the debate. His new book, "Contrary to its way: US financial sanctions and the Bucking The Buck: us Financial Sanctions and the International Backlash Against THEDOLLAR" analysis pointed out. To use diplomatic weapons, the more its opponents need to transfer its international economic activities to other currencies. "</p>
<p>Alhasan also analyzed: "There are currently a large amount of Russian funds flowing in the Middle East and Asian countries. This is basically a country that does not comply with or does not implement the US and European sanctions."</p>
<p>but <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/博雷尔-欧盟应打击印度加工俄油卖给欧洲/a-65661947"> </a>And to upgrade to the so -called secondary sanctions, then it is more difficult to avoid sanctions. The second-level sanctions are aimed at third-party-including countries and enterprises that cooperate with the sanctions entity. Any entity who wants to continue to do business with the United States or the European Union will find it difficult for you to bypass the second -level sanctions.### <strong> Threat of oil trade </strong></p>
<p>Alhasan also proposed <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美媒称习近平年底访问沙特-石油人民币结算是否浮出水面引关注/a-63682483"></a>Essence He explained: "I think there is a feeling that the United States is trying to rewrite the global oil market-in order to target Russia-and this is a strategic threat to Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>In March of this year, Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman said that if any country tries to set the price limit on Saudi oil exports like Russia, then Saudi Arabia will no longer conduct the country with the country. trading. One day later, the Minister of Energy Algeria also concluded this statement, saying that it would be a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Professor Mariademertzis, an expert in EUI Economic Policy in Florence, Italy, believes that this is why this is also the reason for how long the sanctions are implemented and the process of de -US dollar. But all this is not an overnight thing. Even if some countries want to bypass the US dollar and replace the setting infrastructure dominated by the US dollar, it is difficult to add.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T08-40-00Z/65663534_401.jpg" />In the past few months, the political circles of multiple Middle East countries have already stated, suggesting that the dominant position of the US dollar in the region may gradually weaken</p>
<h3><strong> Bank as a weapon </strong></h3>
<p>"For example, if you are India and if you want to export products to Chile, you are likely to settle in US dollars. But the reason you do is not only because it is more convenient to use the US dollar to deny the product, but also because you use it to settle the settlement The infrastructure is based on the US dollar. "Demulqis analyzed that the so -called settlement is a legal behavior of" extracting funds from one account and depositing it into another. "</p>
<p>To complete this step, there must be a trusted infrastructure, and these are what the United States has been provided for decades. Any alternative has "major legal and political influence". Demolqi pointed out, "For example, will Chile accept India's legal framework? Even if the central banks of the two countries are going to settle bilateral settlement, it is a long process."</p>
<p>She explained that the United States and Europe frozen the Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves within its jurisdiction. This operation has made the central bank a weapon and may damage the international financial system. And Alhasan believes that this has been transformed into "a real concern, that is, the United States and the European Union adopt unprecedented ways to use international trade and finance as weapons to deal with Russia." This is why the Middle East countries are "preparing for a more polarized world, and they hope that they can maintain their actions freely within and outside the US dollar."</p>

<p>Tallas said: "In the past, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people in Myanmar and Bangladesh (in the disaster) were killed. Thanks to early warning and disaster management, these catastrophic mortality rates have now entered history."</p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization stated that although the advancement of the early warning system helps reduce casualties, economic losses caused by weather and climate -related disasters continue to rise.</p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization stated in a statement: "Economic losses have soared, but in the past half a century, early warning and progress in coordination of disaster management have greatly reduced human death and injuries." It is expected that the future related economic losses will still show an upward trend.</p>

<p>In an interview with AFP, Manoso said: "The United States and many countries worry that Russia will not comply with regulations. Russia's non -obedient rules are the core of the issue of banning martial arts organizations."</p>

<p>Brazil is unwilling to inhibit the spread of avian influenza through vaccination, because the importers are worried that importers will resist poultry products that vaccinate vaccines, making Brazil inevitably face trade barriers.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Brazil, the most exported country exporter in the world, has confirmed that eight wild birds infected infected diseases <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/world/story20230516-1395109"></a>(HPAI) case, which appeared in Rio de Janeiro, and no poultry in farms were infected.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Minister of Agriculture officially announced on Monday (May 22) that the 180 -day animal hygiene emergency state.</p>
<p>But Brazil represents Eduardocunha at the World Animal Health Organization Conference in Paris on the same day: "At present, there is no HPAI in Brazil (farm). If our epidemiological state changes, we will eventually implement vaccination ... … We strongly believe that this will cause us to face some trade barriers. "</p>
<p>If the poultry breeding field in Brazil has an outbreak of bird flu, Brazil's chicken export market worth nearly 10 billion US dollars (about S $ 13.46 billion) will face risks.</p>
<p>Cunha, director of the Department of Animal Health of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, said that Brazil exports poultry and poultry products to more than 130 countries to persuade these countries to accept vaccine products.</p>

Manas means Mongolian patrol. Many places in Xinjiang come from Mongolian, including Urumqi, and can see the impact of the Mongolians in this land in history.</p>
<p>The Manas Civil Affairs Hotel opened on the third floor of the County Civil Affairs Bureau. The second floor is a charging gym. It seems that the Civil Affairs Bureau has used most office buildings to make a profit. The phenomenon of leased revenue for this type of financial funding is quite common. The hotel room is simple and there is nothing. Fortunately, it is relatively quiet. Outside the window is a tree, and the sun flashes in the gap of the leaves.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Hanas Street is Han people and cannot see several ethnic minorities. Enter the back of the mosque. The Great Scripture was built in 2003. Seeing people said that the original old temple had a history of seventy -eight years. During the chat, the people who saw the gatekeepers were familiar with Ma Zhongying and Ma Bufang of the Northwest Hui, and they were proud of them. His name is Ma Zhongying's "Commander", which is the name of the Hui people. Next to the Hui Mosque is the Mosque of the Uighur. It has a history of hundreds of years and is being repaired. Seeing people say that the proportion of maintenance is costly, but now the government does not allow the dismantling of the old cover and requires the retaining the old. It is considered a progress.</p>
<p>Each county in Xinjiang is engaged in communities. Disassemble the old house to build a new building and implement property management. The community has lost its characteristics of the county seat, but it can vacate large land to engage in real estate development, add output value, tax and economic activities, and also add points to county officials. Therefore, the county governments must have great enthusiasm. As for the loss of cultural characteristics and the unique living environment, officials who are eager to gain profit are ignored.</p>
<p>Passing by Hutubi County the next day. Special off -car traveled in the county seat for several hours. The place name of Hutubi was imaginative, but found that it was fooled again. There are almost no traces related to nation and history. I transferred to the main streets in the urban area, and I saw a total of a family selling meals, and a man who sold milk in the residential area was a Uighur. It seems that the northern Xinjiang cities are completely the world of Han people, and ethnic minorities have been completely excluded.</p>
<p>Go to Urumqi bus. The owner is a Chinese husband and wife. The Hutubi Passenger Bus Station strictly limits overloads, and there are several inspections in the outlet. However, as soon as the car drove out of the door of the passenger station, it began to solicit passengers waiting for cars by the road, regardless of how much overloading. As soon as he went out of the county, before entering the entrance of the highway, the couple desperately arranged for all standing people to squat and shrink themselves to the smallest. At the entrance of the highway, there is a traffic police responsible for checking whether the passenger car is overloaded. His inspection method is to see the window of each passenger car below. If there is a figure in the inner aisle in the car, he instructed the parking inspection and a fine of the overloaded owner, and the overloaded passenger got out of the car. The owner two let the people who were not seated squatted down. The purpose was to prevent the police below see someone from the aisle. In addition, the female owner used the passenger's luggage to cover it in the window. However, he did not see at least a dozen people in the car, so the passenger car passed smoothly and ran on the high -speed highway.</p>
<p>This process gives me quite strange. When the passenger cars and the police are over, the distance between me and the police is less than two meters, and my seat is squatting over and after. Check. After passing the level, the car people looked very happy, and seemed to have completed a successful conspiracy. The female owner is no longer the rustic look before passing the level. She becomes kind of kindness and is kind and talks. She said that she had only four passengers when she returned from Urumqi yesterday. It seemed to be a reason to explain that she had to be overloaded.</p>
<p>Passing through Changji City, it is the capital of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture. I did n’t get off the car. From the window, I was full of the outsider image pursued by government officials. Chinese government officials have the biggest ability in this regard, and they will make everything the most interesting. The characteristics of today's era are everywhere. The whole of China seems to have only one mind, and the will, methods and languages of the mind can be seen in any corner, and even the problem is the same. Today's globalization also has the same characteristics. The difference is only one is power dominance, the other is capital -led, the other is a compulsive way, and the other is the induction method. Today's double ways are working. The space that does not occupy or give up in power is the marketization and commercialization under capital induction.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) BRUNOKAHL, director of the German Federal Intelligence Agency, believes that even after 15 months of war in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin's power still has no signs of weakening. He gave a speech at the Federal Security Policy College (BAKS) in Berlin on Monday that there was no obvious crack in the Moscow regime system.</p>
<p>Although there are some sporadic criticisms -such as supplying weapons and ammunition, there is no sign of showing that Putin's power system is shaken or collapsed from the inside. Although the possibility of this situation in the future cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>"Russia, like the past, still has the ability to fight long -distance long -term operations," Karl pointed out that they rely on the soldiers who are constantly reconciled. The same is true of arms and ammunition. So now we can't talk about weakening or collapse. Although<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯军队被高估的力量/a-63270710"> </a>, Even a surprising weakness -for example, in terms of the combat effectiveness of the army. However, if the West cannot support Ukraine with a very organized manner and coordinate against fighting, then the long -term tug -of -war and naval tactical strategies adopted by Putin may succeed.</p>

<h3>When did Germany observe that Russia is going to invade Ukraine?</h3>
<p>In a Monday speech, Carl was asked that the Federal Intelligence Agency was [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/华盛顿称俄罗斯随时可能入侵乌克兰-呼吁美国公民离境/a-60738941"></a>The person in charge of the German intelligence agency replied: "About 14 days before the start of the war, we also observed that there are some other interpretations except for war preparation." <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯出兵乌克兰-引发全球股市震荡/a-60898151"></a>Some criticisms pointed out that intelligence agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom earlier predicted Russia's invasion plan earlier than the German Federal Intelligence Agency. Carl refuted that the United States and Britain's colleagues used some phenomena as indicators to judge the chance of the outbreak of the war. However, the German Federal Intelligence Agency attaches more importance to that all invasive decisions are eventually made by Putin. The owner of the Kremlin palace is based on many factors, "These do not rely on the number of rockets or tanks to analyze it."</p>
<h3>How does the German industry rely on China?</h3>
<h3>"It takes time to de -risk to China policy"</h3>
<p>When talking about China, Carl said that Germany should reduce dependence on China, but also warned people not to imagine that it would happen overnight. "This cannot be carried out in a destructive way, not something that can be completed overnight," he emphasized in the lecture of the Federal Security Policy Academy. The Federal Intelligence Agency does not advocate that Germany is completely decoupled with China, which will cause losses to German companies. He at the same time <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体对华政策的转折点/a-65700674"></a>The Federal Intelligence Agency Director Karl believes that Germany's current 5G communication network legislation is enough. He believes that it is wise to introduce the so -called "Huawei Act" to fully ban this Chinese network equipment supplier. He added that as an alternative, people can "identify and remove risk components with risks on key infrastructure" and "there is a possibility of legislative in this regard." There is a voice in the German Federal House call for more stringent restrictions.</p>

"The basic national conditions of China" should actively respond to this phenomenon. At the same time, the Economic Observation Network stated that the long -term population of population means that the overall growth of the economy will inevitably slow down, but the problem of "not rich first" in China's population structure needs to be paid more attention. The State Council of China issued the "Opinions on Promoting the Construction of the Basic Pension Service System" on the 21st, and formulated the goal of achieving the basic pension service system in 2025. Economic Observation Network said in related articles that according to the definition of academics, the proportion of Chinese aging population exceeded 14%in 2021, and it has become a standard aging society. China's per capita GDP was about $ 12,700 in 2022, and it is still at the level of medium -income countries, and has not yet reached the level of high -income national standards. Based on the early arrival of the turning point of the population, the article quotes the concerns of scholar Cai Yan, that is, the Chinese economy may face the problem of "slow, rich, fast and old": aging will intensify by the expected amplitude, and economic growth may also slow down from the expected amplitude deceleration. Essence The article pointed out that the structure of China's labor population will appear in the next period of "two ends, weak in the middle", and the increase in the proportion of young people will increase employment pressure. One of the reasons for up to 20.4%. Decreased population growth and the acceleration of the labor age "The era of relatively loose employment situation in China has ended", because the structural contradictions of the population are more prominent. The article also emphasized that in the middle and long term, in 2035, China's labor population (18-60 years old) will decrease by 10%, and by 2050, it will decrease by 35%. The aging will increase at the same time. By 2050, it is expected that the average age of the Chinese will exceed 50 years, which is 12 years higher than now. The decline in labor population and increased support ratio brought about by aging and declining childization means that "increasing social security investment is imperative."

In order to escape the follow -up of the National Security, he deliberately did not take the train and went to Beijing in other ways to go to Beijing to apply for a certificate at the Tongzhou District Entry -Exit Authorization Bureau.</p>

<p>In December 2016, Jiang Tianyong went to Changsha, Hunan to visit the lawyer who was arrested for the "709 Capture" and was monitored by public security; he was later charged with "inciting subverting the crime of state power" for two years.</p>
<p><strong> In the past year, Jiang Tianyong has been closely monitored by the authorities. </strong></p>
<p>Since its release in February 2019, Jiang Tianyong has been living in Xinyang's parents' house. To implement monitoring, the authorities set up small houses outside his house. Although the deprivation of political rights has expired three months ago, the authorities did not let him go.</p>

<p>Pan Jiawei, a researcher at the University of Tokyo, Japan, said that Jiang Tianyong's encounter reflected the randomness of Chinese law.</p>
<p>Pan Jiawei: "The authorities do not need to explain according to any law. For the victims and their families, they are unsatisfactory.

<p>After returning to the United States, he studied politics at Harvard University with a scholarship and received a doctorate in 1954. Later, he taught in Harvard and became a well -known expert in the international political field. In 1969, Nixon appointed it as a safety consultant. After that, he also served as Secretary of State. Under the Nixon's successor Ford, he still played the position of Secretary of State.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-23T12-25-00Z/60857225_401.jpg" />Kissinger went to China in 1971 to pave the way for Nixon to visit China the following year (pictured)</p>
<h3>A secret visit to China</h3>
<p>Kissinger frequently exchanged between the capitals of various countries with the so -called "shuttle diplomacy" and mediation between the conflict.</p>
<p>1971, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格警告美中冲突风险/a-62875163"></a>Passing Pakistan to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格警告中美冷战将带来世界末日般威胁/a-57397429"></a>A secret interview and meeting with the then Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai to prepare for Nixon's visit to China in the next year. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格美中战争将是一场难以言状的灾难/a-58226239"></a>It was officially established on January 1, 1979.</p>
<p>Kissinger also worn the needle to lead the needle in the secret negotiation of the former Soviet Union to successfully achieve the first round of restrictions on strategic weapons negotiation (SAL I). In addition, from 1973 to 1974, he also mediation also mediated the end of the Fourth Middle East War.</p>

<h3>controversy: Cambodia was bombed and the coup in Chile</h3>
<p>For many people, Kissinger is still considered a diplomatic wizard so far, however, this is only the historical side. Critics believe that he is a moral power politician, and he will also support the dictators as long as he meets his interests. In an interview in 1972, he compared himself to a denim, and he was charged with a single shot. Later, he regretted this statement.</p>
<p>In many wars and crises, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格八十大寿毁誉参半/a-879657"></a>At least it is doubtful. For example, Vietnam War: It is said that in 1968, Kissinger prevented a nearly reached peace agreement to help Nixon win. In 1973, he reached a peace agreement with Bei Vietnam's negotiating representative Le Ductho after years of secret negotiations. Both won the Nobel Peace Prize, but the war continued until 1975. Rideshou refused to receive the prize. Kissinger later wanted to return the prize.</p>
<p>Another controversy is that Kissinger secretly bombed the specific role of Cambodia in the Vietnam War. Critics accused him of the consequences of his behavior. In addition, the bloody invasion of Indonesia's bloody invasion against East Timor in 1975 was also a stain in Kissinger's diplomatic career. In 1973, Kissinger was allegedly involved in the bloody coup of Chilean General Pinoches to the National Presidential President.</p>
<p>In an interview with a US television station, he was asked about the bombing of Cambodia. Kissinger expressed anger, saying that the theme of the interview was his 100th birthday, and what he asked was what happened 60 years ago.</p>
<p>After Nixon's resignation, Kissinger continued to serve as Secretary of State until Democratic President Carter worked in 1977. However, he did not disappear from the public perspective. Instead, he established a consulting company and published a number of books. He was still invited to the guests at the time of his age and analyzed the foreign policy.</p>

<p>Many public opinion criticized the Chinese government's excessive response, but the Chinese political blogger "Lonely Smoke Twilight Cicada" said on Sina Weibo and Twitter on the 17th that in the United States, if the talk show actor tells the jokes involved in soldiers, the consequences are also very serious. Essence</p>
<p>Asian facts investigation of the laboratory found that the examples pointed out by Suman smoke and Twilight Cicada are indeed a matter, but only some of them are true. The United States did have a talk show actor because of the jokes involved in the U.S. military, which caused controversy, criticism and discussion, but it was not under administrative fines and criminal case investigation by government administrative fines.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis:</strong></p>
<p><strong> One million words </strong> **</p>
<p>"Excellent style and can win the battle." These eight words, each worth more than 1.83 million yuan -for the Chinese talk show actor House, he was a performance of "disaster from the mouth" for a while, so that he made himself The affiliated company has suffered heavy economic losses, but administrative penalties are only the beginning of various consequences.</p>

<p>What exactly did House say, "Is it seriously insulting the People's Army"? According to the online [] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWO5rsepI2U"></a>, Asian facts check the laboratory festival and sort out the word -by -word narrative as follows:</p>
<p>"We picked up two wild dogs from a mountain near home. (The audience laughed), we are not helping them, because they do not need our rescue on the food chain on the mountain .... These two dogs they It is indeed the top of the food chain on the mountain. I saw them for the first time. I felt that I was not watching two dogs. It was the shooting scene of the animal world. Two dogs chased a squirrel and fired like a shell. You usually see some dogs, you will feel very cute, your heart will be melted, you will think of these words; when I see these two dogs, only eight big characters flashes in my heart: 'Good style, can win the battle' (The audience laughed, applauded) 'very excellent'. I hold these two dogs on the streets of Shanghai. "</p>

Xiao Guo Culture Hurry up <a href="https://weibo.com/pc233"></a>It was recognized that this was an "inappropriate metaphor" and immediately apologized, and stopped house's work endlessly.

<p>After the incident, there were many criticisms in China and abroad that the government had excessive response, but some people supported the government's disposal, including Sina Weibo bloggers with nearly 7 million fans, "Lonely Smoke Twilight Cicada". In a post, she said that even if it was the United States, there was a red line that could not humiliate soldiers. She cited the well -known American TV show "Saturday Night Live" (SNL) in 2018. Dan Crenshaw, a discharged actor Pertdavidson, who was elected by the Republican Republicans, was elected as a killer in pornographic films. It was also resisted by millions of netizens, and officials also appeared to call on Davidson.</p>
<p>Caren Shaw lost his right eye while serving in Afghanistan in the U.S. Navy. Davidson made a joke with his injuries due to public injuries. It did cause uproar. Both parties had politicians condemned. Publicly requires the production unit to expel Davidson.</p>
<p>This post on social media such as Weibo caused discussions. Some netizens commented on this, "people who tout the freedom to the United States will never mention that there are also bottom lines in the United States."</p>
<p>Asian facts check the laboratory verification, the "serious consequences" experienced by the American talk show actor is not the same as the administrative and criminal penalties faced by House and Xiao Guo.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-23T15-22-40-04-00/000001.png" />After Davidson and Caren, the show was on the show after the controversy and jokes, and continued to solve the previous controversy with a joke. (/Youtube screenshot) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05232023151602.html/in-text-pic-davidson-and-crenshaw.png"></a>Cran Shaw also took the opportunity of this dispute to educate and call on the American people not to find a consensus in different opinions because of the different political stance. He also mentioned that Davidson's father was the "911" incident. The sacrificed firefighters, in order to call on the American people to understand how to forgive them, and to forget the country for the country, the police, and the consumer.</p>
<p>Davidson is not the only case for the US military joke. Another American talk show Billburr also questioned in offline performances in 2018, the hero's status of American soldiers. At that time, he was looking at the fighter aircraft take -up and landing instructor on the aircraft carrier, and he realized that such a job was just like "the" Warrior One "posture of yoga exercises", and the same paragraph also caused controversy.</p>
<p>Some audiences should respect the soldiers directly at the scene, but there are also audiences who are veterans to let Bor finish the words, and Bor not only did not pay, but also appeared on the show afterwards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCaljpu1bW4"></a>Critical critics, don't want to use patriotic flags to accuse him of hating the United States.</p>
<p>Although Bor also often caused controversy in topics such as feminism, he still has the opportunity to perform, and he also hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lToQkB1UdAI&amp;t=16s"></a>Essence</p>
<p>US government agencies have no ability to investigate or directly punish companies or individuals because of a criticism of an official. Where the boundaries of this type of cultural performance are still determined by the laughter of the market and the audience in the context of different times.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>"Then you still ..."(The words of whataboutlism) are often used by many Chinese opinion leaders to criticize the American "different" argumentation skills, but in the example of Xiaoguo Culture and Li Haoshi this time, solitary smoke and twilight cicadas involve soldiers with US talk shows involving soldiers. For example, for reference, it deliberately not mentioned that the US government's public power will not punish the content of the performance, let alone call judicial investigations.

<p>TNT reporter Chris Haynes quoted NBA sources in a tweet that James "considered" retreat.</p>
<p>After the Lakers defeated, James said vaguely at the press conference after the game that he intends to spend some time to think about the next step, causing the outside world to speculate on his future plan.</p>
<p>When asked about his views this season, James said that this season is deeply "challenging." James has become the NBA historical scoring king this season, leading the Lakers to the partition championship.</p>
<p>Denver's gold block defeated the Lakers 113-111 on the 22nd, and James scored 40 points in this game. He said, "I don't know. I think it's okay. I don't want to say that this is a successful year, because at this time in my career, I just fought to win the championship."</p>
<p>"I will not be excited because of the reign of the partition championship. I have already scored a lot. For me, it is not fun to miss the championship."</p>
<p>"But let's take a look, let's talk about it again. Let's take a look at the next. I don't know. Frankly, I still have to think about it. To be honest, I have to think about it again."</p>
<p>"As far as I personally, whether to continue playing basketball, I still have to think about it."</p>
<p>James renewed with the Lakers for two years last August and will stay until 2024-2025.</p>
<p>James has always hoped to be at the same time as his son Bronnyjames. Brownie will play for the University of Southern California to participate in the Men's Basketball League in the United States in the next season. He is expected to enter the NBA in the 2024-2025 season.</p>

Among them, there are many videos of primary school students who "sing praise" for Chinese National Day and wearing camouflage uniforms in young children.</p>

Of course, this is the consistent brainwashing education of the Chinese Communist Party. Extension. "</p>
<p>He told this station that in the past, many Chinese parents did not hesitate to send their children to international schools, and they hope that children can receive "relatively normal" education. However, these international schools that should have educated students' universal value, or the gap that the CCP is regarded as ideology, forced them to become the accomplice of the CCP brainwashing education, making Chinese school children nowhere to escape.</p>

<p>** "Education Business" with a famous British school signboardAccording to the British "Daily Mail" report, these British private schools have been required to use the official history, geography, and ideological and moral courses of ideas.

Geographical textbooks say that Taiwan is a province in China and "the sacred territory of the motherland". Governance for the people. "</p>
<p>According to the information of this station, according to China's "Regulations on Sino -foreign Cooperation Schools", Chinese and foreign cooperative schools must "implement China's education policy, meet China's public ethics, and must not harm China's national sovereignty."

<p>These British private schools must implement the CCP ideological education, but Ma Jian, a Chinese writer in Britain, believes that British private schools will still make money in China "with the signboards of famous British schools", and Chinese parents will continue to take their children to international schools On the one hand, it highlights wealth and status, and on the other hand, it also allows children to better connect foreign universities. He believes that the more important point is that parents who have the ability to send their children to private schools are mostly benefited from the Chinese system and will not resist the CCP's ideology.</p>
<p>Ma Jian said: "Chinese parents may also be Xi Jinping's fans. They only think that the West is good and can make their children be better educated, but they are completely unacceptable for political views, democracy, freedom, and human rights. They have benefited from this system, and they will become the guardians of this system. "</p>
<p>Ma Jian said that he knew many British people who lived in China and also sent their children to international schools. He was worried that after the brainwashing of these foreign children, he would become the "spokesperson" of the CCP overseas in the future.</p>
<p>BENEDICTROGERS, the founder of Human Rights Organization, London's human rights organization "Hong Kong Supervision", believes that even if a British institution is running in China, it should teach students' freedom, democracy, and human rights as in the UK. And if they are forced by the Chinese government to compromise and must follow the Chinese Communist Party's education model, they should withdraw from the Chinese market.</p>
<p>He was worried that these British institutions rely on Chinese business too much or let Chinese partners affect their decisions in the long run and may even affect the education of these universities in the UK.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-23T15-38-32-04-00/000000.png" />Cao Xun's "Fatty Freedom" (also known as "Errine Scholar") cover and profile <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/huping/hp-05232023145825.html/@@images/image"></a>Screenshot of Citizenship <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/huping/hp-05232023145825.html/@@stream"></a>In the literary works describing the 1989 Democratic Games and the "June 4th" massacre, Cao Xun's "Deadly Freedom" (also known as "Errine Scholar") has its unique features. This autobiographical novel was widely praised after the launch of the 30th anniversary of the "June 4th". Recently, I re -read this book, with a lot of emotions and imagination.</p>
<p>The book "Fortune Freedom" has a long time span, the scene changes greatly, the events are complicated, and the characters are complicated. The author combines his personal experience with the changes of the times, and witnessed the huge changes in history from a personal perspective.</p>
<p>Cao Xuyun was born in Hukou County, Jiangxi. He studied in Jiujiang Teachers College. After graduation, he was unwilling to be in the dull and mediocre system. In the spring of 1989, Cao Xuyun left Hainan all the way north to Beijing and was catching up with the Tiananmen School of Studies. Cao Xunyun immediately devoted himself to exercise, and became the head of the Chinese people from all walks of life in the square that promoted the army to Beijing. He personally participated in the hunger strike and witnessed the "June 4th" slaughter.</p>
<p>There are two highlights of "Fatal Freedom". One is the on -site testimony of the "June 4th" massacre, and the other is the writing of the author's personal growth, especially the journey of mind. Democratic Wall's senior democratic movement, Ren Takamo, met with the author at Tiananmen Square on the eve of the "June 4th" and wrote a preface for this book. Wu Hongsen, a famous critic and author Jiangxi Jiujiang Division, wrote a post for this book.</p>
<p>The last chapter and 5 of "Deadly Freedom" recall the old people 30 years later. Cao Xuyun narrated the story and ending of dozens of old people. The author wrote: "Some of the vivid scenes of that year gradually blurred. The lively figures of that year were gradually drifting away. Some of them, some mediocre, some expensive Qingxiang, some cheap dogs, some of them, some people are full of people, some grievances, some are still struggling, and some are treating injuries ... ".</p>
<p>Yeah, a "June 4th", how many people have changed the fate!How many people left the original track and took another way; how many people seemed to be on the original road, but the mentality and mentality were very different, and it turned into another person.</p>
<p>For our generation of Chinese, major historical incidents like "June 4th" are not the first time. The Cultural Revolution is once and the reform is once again. There are very few such people in ancient and modern China and foreign countries. In more than half a century, they have experienced so many such big changes.</p>
<p>Contemporary China has a huge change and frequent changes. When we look back on the past and try to give us a overall description of our past few decades of life, we found that our lives are so separated and lacking. It is a few short stories that are not connected to each other: Except for the characters in it, everything is changing, from scenes to vocabulary. Our mentality, our concepts, our status and situation in society, and the attitude and way of treating each other, have repeatedly changed.</p>
<p>So I often think that I often look forward to having such a novel or script, and write down several classmates in a certain class in a certain school, a classmate society in 65 years, a classmate society in 75 years, 85 years, 95 years, 95 The classmates of the year, 2005, or 15 years are still those people, but their respective thinking and mood have changed. Some persistence and evasion, forge ahead and depression, friendship, love, betrayal and betrayal, rising and ups and downs, highlights and darkness. At different ages, the topics of everyone will talk very differently. The respective values will be different, and the tone of each other will be very different. Even the popular vocabulary will be very different. But there are some kind of changes in such changes. Through these complex changes and constant changes, it can deeply reveal humanity and reveal the times.</p>
<p>"The country is unfortunately a poet, and the words of vicissitudes are working." Our cultural person knowledge person has contributed such a huge system to be worthy of our time, worthy of our struggle, and worthy of our suffering. Through this historical review and reflection, we discover and create our future.</p>

Her life was dying because of torture and abuse. In the Lunar New Year in 2022, she was arrested again. This was 3 days before the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The police rushed into our house and found the relevant Falun Gong's books.

<p>Regarding the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, MPs of Billy Rakis called on the US government and Congress to take action: "The United States and the United States should pass a firm signal to defend basic human rights together. Freedom of belief should be protected worldwide. The United States is a free country. We have the responsibility and obligation to do this. No one should be intimidated, driven away from the land of the ancestors, detained, or even murder because of faith. We should not be afraid of the Chinese government, but should ask China to bear the responsibility of infringement of human rights. "</p>
<p>Simon Zhang called on the US government to sanction Chinese officials who persecute Falun Gong practitioners: "Many Chinese police and officials are afraid of being sanctioned because if they are sanctioned, their children cannot come to the United States to study, and they cannot immigrate to the United States after retirement. They will also lose the property of the United States. Therefore, I hope that the US government can sanction these Chinese officials. "</p>

<p>India is the most populous market in the world, and it can compete with China's increasingly increasingly increased military, diplomatic, and economic influence. The Australian government is greatly attracted and is trying to show it to India.</p>
<p>In the shout of "Modi!Modi!Modi!", Angonis introduced Modi to the Indian Australians with the title of "Dear Friends" and praised Modi to make Australia "stronger, more more tolerate".</p>
<p>Anganis said that he saw the last stage on this stage the American rock singer Bruce Springer, but "he was not as popular as Prime Minister Modi."</p>
<p>Angonis smiled and called Modi with the nickname "The Boss" of Brucestine, boasting that they had met 6 times in the past six months.</p>
<p>This is an unusual personal support for Modi. Modi, who will strive for re -election next year, is a nationalist leader. He is criticized for democratic retreat and discrimination against non -Indianism.</p>
<p>When Modi responded to Angonis's praise, it enumerated the common preferences of many people in series, from crickets to curry, yoga to TV show cheff (Masterchef), and pointed out: "The most important cornerstone in Indian -Australia relations is the cornerstone is the cornerstone is the cornerstone is the cornerstone of Australia. Trust and respect each other. "</p>
<p>Modi has visited the first Australian visit since he took office yesterday in 2014. Behind each other's compliments, there are rational strategies and political considerations.</p>
<p>When Australia, in the face of increasingly tough China, it is also looking for economic and political partners in the turbulent regional relations.</p>
<p>India's economic performance has been undulating because of some wrong policies. But hundreds of millions of people got rid of poverty.</p>
<p>Ianhall, a professor of international relations at Griffith University of Brisbane, told AFP: "What we have jointly seen in this co -monument is the integration of Australia and India's domestic and foreign policies."</p>
<p>Hall said: "Both leaders are seeking funds and support. They are centered on Indian diasporas scattered in Australia and use the advantages of bilateral cooperation."</p>

Some scholars have pointed out that the phenomenon of reporting has been in the past political movements in China, and this time the "laughter incident" was resolved, it was another political expression.</p>

<p>In the middle of this month, a Chinese talk show caused a sensation in public opinion. Netizens uploaded the performance video clip of House, a talk show actor of the Guo Culture on May 13, showing that Li Haoshi ridiculed in the performance. He picked up two wild dogs from the mountain. When he saw the wild dog chasing pine squirrels, " I just want to say eight characters in my heart: excellent style, can win the battle. "</p>
<p>The discussion of netizens caused by these eight words once rushed on Weibo hot search. Some netizens believe that "this is an insult to the people of the people's children" and "this manuscript is not appropriate, and it can be joked with nothing."</p>
<p>As soon as the incident came out, although Li Haoshi and Xiao Guo culture issued an apology statement for the first time, it still attracted a number of official media. On the afternoon of the 16th, Xinhua News Agency's Weibo official number posted: "'Listening to the party's command, can win the battle, and excellent style', each word cannot be offended!" The People's Daily also released a comment on the same day, "One -sided pursuit of laughter fruit and At the expense of stepping on the line, you caught up with a misunderstanding. "</p>
<p>With the fermentation of public opinion in the past few days, Li Haoshi and the smiling fruit culture company belonged to the relevant departments by Chinese netizens. The Beijing and Shanghai Cultural Tourism departments immediately involved in the investigation, and the police quickly followed up.</p>
<p>Wang Juntao, a Chinese political scholar in the United States, said in an interview with this station that reporting itself is not a problem, and Western democratic countries also generally have a "whistle" system. However, in China, whether the punishment mechanism after reporting can follow laws and regulations is the focus.</p>
<p>"I think the report is not a problem. The main problem is persecution. In the rule of law society, all reporting materials must be disclosed in the procedure and approved. The two parties must debate. Based on. "He said," Under the dictatorship of Xi Jinping in China and the Communist Party, they regard the safeguarding the preservation of the regime and dictatorship as the standard of the right and non -standards, and the persecution of citizens does not follow the procedures for public and reasonable China Criminal Procedure Law. "</p>
<p>The police of Beijing Chaoyang District reported on the 17th that "the plot of serious insults of the people's army during the performance for actor Li Moumou (male, 31 years old), a cultural company actor Li Moumou (male, 31 years old), which caused bad social impact. "</p>
<p>At the same time, the Beijing Municipal Cultural Tourism Bureau also announced an administrative penalty on Swordsman Culture on the same day. It confiscated more than 1.32 million yuan in illegal income and fined more than 12.25 million yuan. The personnel and its performance brokerage agencies and the operating units operated by the performance field "further accountable in accordance with laws and regulations." The relevant Shanghai municipal departments also announced that they were discussed simultaneously and severely trained the company involved in the first time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-23T16-05-00-04-00/000001.png" />On May 17, 2023, the notice of canceling the performance of Xiaoguo Company was canceled outside a theater of Shanghai. (Agencelet) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/jw-05232023101542.html/afp.jpeg"></a>After the official shot, the former editor -in -chief of the party media "Global Times", Hu Xijin posted on Weibo, supporting Xiao Guo culture. He wrote: "Is the culture of the Chinese People's Liberation Army challenged? I don't think it!" But this time, Hu Xijin's public opinion guidance work was collectively discussed by many netizens. Later, Hu Xi changed his stance to change his tone to support the punishment of laughing fruit culture. He also said that "the bottom line will pay a heavy price!"</p>
<p>Hu Ping, editor -in -chief of the honorary editor -in -chief of overseas political journals living in New York, USA, told the station that the authorities were strictly, fast, and re -handled the reports of Li Haoshi and Swordsman culture, and released a dangerous signal in China today.</p>
<p>"This incident is a very dangerous signal, that is, the authorities must strengthen the text prison and strengthen the crime of language. Using the so -called masses to disclose, it will cause a wider fear effect. This is no stranger to us as the person in the Cultural Revolution." He said, "Things have now reached this step, in this sense, it is completely the deadly repetition of the practice of the Cultural Revolution."</p>
<p>However, Hu Ping believes that the political high pressure of the Cultural Revolution for ten years directly caused the liberation of ideological liberation in the later system, which is currently concerned by Xi Jinping authorities. He said: "Now Xi Jinping is going to re -engage in this set, it will definitely evoke many painful memories of the humanities revolution, and many people will resist this approach."</p>
<p>The news disclosed by the Internet on the Internet shows that the personal information of the "laughter incident" reporter is also exposed by netizens, and it is also questioned and attacked by many netizens.<strong> Reporting the most prosperous Cultural Revolution: the collective trauma of a generation </strong></p>
<p>Under political high pressure, the reporting behavior seems to be the sequelae since the establishment of the Communist Party of China. During the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, the incidents of their children and couples that caused their deaths to cause their families to be broken. Under the harsh political oppression, everyone has become an eternal trauma for a generation since everyone is in danger.</p>
<p>China ’s official Media’ s Daily Online has reproduced an interview report from the Beijing News, telling that a Red Guard in the Cultural Revolution reported his mother and was shot after being shot.</p>
<p>In this report, Zhang Hongbing, who has become a lawyer of Beijing Bosheng Law Firm, tells his wishes. In 1970, Zhang Hongbing's mother, Fang Zhongmou, said at home with some remarks that supported Liu Shaoqi and criticized Mao Zedong, and was reported by Zhang Hongbing. Fang Zhongmou's remarks were characterized as "anti -revolutionary" and were shot dead two months later. In 1980, the case of Fang Zhongmou was rehabilitated. At that time, the court ruled that "the killing was unjust, and Zhao Xue should be given."</p>
<p>Zhang Hongbing said, "At that time, everyone was wrapped in a kind of atmosphere, and they couldn't run. The kindness, beauty in my human nature was completely and irreparable." It was tortured by the inner pain and applied to the relevant departments since 2011. I hope that the mothers' cemeteries are cultural relics, but they have not been successful.</p>
<p>Zhang Hongbing emphasized that the disclosure of the painful experience was to hope that people remember the cruelty of the history.</p>
<p>Chen Chuangchuang, the executive chief of the Chinese Democratic Party Committee and a lawyer in New York, pointed out that China's reporting phenomenon did not begin with the Cultural Revolution, but the Cultural Revolution was the most prosperous.</p>
<p>"Reporting this atmosphere, environment, habits, or even culture, is not just to have the Cultural Revolution. This does not allow you to be peaceful in any private small environment. In the performance of the entire political system, loyalty is the most important. This loyalty is just a personal loyalty to Xi Jinping. In the past few years, Xi Jinping is very concerned about improving the image of the soldiers. In fact, he just wants the army to play Taiwan for him. It becomes more sensitive. "</p>
<p>Chen Chuangchuang believes that, in view of the Chinese public opinion environment under Xi Jinping, the results of the "laughter incident" are not optimistic, and Li Haoshi himself may also face unreamulated persecution.</p>

The left -wing league said that the "last battle" has not yet arrived, suggesting that it will seek a second round of elections.

Sacraropu will authorize Ziplas to try to form a pavilion at 8 am (at 4 pm Singapore time) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The second round of elections will adopt the "floating ratio reward seat system" that has been revised in 2020, that is, the maximum effective voting ratio ratio is greater than or equal to 25%, and 20 reward seats can be obtained. 40%can get a maximum of 50 reward seats, thereby increasing the possibility of a separate cabinet that won the election. All political parties are qualified to run again.</p>

Does Xie Feng, 59, go to Washington and take office. Does it mean that China's policy of US policies will change?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/bx-01122023101347.html"><strong> The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is expected to be the ambassador to the United States? </strong></a><strong> Xie Feng as a signal of the Chinese ambassador to the United States, the ease of relations between the two countries? </strong></p>
<p>Xie Feng worked at the United States of the North American Oceania Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China. Later, he went to the Chinese Embassy in the United States in 2000 and held a number of positions there. In 2008, Xie Feng served as the ambassador to the Chinese Embassy in the United States. In 2010, he became the director of the North American Oceania Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China. In 2021, he served as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China.</p>
<p>Bonnieglaser, Director of the Indian Program in Washington, Washington, DC, said in an interview with this station that Xie Feng was different from the previous Chinese ambassador Qin Gang. She said: "Xie Feng has been dealing with the United States for a long time. He is an expert who has been responsible for American affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Qin Gang has no strong background in the United States and China. So I think this is a one Important differences. "</p>
<p>In the video meeting between the US President Biden Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last November, Xie Feng attended as a participant. In recent years, Xie Feng has also exchanged and meet with representatives of the American industry, overseas Chinese, and local states many times. The US "Wall Street Journal" reported that Xie Feng became the Chinese ambassador to the United States "may release a signal", that is, under the recent series of diplomatic frictions, "the Chinese government is still willing to improve communication."</p>
<p>Qin Gang, the last ambassador to the United States in China, has left him on January 2 this year. Ge Laiyi said that since China has not sent the ambassador to the United States for several months, this has hindered the communication between the US -China governments to some extent. She said: "There is a Chinese ambassador to discuss the various progress that happened, and meet with ordinary public, talk to think tanks, and talk to other states to talk to the business community. This is important."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-23T16-18-00-04-00/000001.png" />On May 23, 2023, the new Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng arrived at Kennedy International Airport, New York. (Reuters) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/sc-05232023124015.html/2023-05-23t183957z_1223711575_rc2i41aqs9uq_rtrmadp_3_usa-china-ambassador.jpg"></a><strong> Scholars' point of view: Ambassador is an executor and not the decision to policy </strong></p>
<p>Ge Laiyi also pointed out that the role that the ambassador can actually play is limited: "Ambassador can help set a positive tone for the relationship between the two countries, but the ambassador does not really make a decision to make relevant policies. This is not the ambassador's ambassador Role. He will be an executor, but he can still have a positive or negative effect on the relationship. "</p>
<p>According to several media reports, Xie Feng had previously established a solid relationship with the former Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the Chinese Embassy in the United States and became Yang Jiechi's relatives. During the 2019 Hong Kong Removal Sports Movement, Xie Feng, a special agent of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, was appreciated by high -level appreciation for "daring to fight". In addition, when Xie Feng accompanied Latin America and the Caribbean National Envoy to Xinjiang in 2021, he expressed his tough diplomatic position, saying "Anti -China forces to disrupt Xinjiang, provocate the contradictions between religious nations, destroy China's stability, curb China's development, and carefully. Designed a 'full industry chain' from the manufacture of lies to launching attacks. "</p>
<p>Wang Dan, head of the "Dialogue China" think tank in Washington, USA, believes that Xie Feng's appointment as a Chinese ambassador to the United States cannot be judged as a signal of eased relations between the United States and China. He said: "After Xi Jinping is re -elected, (diplomatic attitude) has basically become Xi Jinping's attitude. What kind of person he changes to be an ambassador, I don't think it can be regarded as some political signals, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part, the main part. Still see Xi Jinping's attitude. "</p>
<p>Wang Dan said that in the context of Xi Jinping adopting a confrontation and competitive strategy with the United States, even if a relatively mild diplomat was originally milder, she would "change the sheep to fight the wolf." He said: "We have seen such experience like this in the past. I believe Xie Feng will follow the same way."</p>
<p>The reporter also sent an email to the Chinese Embassy in the United States, hoping that the other party would comment on the impact of China's foreign policy on US foreign policy on the Chinese ambassador to the United States. The Chinese embassy in the United States did not comment on the incident in the response email, and said: "We will publish relevant news in time. Please pay attention to our museum website and the official social media platform."</p>

<p>Xie Feng, the new Chinese ambassador to the United States, arrived in the United States on Tuesday (23rd). He said that he would seek to strengthen Sino -US cooperation, but bilateral relations are facing severe challenges.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Xie Feng told reporters after arriving at the Kennedy International Airport on New York on the 23rd: "I come here to protect China's interests. This is my sacred duty."</p>
<p>Xie Feng also said, "I am also the messenger of the Chinese people, so I come here to strengthen exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States." But he also acknowledged that the relationship between the United States and China faces "serious difficulties and challenges."</p>
<p>Xie Feng, 59, previously served as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China and was responsible for supervising the policies against the United States.</p>
<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller(Matthew Miller)At a regular press conference on Tuesday, the United States welcomed Xie Feng's arrival. He said: "We look forward to cooperating with the Ambassador and its team. As we said on many occasions, we are still committed to maintaining communication channels with the People's Republic of China to manage competition responsibly."</p>
<p>Xie Feng's former Qin Gang was promoted to Foreign Minister at the end of last year, and the position of ambassador to the United States has been vacant. The arrival of Xie Feng may help Beijing to avoid being criticized for being ignored by the Bayeng government to increase contact.</p>
<p>Qin Gang told the US ambassador to China this month that the relationship between stability is very important. US -China relations continued to deteriorate after the Chinese spy balloon incident. Biden once expressed his hope to talk to Chinese leaders Xi Jinping, but it has not been fruitful. Last Sunday, Biden said at the news session after the Seventh National Group's summit that the relationship with China would soon be "thawed."</p>

<p>Zhao Taiyong, director of the National Security Office of South Korea, said that North Korea may launch "Military Reconnament Satellite No. 1" in the near future.</p>
<p>Yonhap News Agency reported that Zhao Taiyong put forward the above views on a program of Yonhap News Agency's TV on Tuesday (May 23). He said that if the DPRK launch a reconnaissance satellite, we will further strive to make North Korea more isolated from international diplomacy, and call on the international community to effectively implement sanctions on North Korea. It will also adopt unilateral sanctions from North Korea. He emphasized that it is more important to make North Korea clearly realize that he can no longer have a sense of existence in the international community with acts such as stars and nuclear tests, nor can he obtain economic benefits.</p>
<p>Zhao Taiyong said that North Korean leader Kim Jong -un announced that he would launch a reconnaissance satellite by the end of April, but he had not yet implemented it, and the North Korean side seemed to have encountered various problems.</p>

<p>Reuters reports that there are a large number of Rohingya Muslims and refugees in some provinces in western Myanmar and Bangladesh in western Myanmar, and they are the first in the Mocka Cycone CycloneMocha on May 14. Cross -cyclones estimate that hundreds of people die and cause extensive damage. The funds will be used to provide food, drugs and other materials for the victims.</p>
<p>The United Nations is calling for additional funds of US $ 122 million for Myanmar, and using $ 211 million of existing funds to cope with cyclones, and provide Bangladesh a separate $ 42 million.</p>
<p>"We are running against time to provide safe residences for all affected communities, and prevent the spread of hydropower diseases."</p>
<p>A senior aid person who did not want to disclose his name told Reuters that more than a week after the disaster, the material was placed in the warehouse in Yangon, the commercial capital of Myanmar, waiting for customs clearance. The assistant said: "If we have sufficient, unobstructed channels, we can empty our warehouse and send (material) to the real -scale assistance." He added Said that the aid agencies did not publicize publicly because they were worried about being retaliated by the military.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Myanmar military said earlier that 145 people died in the storm and assisting supplies were being sent to the affected area.</p>
<p>Lewis, the coordinator of the United Nations in Daka, said that in Bangladesh, a "complex disaster management system" saved many people's lives, but infrastructure and houses were severely damaged.</p>

<p>Description: China's "second generation" and "official second generation" have always been a topic of people who are happy, and it is also one of the main points of people's dissatisfaction with the CCP. The results of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 14th National Congress of the Chinese People's Congress show that Xi Jinping, the top leader of the Communist Party of China, has basically eliminated the highest decision -making level and provincial and ministerial leadership of China, which is the same as his peers.

<p>This treaty negotiated by the WHO member states is a legal constraint agreement to solve the "catastrophic failure" of the international community's popularity against crown diseases around the world.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the crown disease, a total of more than 750 million infected cases have been infected, with about 7 million cumulative death cases. This 42 -page document aims to help the world do better next time. Member states can choose to delete many paragraphs in future negotiations, including paragraphs about responsibility.</p>
<p>In the early draft, the controversial part, including the intellectual property rights and the preservation of 20%of the testing, treatment and vaccine, for the WTO to distribute to the poor countries in the emergency situation and still retain the new draft, but It may still be deleted.</p>
<p>This document also defines "big popularity" as "a global spread of a pathogen or variant", which is not only easy to spread, but also dangerous. It can cause the health system to be overwhelmed and require international coordination. This treaty will be completed in 2024.</p>
