<p>NATO leaders are scheduled to hold a summit next month in the Capricorn capital Vilnius.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels yesterday that NATO leaders planned to hold the first NATO-Ukraine Council meeting with the NATO-Ukraine Council in Lithuania.</p>
<p>Stolten Berg pointed out that the meeting will make Kiev get a more equal position on the negotiating table to "negotiate and make a decision on security issues."</p>
<p>He also said that although NATO will strengthen the political relationship with Ukraine at the summit, he will not discuss the identity of Kiev.</p>
<p>He emphasized, "We will not discuss the invitation to invite Ukraine to join at the Vernis Summit, but will discuss how to make Ukraine closer to NATO."</p>
<p>"I believe we will find the appropriate solution and consensus."</p>
<p>NATO's Eastern European member states have been promoted to join in Ukraine to formulate a more complete roadmap, but major allies such as the United States and Germany have been reluctant to break through the vague promise of Ji Fu in 2014.</p>
<p>However, German Defense Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius said yesterday that if Ukraine is finally ready to join, it may relax the qualification requirements of some member states.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brillings will visit China from 18th to 19th of this month. He will be the first highest US official to visit China in five years.</p>
<p><strong> In January of this year, the US media revealed that Anthonyblinken, Secretary of State, will visit China in early February. It is his first trip to visit China for his position, but was immediately claimed to be "Chinese spy in the United States in February in February "The accident of flying into the United States was interrupted. At that time, Joebiden ordered the balloon to hit the balloon, and the relationship between the United States and China fell to the freezing point. </strong></p>
<p>After a few months, Brinken was ready to try again, and will fly to Beijing on June 18 to start a two -day visit. Many analysts believe that the White House hopes to re -stable relations with Beijing through this trip. However, the mutual trust foundation between the two sides is weak and the differences in many issues are great.</p>
<p>Can the wish of the White House realize this time? Will Brinken meet Xi Jinping? Beijing Zhongnanhai finally agreed to let Brinken come to Beijing at this moment. What do you want to get?</p>
<p>Song Wendi, a lecturer at the Asia -Pacific College of the National University of Australia, told BBC in Chinese that Brinken's trip was to reassure Beijing, "more importantly, to rest assured that other American allies." He believes that the United States has not held high expectations for this trip because during the days of Beijing, it has adopted a tough confrontation attitude towards the United States and has no intention of softening the diplomatic relations between the two parties.</p>
<p>For example, he said that not long ago, Beijing did not agree to let the National Defense Minister held talks at the Shangri -La dialogue held in Singapore. Therefore, he believes that for Washington, "if it is necessary to revise the US -China relations, China will inevitably need a large compromise in the United States. The political cost of this move is too high, and the White House has no wishes and will not happen."</p>
<p>Professor Elizabeth Freundlarus, Professor of Pacific FORUM, also holds similar views. She told the BBC Chinese that there are too many things in the United States and China in many things such as the Taiwan issue, the US -China trade and the Ukrainian war. This time, it is difficult for the two parties to talk about any big agreement, or the relationship is very large. Breakthrough.</p>
<p>However, she emphasized that based on the tension of the Taiwan Strait, in order to avoid military misjudgment in military affairs, the two countries resumed regular face -to -face meetings to maintain smooth dialogue channels.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brillings will visit China from 18th to 19th of this month. He will be the first US Secretary of State to visit China in five years.</p>

<p>As Brinken took office, US -China relations have fallen to the freezing point. After he took office, the United States continued his former President Donaldtrump (Trump) to compete with China. The difference is that Biden's allies alliances alliances are trying to regulate the global expansion of China in all aspects. Therefore, after taking office, the first visit to China has attracted worldwide attention.</p>
<p>After the first visit to China after the State of the State, Brinken can be said to be a wave of twists and turns. It was finalized in the second half of Bayeng's term of office. Some analysts also said that this also reflects how uncomfortable US -China relations are.</p>

<p>Is there a Chinese spy station in Cuba's secret base?</p>
<p>In fact, since the outbreak of the "Spy Balloon Incident" in February, Broske's trip to China has been canceled unexpectedly. The two countries have continued to be tattooed in many diplomatic incidents, including in Singapore. meeting. At the end of May, the U.S. Indian Command issued a statement that criticized the Chinese PLA-16 fighter aircraft intentionally approaching the US military reconnaissance aircraft to create danger, and Beijing responded strongly to criticize.</p>
<p>Last week's "Wall Street Journal" also reported that Beijing and the United States adjacent to the island country Cuba almost reached an agreement, establishing "eavesdropping facilities" to collect US East EQ, and then attracted attention and mutual criticism.

<p>But the White House has not stopped China. The US Department of Commerce listed 43 entities as the blacklist of entry and exit on May 12th, because they were suspected of recruiting Western pilots to train Chinese military personnel or developing hypersonic weapons. 31 are Chinese entities. Based on this, Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, criticized the United States to suppress China to "hysteria and use no means."</p>
<p>On Friday (May 16), a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin commented that Brinkelvan said that the United States "should not be fantasized to set off with China from its strength. Stable development track. "</p>
<p>With the moves of your diplomacy and military compete for both sides, the US State Department also did not expect the desire to break through the trip to Beijing, which seemed to reduce the "expectations" of the outside world.</p>

<p>In fact, after the United States and China successively confirmed that Brinkens' visits to China have been confirmed, Daniel Josephkritenbrink, the assistant to the Beijing visit, once said at a press conference that Brinken's trip is not a way to get along in the United States and China. Seeking a breakthrough or change, "but with a realistic, self -confidence attitude and sincere hope to manage the competition between the United States and China in the most responsible way."</p>
<p>Kangda, who is responsible for the Asia -Pacific Affairs in the US State Department, also said that the United States will not expect that this visit can surrender many diplomatic results, but at least it can reduce the risk of misjudgment and avoid the conflict between the United States and China.

<p>The Taiwan issue has continued to become a contradiction in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>Song Wendili said that when it is expected to visit China, Brincken is expected to guarantee that the United States will unintentionally challenge China to think of its core interests, such as sovereignty, security and development benefits.</p>
<p>However, Song Wendi emphasized that more importantly, "this helps enhance the cohesion between American allies, partners and friends. Brincken's trip is to tell allies that the cost of forming an alliance with the United States is appropriate. It is not conflict, but competition, but a selective risk, not a de-countling. "</p>
<h3>What do you want to get?</h3>
<p>Although Beijing's strategy of tough response or offensive for US diplomacy has not changed, Beijing's meeting with Brosky this time is not only to show the attitude of diplomatic diplomacy. External analysis said that business issues or the most willing areas of Beijing to negotiate in the trip to Blink.</p>
<p>This table is now. On Tuesday (June 13) US Treasury Minister Janet Yellen Ye Lun, after attending the U.S. Congress hearing, it will be a "huge mistake" with China. Obtained Beijing confirmation.</p>
<p>At that time, Yellen said that the American people benefited from the US -China trade, and the Chinese people also benefited, and the trade with China had a positive impact on the US economy.</p>
<p>In addition, the day before Yellen's conversation, the Wall Street Journal published an article reported that the US Department of Commerce plans to allow top semiconductor manufacturers such as Samsung and TSMC in Taiwan to maintain and expand these companies in the case of not being retaliated with the United States. China's existing chip foundry business.</p>
<p>Last October, the US Department of Commerce restricted the Chinese semiconductor industry, but also provided a one -year exemption period for several Taiwanese and Korean companies. This time it was reported that Biden may agree to extend the exemption period, and the analysis stated that it can slow down US export control over Chinese technology.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Department of Commerce refused to comment on this, the analysis believed that the United States was softer on the issue of Chinese trade, opened the door to Beijing's visit to Beijing, and was also an important focus of the two parties.</p>
<p>Ivankanapathy, the former director of the National Security Association of the United States, China, and Mongolia, told the US media that "Beijing 'to tolerate' Brinkee visits to promote the meeting with the Minister of Finance because Beijing believes that Yellen is more in line with their interests.

<p>However, Shi Yinhong, a professor at the School of International Relations of Renmin University of China, told AFP that neither the United States and China have not showed any major and long -lasting concessions. Its strategic or technical security.</p>
<p>At present, Shen Xuhui, a scholar who teaches Taiwan Zhongshan University, commented on his personal website. For Xi Jinping, Beijing needs Bronken to visit China to conduct a big news for all domestic trends, while Biden is for the presidential election of the United States. It is necessary to be decoupled to China, but at the same time, it is more "tough" to declare that they will declare more than Trump.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) in the Taipei Shopping Park, because of the joy of the pangolin family not long ago, a male baby wearing a male baby, and another mother -in -law with six armored mothers is about to come. Essence</p>
<p>In 2014, Yamagrazai was being conserved by the International Nature Protection Alliance(International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN)Evaluated as "extreme endangered" species. Fortunately, there have been major breakthroughs in the illustrations and reproduction of pangolin in the Taipei Zoo for more than 20 years, so that there have been birth in the park in the park. And 8 female pangolin. Nowadays, the mountains and Jiajia family in the zoo are leafy, and the people are strong. The continuation of the species of pangolins is now strongly supported.</p>
<h3>Human pitying leads to endangered</h3>
<p>Luo Yaoyi, the director of the Taiwan Animal Area in Taipei City, said in a DW interview that the number of wild pushed by wild pangles in Taiwan decreased sharply, less than 10,000. The biggest survival threat facing the armor comes from the poaching of human beings. In Asia, pangolin meat is often regarded as spectacular treasures, and scales are considered to have the effects of stopping hemostasis and milk. Therefore, wild pangolins are often hunting by humans and become the most often smuggled mammals in the world. Introduction to pangolin is naturally hobbies, no aggressiveness, poor escape ability, and slow movements, so it is easy to be hunt by humans or dogs. Coupled with the low reproductive ability of pangolin, one child is longer than many other animals, which leads to the danger of this species facing death.</p>

<p>萊比錫動物園的穿山甲「水里」</p>
<h3>移居萊比錫和布拉格</h3>
<p>台北市立動物園早在二、三十年前就啟動了穿山甲的保育工作，1997年便成為世界上首家成功繁育穿山甲的動物園。2007年台北市立動物園先送了一隻雄性的穿山甲「頭份」給德國萊比錫動物園；2009年又送了雌性的「龜山」去配對，希望他們能在德國繁殖成功，穩定穿山甲在歐洲的域外保種族群。這樣的期盼雖然沒有實現，但這兩隻穿山甲至今依然健康活潑的生活在萊比錫動物園。2007年「頭份」於聖誕節前夕飛抵德國萊比錫動物園，曾造成轟動；當年萊比錫動物園的會議邀請卡、月曆和明信片上都看得到的「頭份」的英姿，可見其受歡迎的程度，畢竟當年全歐洲只有在萊比錫動物園才可以看得到穿山甲。</p>
<p>繼「頭份」和「龜山」之後，2016年台北又送給萊比錫動物園「水里」和「穿芎」兩隻穿山甲，可惜這兩隻穿山甲分別在2018和2019年病逝。多年來，台北動物園和萊比錫動物園通過人員和資訊的交流，雙方在穿山甲的照養管理、保育繁殖、人工飼料、環境規劃上獲得巨大的成就。</p>
<p>雖然萊比錫的「頭份」和「龜山」沒有成功繁衍下一代，但是台北市立動物園的穿山甲域外繁殖計畫卻在布拉格開花結果。2020年台北市和捷克的布拉格市締結為姊妹市。2022年4月台北市立動物園便借殖一對穿山甲「果寶」與「潤喉糖」給布拉格動物園，作為姊妹市的友好象徵。2023年2月2日「潤喉糖」順利產下一個雌性寶寶，取名為「松果」；這是歐洲成功繁殖穿山甲的首例。由於穿山甲主要分布在亞洲、非洲等溫暖地方，歐洲寒冷乾燥的氣候環境其實不適合牠的生存，因此「松果」的誕生，更加令人感到欣慰和興奮。</p>
<h3>沒有「穿山甲外交」</h3>
<p>台北市立動物園內有一座新建造的穿山甲館，模仿出熱帶雨林的複雜系統，讓世人知道穿山甲的原始生活領域。園內專家和照護員多年來除了在穿山甲的救傷、研究和醫療技術上有重大的進步，更在穿山甲的飲食照料下足了工夫。原本穿山甲在野外習慣覓食螞蟻和白蟻，但動物園卻無法提供足量而且多樣性高的螞蟻與白蟻供其食用，園方只好不斷改良穿山甲的食譜，如今使用包括麵包蟲、蜂蛹等的13種材料，終於成功開發出合乎穿山甲口味的人工配方飼料，不但讓穿山甲吃的津津有味，而且健康活潑。</p>
<p>無可諱言，台北市立動物園在穿山甲的保育成績是世界第一。那麼台北市立動物園會像中國大陸進行的 <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/大熊猫的王牌外交官之路/a-39563989"> 「熊貓外交」</a>Similarly, is the so -called "pangolin diplomacy" by pangolin? The spokesman of the Taipei Zoo Cao Xianshao told DW; the Taipei City Zoo has not carried out "pangolin diplomacy", but is committed to the preservation of species. Essence Taipei City Zoo not only successfully supports Taiwan's pangolin, but also shares the support technology with the German Leipzig Zoo and the Czech Praga Zoo, allowing Taiwan to successfully go to Europe as a conservation ambassador, so that more people in the world know the pangolin, and support the pangolin. Conservation work.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T11-43-00Z/65947993_401.jpg" />The big gibbon "Taishan" in Taipei Zoo is about 56 years old</p>
<h3>"Animal Immigration" in Germany is rooted in Taipei</h3>
<p>Some animals from Germany can also be seen in the Taipei Zoo, such as the oldest gibbon "Taishan" in the park. "Taishan" is currently about 56 years old and belongs to ultra -age, because the average life expectancy of large galaxies is 30 years old. In 1998, it came from the Frankfurt Zoo to Taipei Zoo, and formed a family with the only female individual in the garden at that time. Because both individuals were around 30 years old, they almost came to the end of their lives. The garden had only wanted them to be accompanied by the old age. "Taishan" is now open in Taiwan. It usually has its own activities with his son, but occasionally gathering for a while after meals. "After the long" died in 2009, and its children were still alive.</p>

<p>Latin's cat named Neofelisnebulosa is mainly distributed in southeastern Asia. It is called Nebelpardar in Germany, and it is directly translated into Chinese as a "fog leopard"; in Taiwan, it is called "cloud leopard". But whether it is a cloud leopard or a fog leopard, the naming of this animal should be related to its epidermis with "cloud -like spots".

<p>According to Reuters from Tokyo on June 18th, US Secretary of State Brosky will arrive in Beijing on Sunday. This is the first American senior diplomat to visit China in five years. The current bilateral relations are cold. The two worlds in the United States and China The biggest economy between the largest economy has gained any breakthrough prospects.</p>
<p>After the suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States, Brincken postponed his visit in February this year, and he will become the highest -level U.S. government officials who have visited China since President Byphon in January 2021.</p>
<p>During his visit from June 18th to 19th, it is expected that he will meet with Wang Yi, director of the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Working Committee of China, and may meet with Xi Jinping, President of China, and strive to establish open and persistent communication. Channels to ensure that the strategic competition between the two countries is relieved and will not fall into conflict.</p>
<p>The other parts of the world will also pay close attention to this trip. After all, the upgrade of any dispute between the two superpowers may have an impact on the financial market, trade and global supply chain aspects.</p>
<p>"Both parties realize that we do need to establish high -level communication channels," a senior official of the US State Council told reporters while cheering in Tokyo on the way to Beijing.</p>
<p>"We are at an important node in the relationship between the two parties. I think it is very important to reduce the risk of misjudgment, or as our Chinese friends often say, to prevent the spiral of the relationship from falling," said the official.</p>
<p>The total deterioration of the relationship between the United States and China has triggered people's concerns, that is, they may have a military conflict on the autonomous Taiwan Island one day. China claims that Taiwan is its own. There are also differences in issues such as trade, semiconductor industry, and Beijing's human rights records.</p>
<p>Especially for neighbors of China to worry that despite the United States repeatedly tried, China is still reluctant to have regular military dialogues with Washington.</p>
<p>Before going to Beijing this Friday, Brinken said at a press conference that there were three main goals in this trip: the establishment of crisis management mechanisms, promoting the interests of the United States and its allies, and directly talking about related issues, and exploring potential cooperation areas.</p>
<p>"If we want to ensure that our competition with China will not evolve into a conflict like what we do, then your starting point is to communicate." He said that he would also propose that because Washington believes that it is a political motivation because of the political motivation. The charges of American citizens who are detained in China.</p>
<p>However, US officials diluted any expectations for major progress at the call of this visit earlier this week. Officials said that although Brinton's main goal will be a discussion of "frank, direct and constructive", it is unlikely to make breakthroughs on any major issues, including the issue of Finnini and Americans detained in China.</p>
<p>However, it is expected that Brintken's visit will pave the way for more bilateral meetings in the next few months, including US Treasury Secretary Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Raymond. This may also lay the foundation for Xi Jinping and Biden at the multilateral summit later.</p>
<p>The U.S. official also said that efforts to ensure that China ’s cooperation in Fantney will become a key project on the agenda. US officials said that China has always been reluctant to cooperate on this issue.</p>
<p>Bayeng said on Saturday that he hopes to meet Xi Jinping in the next few months.</p>

Although this trip is an important step, it is also a insufficient step from a certain perspective, because there are still many jobs to do.</p>
<p>Blinden is the first US Secretary of State, which has visited China for the first time since 2018, and the highest -level U.S. officials to visit China since President Bayeng in January 2021. Reuters reports that sources say that Brinkens may meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>U.S. officials told the media at a pre -newspaper briefing on the 14th that they did not expect this visit to break through in US -China relations.</p>
<p>US President Biden said that he hopes to meet with Xi Jinping again in the next few months.</p>

In the speech, Biden emphasized that the early support of union workers will create "great differences" in the campaign.</p>
<p>Biden also mentioned the infrastructure plan he had previously signed by $ 1.2 trillion (about 1.6 trillion yuan), and said that his government had launched 320,000 infrastructure projects across the country.</p>
<p>He told the union workers in the audience that Republicans were "coming for your work. They came to your future. They came for your future for your children and grandsons."</p>
<p>Biden was hailed by labor leaders as the most president of the union in history. He supports the collective negotiations of the trade union in the enterprise, overthrowing the rules of weakening workers' protection by the former President Trump, which has been overturned, promoted the reduction of the number of members of the union members for decades, and made it easier for the workers to build a bridge and port.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned $ 11 trillion infrastructure plan is from the "Infrastructure Investment and Employment Act" signed by Biden in 2021. In order to obtain the bill in the House of Representatives, the Bayeng government and members of the parliament made several months of fierce political quarrels. Biden believes that the bill is an investment of "only one generation" and has a "milestone significance".</p>
<p>Some trade union leaders said that the white workers' class union voters have different differences in whether they support Biden in 2020. But he now gets their support.</p>
<p>Ryanboyer, the Philadelphia Construction Industry Committee leader of the Lei City Construction Industry Committee on behalf of the boiler workers and steel workers, said what the workers' doubts should be supported by the union workers in the 2024 election in the 2024 election. He emphasized that the labor leaders of Philadelphia recognized the support of Biden for men and women.</p>
<p>In 2020, the union voters helped Biden win the battlefield state including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. It is expected that before the 2024 election, labor will play an important role in the grassroots operation of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Sethharris, who was the highest labor policy consultant of the Biden team, said Biden's infrastructure, chips and climate bills help create millions of jobs that do not need university degree, which will help He won the support of the objeper.</p>
<p>He pointed out that men without a university degree industry are one of the most rows, and a large part of Biden's economic strategy is concentrated on men and women without college degrees.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65925528/59026203"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T07-21-00Z/59026203_303.jpg" /></a>The United States wants to prevent China from getting a technology for manufacturing high -end chips</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) Shenzhen, known as "Silicon Valley of China", has a large number of high -tech enterprises such as Huawei, Tencent, and ZTE. More than 4,000 startups are developed here, trials and production. Deguang reporter visited a robot company founded 7 years ago in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>The robotic arm with a size of a child's arm is stored in the colorful building blocks into the container. According to instructions, the robot can distinguish red and green building blocks.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu, the person in charge of the foreign market, said that artificial intelligence is used in robots and used imported chips. She told reporters that the international sanctions in recent years have affected the company, especially after the implementation of the chip ban, the chip price has doubled, "this is very stressful to our financial pressure."</p>
<p>Since October last year, the U.S. government launched a new export control order after several rounds of sanctions, which aims to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欲限縮中國晶片發展-出口管制有用嗎/a-65767213">prevent China's import and production advanced high -tech chip</a>Essence The Netherlands and Japan, which have a light -engraved machine manufacturer ASML, have followed up and adopted the corresponding <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/比美國嚴格日本半導體出口限制使中國憂心/a-65717077">ban on sale measures</a>Essence</p>
<p>Antoniahmaidi, a scholar of the Chinese chip industry and artificial intelligence, pointed out that the purpose of the relevant measures is to ensure that China cannot obtain special chips for artificial intelligence and military artificial intelligence, including military artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3>What is the future of the chip industry?</h3>
<h3>"The United States cannot control all the global chips"</h3>
<p>China has no ability to produce more advanced chips than 7 -nanometer. To replace the machinery of high -end chips such as manufacturing from abroad so far, it is one of the biggest challenges in China to the international experts. Nevertheless, China is not difficult to do.</p>
<p>"Almost all high -end chips can complete the tasks of the old -fashioned chips." McGrady said, but it means that it costs more electricity, consumes more raw materials, and costs higher. For example, two chips are not enough.</p>
<p>She believes that the Chinese chip industry can find a way to deal with sanctions, and it is impossible to control all the global chips, including the military field, aerospace, and high-tech. If there are 10,000 chips, then a Chinese company with international business, then I can always get some, but it may go through three different countries. "</p>
<p>Chinese scholars such as Xing Yuqing, a professor of economics, are optimistic that China will be able to make high -end chips by itself in the future. Xing Yuqing, who is currently teaching at the University of Tokyo National Policy Research University University (GRIPS), pointed out that sanctions will force Chinese companies to develop their own research and development and force them to invest more time and funds.</p>
<h3>Without Taiwan's semiconductor production, what should I do in the world?</h3>
<p>However, international observers are still questioning whether China can really catch up with their opponents. The chip manufacturing process is internationally leading Taiwan. 90%of the world's most advanced chips are made in Taiwan. China regards Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly declared that it will not give up the use of force "unified" the island.</p>
<p>McGrady believes that it is the high -end chip industry that may be able to protect Taiwan from military shock to a certain extent. Because once the supply chain is blocked, all countries will be affected by the economy, including the United States. In addition, she believes that both China and the United States are not ready to confront each other. "Both sides don't want to go into war now, because both countries think that their army needs to improve significantly in order to be sure to win a war."</p>
<p>However, an emergency in early June this year shows how nervous the situation is. A Chinese warship approaches a U.S. destroyer in the Taiwan Strait. Observer warned that such incidents occurred more and more frequently, and it may accidentally lead to an upgrade.</p>

To reach this estimated figure, all manufacturers of Boeing must produce a total of 42,595 aircraft, half of which are used to replace existing aircraft, and the rest are the growth of the fleet.</p>
<p>North America will account for 23%of the new fleets, 22%of the Asia -Pacific region, 21%in Eurasia, and 20%of China alone.</p>
<p>Boeing published the above forecast on the eve of the opening of the Paris Airlines exhibition, consistent with the predictions made last year. Boeing estimated that the global fleet would reach 47,080 in 2041.</p>
<p>Boeing competitors Airbus said on the 14th that it is expected that there will be 4850 new passenger planes and cargo aircraft demand by 2042, and the total number of global fleets will reach 46,560.</p>
<p>Boeing also estimates that the scale of Low Airlines' fleet will expand more than double the next 20 years. Although the growth is amazing, it will still increase below the past 20 years. The scale of the Low Airlines fleet has grown to 6 times in the past 20 years. (Translator: Ji Jinling)</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Broskerer visited Beijing on June 18 and held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. Brincken is the first supreme US official to visit China in five years. After the Chinese spy balloon incident in February this year, Brinken postponed the plan to visit. Some analysts believe that the meeting between Blint and Qin Gang has provided an opportunity to ease the tension between the United States and China.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/kw-06162023130012.html"><strong> International Organization calls on Brinkens to make account on Chinese human rights and the United States, and then you will be recruited </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-06142023113705.html">Bolling Kenkee's visit to China is an expert: the U.S. -China relations are difficult to change</a></strong></p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang welcomed the United States Secretary of State AntonyBlinken at the Diaoyutai State Guest House on Sunday. Qin Gang stretched out his hand first. After a few seconds, Brinken would come to shake hands with Qin Gang. The two did not talk to the media after taking pictures, and entered the conference room for closed -door talks.</p>
<p>Blink's less than 48 hours of whirlwind visits is quite compact. In addition to meeting with Qin Gang, he will also talk to Wang Yi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office of the Politburo.</p>
<p>At the earlier media briefing meeting, US officials faded any expectations of major progress in Blingken's visit, and "it is unlikely to make breakthroughs in any major issue."</p>
<p>"The most important purpose of the United States is the 'meeting'. The meeting this time makes the senior management of both parties really sit face to face." Huang Jiezheng, an associate professor of the Institute of International Affairs and Strategy of Tamkang University in Taiwan, told this station that at least the above meeting represents the balloon incident. The controversy caused by this page temporarily turned over. He believes that the tension of the rising tension of the evil line of the United States and China has slightly slowed down, and "this trip provides an opportunity to ease bilateral tension."</p>
<p>"With the continued tension of relations in the United States and China, the United States can build a pipeline of communication dialogue to the greatest extent, establish a mechanism for crisis management or risk avoidance." Song Guocheng, a researcher at the National Guan Center of Politburo in Taiwan, said This is the subjective expectation of the United States in China, but it does not mean that the United States shows weakness or reduces the siege of the CCP. The United States wants to "compete without confrontation."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-18T07-55-00-04-00/000002.png" />Blingken arrived in Beijing on Sunday morning, and Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, and the US ambassador to China Burns.(Reuters)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-06182023075433.html/6a5f5834.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-18T07-55-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> The United States hopes to establish a channel for communication in China to avoid misjudgment </strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Brinken has expressed three purposes to visit Beijing: one is to establish an open communication channel, deal with misunderstandings, and avoid misjudgment; The third is to explore cooperation space for issues such as stabilizing global economy and climate change.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Qin Gang talked to Bollingen in front of the meeting. According to the official release of China's officials, Qin Gang explained the strict position on the issues of China ’s core concerns such as Taiwan’ s issues, emphasizing that the United States should respect, stop interference in China ’s internal affairs, and stop harming the interests of Chinese sovereign security development in the name of competition.</p>
<p>Huang Jiezheng analyzed that the first item has done the first step. The outside world expects subsequent high -level officials including Janet Yellen, including US Finance Minister Janet Yellen and Commercial Secretary Ginaraimondo. consensus. However, he believes that it is difficult to reach the second item. "The United States must clearly state the value of the United States. Core in Beijing's core interests. "</p>
<p>Song Guocheng emphasized that "the United States and China are still structural confrontation", involving the competition for global leadership. The Chinese Communist Party attempts to compete for Asian hegemony and expel the US military existence to the global leadership of the United States and even replace the United States.</p>
<p>"Its ambitions have not changed at all. It is not to be the role of world peaceful builders. It must be the role of the world's highest leader. Isn't that the global leadership position, isn't it the point of the two strong resistance? "Song Guocheng added.</p>

The above factors obviously have a serious impact on the housing construction industry. According to data released by the Federal Department of Statistics on Friday, the amount of residential construction permits has fallen to the lowest level in the past 17 years.</p>
<p>The building permit of 21,000 apartments in April was nearly one -third less than the same period last year. The IFO Institute believes that before 2025, the number of completion apartments will remain at a low level of 200,000 sets per year. This number is only equivalent to half of the government's given goals.</p>
<p>Dirksalewski, chairman of the Freedom Real Estate Federation Federation, said: "The status quo will lead to a series of negative social effects, not to mention the problem of housing shortage is becoming more and more serious. Less, it means that there will be less residential houses in the next few years. "The Real Estate Federation predicts that in 2025, the housing gap will reach 700,000 units, and there will be as many as 1.4 million people looking for housing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T08-02-00Z/62801127_401.jpg" />Experts: In the next few years, the housing gap will become bigger and bigger, and the problem of finding house difficulties will become more prominent.</p>
<p>"The Federal Statistics Department stated:" After May 2022, the main reason for the decrease in construction of residential buildings is still the high price of building materials and the harsh financing conditions. "The European Central Bank has eight consecutive interest rates, which has caused the interest rate of house loans to a high level of more than 4%. The central bank continues to raise interest rates to curb high inflation.</p>
<p>The IFO Institute believes that the reason for the decline in the number of apartments is not just due to excessive interest. The institute's construction industry expert, Ludwigdorffmeister.) Said: "At the same time, the government has greatly reduced subsidies for new apartments, and in 2023, the standard of new apartments has been improved."

<p>(Voice of Germany) How to travel frugal? Classic tent camping is a good choice!Usually, you only need to bring the equipment to drive to the so -called "camping"(campsite)Essence These camps are usually operated. As long as you pay some rent, you can use public facilities such as bathrooms.</p>
<p>Camping is particularly suitable for families with children. You can bring your children to know the flowers and plants in nature and experience the joy of picnic. It is also a good parent -child activity to look up at the sky at night.</p>
<p>Some large -scale camps not only include swimming pools, children's playgrounds and open -air theaters, but also provide catering services. It is worth noting that in general, in order to protect the environment and water sources, German law does not allow people to camping in the wild at will.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T08-09-00Z/45347345_401.jpg" />The camping car "Although the sparrows are small, the five internal organs are all"</p>
<p>However, it is an exception. In order to ensure that driving has sufficient physical strength and concentration, as long as it is a area where legal parking is legally, it is okay to stop and sleep for 10 hours overnight.</p>
<p>In Germany, some families who love road travel will rent or even buy such camping cars. During vacation, they will drive out to play. For those who pay attention to comfort, the camping car is "although the sparrows are small and the internal organs are all available." Of course, these camping cars are also allowed to enter most camping.</p>
<p>When it comes to camping cars, one of the most impressive is the Campervan produced by Volkswagen (Volkswagen). The unique and colorful shape makes people think of vacation when they see it. Although it has been discontinued for many years, it is still the favorite of some antique car collectors.</p>
<p>In recent years, the so -called "luxury/wild luxury camping" (GLAMPING "has begun to live in a five -star restaurant, with comfortable four -column large beds, swimming pool SPAs and restaurants that supply various foods in all -weather. The form of the room is not limited to tents, such as wooden houses, tree houses, and even wooden barrel shapes, etc., and you can put on the net red photo of social media.</p>
<p>In addition, there are "ecological camping". As the name implies, it is to minimize the damage to the environmental ecology as much as possible during camping. Some camping sites are gradually changing to support ecological camping. They use renewable energy, provide biological decomposition or recyclable materials, provide organic ingredients or other products, and reduce light harm at night to avoid interfere with wild animals.</p>

<h3>If you catch the rain</h3>
<p>Rain rain, continuous rainfall, or temperature is too cool -as a summer tourist destination, Germany usually cannot guarantee that tourists can enjoy sunshine holidays. However, the long -term severe weather in Southern Europe has prompted more and more tourists to choose to view the weather online, and then quickly clean up the bags and come to say a "camping journey" that goes away. Many of the pleasant areas in Germany attract wild camps.</p>

<h3>RV or a private yacht?</h3>
<p>The small private yacht on the picture may be the most suitable choice for Germany this summer. The boat named "Salander" is called a driver who can swim. Although this multifunctional boat is not suitable for sailing, it can be freely sailing in lakes and rivers.</p>

<h3>Luxury Camping</h3>
<p>In ordinary camping places, you can enjoy nature at a camping fee of only 10 euros a day. However, the real luxury camping tour is not just a place for overnight. For example, the operator of the camping venue will provide a car with high -profile facilities (pictured), and there is a parking space for the second car. VIKTORIAGROß, a German camping club, introduced that in this camping place, the cost of a RV parking cost does not exceed 80 euros per day. A three -dish package also includes lease costs.</p>

<h3>flexible</h3>
<p>The haze weather in Germany is not suitable for summer tourism destinations. Another choice is indoor camping. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Statistics, only 8%of the German vacations like to take a swimming pool, most people are willing to take a tent camping. The indoor camping can be both. Another advantage is: who wants to go to a big city to camping and put the camp in the room.</p>

<p>However, in recent months, the prices of global oil and natural gas have begun to decline.</p>
<p>According to the International Energy Agency, given the demand for the petrochemical industry and the aviation industry, global oil demand will increase by 6%from 2022 to 2028, and its capacity will reach 105.7 million barrels per day. However, the annual growth rate will be sharply reduced from the current 2.4 million barrels/day to 400,000 barrels per day in 2028.</p>

<h3>Petroleum demand will also slow down the growth rate</h3>
<p>Last year, when the International Energy Agency released the annual energy outlook report, it also predicted that the peak of global oil demand will appear around 2035, and the demand will become stable since then. However, the agency now said that the energy crisis is "accelerating the transformation of clean energy." In the report, as more and more electric vehicles are on the streets, oil consumption in the transportation field will begin to decline after 2026. The more developed Organization Organization 38 member states (including the European Union, the United States, Japan, Australia, etc.) demand is expected to decline from 2024.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency also pointed out that the booming petrochemical industry and strong consumption growth of emerging countries will offset the shrinking demand for oil in developed countries to a certain extent. The organization also predicts that China's petroleum demand will rebound this year due to the termination of epidemic control measures, but the increase will also slow down from 2024.</p>
<p>The annual energy outlook report concluded that in the past three years, the global oil market first experienced <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专题报道新冠疫情与疫苗/t-55795902">New Crown Extraction</a>The impact, subsequently encountered the turbulence of the Russian and Ukraine War, and is still slowly re -adjusting. In view of Saudi Arabia and Russia, OPEC is cutting out of production, "the global oil market may be tightened sharply in the next few months", but "various pressures in the market will seem to be alleviated in the next few years."</p>
<p>The report also pointed out that despite the slowdown in demand, global investment in oil and gas exploration, mining, and production will reach its highest level since 2015. It is expected that this year's growth rate will be 15%, and the total investment in the year will reach US $ 528 billion.</p>
<p>On the same day, the industry giant British Shell said that it would maintain its stability of oil production by 2030. Envalvex of environmentalists, thinking that this is "the retrograde of damage to the climate." In February this year, British Petroleum Corporation also announced that it would increase profits by investing in renewable energy and traditional carbon -containing energy before 2030, thereby slowing the pace of energy transformation.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) According to the Kyodo News Agency, on June 16, the "Criminal Law" amendment was approved at the plenary conference of the Senate of the Japan Parliament. By the age of 16. In the amendment, a new crime of "sexual photography" of shooting parts and underwear is also set up.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) In Germany, a large number of financial funds flow from the country to Catholic and the Gospel Church each year. Last year, it had more than 600 million euros. This does not include Kirchensteuer, a church taxed by the church to the church, that is, the money comes from all taxpayers.</p>
<p>why is it like this? This starts from more than two hundred years ago. In the early 19th century, Germany was occupied by Napoleon and implemented a strict separation of politics and religion. With the disintegration of the "German and Holy Roman Empire", the property of churches in various places has been charged, and church institutions such as the monastery may be closed or returned to the state. The church was forced to give funds and real estate to local princes as compensation, and the latter was obliged to undertake other expenses of the clergy and church institutions. This approach has continued to this day, and now the German federal state governments are still paying the daily expenses of the church.</p>
<h3>"One Stroke" is easy to talk about</h3>
<p>However, in fact, all parties have long been approved, and the approach to pay for this country should end. As early as 1919, the Constitution of the Weima Republic has stipulated that the state will pay a one -time compensation to the church to buy this "evil debt". Thirty years later, the Federal German Basic Law inherited the resolution. Until now, the German government is still paying for a year. And the corresponding expenses have also risen, from about 23 million euros in 1949 to 602 million euros this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T08-46-00Z/62328223_401.jpg" />Although he was "charged" two hundred years ago, the German church still has huge assets.</p>
<p>Hans Michaelheinig, a legal professor at the University of Gostegen, explained that in fact, federal states are not dissatisfied with the current maintenance status, because the government does not need to pay a high one -time termination fee. The church is also happy, because it is the country who pays it, which is a account of drought and flood protection. But from the perspective of fiscal economy, this approach is not a long -term plan.</p>
<p>The current federal government intends to "give money" to the church to "give money" endlessly. This plan is also written into a three -party joint ruling agreement. A working group will submit a framework scheme within this year. The core content includes whether to pay the church compensation at one time, how high the number of compensation is, and the transition period of the state's continued payment.</p>
<p>This is a big money. According to a draft legislative case submitted to the Federal House of the House of Federal House in 2020, the number of one -time payment should be 18.6 times the actual payment of the year, and the standard of that year is 11 billion euros. The money was paid by the church by the federal states within 20 years, and before the paid, the country continued to bear the original expenses.</p>
<p>Bodopieroth, a legal scholar at the University of Minshi, believes that the number is too high and quoted a data evaluated by an expert that the capital paid to the church over the past two hundred years has far exceeded that year that year was exceeded that year. The scale of its assets, including interest of assets.</p>
<p>However, Heini has different views: "The assets that the church was confiscated could have generated benefits through operations." And the state compensation is this part of the loss. In addition, of course, the factors of inflation must be considered. "If I rent a house for a long time, I want to buy it, and the homeowner will not deduct the rent I paid for many years from the purchase of the house."</p>
<h3>The world's largest stamp collection agency</h3>
<h3>The church cares about this money?</h3>
<p>For the two major churches in Germany, the fund's funding only accounts for a small part of its income. It was only a church tax, which had a total of 13 billion euros last year. In addition, the church has some asset income, but how much is secretly. Today, the church still has some real estate, forestry and enterprises, such as publishers, beer plants, banks, insurance companies, and shares, so it can be said to be a large capitalist.</p>
<p>Carstenfrerk, a writer who has been paying attention to this issue for many years, pointed out that if Lin Lin is finally together, it is estimated that the economic revenue of the two major churches has a total of 150 billion euros. However, the church's finance is very opaque. One of the reasons is that these income is distributed on 50,000 different legal entities. It is estimated that the total assets of the two major churches are worth 3,000 euros.</p>
<p>Ferlk said that if the state stops paying to the church, social service institutions in the church, such as kindergartens, maintenance hospitals, and hospitals, will not be able to do it. "There is no direct relationship between state funding and church charity institutions and other social welfare undertakings. In fact, only 2%of the above institutions are funded by churches." Most of the remaining were funded by the state.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T08-46-00Z/65409490_401.jpg" />There are many kindergartens in Germany, which are actually funded by the government.</p>
<p>Heini believes that from the beginning, the key issue is that the federal government has not set a hard period for ending fiscal payment. Therefore, the Federal Constitutional Court cannot force legislature to take action. If the federal government insists on implementing the relevant plan, it can only be difficult to please, either offending the Federal State or offending the church.</p>
<p>At present, only half of the residents of Germany are <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国去年43万人退出教会/a-49678681">church members</a>Essence It is estimated that the number of people will be halved by 2060. Heini pointed out that in view of this, the phenomenon that the public should end the history of this history and should end a hundred years ago is difficult to understand. Therefore, finding a solution is imminent. Moreover, the neighbor Czech Republic has already made an example: the country has made the country from getting rid of the financial transfusion obligation to the church through one -time payment.</p>

The missile must be the fastest growing market in this industry. But the manufacturer's speed can't keep up at all. "</p>
<p>Western countries have completely grasped the sky since the end of the Cold War, and largely abandoned a strong air defense system that used to defend the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) forces not being attacked by Soviet aircraft. In a recent report, the French Parliament had alert, and eight French air defense artillery regiments were abolished.</p>
<p>However, Markcancian, a senior consultant of the "Strategic and International Research Center" (CSIS) of Washington Think Tank, said that as more and more countries have achieved cruise missiles, short -range ballistic missiles and drones, NATO countries have re -focused on in recent years, they have re -focused attention air defense.</p>
<p>Kanson told AFP: "They have started, but basically not far ... I think the number of (air defense weapons) will be more, but this will not be urgent The shortage is difficult to respond to the short -range or long -range defense needs of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The German government has allocated a special fund of 100 billion euros (about NT $ 360 billion). It will be used to rebuild the National Defense Force in the next few years. Among them, 5 billion euros are planned to be used for air defense. The air defense budget is also comparable to Germany.</p>
<p>In terms of the military industry, the European MBDA missile system company has signed contracts worth 2 billion euros with France and Italy in recent months, and will supply 700 purple garden air defense missiles (ASTER) in the two countries.</p>
<p>Poland will also spend 2.2 billion euros to purchase hundreds of CAMM missiles and 44 launchers.</p>

<h3>North Korea under the new crown epidemic: "We are trapped and waited for death"</h3>
<p>10:16 am on June 18, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085791_b750fe71-e6db-4900-91ec-64af097bbd41.jpg"></a><strong> For several months, the BBC has been secretly contacted with three people in North Korea. They disclosed for the first time that the government blocked the disaster after blocking the border more than three years ago. Hunger and brutal suppression, but there is no chance to escape. </strong></p>
<p>Ming Shu stared at the mobile phone with her body, fighting for the next sale. She is a savvy businessman who secretly sells smugglers to some urgent people with a small amount of supply, allowing her to live barely. She had been caught once, and it was reluctant to afford the dredging fee at that time before she was relieved.</p>
<p>She has almost no money to come again. However, knocking on the door may sound at any time. She was afraid of not only the police, but also her neighbors. Now she can hardly believe anyone. This is not the case. Mingshu's drug business was originally prosperous.</p>
<p>However, on January 27, 2020, North Korea suddenly closed the country to deal with the global epidemic. Citizens who have been banned from exporting are now closed in their own towns. Rescue workers and diplomats were packaged and left. The guards received the order, and any person near the border killed. The most isolated country in the world has become a black hole.</p>
<p>Under Kim Jong -un's totalitarian rule, North Korea was banned from contacting the outside world. With the help of the Northern Media "DailyNK" in the country in the country, the BBC was able to contact three North Korean civilians. They urgently want to tell the world about the catastrophic impact of Fengguan on their lives. They understand that if the government finds that they are reporting to us, they are likely to be executed. In order to protect them, we can only disclose what they tell us, but their experience provides a picture of rare domestic conditions in North Korea.</p>
<h3>Mingshu</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085793_h_ch1_dk_2560_x_1440.jpg" />"Our food conditions have never been so bad," Ming Shu told us. Like most North Korean women, she is the main economic source of the family. The meager salary obtained from the mandatory government work is basically worthless, which forces their wives to come up with various ways to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>Before the closure, Ming Shu would find an urgent need of antibiotics such as antibiotics in various ways, stole them from China, and then sold them to their local market. She needs to buy the border guards, which occupies half of her profits, but she accepts the rules of the game. This allows her to live a comfortable life in the northern town that borders in China.</p>
<p>The burden of supporting her family has always given her heavy pressure, but now this pressure makes her overwhelmed. It is almost impossible to find a sellable product. On one occasion, she wanted to steal the drug by herself, but was caught. Now she is always surveillance. She tried to sell domestic drugs in North Korea, but it is difficult to find this now, and her income is almost halved.</p>
<p>Now, her husband and children wake up every day, and she will prepare corn breakfast for them. Her hungry neighbors have begun to knock on the door for food, but she has to reject them. "We all live on the edge of life," she said.</p>
<h3>Chanhao</h3>
<p>In another town of the border, the construction worker Chan Hao was frustrated the day in the morning. "I want people to know that I regret being born in this country," he vented like this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085795_3c5e0bd7-f6f9-4b3d-b31d-ce2b4a91ee30.jpg" />He got up early, helped his wife to open the market, and then went to the construction site by himself. He did his best to help her move the goods and put it on the booth. He knew very well that he lived on her small business. He earns 4,000 North Korea -equivalent to $ 4 (£ 3) -the is not enough to buy a kilogram of rice, and his family has not received the government's grain for a long time, and he no longer expects.</p>
<p>He said that most North Koreans buying food markets are now almost empty, and the prices of rice, corn and seasonings have risen. Because the food produced by North Korea is not enough to be supplied to the citizens, it depends on imports. The blockade of the border allows the government to cut off the important food and fertilizers and machines for planting crops.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Chanhao was worried that he might die in the new crown, but over time, he began to worry about starving, especially after he watched the people around him died. The first to be starved to his village was a mother and her children. She was sick at the time. Her children rely on begging food to keep her life as much as possible, but in the end, all three died.</p>
<p>Then there was a mother who was sentenced to work because of violating the isolation order. She starved to death with her son. Recently, a acquaintance's son was released from the army because of malnutrition. Chanhao remembers that his face suddenly swelled, and then he died within a week. "I think of my children, thinking that we have to live in this unsatisfactory hell, and I can't sleep."</p>

<p>Hundreds of miles away, relatively rich capital Pyongyang, high -rise buildings on both sides of the rivers of the city. Zhiyan took the subway to work. After another sleepless night, she exhausted.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130085797_132e4697-c7d8-4553-b58f-b5dc7afde75e.jpg" />Her two children and husbands live on the money she earns in a food store. She once stole fruits and vegetables in the store to sell in the market, and she also sold cigarettes received by her husband from colleagues, and then bought rice with those money. Now, every time she get off work, the bag is thoroughly searched, and her husband no longer receives bribes. No one can afford anything.</p>
<p>"They have no longer possible," she was worried. Zhiyan now pretends to have three meals every day, but in fact she only eats one meal. She was hungry and was better than others knowing that she was poor.</p>
<p>She couldn't forget for a week, she was forced to eat "paste" -the food that mixed vegetables and grass into porridge into a paste. This food is inseparable from the darkest period in North Korea's history -in the 1990s devastating famine abused the country, causing as many as 3 million people to die.</p>
<p>"We all plan to survive 10 days in advance, and then plan for 10 days after the plan, thinking that if my husband and I are hungry, at least we can feed the children," Zhiyan said. Recently, she hasn't eaten for two days. "I thought I would die in my sleep, and I couldn't wake up in the morning," she said."This is a disaster," she said. "Without overseas supply, people don't know how to make a living." Recently, she heard that someone committed suicide at home, and some people hid in the mountains and died. She was distressed by the cold mentality of the city. "Even if someone dies next door, you will only think about yourself. It's so ruthless."</p>

<p>During the new crown epidemic, the Pyongyang people wearing a mask are waiting for the train at an intersection.</p>
<p>For many months, the news of people's starving has been circulating, causing fear of may face another famine in North Korea. Peter Ward, an economist of North Korea, described the description of "very worrying".</p>
<p>"You heard that people starve to death are the same thing, but when you really know that the people around you are starving, this means that the food condition is very serious -worse than what we realize, and in the late 1990s The famine has been serious since any time, "he said.</p>
<p>North Korea's famine represents a turning point in the history of this country that is not long, causing its harsh social order to collapse. The government that cannot let people eat meals, give them fragmented freedom, and do what they need to do for life. Thousands of people fled out of the border and went to South Korea, Europe or the United States for refuge.</p>
<p>At the same time, the private market began to rise, and women began to sell soybeans, second -hand clothes and Chinese electronic products. A non -mainstream economy came into being, followed by a North Korean of the entire generation, and learned to make a living in the case of rarely helping the government -capitalists developed in a high -pressure communist country.</p>

<p>The market went to the building one day, and Ming Shu was calculating her revenue. She was worried that the government would start the capitalist generation for her and this capitalist generation. She believes that the global popularity is just an excuse for the authorities to re -control the people's lives. "Indeed, they want to fight smuggling and prevent people from escaping," she said. "Now, even if you are near the river near the Chinese border, you will be severely punished."</p>
<p>Construction worker Chanhao also reached the point of the collapse. This is the most difficult time he has experienced. The famine was difficult, he said, but at the time there was no such harsh suppression and punishment. "If people want to escape, the government can't do anything," he said. "Now, you may be executed in a wrong step."</p>
<p>His friend's son has recently witnessed the execution of the government several times. Three or four people were killed every time, and the charges were trying to escape. "If I live according to the rules, I am likely to starve to death, but as long as I try to escape, I am afraid that I may be arrested, the label as a traitor, and then to execute," Chanhao told us. "We are trapped here and wait for die."</p>
<p>In front of the border blockade, more than 1,000 escapers will arrive in South Korea each year, but after that, the number of people who are known to escape and reach South Korea is very small. Satellite pictures analyzed by Human Rightswatch (Human Rightswatch) show that the authorities have built many walls, fences and defense points along the border in the past three years, making it almost impossible to escape.</p>
<p>Just trying to contact foreign people is becoming more and more dangerous. In the past, residents near the border could also use mobile phones to be transported in from China to secretly call abroad through the mobile network of China Unicom. Now, Chanhao said that at each community party, people with Chinese mobile phones will be asked to surrender. Recently, a person he met by Ming Shu was discovered to call on the phone with the people in China, and was sentenced to several years.</p>
<p>Hannasong (transliteration) of the North Korean Human Rights Data Center (NKDB) said that by cracking down on smuggling and preventing people from contacting the outside world, the government is also depriving the people of the country to make a living. "When a grain is scarce, the government fully realizes what kind of damage this will cause," she said.</p>
<p>However, these extreme control measures cannot resist the new crown virus. On May 12, 2022, nearly two and a half years after the global popularity, North Korea officially confirmed its first confirmed case. Because there is no detection method, the people who have a fever are actually held at home for 10 days. The whole family will be prohibited from taking a step. As the epidemic spread, the town and the street were completely blocked, and sometimes it was more than two weeks.</p>
<p>In Pyongyang, Zhiyan looked at some neighbors out of her windows. They did not have enough food to adhere to the entire blockade period, and there was vegetables in front of them every day. But along the border, there is no help.</p>
<p>Ming Shu was panicked. Her life was already very tight, and the cabinets at home were empty. That's how she had to go crazy to sell medicine secretly. She felt the risk of getting sick to make money and starve to death.</p>
<p>Chanhao said that when the blockade was lifted, five families had "half dead". They only went out to find food after dark. "Those who stayed at home could not live," he said.</p>
<p>"People begged loudly, saying that they were starving to death, and for a few days, the government issued some rice from the inventory," he said. It is reported that the blockade in some areas has been lifted in advance, and people are obviously unable to survive if that.</p>
<p>Those infected people cannot rely on national ruined hospitals to treat them. Even the basic drugs are used up. The official suggestion is to use folk therapy to relieve symptoms. When Zhiyan became ill, he called his friends desperately. They suggested that she use boiling water to drink green onion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130086111_screenshot2023-06-14at10.00.58.png" /></p>
<p>If it is calculated to the entire country, it is equivalent to more than 45,000 people, which is hundreds of times higher than the official announcement. But she got the news that everyone was informed of another cause of death, such as tuberculosis or liver cirrhosis.</p>
<p>In August 2022, three months after the outbreak of the epidemic, the government announced the victory of resistance, claiming that the virus had been cleared in China, but many isolation measures and regulations still took effect.</p>
<p>Kim Jong -un blocked the border in such an extreme way, which surprised the international community. Due to seeking development of nuclear weapons, North Korea is one of the strictest sanctions in the world. It is prohibited from selling its resources abroad, and it cannot import the fuel required for its normal operation. Many people ask, why is it a country that is already in the economy, and is willing to exert such pain to themselves?</p>
<p>"I think those leaders have determined that the new crown virus can kill many people, at least the people who are not damaging, they are worried about those who will die," Peter Ward said. He refers to the army and elites that keep their power for the Jin family. There is one of the worst medical systems around the world. The overall population is malnourished and has not been vaccinated. Many people will die for a reasonable prediction.</p>
<p>But Song Hannah said that the new crown epidemic also gave Kim Jong Un a great opportunity to re -control people's lives. "This is what he wants to do secretly for a long time," she said. "His first priority has always been as much as possible to be isolated and controlled by his people."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130086113_screenshot2023-06-14at10.01.18.png" />After making a little meager dinner, Zhiyan washed the dishes and cleaned her home. She climbed up to bed very early, hoping that she could rest better tonight. She will probably sleep more than Chanhao. The current work is very busy, and Chanhao often sleeps in the construction site.</p>
<p>However, in the relatively quiet border town of Ming Shu, she fell a little time, sitting with her family to watch TV, and used the battery that was charged during the day.</p>
<p>She especially likes watching Korean dramas, although these are prohibited. The show was sold and secretly sold through miniature SD cards. The latest episode that Ming Shu saw was about a K-Pop star appeared at the door of the family, claiming that he was his son who had been separated for many years. She said that since the border blockade, there are almost no new programs that can enter the border. In addition, the crackdown was very severe, and people became more careful.</p>
<p>She refers to the Reactionary Ideology and Culture RejectionAct adopted in December 2020. According to this law, people who smuggle foreign imaging products may be executed. Chanhao said that this is the "most terrible new law", and just watching these videos may face 10 years of imprisonment. According to the legal text obtained by "Daily North Korea", the purpose of the law is to prevent "a kind of decaying ideology that erodes our society".</p>
<p>Kim Jong -un's most worried thing is that his people understand the prosperous and free world outside their border, and wake up from the lies they hear.</p>
<p>Chanhao said that since the law was passed, foreign videos have almost disappeared. Only the younger generation dares to watch, which makes their parents extremely worried.</p>
<p>Zhiyan remembers a recent public trial in Pyongyang. Local leaders gathered together to judge a 22 -year -old man who shared Korean songs and movies. He was sentenced to 10 years and three months in the labor camp. Zhiyan said that before 2020, the trial of such cases usually only carried out quietly, and may be sentenced to one year in prison.</p>
<p>"The punishment is so much so much, and people are shocked," she said, "It's terrible, they are targeted at young people like this."</p>
<p>In 2019, former North Korean diplomat Ryu Hyun-Woo, a former North Korean diplomat, said that the formulation of the law is to ensure the loyalty of young people, because the attitude they developed is very different from their parents. "We have received a gift from the country since we were young, but under the leadership of Kim Jong -un, the country has not given the people anything," he said. Young people now question what the country has given them.</p>
<p>Zhiyan said that in order to implement this law, the government has established a group and "relentlessly" fights everywhere to fight anything that is considered anti -socialism. "People don't trust each other now, and the fear is huge."</p>
<p>Zhiyan said she was taken to ask for this new law. Since she was questioned, she no longer revealed her true thoughts to others. She is now more afraid of people than before.</p>
<p>For Professor Andreilankov, who has studied North Korea for 40 years, this trust is worrying. "If people don't trust each other, they can't talk about resistance," he said. "This means that North Korea can maintain stability and exist in the next few years or even decades."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-18T10-16-59.000Z/_130086115_screenshot2023-06-14at10.01.52.png" />In January 2023, the government passed another law to prohibit people from using vocabulary reminiscent of Korean dialects. Violation of this law may also constitute a death penalty in the most extreme circumstances. Zhiyan said that the law is now too much to remember, and those who are taken away may not know which one they have been accused. If they want to ask, the prosecutor will only answer, "You don't need to know which law you have committed."</p>
<p>"The three Korean people who interviewed the interviews confirmed a amazing point of view. North Korea is more high and totalitarian than in the past at any time." Korea's Sokeel Park said, "This is the disaster tragedy that is currently being performed."</p>
<p>Recently, there are signs that the authorities may be open to the border. Ming Shu and Chanhao, who lived near the border, said that most of them in the town had vaccinated the new crown vaccine -they estimated that it was a Chinese vaccine -in Pyongyang, Zhiyan said that a considerable number of people had already vaccinated two shots Essence In addition, customs data shows that the country is allowing some grains and flour to be imported from China again, which is likely to be to alleviate the shortage and avoid famine that many people are afraid of.</p>
<p>The control system that appears during the popular period is likely to be consolidated. This will make it more difficult for us to understand this country, and it is a pity that it will be much more difficult to understand everything that happens to what they have been instilled. "</p>
<p>However, there are subtle signs that the suffering that this regime has caused people in the past three years will not have no impact on itself. Chanhao said that on working days, people would not think of changing this system too much. They all focused on finding a way to eat dinner every day. If you have something to eat, you are happy. But as soon as he weekends, he, Ming Shu and Zhiyan had time to reflect."The country tells us that we are inhabited in the arms of our mother, but what kind of mother will kill him because the child does not want to starve in China because the child does not want to hungry?" He asked. "Before the new crown, people's views on Kim Jong -un are positive," Ming Shu said. "But now, almost everyone is dissatisfied."</p>
<p>Zhiyan remembers that when Kim Jong -un and US President Trump met with nuclear weapons in 2018, she was full of hope and joy, thinking that maybe she could go to foreign travel soon. The negotiations have been ruptured later. Since then, Kim Jong -un has continued to use its limited finances for nuclear weapons development and reject all diplomatic proposals in the international community. In 2022, he conducted a record number of missile tests.</p>
<p>"We were deceived," Zhiyan said, "Border blockade made our lives back 20 years. We feel deeply betrayed."</p>
<p>"The people never want this endless weapon development, it brings hardships to generations," she sighed.</p>
<p>Chanhao accused the international community. "The United States and the United Nations seem to be stupid," he said, questioning why they still proposed to negotiate with Kim Jong -un, it is clear that he would not give up nuclear weapons. On the contrary, the construction worker also hopes that the United States will attack his country.</p>
<p>"We can live only through war and get rid of the entire leadership," he said. "We must end this regime in some ways."</p>
<p>Ming Shu agreed to this. "If you start war, people will abandon our government," she said, "This is reality."</p>
<p>But Yan Yan hopes to have a simple way. She wants to live in a society where people are not hungry, neighbors can live, and they do not need to monitor each other. They can eat rice in three meals a day.</p>
<p>When we heard her news last time, she did not have enough food to feed the child.</p>
<p>We submit our survey results to the Korean government. The representative of the country's embassy in London said: "The information you collected is not exactly in line with the facts, because it is a testimony from the forces of the Anti -North Korea's Democratic People's Republic. One, and unswervingly maintain the well -being of the people. "</p>
<p>"Even in the face of the test and challenge, the people's well -being is our first priority."</p>

<p>Description: On the morning of June 18, US Secretary of State Brills arrived in Beijing and held a five and a half hour meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. This is also the first US Secretary of State's visit to China after 2018, and it is also the highest -level American officials who visited China since 2021. However, Brinten's trip is unlikely to cause major turns in the cold Sino -US relations.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Brinchen(Antony shine)It should have been visited China in February this year, but it delayed its trip because of a suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States. He landed in Beijing on the morning of June 18, local time, and met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang at the Diaoyutai State Hotel in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters reporter, Qin Gang greeted Brinken at the door of a villa in the National Hotel, instead of greeting in the house as usual. As soon as the two entered the door, they conducted a brief English conversation. Qin Gang asked Brinken's long -distance travel situation, and then shook hands in front of the national flag of China and the United States. After entering a conference room, journalists were briefly allowed to enter the photo, but neither foreign minister did not make any remarks in front of the reporter.</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and spokesman, posted a photo of Qin Gang and Brinken with Twitter, and sent a text "I hope this talk can help guide <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美关系/t-17455900">Sino -US relations</a>Return to the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Bali. "Hua Chunying also attended the Diaoyutai State Guest House.</p>
<p>In November last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Biden held a bilateral meeting during the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. He had a straightforward dialogue on issues such as Taiwan and North Korea. Essence</p>
<p>Blint will stay in China for two days. It is expected that Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the CPC Central Committee on June 19, may meet Xi Jinping. The trip to Brinkon is to seek to establish open and lasting communication channels between the United States and China to ensure that the strategic confrontation between the two countries will not evolve into a conflict. The outside world expects that Brintken's talks with China can pave the way for more US -China bilateral exchanges in the next few months, including US Treasury Secretary Yellen.(Janet Yelle), Minister of Commerce Raymond Duo(Religious ramond)Possible access. At the same time, Brosky may also be committed to laying a foundation for Biden and Xi Jinping at a meeting at the multilateral summit later this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T10-27-00Z/65952775_404.jpg" />After the meeting with Qin Gang, Brinkee will meet Wang Yi next, and may be traveled to Jun Ping.</p>
<h3><strong> Management and control risk </strong></h3>
<p>On June 17, US President Biden said that he was looking forward to meeting Xi Jinping within a few months. When talking about the balloon incident in February this year, Biden said that Chinese leaders may not know the specific position and use of the balloon at the time.</p>
<p>The balloon incident allowed Sino -US relations that had just recovered because of the meeting with Xi Jinping at the time <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美外长通话-秦刚暗指双边关系困难责任在美方/a-65910231">re -slide into the bottom of the valley</a>, And directly caused Brinken to postpone the visits to China in February. In the next few months, high -level exchanges between the two countries were almost interrupted; and despite the United States repeatedly tried, China was unwilling to conduct regular military talks with Washington.</p>
<p>An accompanying senior officials in the United States State Department told Reuters reporters when they stopped Tokyo to supplement fuel that both the United States and China now realize that both countries do need to have high -level communication channels. "Relations between the two countries are at an important node. I think it is very important to reduce the risk of misjudgment, or as Chinese friends often say: to prevent the spiral of the relationship between the relationship between the two countries from falling down."</p>
<p>At present, there are major differences in the fields of China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, Trade, Semiconductor, Human Rights and other fields. The outside world is worried that any form of friction upgrade may have a significant negative impact on global financial markets, trade, and supply chains.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T10-27-00Z/64610458_404.jpg" />The balloon incident in February directly led Brinken to delay in visiting China</p>
<h3><strong> US side reduces expectations </strong></h3>
<p>At a press conference on June 16, Brinken once said that the three main goals to go to Beijing this time are: establishing <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688">crisis management and control</a>Mechanisms, promote the protection of the interests of the United States and allies and directly talk about concerns about issues and explore potential cooperation areas. Brinken said he would also mention the issue of being detained in China in China, and the United States believed that there was political motivation.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department's website pointed out that Brinkens will meet with senior Chinese officials during his visit to China. Blint will discuss the importance of "maintaining open communication channels" and "responsible handling Sino -US relations". Blinden will also mention issues such as Sino -US concern, global and regional affairs, and the possibility of cooperation in cooperation facing together.</p>
<p>Other US officials said that further restoration of commercial flights between the United States and China may also be on the discussion agenda. However, in the telephone briefing earlier this week, the US official <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯訪華在即-美不期望雙邊關係突破/a-65917669">trying to dilute</a>The high expectations of the outside world's visit to Brinken believes that "it is unlikely to make breakthroughs in any major issue."</p>

<p>Reuters on June 18 quoted a number of official US sources familiar with relevant discussions disclosure that, in view of the current state of US -China relations in the worst of decades, whether the U.S. government is allowed to let the US -China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement "Agreement on the United States and China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement"(STA)Discussion in failure later this year.</p>
<p>On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Brills held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing. The outside world expects whether both parties can achieve a breakthrough in any two countries. In fact, Brincken was the first US Secretary of State to visit Beijing in five years. The above -mentioned news about whether the scientific and technological cooperation agreement can be renewed also highlights the differences among the US policy makers, or the consequences of contact with China, a risk that may follow the power of competitors that may follow different rules?</p>
<p>It is reported that the United States and China signed this milestone "Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement" when establishing diplomatic relations in 1979. The agreement has been renewed every five years since then. The current agreement will expire on August 27.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that the above -mentioned agreement helps China to grow into a technology and military power, but the concerns of Chinese technology and business achievements have also caused questioning whether the agreement should continue. Some government officials have said that although the mainstream views of the United States seem to support renewal, more and more government officials and legislators believe that considering the competition between the United States and China big.</p>
<p>Gragel, chairman of the China House of China China Issues Special Committee, said, "Prolonging the scientific and technological agreement between the United States and China will only further endanger our research and intellectual property rights, and the government must make this outdated agreement fail."</p>
<p>As of now, neither the US State Department and the National Security Commissioner have not comment on the above news. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United States, said that Chinese officials contacted the United States a year ago and discussed the agreement with the United States, and hoped that the United States would accelerate the internal review before the agreement expired.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) "Dry mango" is a homophonic vocabulary used by netizens during the election in Taiwan, which means that the votes are urged by stimulating the "feeling of the country". Taiwan's "report" publishing article "What exactly what Xi Jinping sells" dry mango "to do", the author Zhuoran pointed out that according to the logic of the CCP official media, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论习近平的极限思维是什么意思/a-65909139">the extreme situation in Xi Jinping's heart probably refers to the final battle between China and the United States</a>So what would his "worst plan"? On June 5th, Xi Jinping inspected Inner Mongolia, convened cadres to meet again to emphasize extreme thinking again, singing his dual -cycle theory, claiming that the rice bowl should be brought in his own hands. , Live better!"With this highest instructions, the leaders of all provinces and cities have made various strange movements such as" retreating forests and returning farming "and" rice up the mountains ", which made the people resentment.</p>
<p>The article said that Xi Jinping's sense of death should not be worrying. After the clearing of Lingyatan, the housing market is still dying. Both imports and exports have declined significantly. No matter how faint Xi Jinping is, you should also know that it is impossible to keep up with technology to maintain stability.</p>
<p>Many people are curious when the CCP is here. The author believes that its large limit will be deeply bound to the housing market. The CCP's finance relies on the sale of public land, but the residential houses only buy the right to use and have no rights. It is equivalent to paying 70 years of renting for the government at one time. The Chinese commercial housing system was launched in 1979, and the showdown is not far away. Once the people awakened, when the CCP collapsed, Xi Jinping probably understood this. Before the limit came, finding a US to the United States may be the best choice for the contradiction.</p>

<h3><strong> "May Rongguang return to Hong Kong"? The Chinese Communist Party wants to pinch this golden bird </strong></h3>
<p>Taiwan's "Wind Media" published an article "Beijing will not hesitate to pinch the golden silk birds".

Don't Beijing worry about this negative effect? The author believes that Chrispatten, the last governor of Hong Kong, provides a answer.</p>
<p>In a recent discussion, Pengding said that instead of regarding Hong Kong as a Chinese golden chicken, it is better to be regarded as a golden bird. "I always think that Hong Kong should be the golden bird in the pit, let everyone know whether the power of China is getting larger and larger, whether Hong Kong can really maintain such a free society." He wrote in the "Hong Kong Diary" in the "Hong Kong Diary".

Singapore's "Duan Media" published an article "Facing the charges of sexual assault, should the public" suspect "? Can public opinion be neutral? ", The author Lin Yubo believes that the Chinese Communist Party will indeed use the" sex scandal "as a means to discredit the different people, but the allegations of Wang Dan's sexual harassment are not the groundwriter of the third party, nor is it not the arrest and persecution of the television to plead guilty to the television. The incident of "being priested" came from the party's own statement, and it was more detailed statement by the parties. It is unreasonable to depict the parties as "unsatisfactory", which is a typical slander of sexual violence experience, especially the slander of sexual violence experience in power relationships.

Because in the face of revenge justice, "suspicious crime is not" important-even if 1,000 defendants are allowed to be free, one innocent person is not allowed to be punished. But we should be included in "restramed justice"), "Repairing Justice" does not regard the criminals as a natural wicked, but instead to test how the social environment makes him a criminal and review what kind of culture makes sexual assault and what kind of culture makes the victims the victims.

<p>The romantic dream of becoming a "digital nomad" appeared at the beginning of the Internet. More than 30 years ago, riding a computer -based modified bicycle through the US pioneer Steven K • Roberts(Steven KRoberts)In 1994, he wrote that a "virtual technology tourist fleet composed of travelers from all over the world ...(Virtual TechnomadicFlotilla)"Because" once you transfer the essence of your life to the Internet, the physical location becomes unrelated. "</p>
<p>But it was not until the era of the new crown epidemic that the word was really popular. The epidemic created a perfect environment: after the boring blockade, the workers wanted to change; the company had realized that they could trust employees to complete their work remote; countries relying on tourism in the tourism industry urgently needed visitors in other places. Suddenly, it seems that any white -collar worker can work anywhere they want to go -not just a freelancer (some of them have done this), and ordinary office workers can. Dozens of countries have launched a "digital visa visa", which uses a formal system to fix this trend and use it.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体肖尔茨邀请李强6月访德/a-65431157">Chinese State Council Prime Minister Li Qiang will lead multiple ministers to visit Berlin on June 19</a>Participate in the seventh round of German and Chinese government negotiations, the motto of the consultation is the "Gemeinsam Nachhaltighandeln". At present, the "reserves" between Beijing and Berlin seem to be shrinking. This is clearly performed during the meeting of Borispistorius and Chinese Defense Director Li Shangfu in Shangli -La, Singapore. German fighter pilots come to train Chinese Air Force pilots](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/法律存灰色地带-德国担心退役飞行员与中国分享情报/a-65868166)way of doing. Thorstenbenner at the Berlin Think Tank Global Public Police Research Institute (GPPI) believes that the incident shows that "we must be sober because Beijing will use all opportunities to obtain key technologies and capabilities to strengthen its own industry and military. Base".</p>
<h3>The fuel that may cause conflict is increasing</h3>
<p>Whether it is technology outflow, or in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Russia, Beijing still insists on "friendship like a rock" with Moscow, the increasing situation of the Taiwan Strait, and the pressure on China to China: between Germany, the conflict " "Fuel" is growing. And further intensified due to the geopolitical competition between China and the United States.</p>
<p>At the same time, China is still the most important trading partner in Germany, which is the seventh consecutive year. In 2022, the total trade between the two countries reached nearly 300 billion euros, of which Germany's trade deficit with China exceeded 80 billion euros.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国出台首份国家安全战略-中国是对手也是伙伴/a-65912004">Background reading: Germany introduced the first national security strategy China is an opponent and partner</a>Therefore, this relationship is not only important, but also complicated. The contradictions of Germany and China relations can be seen from this fact that in the official documents of Germany, China is also described as partners, competitors and strategic opponents. In the past, Berlin emphasized the partnership. Government consultation since 2011 has witnessed this: This high -level intergovernmental dialogue is only carried out with particularly intimate partners. In 2014, German -China relations were even mentioned to the height of "comprehensive strategic partnership". But since then, the atmosphere has changed in the capital of Berlin and other European countries. The focus of the relationship has obviously began to turn to strategic competition.</p>
<h3>Berlin wants to say goodbye to "everything as the old"</h3>
<p>Barbarapongratz, a Chinese think tank (Merics Research Center), Berlin, predicts that this steering will also affect the seventh round of German and Chinese government consultations. The German -China relations expert said: "The German government wants to say goodbye to‘ everything ’. Some signals have shown that compared with in the past, government consultations will have few big scenes and will not be concluded by major business contracts.”</p>
<h3>How can the German Foreign Minister visit China for "correction" for Macron?</h3>
<p>In the joint ruling agreement of the ruling alliance consisting of the Social Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, it can already feel the new trend of Germany's policy on China. The agreement was mentioned 12 times in China, which also included in the key word entries of strategic competition and cooperation with European partners. The agreement wrote: "In order to achieve our value and interests in the competition with China, we need to formulate a comprehensive Chinese strategy in Germany under the common European Union's policy framework. We hope to continue intergovernmental consultation And make it more European. "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Merics experts Pon Gelaz concluded that so far, "so far," in response to Germany's relations with China, Chinese strategy, or government consultation, it has not really discussed. "Except for the Chinese strategy announced by Berlin, it has not yet been introduced. The German national security strategy is pushed again and again. The Chinese strategy of Berlin is based on the national security strategy, and the latter's repeated delay is also due to the differences between the internal opinions of the ruling alliance.</p>
<p>Berlin political scholar Eberhardsandschneider believes that the atmosphere of talks is "relatively favorable." The Chinese expert said: "If a document is now published in China, it can be imagined that China's self -esteem will cause government consultation to be canceled." He also said, "Different from the German government is an open secret. China. Know this too. "</p>
<h3>Different</h3>
<p>This is not surprising, because governing partners will also argue in public, especially between the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party. The Green Party claims that it is valuable and adopted a tough tone to China, while the Social Democratic Party focuses on economic interests at the same time. For example, when the Green Party Foreign Minister Annalenabaerbock visited Beijing for public confrontation with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in April, the conservatives of the Communist Party Parliament Party issued a position on Germany's policy on China. Members call for a pragmatic Chinese policy in the document and warn not to adopt anti -China strategy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T12-20-00Z/65915653_401.jpg" />There are differences in the German government's policy within the German government</p>
<p>Merics experts Pon Gelaz said that there are huge differences in foreign ministers Belbak and Prime Minister Shulz, and party politics is the characteristic of the current policy of China. "But if you listen carefully, you will notice that they have differences in tone. But the difference between the information they pass is not much," said the expert of China.</p>
<p>The German -China government consultation will be presided over by Prime Minister Shulz, which may make difficult issues at least friendly. Chinese issue expert Sand Schneider said he did not have much specific expectations for the actual results. For him, the most important thing is that the consultation was held after three years of personal contact. He said: "I agree with those Chinese colleagues who talk to me: everyone reunited together, which is imminent. Not only at a formal meeting, but also in the well -known tea dinner time, communicate with each other. This will change. The atmosphere may make the 'common action -long action' possible, at least in some areas. "</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) more than 40 years ago, on January 31, 1979, when the leader of the Chinese Communist Party Deng Xiaoping visited the United States, he signed the China -US Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement with then US President Carter when he visited the United States. This landmark agreement released a strong signal at the time, indicating that even the opponent can still put on the dispute and make common efforts.</p>
<p>At present, the US -China bilateral relations have been in the worst state in the past decades. Several officials familiar with Washington said that the government is postponing the US -China Science and Technology Agreement (STA) as usual later this year.</p>
<p>Although U.S. Secretary of State Brills arrived in Beijing on Sunday for the first time in US Secretary of State's visit to China for the first time, it was basically unwilling to break through the interview. Whether the Sino -US Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement continues the current setbacks, it highlights the following issues: The US government has not yet determined that the benefits of US -China cooperation have more benefits, or are they more risky? This issue is dividing the decision makers of the American politics.</p>
<p>This agreement was signed during the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China. It has been updated every 5 years since then. It has been known as the stable factors in relations between the two countries. The fields of cooperation include basic research in the fields of atmosphere, agriculture, physics, and chemistry. The development of academic and commercial exchanges in the United States and China laid the foundation.</p>
<p>These exchanges have undoubtedly promoted the process of becoming a technology and military power, but at the same time, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/走私美国海洋技术-中国商人在美遭判2年徒刑/a-59128825">American politics is concerned about the stolen science and commercial secrets of China</a>So that the agreement continued before it expired on August 27 this year.</p>

<h3>Shooting</h3>
<p>A balloon in China fluttered over the United States for a few days. On February 4, the U.S. military shot down in the coastal waters of the South Carolina. The United States has accused China of using balloons for espionage. But China said that this is just an out of control meteorological balloon.</p>

<p>It looks like fishermen are fishing a large jellyfish, but in fact, this is a group member of the US military who is responsible for dealing with explosives. This balloon has a diameter of about 61 meters, and the weight is equivalent to a small passenger aircraft.</p>

<h3>wreckage</h3>
<p>Due to the huge balloon size and uncertainty of its security, the United States eventually decided to shoot down at sea. The water depth of the balloon falling is about 15 meters. The U.S. military is trying to salvage more wreckage in order to more accurately understand the actual use of this flying object.</p>

<p>The U.S. military uses special equipment such as underwater drones to search and salvage balloon wreckage.

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>At present, the mainstream view of the American political circles seems to support extended agreements, but the opposition sound is getting higher and higher. The U.S. State Department refused to comment on this. The National Security Council also remained silent. The Chinese Embassy in Washington stated that China took the initiative to expose the agreement with the United States as early as a year ago, and said that the agreement constituted the basis of "effective" cooperation in the 40 years of the two countries.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United States, told Reuters, "As far as we know, the United States is still conducting internal review on the renewal agreement." Accelerate internal censorship. "Those who support the continuation of the agreement believe that they will stifle academic and commercial cooperation at the end of the agreement. People who support the extension of the US -China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement also believe that if there is no agreement, the United States will lose observation channels for Chinese scientific and technological progress. Denissimon, a Chinese science and technology strategy expert at the University of North Carolina, said, "whether China is a friend or an enemy, the United States, the United States It is necessary to understand what happened in China. "The opponents believed that the signing of the agreement that year made the relationship between the two countries" feel good ", but this atmosphere no longer exists.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-18T13-10-00-04-00/000000.png" />After the US Secretary of State Brillings and the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang held a closed -door talks in Beijing on Sunday, the two countries officially announced the content of the talks on the same day. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/6-06182023130642.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-18T13-10-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Associated Press Picture</p>
<p>After the US Secretary of State Brillings and the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang held a closed -door talks in Beijing on Sunday, the two countries officially announced the content of the talks on the same day.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Office of the US State Department spokesman said that Brinken and Qin Gang held a "frank, substantial and constructive talks." Brinken emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and the communication channels that maintain openness on all issues to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and misjudgment.</p>
<p>Brinken clearly stated that the United States will always defend the interests and values of the American people and cooperate with its allies and partners to promote the United States' vision of freedom, opening up and maintaining the world of international rules and order.</p>
<p>The press release stated that Brintken also raised a series of concern issues, as well as the opportunity to explore cooperation opportunities with China on a multinational issue with China on the same interests of both parties. Qin Gang expressed the importance of promoting the exchanges between the United States and China. Brinken also invited Qin Gang to continue consultation in Washington, and the two sides agreed to visit each other at the right time.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brills was originally scheduled to visit China in February this year, but was forced to cancel with the suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States and being shot down. Although the trip to Brinken is generally regarded as a journey of stable bilateral relations by the outside world, it is very low whether it can get a breakthrough. In fact, Blintken was the first US Secretary of State to visit Beijing since 2018. It is still unknown whether Brinton can meet with the CCP's leader Xi Jinping on Monday.</p>
<p>The press release of the above -mentioned talks issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day stated that Qin Gang pointed out in the meeting that the current lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sino -US relations is not in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries and does not meet the common expectations of the international community. The Chinese side has always maintained continuity and stability in the U.S. policies. It follows the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping. This should also be the spirit of the two sides, the bottom line that keeps together, and the common pursuit. China is committed to building a stable, expected and constructive Sino -US relations. It is hoped that the United States will adhere to the objective and rational cognition of China, go with China to maintain the political foundation of Sino -US relations, and deal with accidental occasional incidents in calmness, professionalism, and rational treatment. The two sides should not be able to discourage the consensus of Chairman Jinping and President Bayeng Bali, to promote Sino -US relations to stop falling and stabilize, and return to the right track.</p>
<p>Qin Gang also clarified its strict position on the core interests and major concerns of the Taiwan issue and put forward clear requirements. Qin Gang pointed out that the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue of Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk. China urges the United States to abide by the three joint communiqués of China and China and the United States. The promise really falls into practice.</p>
<p>The press release said that the two sides agreed to jointly implement the important consensus reached by the heads of state in Bali, effectively controlled different differences, and promoted dialogue exchange and cooperation; the two sides agreed to maintain high -level exchanges; the Secretary of State Brillin invited Qin Gang's State Commissioner and Foreign Minister to visit the United States. Qin Gang expressed his willingness to be willing When the two sides are convenient to visit the United States; the two parties agree to continue to promote the guidance principles of Sino -US relations; the two parties agree to continue to promote the negotiations between the Sino -US joint working group to solve the specific problems in Sino -US relations; Passenger transport flights between China and the United States are actively discussed. More students, scholars, and people in the industry are welcome to visit each other countries and provide support and convenience for this. The two sides also exchanged views on major international and regional issues that are concerned about.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted the unknown U.S. State Department officials on Sunday that Brinken expressed the desire to stabilize the relationship between the two countries and prevent competition from becoming a conflict in the meeting with Qin Gang. The official revealed that Brinken "very clearly" stated that the United States did not want to decide with China, and the two sides agreed to continue talks to make progress in many aspects.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-18T13-32-07-00-00/000000.png" />According to local officials, a hydropower project is being carried out on the Hewa River. It has been found that one of the remains involved in the construction of the workers, and 17 employees disappeared last night.</p>
<p>Another one of Taplejung, who was near the neighboring Tiepo, was found to die. Because the house was washed away by the soil flow, the three members of the same family disappeared.</p>
<p>Nepalese police spokesman Risei Ram Kandel said: "2 remains have been found, but 28 people have fallen unknown. We have strengthened search and rescue operations."</p>
<p>Mohanmani Ghimire, assistant county chief of Sankuwasabha, said that due to the damage of roads and bridges, it is difficult for rescuers to enter the affected area.</p>
<p>Jimil said: "The machinery and equipment of hydropower engineering have been washed away. There is also news that houses have been destroyed."</p>
<p>Nepal meteorological forecast warning that the rain will continue for several days and warn the river water level.</p>
<p>The monsoon rainfall from June to September of each year always causes extensive casualties and damage to Nepal in South Asian countries, but in recent years, the number of fatal floods and soil flows has increased.</p>
<p>Experts point out that climate change and large number of road construction may be the cause of these disasters.</p>

<h1>Under the shadow of China, the hopes of revival in the European photovoltaic industry are slim</h1>

<p>Description: The Russian and Ukraine War exacerbated the European energy crisis. To get rid of this dilemma, Europe is accelerating energy transformation by expanding solar power generation. However, Europe's dependence on Chinese -produced photovoltaic equipment exceeds its dependence on Russia's natural gas: more than three -quarters of solar power boards come from China.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Industry estimates that if Europe wants to revive the solar industry, it will face almost invisible obstacles. On the one hand, Chinese manufacturers have a huge scale effect and the cost advantage that follows. On the other hand, the United States also attracts few European companies with huge subsidies to transfer production capacity to the other end of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In this environment, the EU's <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/能源转型/t-17464748">Green Energy Transformation</a>Only with the "coordinated policy and financial support" can it be successful. Cornech, Chairman of the German Federal Solar Industry Association(Carstenkörnig)It is believed that in order to maintain competitiveness in Europe, they must take double measures in terms of industrial and energy policies.</p>
<p>At present, the annual total production capacity of the European solar industry is only equivalent to 8 million kilowatts of installation capacity. According to the Institute of Solar Systems, Germany's Fraunhov Research Institute(FraunhoferISE)It is estimated that the production capacity of solar equipment in Europe only accounts for only 1%of the world, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧洲绿色能源对中国有多依赖/a-61826925">China accounts for 75%</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T14-25-00Z/17677114_404.jpg" />Cornech, Chairman of the German Federal Solar Industry Association</p>
<h3><strong> Cup of Water Sales? </strong></h3>
<p>EU's Green Energy Plan(Green Deal)Set a goal: local <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/太阳能/t-41543918">solar energy</a>The industry increased its annual output to 30 million kilowatts of installation capacity by 2030. However, according to a survey by the Consulting Company Pwa, China Crystal Energy can achieve an annual capacity of 45 million kilowatts of annual capacity alone. According to the introduction of Jingke Energy's official website, the company's capacity this year is expected to reach 90 million kilowatts, which is equivalent to three times the total production capacity of the European Union in 2030. Moreover, this Chinese manufacturer has also prepared a great increase in market demand in the next few years, and its production capacity climbing speed will also greatly surpass the entire Europe.</p>
<p>International Energy Agency(IEA)In a report last November, even if Chinese manufacturers are facing the same human, energy, and upstream product costs as European manufacturers, they can rely on the scale effect to achieve a cheaper manufacturing cost than smaller competitors. "Since 2011, China has invested more than 50 billion US dollars for photovoltaic equipment production, equivalent to 10 times that of Europe, and created 300,000 jobs in the entire industrial chain."</p>
<p>According to the estimates of people in the solar industry, the manufacturing cost of the aircraft capacity of the aircraft in China is between 0.17 and 0.18 US dollars. Munich solar photovoltaic exhibition held this week(Intersolar)On, French solar expert Ma Song(GaetanMasson)It is also pointed out that China is now working hard to further reduce costs to 0.15 cents per watt, "Chinese generally said."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-18T14-25-00Z/57913313_404.jpg" />A solar factory in Hai'an, Jiangsu</p>
<h3><strong> Electricity price is high </strong></h3>
<p>However, the manufacturing cost of European photovoltaic equipment is about twice that of Chinese products. Ma Song said: "Our cost is much higher than that of the Chinese. This is not only the issue of investment and operating expenses, but also a matter of lack of competitiveness."</p>
<p>There are 5 steps for the production of a photovoltaic power generation board: First, to produce polysilicon with quartz sand, which is the basic raw material for photovoltaic power generation boards. Then, the polycrystalline silicon is made into a silicon ingot, the silicon ingot is then cut into a silicon piece, the silicon wafer is assembled into a polycrystalline battery, and finally assembled with the inverter as a photovoltaic power generation system.</p>
<p>The first step in the production of polysilicon is very high. In Europe, high electricity prices have significantly increased the manufacturing cost of photovoltaic equipment. Cornich, chairman of the German Federal Solar Industry Association, said: "Without low industrial electricity prices, the European solar industry is difficult to successfully revive." He also pointed out that it is not enough to achieve the goal of industrial rejuvenation alone by reducing electricity prices. Therefore, energy policy requires energy policy "Double -oriented approach" with industrial policy.</p>
<h3>How clean is photovoltaic power generation?</h3>
<h3><strong> Government subsidy creation advantage </strong></h3>
<p>In the United States, the Bayeng government is providing huge tax benefits for the solar industry with the "Angle Act". Europe has no similar incentive measures, so its investment attraction is far less attractive than the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Elford, chairman of Swiss photovoltaic equipment manufacturer Meyerbog(GunterErfurt)It is also stated at the Munich Solar Photovoltaic Show that if any measures are not taken to protect European local manufacturers, it will not be able to attract investors, and the photovoltaic industry in Europe will be difficult.</p>
<p>At the same time, almost all European solar industry executives exhibited in Europe said that they are willing to produce photovoltaic equipment in Europe or order in European -made photovoltaic equipment because "no one wants to see a situation that depends on China."</p>
<p>Tarft, president of Baywa RE(Matthiastif)It means that the supply chain diversification is hoped to be realized in the region. "This is not only the strong interest of our developers, but also the interests of manufacturers and power companies." He pointed out that European manufacturers do not lack sales opportunities, because "the market is large enough to establish an annual capacity of 30 million kilowatts installation capacity European photovoltaic industry. "</p>
<p>Tafte believes that Asian manufacturers have achieved a competitive advantage with a better framework environment and scale effect, but European manufacturers "still have technical advantages", and the "supply chain of the products made in Europe is completely transparent. For production, I think this will be welcomed by many terminal consumers. "</p>
<p>However, the consensus of the industry is: without government subsidies and support, the European solar industry cannot revive. Tavter also acknowledged this. He took the United States "Angle Act" as an example: "To make the industry competitive, there is a need for predictable fiscal incentives."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) in the next few years, the industrial production capacity of Western and South Europe will continue to shrink. About 30%of these regions plan to reduce labor costs and production costs in 5 years. This is the main content of a survey of Horváth, a corporate consulting company summarized by Agence France -Presse.</p>
<p>According to this survey, many companies in Western and South Europe will migrate factories to North America or Asian countries. Relevant companies believe that the development of enterprises can still be realized, but the location is not in Europe. The key factor in determining the corporate strategy is the cost of labor, followed by lack of labor and professionals. In view of the above factors, the situation in Eastern Europe is relatively good. Because the cost of labor is relatively low, 58%of companies plan to continue their investment in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>However, more enterprises have invested vision and funds to North America and Asia. 71%of companies and 79%of companies plan to expand in North America or <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/2023年亚洲新兴国家经济何去何从/a-64270700">India's production capacity</a>Essence</p>

<p>This investigation asked more than 430 executives for international operations companies, of which more than 230 were industrial manufacturers. The annual output value of more than 1 billion euros.</p>
<p>Ralfsauter, the person in charge of the Horváth investigation, issued a warning that "in the next few years, production bases and industrial chains in Western and South Europe will be transferred to North America and Asia." The investigation called on Germany and other Central European countries to quickly improve the framework conditions in the fields of "raw materials and energy prices and professional talents, and pointed out that once the enterprise moves out, permanentness will no longer return.(Agence France -Presse and other)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-18T14-35-10-00-00/000184783_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p><strong> [Editor's note] With the continuous development of China's local capital, China's situation in foreign investment has also changed. China's local capital is gradually forming its own multinational brands, and this brand effect has begun to achieve results in stable exports and foreign trade performance. To this end, FT Chinese Network recently organized the "Road to China's Foreign Trade Transformation" topic. In the next series of articles, we will tell how representative companies in different provinces in China will form their own multinational brands in different segments in different segments. Essence Edit, contact Yan MAN.YAN@ftchinese.com. </strong></p>
<p>The reason why we focused on the electronic information industry in the previous article, not only because the industry contributed nearly a quarter of China's exports, but also because this industry is crucial to the central and western China. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the exports of the central and western provinces have grown at high speed driven by electronic products, and have become a rising star in China's foreign trade industry.</p>
<p>According to the Customs Statistics Monthly Report, the export volume of the Twelve provinces and municipalities autonomous regions in the western provinces and cities from 2014 to 2022 increased from US $ 16.9 billion to $ 326 billion (an average annual increase of 9.2%). 374.6 billion US dollars (an average annual increase of 12.2%). The central and western regions increased, and the share in exports across the country increased from 13.22%to 19.50%. At the same time, 10 provinces and cities in the East increased from 1958.8 billion yuan to 2812.1 billion yuan, with an average annual growth of only 4.6%.</p>
<p>The exports of high -speed growth in the central and western regions reflect the gradually moved to the local area. We mentioned in the previous articles that starting from the investment and setting up factories in mainland China in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, two typical geese arrays have begun to appear in the Asia -Pacific industrial structure: one extends to Southeast Asian countries, and the other extends to mainland China. The geese that extended towards mainland China initially settled in the eastern coastal provinces and cities; and with the rapid development of more than ten years in the 1990s, some provinces in the eastern coastal began to think about the issue of industrial transformation.</p>
<p>In the eastern coastal province's thinking on the issue of industrial transformation, the point of Guangdong, which is the largest province of China, is the most representative. In 2008, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government officially proposed the "Decision of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Government on Promoting Industrial Transfer and Labor Transfer" documents. Essence</p>
<p>The original intention of "Teng cage to change birds" is to transfer the labor -intensive industries of the Pearl River Delta to the northwest of Guangdong. However, this policy in China that year aroused thousands of waves and aroused major discussions on the industrial transfer and business environment. The labor -intensive industries of the eastern coast are obviously facing key issues such as land shortage and rising costs. However, in addition to the eastern coastal provinces, what are the choices of entrepreneurs who want to exhibit the great exhibition?</p>
<p>Part of the central and western provinces obviously saw the opportunity.</p>
<p>Here we need to make a background introduction for everyone. Let's think about "where to build a factory" from the perspective of a businessman -For foreign trade merchants, the most troublesome and variables in the entire business process should be the long -distance transportation of goods.</p>
<p>The earliest trade needs to rely on land logistics (like the Silk Road of the year). In today's society, long -distance land logistics often has to be very complicated through multiple countries along the way, and the transfer procedures are very complicated. The logistics time and cost of logistics are also very high. In contrast, the Hai Road Logistics Bank passes through the Gonghai without repeating the customs clearance. The procedures are relatively convenient and convenient. Therefore, we can see that most of the developed cities are often adjacent to the ocean or rivers that can travel. For example, the Yangtze River Delta is the closest place to North America from the sea, and the Pearl River Delta is the closest place to Europe from the sea from the sea.</p>
<p>In contrast, the requirements for geographical location are the lowest -as long as there is a small piece of airport, the goods can be delivered through the aircraft. However, due to the high freight of its unit weight, for export goods with low value (volume) value of most units, the proportion of shipping costs calculated in weight (volume) will account for too high the total price of the goods. Therefore, it is too expensive for most products.</p>
<p>But unlike other export categories, electronic products have a typical feature -the unit weight price is extremely high. It is not difficult to calculate the packaging of the laptop, and it is not difficult to sell tens of thousands of dollars. More than a thousand yuan of goods are put in the Chinese export industry, I am afraid it is difficult to find the second one.</p>
<p>This feature makes the freight of electronic products accounted for a small proportion compared to the price of the product. The merchant has a strong motivation to use air transportation -the price of less than 1%of the more can be reduced by more than 50%. It's a good deal. Therefore, what we can see is that China's aviation freight industry and electronic product manufacturing industry have almost developed simultaneously -the success of China's electronic product manufacturing industry, accompanied by Hong Kong (world No. 1) and Shanghai (the third world). The success of the Great Freight Hub Airport.</p>
<p>Electronic products use air transportation to the site of electronic manufacturers to bring a huge change -the construction of electronic product factories does not need to depend on the ocean as other foreign trade export factories. For the central and western provinces, this is undoubtedly an industry that is long -term and avoids the shortcomings.</p>
<p>At the same time, the industrial transfer of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan enterprises in mainland China has almost no obstacles in communication -for more than 20 years of "pushing" work, it has made most Chinese people communicate in Mandarin, which greatly reduces from the east to the east. The communication cost of transferring industries to the central and western regions.</p>
<p>Therefore, let's talk about the topic of industrial transfer. Realizing that the geographical location is no longer a shortcoming, the central and western provinces and cities have begun to strive to take the settlement of electronic product assembly plants with the existing Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan entrepreneurs investing in the existing coastal coast. The transfer of Foxconn's leading enterprise is very representative. In August 2010, Foxconn built factories in Henan, Sichuan, and Chongqing to produce smartphones, tablets and laptops, respectively.</p>
<p>In the process of industrial transfer in the central and western provinces, the old saying "want to be rich, build the road first" is still applicable. We just mentioned that the transportation of electronic products often requires strong support of aviation logistics. To this end, local governments often make heavy funds, attracting airlines to settle in the local area -for example, in 2014, Henan Civil Aviation Development Investment Group Co., Ltd. (Henan Aviation Investment) acquired 35%of the Cargolux (Cargolux) and invited Luxembourg Freight Airlines to Establish a second base.</p>
<p>Among them, the development of the three provinces and cities of Henan, Sichuan, Anhui, and Chongqing is very representative -they have become the production town of the world's laptops, tablets and smartphones, and produced half of the world's laptop computers. Two iPad and nearly half of the iPhone. Today, these three provinces and cities are ranked in the top four in the exports of the central and western provinces and cities across the country. Although there is still a gap with the Eastern provinces, the export processing industry has brought great changes to the local area.With the end of this article, our series of articles about Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan entrepreneurs investing in mainland China also come to an end. In the next article, we will focus on the narrow sense of foreign investment, that is, the process of investing in the industry in China in China. We will start from China's important industries today -since 1984, the joint venture automobile industry has been in China for nearly 40 years. From the initial satisfaction of the domestic market, to the small -scale exports to foreign countries, and now to start large -scale exports, foreign investment in the Chinese automotive industry may confirm the importance of the business environment from the other side.</p>

<p>Economic data and expectations of all parties show that the task facing the Sino -German government in Berlin on June 20 is very arduous.</p>
<p>The German Chamber of Commerce (AHK) conducted a "fast survey in the post -epidemic era" in mid -May in mid -May. The survey results show that because market development is slower than expected and continuous geopolitical tensions, so that German companies are in China to China The business confidence of the market is not as optimistic as the original hope. Among them, more than half of the interviewed German companies remained pessimistic about this year's industry expectations, and the industry development is expected to remain unchanged or worsen in 2023. Last year, 22%of companies are expected to decrease by more than 5%in 2023. This year, the proportion of companies holding this expectation increased to 32%. 54.9%of the company plans to increase investment in China in the next two years, an increase of four percentage points from last year, but far below the pre -level level. The first three reasons for not investing are low expectations of the market, continuous geopolitical tensions, and believe that China is seeking economy dependence. As for the reasons for continuing investment, 62.4%of the interviewed enterprises said to maintain their competitiveness in the Chinese market. 48%look forward to benefiting from the growth potential of the market. 17.7%wants to reduce investment. Annual level. In the case of lack of confidence, companies on the one hand are localized in the Chinese market, and on the other hand, they seek diversification in other countries.</p>
<p>In the expectation of the upcoming government consultation, 45%of the interviewed enterprises expect the Chinese government to give more legal guarantees. 60%hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in terms of decarburization, intelligent manufacturing and travel. 76.4%of the interviewed enterprises have stated that they have been affected by the excessive procrastinating business visa issued by Chinese employees to Germany.</p>
<p>In addition to the end of the new crown and clearing policy, the inaccessible import and export data of China in May and the incompatible emotions caused by European investment trends in Germany also showed that the economic development of the two countries is closely related.</p>
<p>Different from the data of the Chinese Customs General Administration of Customs and websites in the country's major media and websites, unlike the title of "my country's imports and exports in the first five months of this year, which increases by 4.7%year -on -year", the German news agency DPA, which was widely reproduced by German media, reported that "China Export May in May is year -on -year year -on -year year -on -year The focus on the decline of 7.5%"expressed concerns about the economic growth of the world's second largest economy and the prospects of German enterprises in China. DPA reported that in May, the contraction of China's imports for the second consecutive month showed the weakness of China's domestic market. Although imports in May decreased by 4.5%year -on -year lower than that of expert expectations, the data used last year was originally low. Last year, China ’s largest port Shanghai Port was in a stagnant state because of the control. The report pointed out that the reasons for decreased exports in China are the lack of vitality in the global market. High inflation, rising interest rates, and high energy prices have reduced the demand for "Made in China".</p>
<p>According to data from the General Administration of Customs, according to the US dollar, in May this year, China import and export 5011.9 billion U.S. dollars, a year -on -year decrease of 6.2%. Among them, the exports were 283.5 billion US dollars, a year -on -year decrease of 7.5%; imports were US $ 217.69 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 4.5%. In terms of Sino -German import and export trade, China ’s imports from Germany have decreased by 3.9%compared with the same period last year, and exports to Germany even decreased by 8.3%.</p>
<p>Rhodium Group and Merics issued a report from the Chinese country in May in May in Europe. In 2022, China's direct investment in the European Union and the United Kingdom reached the lowest ten years, down to 2013, a 22%decrease from 2021. The main reason is that because European countries have tightened the review of China's investment, corporate mergers and acquisitions have decreased. According to the study, as of the end of March, the German Ministry of Economic and Climate Protection launched an in -depth review of 11 investment, of which 10 started from China and another from Russia.</p>
<p>The Chinese EU Chamber of Commerce Chairman Jergwuttke used "terrible" to describe the investment trend in an interview with the media before he stepped down. He advocates a safety review in sensitive areas, but in Europe with insufficient technical fields, Europe should support Chinese investment and learn from China. Woodker said that he was welcomed by the highest specifications of local governments when leading the European corporate delegation to China, and the localities did their best to attract and retain the investment of European enterprises. The contrast to the formation was that the active actions from the central government were too small. Woodker mentioned that the Chinese EU Chamber of Commerce made 1,000 suggestions on the Chinese government in a 430 -page position document. He said that many problems have been existed for many years, but there are no signs of solving.</p>
<p>What's more, Germany has fallen into decline, and the hope of recovery in the short term is slim. In the first quarter of this year, Germany had re -economic shrinkage in the previous quarter, thus entering the technical economic recession. In the case of high inflation and high energy prices, some German companies will want to rest on the Chinese market.</p>
<p>The German chemical giant BASF's performance report in the first quarter of this year shows that BASF's global sales decreased by 13.4%year -on -year, while sales in China decreased by 28.5%year -on -year. Although BAARTINBRUDERMüller uses "turbulent" to describe the economic situation at the moment, he hopes the growth of the second half of the year in the Chinese market and the automotive industry. At the annual shareholders' meeting at the end of April, facing the doubts of someone's investment strategy in BASF China, Bo Mule responded so that China is the world's largest chemical market, and the volume will soon be greater than the sum of Europe and the United States. Experts conducted in -depth analysis of opportunities and risks in China. The analysis results were significantly greater than risks. Another reason given by Bo Mule is that the profitability of the German and European markets is worrying. The profitability of the Chinese market is very large. BASF wants to use the growth of China to make up for the losses in the European market.</p>
<p>Not only the BASF family is expected. According to the "South Germany" report, the head of the German Business Conference Torrell(Vokeker Trier)It is said that China will help Germany to barely survive the economic recession. Treier said that although for German companies, China has no advantage in the global investment destination competition, especially compared with the United States, but he is still optimistic. 5%.</p>
<p>Prior to the Sino -German government consultation meeting on June 20, Terrell and Chairman of the German Industry and Commerce Conference Adrian(Peter Adrian)Meet with Chinese government representatives. According to DPA reports, the two sides have a "constructive critical" dialogue on the future economic relations between the two countries, discussing specific content, including the results of the investigation of market confidence in the Walted Enterprise Market mentioned in the previous article. According to the "Nanda will", Terrell emphasized when meeting with the government on the government that the German economic circles' understanding of the Sino -German relations is different from the German politics. The emphasis is "partner". Trerer said that his meeting in Beijing gave him confidence and believed that both parties intended to deal with the problem in the upcoming government's consultation.Since the beginning of this year, the changes in the Russian War, the situation in Taiwan, and the German route to China have been unstable factor in Sino -German relations. It is difficult to say what extent this consultation will promote Sino -German relations. Adrian, chairman of the German Industry and Commerce Conference, said that the Sino -German government consultation was the first offline meeting after the online meeting in 2021. "This is really rare."</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve ’s interest rate interest conference ended on the 14th, and the Monetary Policy Committee decided to maintain interest rates at a range of 5-5.25%. This is the first meeting since the start-up interest rate hike cycle in March 2022. In a policy statement, the Fed stated that "maintaining interest rates unchanged can give the committee the opportunity to evaluate more economic information and its monetary policy meanings in the future." In the summary of economic forecasting, the committee's prediction of economic growth at the end of 2023 has increased. The median number has increased significantly from 0.4%in March to 1%, and the unemployment rate has decreased from 4.5%to 4.1%. 3.6%increased to 3.9%, and the most striking policy interest rates increased from 5.1%to 5.6%.</p>
<p>What are the factors of the three -month interval that has improved the Fed's prediction of the economy? The most important reason may be continuous employment. New non -agricultural employment raised from 217,000 in March to 340,000 in May, exceeding market expectations. In addition, the decline of energy prices and the improvement of the supply chain have also boosted the economy.</p>
<p><strong> Suspension rate hikes in June, policy interest rates reach key nodes </strong></p>
<p>At the reporter's enrollment after the May meeting, most reporters asked about the bank crisis. Powell took the initiative to explain the situation of the bank in the opening white. The reporter at the meeting asked about the problem of the bank crisis very few, and these changes indicated that the bank crisis may have been greatly alleviated.</p>
<p>The suspension of interest rate hikes in June was closely related to the recent downlink of inflation. The May CPI growth rate announced on the 13th was 4%year -on -year, and the previous March and April were 4.9%. However, the suspension of interest rate hikes is not surprised because the Federal Reserve has hinted in the forward -looking guidance in May. I guess that even if the CPI data in May was slightly higher than 4%, the Fed will still suspend interest rate hikes in June because the Fed has reached a favorable key node after the interest rate hike. According to the standard monetary policy model, the policy interest rate is higher than the current inflation rate is the key condition to prevent "inflation self -realization". This condition is barely achieved after the interest rate hike in May, but in June To achieve (considering the base effect, the growth rate of the CPI in May can almost be almost below 4.9%in April). At the press conference on June 14, when explaining the decision of not raising interest rates of the month, Powell talked about the difference between interest rate hikes and interest rate hikes. In my opinion, the first node of the interest rate hike level is also the most important node is that the policy interest rate is higher than the level of inflation. After the hard -to -catch the inflation curve for one year, the Fed reached a key node.</p>
<p><strong> Crossing to Dark Time: The Federal Reserve gets calm again </strong></p>
<p>The Fed started interest rate hikes in March 2022. At that time, the CPI had reached 8.5%, which made the Federal Reserve criticize. Some well -known critics believed that the interest rate hike was too late. However, the Fed is not unaware of the danger, and the reason for the interest rate hike is to start with the new policy framework of 2020. In November 2018, the Fed launched a strategic assessment of the policy framework. This evaluation seemed very serious and meticulous, and it was not completed until August 2020. An important change in this new framework is the "flexible average inflation target system". This strategy attaches more importance to employment and will abandon the anti -inflation policy of "premier manner". The methodology foundation of the above policy goes back to Bowell's speech in Jackson Hall in August 2018. Powell had just served as Chairman of the Fed in February. This conference was the best opportunity to explain its monetary policy and methodology.</p>
<p>The new framework formed by the strategic evaluation will be put into use immediately after the announcement. After the interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest interest rate increase, one is that the Fed will be considered in the future. In full employment, the second is that the inflation rate is higher than 2%, and the last condition is that the inflation rate must be maintained at a level higher than 2%. This bold measure was not unsuccessful, and two members at the time had voted against the votes. The Federal Reserve keeps promise that before November 2021, these three interest rate hike conditions were repeatedly reiterated. In December, the inflation rate has been as high as 7.2%, the inflation rate higher than 2%has continued for 10 months and continued to rise. At that time, the pressure of the Federal Reserve can be imagined.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in November 2021 was 3.9%, which looked quite low, but because the epidemic was less than 150 million non -agricultural employment at the time, it was still significantly lower than the 152 million before the epidemic. Is it appropriate to raise interest rates at this time? This seems to be a two -choice choice. However, the Fed seems to have chosen adventures, and also adheres to the promise of employment more under the new framework. It was postponed that it would only raise interest rates until March 2022. At this time, the unemployment rate was 3.6%, which basically reached the level of 3.5%in February 2020 before the epidemic.</p>
<p>Looking back, the period from October 2021 to October 2022 was probably the dark moment of the Fed in the inflation of the Fed in this round. In 2021, after the rapid rise of inflation at the beginning of the year, there were several consecutive months in June-September, which enhanced the confidence of pigeons about inflation. However, the macroeconomic economy will not be too friendly to anyone. In October of that year, inflation accelerated again to exceed 6%of the psychological mark. In the subsequent November policy statement, inflation is a temporary wording. ), But the overall expression has been very nervous than the September meeting. In June 2022, the CPI reached the highest value of 8.9%of the inflation, and then fell slowly, and it did not fall below 7%until October 2022.</p>
<p>From March to December 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rate hikes 425 basis points, the fastest interest rate hike in the past 40 years. This tough position stabilizes inflation expectations, and stable inflation expectations are the largest capital of the Fed's adventure. Essence After October 2022, the downward trend of inflation was even more clear. The price of $ 300 by the international investment bank's 300 US dollars was not realized, but continued to decline. A energy crisis caused by war gradually resolved. It was a month of seeing light, and the stock market also bottomed out in the month. Since then, the situation has continued to improve. By June 2023, with the further decline of inflation, the policy interest rate finally caught up with the inflation curve. It can be said that the Fed has won the initiative since June.</p>
<p>June is Xiaoxia, and the Federal Reserve was calm again. Follow -up rate hikes, bank risks are a key consideration.</p>
<p>In the three consecutive statements after March, the Fed mentioned the uncertainty of bank credit tightening, which may be one of the key considerations for whether to continue to raise interest rates. Compared with the interest rate hike cycle before 2006, the duration of the low interest rate environment before this round of interest rate hikes is much longer. Essence The subsequent interest rate hikes need to be cautious about financial stability.</p>
<p><strong> The mystery of inflation viscosity: an explanation </strong>Suppose consumers have constant alternative elastic demand functions, which means that the proportion of expenditure in the consumption of different categories is fixed. However, due to the concerns of virus infection and the sequence of vaccine injection, people's consumer goods or services have been restricted in some order. Commodity consumption does not require too much personal contact, and the virus is restricted at the least. Therefore, consumers concentrate their expenditure in this field, such as the price increase of durable consumer goods (including cars) in February 2022. Then with the popularity of the vaccine, people who have been at home for a long time will go out, so the demand for services such as public transportation, medical entertainment and other services has risen rapidly. Essence As such "contact" services are quite satisfied, consumption expenditure is more inclined to housing. The high point of housing rent is at the end, with time in March 2023. Due to the gradual transfer of demand caused by epidemic restrictions, the overall inflation period is longer than that of the high level (but the high point of core inflation is not particularly high). The emergence of housing rent increases may end the signal of the end of the inflation.</p>
<p>In the case of some consumer demand being limited by the virus, people use the time to "take turns consumption" to achieve a fixed proportion of consumption expenditure. If my above explanation is reasonable, this is a new contribution to consumer theory. When I studied economic theory in class many years ago, I couldn't think of any useful models, but it can help me explain the current inflation viscosity now. Great satisfaction!In macro theory, there is also a commonly used model is a pure consumer economy model. For a long time, I feel that it has not been practical. But recently, I faintly felt its potential for analyzing the current Chinese economy.</p>
<p>The power of memories is huge. The happiness it brings is not just about knowledge. For example, a friend of mine saw his son and a young woman playing tennis. And Yi Ran. I have a complete understanding and approval of this.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2023, the annual growth rate of the nominal GDP of the United States was 5.4%, and economic deceleration continued. Although the economic structure has so many confusions, Kanes's insight on the analysis of total amount will finally gain dominance.</p>
<p><strong> Prospects: an epic soft landing? </strong></p>
<p>A large number of government subsidies during the epidemic period, and the smooth consumption of residents is the main reason why I predict the soft landing. US residents' real estate investment accounts for only 3%of GDP, which will also provide favorable conditions for economic soft landing.</p>
<p>The follow -up policy trend still depends mainly on inflation. My prediction is that the upward decline will exceed the expectations of the Federal Reserve. The main reason is that I have a previous analysis of inflation viscosity. Now this stickiness may be close to the end. At the end of 2023, CPI is likely to return to 2%. The high probability of interest rates will be lower than the level of the "dot matrix" foreshadow in June, which may also be why the US stock market is still rising after the Fed's dotted dotted map.</p>
<p>Perfect soft landing needs a little good luck. <a href="http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001099454">In another article published in FT Chinese website,</a>I discussed that after the emergence of generating artificial intelligence represented by ChatGPT, technological progress (usually the content of long -term economic analysis) for this round of economic cycle and monetary policy is no longer a factor that can be ignored. Here I add a vivid example. A friend's daughter went to study in the United States. After graduating from undergraduate, I found a job. Most of the job content was programming and English writing, which was quite challenging to her. After ChatGPT appeared in March 2023, my friend told me that his daughter's working status had changed, because this new technology provided strong help to programming and writing.</p>
<p>Grimpan wrote in his autobiography that the economic soft landing from 1994-1996 was the most proud masterpiece. Grimpan has an impressive appearance, low voice, and fascinating words. After several biographies written by famous reporters, Green Panpan became a rock star -like idol figure around 1996.</p>
<p>If my analysis of ChatGPT is correct, add this good luck, Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman who is now full of white hair and a slightly revealed transportation may get an epic soft landing. Considering the magnificent economic environment in recent years, and considering the highest and most sticky inflation over the past 40 years, this soft landing will make Green Panpan's masterpiece look more like an episode of Chengping era. However, whether Powell can become a rock star -like idol, I am not so sure. After all, the transparency of the Federal Reserve is not what the mysteriousness needed to become an idol.</p>

<p>Kedah Sultan Shalidin believes that regarding the recent controversy of "Penang belongs to Kedah", all parties must speak in accordance with historical facts. Do not speculate at will in order to make the next generation correctly understand history. This is the first time that the Kedah Sudan has stated its position for this matter since the Ji -State Minister of the Kedah stir up related disputes in February this year.</p>
<p>The Minister of Kedah State Sanuxi claimed that "Penang is a Kedah" in February this year caused controversy. On May 29, he attended the two states in the two states and the Ocean Border Agreement. The media told the media that Penang belonged to Kedah, so there was no boundary between the two states. These remarks once again caused controversy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Anhua Monday (June 12) reminded Sha Nunxi to say cautiously. "Sanuzi advocates that Penang belongs to Kedah. But he thought about it, and Kedah belonged to Thailand 200 years ago."</p>
<p>Shalidin pointed out at the celebration ceremony of the 81st birthday on Sunday (18th) that the Malaysian Federation was composed of the consent of the states. The right to enjoy the federal government is the result of the signing of the Malaysian Federal Agreement on August 5, 1957.</p>
<p>He said that any practice trying to suppress the voice of the states is very inappropriate, especially about the history and sovereignty of Kedah. "The establishment of the Malaysian Federation does not mean that it can erase the history of each state."</p>
<p>He pointed out that "the recent history of Kedah has discussed on various platforms, and people from all walks of life participated in the discussion of the status of Kedah and Penang." He believes that this is a good thing, but this matter must be spoken according to historical facts. Quick and ignore history.</p>
