![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T02-42-00-04-00/000000.png)China has used digital RMB in 17 provinces and cities. In May, public institutions such as Changshu Civil Service issued digital RMB wages. [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt-05252023024141.html/@@images/image)Screenshot of Weibo [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt-05252023024141.html/@@stream)In late April this year, the official media reported high -profile that Changshu Civil Service and employees of public institutions in May were settled with digital currencies in May. As a pilot project, there are already seventeen provinces and cities to pay for digital RMB for salaries, but whether digital currency can be popularized still remains to be observed.

[** Where does the real estate registration and civil servants use digital RMB paid to synchronize their finger? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/ec-04262023081934.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-04222023164207.html)**

Not long ago, the official media reported high -profile that starting in May, Changshu City, Jiangsu Province, has issued a full number of wages in the editors and other people in Jiangsu Province. The Changshu Local Financial Supervision Bureau and the Changshu Municipal Finance Bureau recently issued the "Notice on the Implementation of the Full Digital RMB Issuance" stated that starting in May, it has been compiled by civil servants (including public officers), public institutions, and each of them The personnel of the state -funded unit implement the full salary of the salary.

For a time, Digital RMB became a hot topic of live broadcast platforms, but the caliber of the live broadcast owner was consistent, and there was no question: "From May, all civil servants of Changshu, including public institutions and state -owned enterprises, all of them were issued by digital RMB. Buy online online. Buy online online. East and west, shopping, bus, and seeing a doctor can use digital renminbi. "" The salary of civil servants has to change. Recently, a notification has been issued. Since May, all civil servants and public institutions in the city have already. ... "," Jiangsu Changshu starts in May, all public officials will use digital RMB ... "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T02-42-00-04-00/000001.png)At present, Digital RMB can only be used online, and should not be used offline like banknotes. (Network screenshot/ancient pavilion provided) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt-05252023024141.html/m0525-gtp2.png)** Official media promotes digital RMB folk reflection of multiple negative **

Judging from a series of reports such as CCTV News and other official media, at present, digital RMB can only be used online, not as official, but it can be used offline or mobile phone. On social platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and Douyin, no digital RMB users are commented.

Ma Ting, an industry insider who is concerned about digital currency, said in an interview with Radio Free Asia on Thursday that digital RMB has difficulty overcoming obstacles. She said: "There is no offline state, that is, the hardware that is not used without networking, is the offline mode that you support when you are not connected to the Internet. There is no such hardware. You can only use it offline to become a real currency."

Ma Ting said that at present, no matter online payment or offline payment, digital RMB encounters problems: "Condesses will occur online, such as blockchain and Bitcoin transactions. In the case of large -scale transactions, they will actually occur. It will be congested for one to two hours. Then non -blockchain will also be congested on the line, which we have this experience when we use it. I don't think these non -commercial institutions make things better than Alipay and WeChat payments. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T02-42-00-04-00/000002.png)At the China International Services Trade Fair held in Beijing in 2022, the booth (Reuters picture) of China Digital RMB

** Digital RMB research and development has not resolved offline use problems for nearly ten years **

China has developed a digital RMB payment system in 2014, but it has not made breakthrough progress. The public account "Sisyphus" wrote that not only did Digital RMB not popular, but the sound became smaller and smaller, and even some people had forgotten it. The biggest obstacle is the technical reason why the digital RMB has not been promoted in a large scale. The article wrote that when the digital wallet was designed at the beginning, it was mainly offline mode, and the transaction was supported through offline smart devices. But this requires a built -in hardware on the phone, or buying a smart device on the body separately, but this hardware device may be cracked, and once it is cracked, it will cause great trouble.

Even if the digital RMB payment has an offline model, the person who picks up smart devices can immediately consume arbitrarily, which is more loser than the loss of wallets with cash. Another online article wrote that after demonstration, the experts concluded that "to install a micro -chip or external chip on the mobile phone, but after the relevant software is cracked, the currency flow in the offline state cannot be controlled. After the network mode, I found that the money in the account had been transferred, and even the account information may be formatted in the offline state. "

Many non -civil servants' netizens have resisted digital RMB. Some netizens posted that they had to transfer wages from digital wallets to bank cards. This is not more. Some netizens have suggested that digital RMB is only forced to use in the civil servant system, and do not expand the scope. Mr. Qin, a netizen, told this station that he opposed Digital RMB: "The government's digital RMB, it (government) can master all the paths of money you use, and can directly freeze your money, even clear zero. Digital RMB can be like a health code. Pay the red code at any time. If you go to the government for salary or the house is forced to petition, you can also freeze your wallet. "

For a number of social platforms such as Weibo, there are no netizens who have received digital RMB salary comments. Ma Ting said that civil servants' social media accounts have been registered in the unit, and they are prohibited from publishing negative comments: "I did not see their experience of using digital currency because civil servants now do not let them go online. So they dare not speak randomly. Complaint. Digital currency is now using civil servants. "

In terms of US -China relations, nearly half of the people believe that the relationship between the two countries will improve in the future.

The Beijing Tsinghua University Strategic and Security Research Center released the "" Chinese International Safety Opires "Public Opinion Report (2023)" on May 24. The report said, "I hope to show the world's" appearance without filter "to the world, and reduce the 'information deficit' in Chinese and foreign dialogues."

"The Chinese people are highly confident in China's global influence." The report shows that among China, the United States, Russia, and the European Union, and the United Nations, Chinese interviewees regard China as the world's largest influence, with an average score of 4.36 (average score of 4.36 ( 5 points are full), and the second place in the United States is 4.22 points. In addition, 90%of the people believe that China's global influence has increased (90.4%) 5 years ago, and will continue to increase (90.8%) in the next ten years.

Current affairs commentator Ma Ju interprets Tsinghua's polls only "funny". He believes that this is a series of so -called national security policies for Xi Jinping: "This poll is the tough policy for the Communist Party and Xi Jinping's next tough policy. , Even if war behavior is preheated in advance, or a series of publicity in advance. I hope everyone is alert to what is happening. "

Song Guocheng, a researcher at the International Research Center of Taiwan Politburo, told this station that the Chinese Communist Party has continuously used the method of deleting historical memory to brainwash young generations, and praises the greatness of the Communist Party of China in the world. China is the world's number one and how China affects the world. It can be seen from the polls that China's totalitarian rule creates a spiritual cage, promotes a fence, and allows young generations to be in a state of information closure. It is impossible to have an objective international outlook.

"(China) The young generation has lacks objective vision and the background and foundation of objective knowledge, and judges that China is actually facing the point of isolation and helpless internationally, so it lacks the world outlook and observe the changes in the world." Song Guocheng said.

Song Guocheng further pointed out that whether the digital or values are fraudulent, the more the CCP is in the international unfavorable situation. The more the facts need to be fabricated to promote the opposite facts to avoid the internal people from understanding the real situation of their country, and then do not believe in the Communist Party.

According to polls, the Chinese people regard major epidemic diseases, territorial leadership disputes, and US -China relations as the three major international security issues that China should give priority. The report pointed out that although the conflict of confrontation between the United States and China is one of the most worried international security issues that the Chinese people are, nearly 50 % of the interviewed people believe that US -China relations will improve in the future, and the respondents who will continue to decline will only be 24.76. %.

In addition, about 80 % of respondents believe that the main responsibility of the Ukraine crisis is in the United States and Western countries, and that Russia has less than 10 % of the main responsibility.

Ma Ju said that the Chinese people believe that the interests of the United States and China are greater than the differences, and there are room for cooperation because there are many interaction of interests. But he believes that this is already the past. If you still understand this today, you are deceiving himself.

"Because the current contradiction between China and the United States is not simple and inconsistent, the core conflict is already a conflict between you and my life." Ma Ju said, "The so-called de-Risk now in the United States is to give the interest groups in the United States on Wall Street more. With more time withdrawing from China and avoiding risks. "

But few Chinese people really understand this stupid movement, how much harm to their country, people, and even the world. He believes that the Chinese people do not understand this and even deliberately avoid them.

### 40 years, hundreds of times against Taiwan's military sales case

The United States sold weapons to Taiwan, which originated from the United States and Taipei in 1979. Instead of establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing, the Taiwan Relations Law was formulated. After the evacuation of the US military in Taiwan, the United States began to provide defensive military military in accordance with the law. According to a memorandum established by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, the performance of the United States provided weapons to Taiwan "depends on the threat of the Chinese Communist Party."

### Turn Taiwan into a "fortress"

In recent years, with the continuous growth of Chinese military equipment and the increasingly tense US -China relations, the types of weapons sold to Taiwan have also changed. Grylesman, a researcher at Rand Corporation in the United States(Derek Grossman)In an interview with Voice of Germany in mid-October, "the United States sold many different types of weapons in Taiwan in the past, sometimes weapons that can improve Taiwan's asymmetric defense combat power, and sometimes it is an iconic weapon like the F-16 fighter. However, the United States now seems to have made a clear adjustment of Taiwan's military aid policy. "He believes that in order to prevent China from invading Taiwan through amphibious landing, the United States will assist Taiwan to become a" indestructible fortress ".

### How to deal with it?

The past U.S. military sales cases have caused Beijing's opposition, but in most cases, they are limited to verbal protests. On October 26, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press conference that China will impose sanctions on American companies and individuals such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, and Thunder who participated last week. In fact, Lockheed Martin rarely does business with China, and has provided weapons and defense equipment to Taiwan for many years. However, if China is on Boeing(Boeing)Implementation of sanctions may cause a heavy blow to it because the company also sells civil aviation aircraft to China.

[ ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国批准619亿美元对台新军售-中国军机连续两日扰台/a-64862978)Essence In early May, the Taiwan National Defense Minister Qiu Guozheng said that due to the supply chain problem caused by the new crown epidemic, the first batch of 66 new F-16V fighters purchased from the United States was originally scheduled to be delivered at the end of this year, but it has been delayed until next year. Bloomberg quoted the U.S. Air Force statement this week that delayed planes not only because of the epidemic and supply chain, but also containing "complex research and development challenges."

In early May, the journal "Journal of Test Technology" jointly sponsored by the Chinese Society of Military and Workers and Central North University also published a paper push paper, saying that if the conflict of the U.S. and China broke out, the PLA could use hypersonic anti -ship missiles to sink the latest US military. The Ussgerald R. Ford, the nuclear -powered aircraft carrier, formed a devastating blow to the US aircraft carrier battle group.

However, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese hypersonic missile data used by the soldiers was disconnected from reality, which may make the simulation distortion and cause the results to be inaccurate.

### In response to Xinjiang race extinction

In addition to strengthening support for Taiwan, another report adopted by the Chinese House of Representatives Special Committee on the same day, it is recommended that the US government take action on the Xinjiang issue. The report suggested that Chinese technology companies participating in the "racial extinction" of Chinese technology companies imposed sanctions and involved [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人权组织起诉法国时装集团涉维吾尔强制劳工/a-65660627)Strengthen law enforcement.

The chairman of the committee Gragel said: "Let's send a two -party (common) message, that is, Congress will stand up against racial extinction -this is the worst crime of all crimes."

Washington has accused China of sustainable ethnic extinction on Xinjiang Uyghur and other ethnic minorities. Human rights organizations have accused Beijing that Beijing has forced detention and forced labor against more than 1 million Uighurs. China has strongly denied the statement and emphasized that the so -called "vocational training center" is to curb terrorism, divisionism and religious radicalism.

Adopting a tough attitude towards China is a small consensus supported by the two parties in the United States Congress. The Special Committee of the China Issue Special Committee consisting of the two parties has not drafted the power of legislation. It only puts forward policy suggestions. It must cooperate with the legislative committee to transform the proposal into laws.

** 1. China's current three major issues involved in land real estate rights: retreating forests, agricultural management, land finance **

Recently, there are several hot issues in China, which is attractive: the crisis of defeat of the retreat of farming, agricultural management, and land finance.

1) ** Retreating to forests and returning to farming **

Not long ago, Xi Jinping reversed his "green water and green mountains are the golden mountains and silver mountains" national policy of "returning farmland to the forest", and suddenly announced that he would "return to forests and return farming" to ensure the large -scale movement of "rice bowls should be brought in your own hands".

As a result, this national system of the Communist Party of China began to toss: China urban and rural areas destroyed forests and fields everywhere, and the boundless forests fell down. In the bulging sound of the bulldozer excavator, the green mountains and green mountains turned back to the land of dirty stones overnight, and even some places became Balling Mountain.

Chengdu is a typical case. The ecological park of 100 kilometers of beautiful people with a cost of 34.1 billion is there. Within a few days, all of them are flattened and intended to create 100,000 acres of paddy fields. The price paid is 34.1 billion, and it takes 442.8 years of income for 100,000 acres of rice fields to pay off. The absurdity of this prodigal son is rare in the world, and the sighs of the country will definitely leave a record of shame in history.

Why do you want to toss so absurd?

It is said to be "food safety". In fact, China currently produces 680 million tons of food, consumes 780 million tons of food each year, and the gap is 10 million tons. This gap can be completely made up by imports. There are many good quality, so you don't have to retreat to the forests for self -food and self -food, and make such a major damage.

This decision reflects the will of the gambler who retreats the country in the crisis of crisis. It is a kind of wartime thinking that he wants to defend his crumbling power of power regardless of all costs.

But even for war thinking, the Xi authorities are obsessed with the current status of the basic international civilization.

Judging from the current international environment and civilization, even if the war is started, it will not block all food exports. This is the lowest humanitarian. The modern international consensus is that no matter what kind of human and gods you do, you will never include food and medicine on the international sanctions list.

At that time, the Soviet Union confronted the Chinese Momes in China, and the Chinese Communist Party said that the Soviet Union forced debt to repay debts, and could only transport food products to the Soviet Union. The actual situation was that the Soviet Union proposed to suspend debts. In order to face face, to fight against Emperor Xiu, he refused to live with the people. But looking at the Russian and Ukraine War today, although some difficulties in Ukraine's food exports have occurred, it is basically normal. Russia invaded Ukraine, and the international community's sanctions on Russia did not include food and drugs. This is the most basic international morality, basic humanitarianism.

Water conservancy expert Wang Weiluo said to the current retreat from forestry: "The result of returning forests (grass) and plowing and rice goes on the mountain is a large area of soil and soil loss, causing geological disasters." The flood in China in 1998 was a big result caused by a large area of cutting down forests and painful pain, so it proposed "returning farmland to forests". Twenty years have passed, and the results have been achieved at first, and the flood has been slightly contained. Now it is "returning to the forest and returning to farming", and the east of hard work for 20 years. But some people think simple and ignore their heads.

The Nobel Prize winner of the Economic Amadia Mori once said: Serious famine is actually an artificial shortage economy and a consequence of political decision -making. The Great Famine only occurred in an autocracy without news freedom. The ruler deliberately placed the target population for a long time in a state of serious insufficient supply in food, housing, medical care, education, or the price far exceeding the consumption level. To control them, forcing them to be trapped in a panting that can only satisfy the state of survival, and has no time to carry out other political appeal activities.

The most important purpose of "retreating to forests and returning farming" is to once again change the form of collective ownership of rural land again, completely deprive farmers' rights to land, stripping the connection between farmers and land, and so that farmers will become a free of free from the new planned economy again. Atoms have become migrant workers of state -owned farms. This can achieve the purpose of going to the real estate stock.

"Returning to the forest to cultivate" once again reflects the essence of Chinese social imperialism: "In the world, is it the king of the king", but. "Mo Fei" has become "Mo Fei's soil."

Therefore, the fundamental problem here is that Chinese farmers do not have land ownership. The collective ownership of the so -called rural land has also become a thing that cannot be competed with the government, which is taken. They cannot decide the use of land and their income themselves, and they cannot interfere with the government's arbitrary disposal of land and use them at will. No matter how the official toss, farmers have no say.

2) ** agricultural management **

In order to support the "retreat to forests and return farming", Beijing also established the agricultural management department and followed the countryside to strengthen the control of the dying rural areas.

Earlier this year, local governments at all levels have reported and organized a "agricultural comprehensive administrative law enforcement" team, which is also commonly known as "agricultural management". There are currently 82,000 agricultural law enforcement officers compiled in China. On duty among about 2,500 related institutions, with their own uniforms, vehicles and law enforcement equipment. According to official statements, this is a new administrative law responsibility for the management of past seeds, pesticide feeds, agricultural machinery and other fields.

In the name of enforcement in the name of law enforcement, these agricultural management violence forced farmers' vegetable greenhouses, and even pigs who snatched chickens and ducks and seized farmers. "" ". Because their evil -shaped and evil are comparable to the "urban management team" of the urban law enforcement team, they were described as "village tyrants" by villagers. This kind of violent and stable agricultural management has triggered the anger and tolerance of the people. It has finally erupted recently.

According to the Chinese official media "Today's Headline", Zhejiang Province was at the forefront this time, and the "agricultural management" that had been established for less than a few months was finally canceled. It is estimated that in the near future, there will definitely be more and more provincial effective laws to cancel "agricultural management".

** 3) The crisis of "land finance" **

China's land finance refers to the fiscal revenue obtained by local governments relying on "selling land", which mainly includes two parts: First, non -tax revenue of land -related governments, such as land rent, land transfer, new construction land is paid Use fees and so on. Second, taxes related to land, such as the business tax of cultivated land occupation tax, real estate and construction industry, and land value -added tax. As of 2020, the land transfer fund is the absolute main source of fiscal revenue obtained by the Chinese government's land.

The government uses land as a commodity, and the income of the land is used as a small vyte in a budget. This is actually the failure of the CCP system.

At present, with the frequent crisis of China's real estate explosion, China's land finances are facing a comprehensive crisis. Some local fiscal companies have bankruptcy, debt, and no debt.This land finance is closely related to the rise and fall of the real estate industry. Because the fiscal revenue of local governments mainly comes from selling land development rights to real estate developers through long -term contracts. However, due to the bubble crisis of the real estate industry in recent years, the income of land sales has been significantly reduced, and it has entered a stage of decline.

However, the CCP has never dared to use obvious fiscal revenue options in other countries: real estate tax. Because this will involve the basic interests of the real estate in the huge population; at the same time, it is not straightforward. The Chinese have been deprived of land ownership by the Communist Party of China, and real estate has only 70 years of use. Since I have no ownership, what power do you have to levy my real estate tax?

****

** 2. China's land ownership issues **

** Earth Power: Key key **

The above three issues are the three issues: the root cause of returning forests, agricultural management, and land finance: The root causes are related to the five words, that is, land ownership. Opening China's complicated phenomenon, the key of practical land ownership can reveal a lot of secrets.

For thousands of years, the land problem is like a lingering nightmare. The CCP long -term propaganda said that one of the main problems of traditional China is that the land is concentrated in the landlord. It is precisely the secret of land rights. Mao Zedong deceived the poor farmers to participate in the army with "fighting the land and dividing fields", and prepared an important violent armed forces for seizing the regime.

Many countries have implemented land reform in the early days of industrialization. Originally, as long as the land reform was assigned to farmers through peaceful acquisitions to farmers. The three -seven -five -lease reduction in Taiwan further distributed land to self -cultivated farmers, and a drop of land reform was completed without a drop of blood.

The Chinese Communist Party is not. After the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, a violent land reform movement was launched. Essence It killed as many as 2 million farmers labeled "landlords".

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese farmers have only four or five years as the owner of the land to receive a land certificate, but soon it is the mutual aid group. At this point, the junior and senior communities have returned to the "Mo Fei Earth under the Sky". In the situation, the land was collected by state -owned.

Before the reform and opening up, Chinese farmers became serfs. What has been implemented has always been a policy of transfusion for urban and industrial blood transfusion through the poor scissors of workers and farmers. The cruel dissection of rural farmers is relatively simple and rough through production materials and labor products. As a slave farmers, the life of the peasants is extremely poor, and there is no rights and property. During the Great Leap Forward, they were driven to the commune cafeteria for dinner. Finally, they hungry all over the country. The highest tragic record of great famine caused by political reasons.

Forty -five years ago, the farmers at Xiaogang Village, who were hungry on the edge of hunger, decided that regardless of their rules that they had to work in the people's commune, risked their lives, secretly broke through the ownership of the CCP, restored the family bag system, and according to their considerations, they thought it was appropriate. The method of cultivating land has created the prosperity of agricultural production, and caused a series of capitalist reforms later, making China one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

** is still the only local Lord -the Communist Party of China **

However, these reforms failed to reverse the policy of nationalization of land ownership in the early days.

After the reform and opening up, the deprivation of the party -state's rights to peasants has transformed into a plunder of production factors. In accordance with China's existing land regulations, Chinese farmers' rights in land contracting are quite incomplete and unfair.

This has a negative impact on the farmers' production and life. Because there is no real land ownership, it means that farmers cannot purchase, sell or rent land, and create a large number of land that can be used in a large number of land, and cannot use the land as a loan mortgage, which limits their ability to raise funds. Although they can leave the land to work in the city, no property right means that they cannot use land to help provide funds for new life.

As a result, rural economic stagnation is common. In 2018, the income of urban residents was nearly three times higher than rural residents' income, which was roughly the same as the gap between the economic reform in 1978.

Now, with the government's random tossing of land, they cannot resist the repeated toss from "returning farmland to forests" to "returning forests and returning farming". Coupled with the agricultural management of violence and stability, will the rural areas go back to the dark era before 1978?

Although there have been efforts to imitate a certain land market in recent decades, every land in China has been in the hands of the country. China has become the only country of landlords -CCP -CCP -CCP -CCP from 1949, which is still the case.

This is the key crux of all rural issues.

However, maybe you wondered, isn't purple spa butterfly a butterfly species that can be visible? Zhan Jialong, an insect expert and an ecological documentary director, once used to it.

Purple spots have begun to fly into his life. For more than 20 years, he chased the butterflies to overwhelm the mountains. The thin and thin figure flew from Taiwan to Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and other purple butterfly habitats. Experts' academic and emotional strokes wrote the ecological biography "Purple Paef Die" for them, and even shot the documentary "Disappearing Purple Die" from the perspective of a butterfly. "After watching this film, you may find that the life of a butterfly is not the same as our life."

"If the bee disappears, half of our food will be disappeared." "Disappearing Purple Die" said at the beginning, "So what will happen to the butterfly disappear?" This question mark still stopped in mind. The sound of echoing the valley made the audience move from their ears to their hearts.

Taiwan's purple butterfly valley is the world's second largest overwintering butterfly valley, second only to Mexico Emperor Butterfly Valley. "In the past, there were 2 million winter butterfly valley in Taiwan. . "Zhan Jialong slowly opened the box." The status of the purple butterfly is in the flat land and low altitude, that is, the place where humans live in.

The climate is relatively dry. In Taiwan, it is trapped in the island to migrate on the island. In short, the small of Taiwan Island has made it spectacular.

** Orange Butterfly Rain and Fantasy Purple Butterfly Valley **

Compared with the Emperor Better Butterfly forming a large number of scenes of tens of millions of clusters in Mexico's single valley. "When I went to Mexico, the sun came out, butterflies flew up, and the butterflies would stop until the sun. . "Zhan Jialong, for example, in the purple butterfly valley of Mao Forest, Kaohsiung, when he entered the forest, the butterfly was disturbed in 5 minutes. stop."

However, the purple butterfly valley in his eyes is more diverse and ever -changing, because the emperor butterfly valley has only one butterfly and one color, "Taiwan's Butterfly Valley has 4 purple butterflies, 6 kinds of blue spots, 2 birch butterfly. As a kind of white spots, and the wings of the purple spots have a structure like triangular prism. From a specific angle, the light of the original dark brown wings will emit purple light. "His eyes lit up, and the words turned around and said again. "The most difficult thing for this movie is to shoot purple butterflies into purple, because the moment of light may only be 0.1 seconds."

The director who loved the butterfly became an instantaneous change in capturing the purple spots with ultra -high -speed cameras. Following his lens, he walked into nature. The praying mantis was ambushing for the opportunity to hunt, and the eight -eyed crab spider had an unexpected raid. The parasitic bee fiercely switched from the butterfly body. The scenes made people see the natural diversity and survival laws of nature.

** Environmental crisis all sides Chu Ge **

One of the survival challenges encountered in Taiwan is the loss of habitats. "Humans have covered their own homes at flat land and low altitude. For the environmental pressure, climate change is another threat. "Global warming will eventually lead to Taiwan into a tropical country. Purple spots do not need to overwinter, and there is no butterfly road and wintering butterfly valley."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000003.png)Taiwan's purple butterfly faces habitat loss and global warming. (The official Facebook of "Disappearing Purple Paef Die" [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/4.jpg)

The use of pesticides in modern agriculture also brings survival threats to purple butterfly, and even destroy the entire ecosystem. He reminded that purple spots butterflags will die when they absorb honey. In fact, purple spots and bees will be pollinated like bees. Agricultural production can be combined with the ecology to introduce purple butterflies and be friendly to the environment and at the same time. More than 10 years ago, in order to solve the problem of pesticide poisoning spot butterfly, the Taiwan Purple Poor Butterfly Ecological Conservation Association and the Conscience Foundation jointly promoted farmers to transform friendly farming. Silently guard the purple spots butterfly habitat.

Not only pesticides, the Research team of the University of Cantonel also found that the genetically modified crops may be harmful to the emperor's spot butterfly. Zhan Jialong also noticed this research. He explained that genetically modified corn (BTCORN) is to colonize the gene of a bacteria into corn Inside, it is called Su Li bacteria (BT), and the pests will be poisoned when they eat corn to achieve the effect of diseases and insect pests. The experimental results show that the emperor's spots of genetically modified corn pollen, nearly half of the individual death, so genetically transferred genes, so transferred genes to genet Is the crop really safe? Butterflies seem influential.

The migration road of Emperor Paei -Butterfly is also in crisis, and "human roadblocks" may lead to their "ghost hit the wall". He takes the fence built by former US President Trump on the border of the United States and Mexico as an example. "The Emperor's Better Butterfly went south to Mexico to overwinter. Some biologists raised doubts. From the principle of effect, butterflies will fly along the wall after encountering the wall, and then turn over after a section, but when they turn over, they may be different hills, and the migration path changes. This is a butterfly. The concept of effect. "

** Give up the highway for butterflies **

From the time of spring into the summer, the purple butterflies in Taiwan migrated from the southern wintering area to the north, but the highway blocked the butterfly road, causing the purple butterfly to "get a car accident." Zhan Jialong said that the butterfly migration of purple spots and butterflies came from the south of the Central Mountains, all the way to Bagua Mountain and Daishan, and then entered the plain area. At that time, there were thousands of butterflies recorded in one minute, and even tens of thousands of butterflies were killed through highways. After the car was crushed, the entire ground was bright and slippery. The ground is like a pig was crushed 10,000 times. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000004.png)The Taiwan Expressway Bureau has set up a protective network on the No. 3 National Highway, and launched a sealing measure at the peak period of the purple butterfly flying over. (Provided by Taiwan Highway Bureau) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/5.jpg)Later, under the butterfly protection initiative of Zhan Jialong and other scholars and experts, since 2007, the Taiwan Expressway Bureau launched the "National Highway to let the butterfly road" conservation operation. High, when the number of purple spots is more than 250 per minute, immediately close the outer lane, and the butterfly can have more buffer time. These protection measures have also greatly reduced the death rate of purple spots. From 2007, in 2007, it has fallen to less than 3 % in recent years.

"This year's record to the maximum of about 1,000 butterflies passed." Zhan Jialong always had this group of aerial elves. He reflected that this butterfly action should be called "the national road", "because human development, high -speed high -speed, high -speed high -speed Highway grabbed the butterfly road, at this time humans should show their own height. "

** The network of life connected to butterflies **

In fact, not only the wintering ecology of purple spots butterflies is in the decline mode, there are 5 native purple spots in Taiwan, including Si Zi purple spots, end purple spots, round wings purple spots, small purple spots, and large purple spots. Travel. Zhan Jialong pointed out that the large purple spots have been extinct in the 1960s. It is also the first extinction butterfly in Taiwan. The reason for disappearing is still a mystery, because its herbivores and honey sources still exist. One possible reason is that the habitat is being habitat. Destruction.

"There are many butterflies in Taiwan, but they are not extinct, but they are the largest purposes. There is an extinction." He said, "The butterflies living beside us are easily disturbed. I often talk about purple spots. Butterflies are like people, it is easy to hurt family!"

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T09-45-48-04-00/000005.png)Purple spots and humans are the community of destiny. Zhan Jialong reminded that purple spots are like humans, and it is easy to hurt family members. (Provided by the monkey subsidiary) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-05252023091614.html/6.jpg)What will happen if the purple spots disappear? "Purple spots have wings. As long as this environment is not good, it will leave, but humans have no wings." Zhan Jialong's tone was full of Zen machine. So where will humans go from? He replied in the documentary: "Everything on the earth has nothing to do, but it is closely affected by each other, like a vast and complex network of life."

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T10-32-00Z/36989341_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65732354/36989341)(Voice of Germany Chinese website) On Monday (May 22), a netizen posted the news online, [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/國泰航空遭指歧視中國客-官媒重拳整頓/a-65715856), I heard that the empty service staff laughed at the passengers in private and could not speak in English. He described the "blanket" as a "carpet", and said that "if you can't speak the blanket in English, you can't get it." The incident quickly appeared on the hot search on Chinese social media, which caused violent criticism of Chinese government officials and Hong Kong government officials, including the Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao.

According to Reuters, Cathay Pacific issued a statement late on Wednesday, urging Cathay Pacific to fundamentally solve the problem and rebuild a reasonable and safe working environment to boost employee morale. The statement expressed his deepest regret on the "recent unpleasant incident", and said that Cathay ’s air passengers have always respected and treated all passengers from different countries.

The union stated that after the new crown epidemic, with the recovery of flights, the number of passengers increased, but the aviation staff on the front line was facing a shortage of manpower and material resources, and the workload increased significantly but the salary was low. "The company ignored these problems, which led to the extremely low morale of employees, and the complaints on the cabin service also increased."

Hong Kong's "Ming Pao" reported that according to the internal email issued by the Cathay Pacific Skyworth Service Workers' Union obtained by the newspaper, the trade union was "distressed to face many unrealistic allegations and online rumors." The email also mentioned that, according to the "cabin service guidelines", if the flight attendant was filmed and videos by passengers without the consent, it can propose to delete the relevant content to the passengers. Take a "zero tolerance" attitude towards non -conservation passengers. The report quoted the trade union that "this expectation Cathay Pacific will support employees to protect themselves and provide relevant guidelines, and it is a pity that it will eventually get sad news."

### Cathay: Trade union does not represent Cathay Pacific position

In response, Cathay Pacific issued a statement on the official Weibo on Thursday that "the 'Air Workers' Association' is an independent union and never represents Cathay." The statement also wrote that Cathay Pacific "does not accept, support or agree with the union's position on the matter."

Mandyng, director of Cathay Pacific Services, also emphasized in the statement: "We will continue to communicate directly with colleagues in the cabin waiter, including various ways such as online and face -to -face. We will continue to listen to their feedback and actively respond. "

But many Chinese netizens do not buy Cathay Pacific's response. There is a message under the relevant Weibo: "Still, you don't like the mainlanders, don't fly to the mainland route, there is no need to force yourself!"; It is support for not opposing treatment. "

Since the outbreak of the incident, Cathay Pacific has apologized many times. The chief executive of the administrative Lin Shaobo said that the company will "adhere to the attitude of" zero tolerance "against the company's rules and regulations and moral standards.

###  Chinese Social Media is now anti -"Chongyang Mei Wai" sound waves

Nevertheless, Cathay Pacific incident continues to ferment on Chinese social media.

Some netizens said that the focus of Cathay Pacific Incident was "employees' discrimination" and "Chinese people's own discrimination against the Chinese are everywhere." Some people have severely criticized "Chongyang Mei, shame and sad", and threatened to resist Cathay Pacific.

However, some netizens believe that this matter is not "discrimination", but "unprofessional, lack of professional ethics"; "this has a lot to do with company culture, if a company that emphasizes equal culture everywhere will not have this behavior" Essence Another group of opinions believes that "Actually, there is no need to go online, and many industry service attitudes are poor."

The news of Shanghai "News Morning News" and upstream news came out of Cathay Pacific's news in 2017 that they refused to use Chinese famous brands in 2017, which once again aroused heated discussion among netizens. Some people think of the "BMW Bingbing Incident" of the Shanghai Auto Show.

"

In April of this year, some netizens broke the news that the staff of the BMW MINI booth at the Shanghai Auto Show suspected to treat Chinese and foreign visitors when they distributed free ice excitement, and only sent ice cream to foreigners. After the incident was exposed on Sina Weibo, a large number of netizens expressed anger and dissatisfaction.

In the early morning of May 25, several policemen in the Guang'anmen Wai Police Station in Xicheng District suddenly came to the door, claiming that they received the report, and someone gathered to take drugs.

Public Security: "Someone now reports that you have drug abuse in it. We have to enter the house for inspection. We need to investigate whether there is such a matter, which is a clarification of you."

Li Wenzu: "What about your search?"

Public Security: "What is a search certificate? The country is in formal law enforcement. How do you obstruct it?"

Ye Jinghuan told this station that the actions of public security are completely out of nothing, and they are suspected of violating the case handling procedure.

(Voice of Germany) Rondesantis, 44, has recently toured in various states to build momentum for Republican President. The information he passed is simple: No state is more successful than Florida. His campaign slogan is: De Santis 2024-to make the United States like Make American Florida.

At the end of March before the campaign, De Santis also launched a new book, which opened his childhood, and his love for the American sports baseball.

It was his sports talent that opened the door of Yale University's history for him. After that, his experience was quite smooth: after a year of history, he studied legal science at Harvard University. In the second year of Harvard, he became an alternate officer of the U.S. Navy, and then served as a military judicial personnel of the Guantanamo Prison. He served as a consultant of the Special Forces SEAC in the Iraq war.

### from Member to Governor

In 2012, after two years of prosecutors, he entered politics. Desanteis was a six -year member of the Congress. In 2018, he participated in the primary election of the Governor of Florida and won. In November, he defeated the Democratic Party with a weak advantage. At the end of 2022, De Santis, who was married and had three children, even won the governor again with obvious advantages.

The governor scored in his hometown with good economic data, tax cuts and liberal new crown policies. His new crown policy slogan is: freedom, not welfare. Fitch is a well -known virusist. De Santis opposed the implementation of restrictions and prohibited the company from requesting employees to show vaccine certificates. Despite criticism, many Florida supported it very much.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T11-08-00Z/65727445_401.jpg)The main reason for Desantis's score in his hometown in Florida is the new crown policy of good economic data, tax reduction and liberals

### De Santis and Trump: No longer a good friend

Trump has supported his supporter De Setis and said the political successor "smart young leader". Until the former president discovered that his successor became his competitor. Since then, Trump has reprimanded De Santis as a fake hypocrisy and grateful politician.

The strategy of De Santis facing Trump's attacks is: ignore. In the election campaign, the governor of Florida tried to establish a strong conservative image of no scandal, no chaos and legal disputes. Many people call him "brain with Trump".

However, De Sandeis is a 32 -year -old council candidate: Trump can easily make a huge venue lobby popular, while De Santis is not so close to the crowd.

### Anti -"Awakening Culture" of Florida

The so -called "wake culture" refers to opposition to various social discrimination. Desanteis prohibits courses in facilitation and gender identity in school in Florida. In addition, it is limited to school professor's anti -race theory. Surgery students are prohibited from participating in public school girls' sports school team. Then, it is forbidden to display pictures of same -sex partners on the school's podium.

"We have to do it, and the parents are sent to school to obtain education, not to be instilled."

In addition, De Sandeis had an abortion ban for more than 15 weeks of pregnancy in the state before overthrowing abortion rights in the US Supreme Court. After 15 weeks, abortion was allowed only under special circumstances such as life in danger of life, but it was not amazing due to rape pregnancy.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T11-08-00Z/65727433_401.jpg)In the face of the CCP's attitude, Desandis performed well. He launched a bill in early May to prohibit Chinese agents from buying sensitive plots in Florida

### Florida prohibits Chinese people from buying agricultural land and sensitive facilities

If De Sandeis not only defeated Trump in the Republican Party, but also defeated the Democratic Party as President Biden, his foreign policy may be quite uncomfortable for the left -wing liberal Americans. Desantis's explanation of Fox News on the United States in Ukraine, further involving the territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not the core national interests of the United States.

On the issue of China, early May, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国多地限制中国人买地买房不全是真相/a-65625492)Essence De Santis said in a press release: "Florida is taking action to resist the largest geopolitical threat in the United States-the Communist Party of China." He said, "I am proud of signing this bill to prevent Chinese agents from buying us The land of farmland and our military base and key infrastructure. "

Desantis also signed two other bills, saying that it was to prevent sensitive data from being stored in China, and preventing the Chinese Communist Party from impacting the education system at various levels in Florida. He said: "We are implementing the commitment to suppress the Communist China."

We do n’t mean that the prisoners of war are ...” Some people think that the actual work period every week is higher than the statistical data reflected, and it is said that in China In public institutions, at least half of people are far beyond this time.

The former Tiananmen student leader Wang Dan shared the preparatory process of the memorial hall in the "Asian Want to Talk" program.

[** On the eve of June 4th, the police demanded that the police in many places requested to investigate young mobile phones **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/hx1-05232023092839.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-04052023073746.html)**

Wang Danfa, the leader of the 89th Academic Games, started the establishment of the June 4th Memorial Hall. He said that it was expected to raise 500,000 US dollars. Except for more than 50 civil movements participating in the campaign, more than 70,000 US dollars were donated, and the rest were small donations. Among them, more than a dozen donations are just "89 yuan and 6 cents 4". The sand accumulates into a tower. With the strength of everyone, the memorial hall is finally about to settle next to the Times Square in New York.

Wang Dan mentioned in the "Asia Want to Talk" that the name of the library was inscribed by Bao Tong, the passing secretary of Zhao Ziyang. Bao Tong's death was very weak a year ago, and everyone did not dare to urge. Although he did not even have the strength of the pen during the hospitalization, Bao Tong insisted on completing the title of the museum before his death.

"The five words of the June 4th Memorial Hall are Mr. Bao Tong's last Mo Bao in this world, and finally dedicated to the June 4th Memorial Hall. Coincidentally, the power behind this can be moved. "Wang Dan said.

In addition to Bao Tong's Mo Bao, artist Yan Keff also donated a 2008 painting "Non -Related Religious". He explained the idea of creating in the show. People born in China were brainwashed, just like a wooden man, and he could not dominate his own destiny. However, human nature is inherently yearning for freedom. The puppet people prayed. When he awakened his eyes, he naturally pursued democracy.

Yan Kefu: "Therefore, we have June 4th. What is paradoxic is that we have been educated by Marxism since we were young. Why do we still oppose it? At least for me, it is a human awakening. It is unstoppable, our longing for freedom is unstoppable. "

Yan Kefu lamented that many years ago in Beijing, the same classmates held a graduation exhibition "Mo Wang's original intention", which clearly felt that the authorities began to shrink their remarks, especially related to ideology. Artists have always been more sensitive to creative freedom. He said, especially after Xi Jinping came to power, he couldn't walk forward, and he could only go back in endangering the regime: "Why go back? It's not that he is stupid, because there is no way. Just like climbing a mountain, it has been a place to go to a place. There is no way, and then the cliff is ahead. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T11-20-00-04-00/000002.png)The painter Yan Keff was analyzed in the show. The spread of Chinese liquidation to the art world was a joke.(Screenshot)  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/984f67ef592b.jpg)** Chinese art works are ups and downs, but also the subject matter is also the subject matter **

The former Chinese art market is booming. Dai Zhongren, the host of the "Asia Want to Talk", described the price of contemporary Chinese works "not to set up helicopters, but to erupt rockets."

The host asked, don't you think it is a pity to give up such a huge market? Yan Kefu mentioned that he came into contact with several well -known Chinese painters and was hot in the market, but they were unhappy: "The reason is unhappy, don't talk about Chen Yi's high freedom, because he can't draw other things, he can draw other things. He It was set up very early. "

For example, Zhang Xiaogang painted the "family" series for a lifetime, but has been abducted by the market. Recently, Yue Minjun, who is famous for its "laugh" series, used to paint millions of Hong Kong dollars in the Hong Kong Sotheby's auction, but now because of painting soldiers "laughed", he was suspected of ugly and blasphemy. Yan Kefu, who once told Yue Minjun, said that the smile in Yue Minjun's paintings was "smirked": "In the big wave of the mainland, the artist was crazy, everyone was crazy, making money and earning money and earning money. Crazy, I want money and want to be crazy. What strange things are, there is a very magical place. Everyone only smiles, it is so simple. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T11-20-00-04-00/000003.png)The work donated to the 64 Memorial Hall (provided by Yan Kefov) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/975e95dc5b976559.jpg)** "Disgrace Army" sensitive nerves China strict hands and art world **

It's not just Yue Minjun, but even the talk show actor Li Haoshi(House)Just because the word "excellent style, can win the battle", was suspended and was criticized for "insulting army". This is very absurd in the eyes of Yan Koff: "As an artist, I can't understand This level. Like laughing fruit, a joke is fined more than 10 million yuan. I think the whole thing is a joke. "He said, "'We are the last generation', not even children, we will not give birth. Strictly speaking, in terms of political science and historian sense, isn't this just non -violent?" Wang Dan believes that Wang Dan believes that The younger generation of China grew up playing games. In their world, they can withstand jokes. In such an environment, the society suddenly closed, and even jokes are taboos. It is absolutely impossible to support such regimes from the bottom of the heart.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T11-20-00-04-00/000004.png)Wang Dan, the leader of the 89th Academic Games, pointed out that a total of 500,000 US dollars donated a small amount of donations and set up the June 4th Memorial Hall.(Screenshot)  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hcm2-05252023100556.html/738b4e39.jpg)** Six Forty Fire Sales Fire Live **

But Wang Dan was not pessimistic. He believes that although June 4th has passed 34 years, it is evaluated from a historical perspective to the success of a movement, although the on surface is crushed by the regime, like the Hong Kong countermeasures to the Central Movement, after the implementation of the "Hong Kong National Security Law", it seems like the implementation of the "Hong Kong National Security Law". Leaders like Huang Zhifeng were arrested. While expanding global expansion, it has caused a rebound in the free world and is isolated, which will inspire more people's vigilance and resistance to it.

Wang Dan: "Although Huang Zhifeng was arrested, the sacrifice of these few people brought a huge achievement, that is, the people of the entire generation of the whole generation of the soberness of reality."

Wang Dan believes that the white paper movement that happened last year was a replica of the "June 4th", and the pursuit of freedom and spirit were not cut off. He emphasized that the pursuit of the two generations has the same place, and hopes that through the June 4th Memorial Hall and related commemorative activities, they can connect the spirit of freedom in different times.

(Voice of Germany) Germany Football (DFL) must abandon plans to raise new capital through investors. At a special general meeting, the relevant revision application did not receive the majority of the two -thirds of the members of the 36 -level and B -level teams.

The voting results of 11 opposition votes and 5 abstains votes were obvious to the German Football Leadership. It also confirmed the resistance of the football group's financing plan. In order to reach two -thirds of the majority, 24 votes of 36 votes of Football Party are required.

"We set this threshold by ourselves. The voting results are obvious majority, but it is not the majority we think. From today, this topic is over."

Dortmund ranked 12th and Schalke 04 team ranked 14th. With Bayern, the total market value of the above three German teams is 4.1 billion euros.

###  trading will bring 2 billion euros in incomeThe financing plan originally pointed out that the right to broadcast the media should be stripped out to become a business subsidiary, whether it is Germany or internationally in the country. The potential investor can buy 12.5%of the company's shares for a period of 20 years.

This model is not no risk. During the contract period, the club must give up 12.5%of the media income to the financier. Even if the income grows moderately (currently obtains nearly 1.3 billion euros from home and abroad at home and abroad), this also means that in the next 20 years, the major clubs of the German Football Federation will bear the income loss of significantly more than 3 billion euros.

### Opposition of the fan group and the club

For the German Football Federation, which is currently led by Axel Hellmann and Oliverleki, the launching financing discussed in this round is still considered "irreplaceable", and only in this way can the competitiveness of the league. In addition, the best situation is that through investment, sales will increase. In other words, although the investors need to be divided, the final total profit will be higher than before, and the goal is to achieve a win -win situation.

Heerman said: "I found that all the opinions from all walks of life were: need to invest." He was surprised by the results of the voting. "You can't say that there is a demand, and then the process is over. Every year, every investment made by investors to other leagues will become more and more difficult for us. Those who oppose loud opposition must now answer this question: Where will the security and stability of the Bundesliga come from in the future. "

The representatives of the suspect are the leadership of the Bundesliga team Cologne 1.FC and the B -League team St. Pauli FC. They point out that investors' interests may conflict with the interests of the league in many fields. They support other ways to obtain new capital. For these critics, pre -occupation of future income is considered a wrong way, which may have long -term damage to Germany's professional football environment.

"Results and fierce disputes show that there are still many issues that need to be clarified and unreasonable," said OKEGOTLICH, chairman of St. Pauli, and he was also a member of the German Federal Union Council. "We must make all clubs be able to understand the importance of such a transaction. The current approach is not enough in terms of time and space. We must form a clear strategy together and constructively. Praising it in a targeted manner to achieve our clearly defined goals. "

### Fans' criticism

The opponents of investors' shares were not even shaken by various recent threats. The German Football Leader Laiki issued a warning saying that if the transaction failed, then the Bundesliga would be stripped out from other parts of the German Football Federation and thereby ending the "subsidy" of the small club.

Many fan groups are also critics, they criticized [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人权组织谴责国际体育机构奖励威权制国家/a-61316736)Essence The refusal of the investment plan is a blow to the German Football League leadership that hopes to improve the financial prospects of the league.

Customers of "Amazonchina" received an email notification on May 23 that from July 17, the "Amazon App Store" service will not be provided. Because "Amazon China" only announced the stop of its China Kindle Electronic Bookstore last year, at this time, it was closed again in China ’s application store services, causing heated discussions on whether the company intends to gradually withdraw from the Chinese market.

Amazon China clarified on the 24th that stopping the "Amazon App Store" will not affect Amazon's business operations in China, including Amazon Overseas Purchase, Amazon Global Store and Amazon China official website, and the suspension of Amazon App Store has no shopping for Amazon shopping.

According to a comprehensive report, the "Amazon App Store" mainly provides applications and games and other content downloads. You can download this app store on the official website of "Amazon China" and download various applications through Amazon account.

Amazon announced that it will suspend the Amazon App Store service, which is another case for American technology companies to add another case in China.

Jiang Yaqi, the chairman of the Taiwan Legal Science and Technology Association and the associate professor of the School of Marine Law and Policy of the National Ocean University, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia on the 25th that this was not the first time that Amazon had reduced its business scale in China. Serve. Although it cannot be said that this is the company's "full exit", it does have a trend of gradually narrowing and withdrawing from the Chinese market layout.

Jiang Yaqi analyzed: "In recent years, China's regulations on personal data protection, data outbound, and data security are getting strict. In addition to the opaque Chinese regulations, it is difficult for foreign businessmen to review. Many officials are more stringent, but the regulations of the information and security data with inadequate law enforcement standards to overseas transmission are becoming more and more difficult to operate in the Chinese market. "

Jiang Yaqi believes that these foreign companies in China "internal and foreign and foreign -foreign" must not only compete with China's same -nature e -commerce, and the current Chinese regulations have become important assets between national geopolitical and scientific and technological competition. Many regulations in China are legally strictly booked by the standards of data security, but China's transparency in law enforcement or the requirements of national security is not so clear for foreign manufacturers. Of course, these will be improved. Risks of Chinese market operations.

Wang Xiuwen, assistant researcher at the Institute of Politics and combat concepts of the National Defense Security Research Institute of Taiwan ’s National Defense Security Research Institute, also mentioned that China’ s Anti -Spy Law has just been revised in April in April to take action on some foreign and domestic consultants and consulting companies.

Wang Xiuwen judged: "On the one hand, Chinese Douyin (TIKTOK) is preparing to be blocked or controlled in the United States, making Amazon worry about whether it will become an innocent cannon fodder under the competition between China and the United States; When foreign businessmen do not know if they have violated Chinese laws, or if China requires him to hand over customer information, I do not know if they can and are willing to provide it, and simply turn off the platform themselves. "

In addition, Wang Xiuwen mentioned that the Amazon App Store mainly provides applications and games in Android phones. This move is also related to Xi Jinping's wanting to rectify related policies such as the game industry: "Amazon feels that the signs are wrong, withdraw first. And Amazon also Amazon In the United States for layoffs, I do n’t know if there is their own internal relationship, that is, the consideration of reducing the company's internal operations by itself. "

** Anti -espionage method and violation of Guoan hat are too big ** ** China self -broken road decoupling **

Wang Xiuwen believes that China's "Anti -Spy Law" is extremely friendly to foreign -funded enterprises. Whether it will have a joint effect will affect other multinational e -commerce to evacuate China and have to observe follow -up. It is possible that after China banned Micron, China ’s relevant stocks in China have risen up. The Amazon App Store has collected it, which may promote the Chinese domestic e -commerce platform, such as Baidu, but the market is optimistic. This caused the outside world to suspect that the Chinese government said that fighting legal warfare was actually to ensure the survival of domestic industries.

Wang Xiuwen: "Who is this decoupled? It is China to decide with others. Amazon is so big. Don't even go through Amazon to shop overseas. This is funny.

In addition, colleges and universities secretly make the data "look better".

(Voice of Germany Chinese) China announced that the unemployment rate in April announced was 5.2%, a decrease of 0.1%from March, but the unemployment rate of young people aged 16 to 24 is as high as 20.4%, the highest since record. According to data from the Ministry of Education, in 2022, the number of Chinese college graduates was 10.76 million. In 2023, college graduates are expected to be 11.85 million, an increase of 820,000 year -on -year, and the scale of graduates hit a record high. According to the "2022 China Returnees Employment Survey Report", since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020, the number of returnees returned to China has also increased significantly. The number of returns returned from 2021 and 2022 has exceeded one million, which has even increased the pressure of fresh graduates to find a job.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/毕业即失业-中国年轻人失业率居高不下/a-64834417)The Chinese government has also taken various means and measures.

Many provinces and cities have issued policies to encourage small and medium -sized enterprises to recruit fresh graduates. In 2022, Shandong Province adopted small and medium -sized enterprises who recruit college graduates and signed a labor contract for more than one year, and gave one -time employment subsidies to 10,000 yuan/person. In Jiangsu Province, if an enterprise enrolls the college graduates of the year to sign a labor contract for more than one year and participate in unemployment insurance, it will distribute a one -time expansion subsidy from the unemployment insurance fund at the standard of 1,500 yuan per person.

Ms. Mo Mo, who is engaged in manufacturing and sold on the Internet, said in an interview that because of the subsidy relationship, he recruited several fresh graduates this year, and even recruited a undergraduate study at 985 universities. Britain's fresh graduates who have obtained a master's degree.

"The person we recruited before, there are only three of the highest degree of education." Ms. Mo said. "In this year, there are many people who vote more than in previous years. The big e -commerce platform has been internship. "But after she recruited people, she was a little uneasy in her heart, worried that the development opportunities that her company could provide will not be able to match the expectations of the returnee master, and she was worried that she left the job not long after the job of returnees.

She said, "In fact, we don't need to be highly high, nor can we speak English, but we hope to get started quickly, work hard, and do it. And because we are small companies, all kinds of miscellaneous work must be done. , It may be different from the expectations of students who have experienced internships with big companies. "

### How to deal with the age of population?

### civil servant and master's degree expansion

According to the "2023 University Student Employment Research Report" released by Zhilian Recruitment, the slow employment ratio also increased from 15.9%last year to 18.9%. The main reason for slow employment is to take the postgraduate entrance examination and the preparation.

This year, the provincial examination of civil servants will be expanded sharply, with an expansion of 17%, of which 27 provinces are expanded. Gansu expansion reaches 80%, and there are more than 50%of many provinces. "In 2023, more than 50%of the provincial civil servants have been expanded by more than 50%" also appeared on Weibo hot search, becoming one of the ways for the country to solve the employment of fresh graduates.

Data show that most of the posts of enrollment are grassroots, such as the county government and the position of the district government. The largest proportion of the enrollment is the remote areas of Gansu Province, Yunnan Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Essence Freshman Bosheng has also relaxed age restrictions.

Many universities also conducted postgraduate enrollment. In 2023, there were 864 enrollment units across the country in the postgraduate entrance examination a total of 761,763 recruitment, an increase of 10,245 people from 2022. Because the employment situation is severe, more and more fresh graduates choose to continue their studies instead of finding a job. A total of 4.74 million candidates for the National Master's Graduate Admissions Examination in 2023 registered, an increase of 170,000 compared with 2022, a record high.

### University data "water injection"

The employment rate of fresh graduates has also become one of the important criteria for measuring universities and majors. In order to make the data look better, and to be able to go to the upper layer, there are also school fraud.

A Shanghai student Xiao Zhang, who is about to graduate from a master's degree, told reporters in an interview that his mentor asked him to find some ways to sign a three -party agreement so that he could be counted as an employment when statistics.

"He told me several times on WeChat that if he did not sign the three -party agreement, he would not let graduation defense." Xiao Zhang said, "But I don’t want to find a job immediately. Application materials, ready to apply for foreign doctoral projects in the second half of this year. "

However, the instructor advised him to find some acquaintances signed the three -party agreement, so that he could help the school to complete the task. He also said that if Xiao Zhang could not find the help of an acquaintance, the instructor could contact someone to help.

"I don't want to sign, I didn't find a job, but I didn't find a job, so the instructor asked me to deal with it."

Xiaodi, an undergraduate graduate in Harbin, was asked to sign a flexible employment agreement by a counselor. The flexible employment agreement includes two types: independent entrepreneurship and freelance occupation. After signing, it also belongs to finding a job during statistics.

She showed reporters the WeChat sent by the counselor. In WeChat, the counselor said straightforwardly that the flexible employment agreement was "the school simply just completed the task issued above" and asked Xiaodi to help him complete KPI. Moreover, the counselor assured Xiaodi that the agreement was only for statistics. She would not be affected in the future or the preparation of the examination.

### Why do many Chinese women unwilling to have more children?

### Public opinion publicity

There is a structural contradiction in the current employment market, that is, the incompleteness of talents and labor markets cultivated by universities. Some professional graduates are too large.

The "China Blue -collar Employment Market Embarra" in 2021 shows that the blue -collar employment index has risen sharply, and it has even exceeded the level before the epidemic. A survey by CCTV shows that 83%of manufacturing companies have expressed varying degrees of blue -collar workers. But many college students are yearning for white -collar workers in the office building.

In the past few months, the Chinese government has also used public opinion to promote the work of blue -collar workers. In a hot search on Weibo, the graduates of the logistics major of Tianjin University owed debt because of accidental friends. He chose the industry to take the takeaway. 400,000 debts were paid in the year.

There are many similar stories in hot search and media reports. For example, the post -95s Ms. Wang resigned from 300,000 years of salary work, because she resigned to sell fast food, and the monthly income was 40,000; for example, Ms. Huang of Zhengzhou University relied on "Rotten" monthly income; for example, the post -95s couple operated a snack stall in Yiwu, Zhejiang, and they could earn 9,000 yuan a day.

In a short period of time, such eye -catching stories are frequently reported, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体新时代的上山下乡运动/a-65661636)Call for young people to face the pressure of employment and rely on labor to change their situation. Call: "The era of Kong Yiji is gone, and young people with contemporary contemporary will never be trapped in a gown."There is a message from a young man: "It is you who let me wear a gown, and you who scold me in a gown too."

U.S. officials said that in addition to drone attacks, they believe that Ukraine should also assassinate the daughter of a well -known Russian sociologist, kill a Blogist author of Russia, and the Russian town near the Russian and Ukraine border. A series of attacks are responsible.

U.S. officials also believe that the "Beixi" pipeline was bombed by Agent of Kujes, and their relationship with the Ukraine government has not yet been determined.

Russian media reported on May 3 that Ukraine tried to dispatch drones to attack the Kak Palace, and the Russian side took action in a timely manner to cause the drone to be abnormal and did not cause casualties or property losses. Russian President Putin was not injured due to attacks, and his working day was as usual.

Subsequently, Zerrenki denied the attack of the attack: "We don't have enough weapons to do this. This is why we are not using it anywhere."

The United States is the largest military equipment supply country in Ukraine.

It is reported that the United States is an assessment based on intercepted Russia and Ukraine communications.

The New York Times pointed out that the United States intercepted the dialogue of Ukraine, and some of them said that they believed that its country should be responsible for this attack; the United States also eavesdropped Russia's communications. These communications show that the Kremlin's attack is not a Russian self -directed plan for planting stolen goods. Essence

The Kremlin spokesman Dmitrypeskov said in the relevant report, "We immediately showed that the Ukraine government was behind the scenes." "No matter which units in the Ukrainian government, there is no difference."

It is reported that U.S. officials said they did not believe that the Ukrainian President Zelezky would sign all secret operations by hand. These officials said that it is unclear to how much Zelezki knows in advance.

Russia has accused Ukraine of trying to assassinate the country President Putin by drone. Zeelianki immediately denied Ukraine's participation.

### Wagner Group transferred Bachmut to the Russian army

At the same time, Russia's Wagner hired mercenary group issued a statement on Thursday that the group began to transfer the positions of Bachurut, eastern Ukraine to the Russian military.

A few days ago, the Moscow military stated that it had deployed fighters and artillery on Russia's land to block the "destruction organizations" from Ukraine Vietnam.

On Thursday, Russia stated that Chinese Eurasian affairs Li Hui would visit Moscow on Friday. Li Hui started a trip to Europe on May 15th and visited many European capitals including Kiev.

"We will retreat from Bachmuut today from Bachomum. We will transfer positions, ammunition and all the military in a video released by Yevgeny Prigozhin."

He added: "We retreat, rest, prepare, and then we will get new tasks."

Earlier this week, Rigerjin acknowledged that about 10,000 prisoners he recruited were killed on the Ukrainian battlefield.

The Kremlin ally went to various hells in Russia last year to persuade the prisoners to fight with the Wagner Group in exchange for promise for amnesty.

Reuters [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/tj1-05252023133044.html/@@stream)A China think tank recently released a report stating that as global climate warming has intensified year by year, the Top Ten River system in Asia is facing a drought crisis. These rivers flow through 16 countries in Asia, supporting the economic and energy security of many countries.

These rivers flow through 16 countries in Asia, including China, as well as Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and other countries. There are as many as 1.9 billion people through the area, with an annual economic output value of about 4.3 trillion US dollars. These rivers are not only the cradle of Asian civilization, but also produce three -quarters of rice crops such as rice.

** Human and natural reasons lead to the water supply pressure of the river **

However, due to climate change, the melting acceleration of glaciers, decreased snowfall, and monsoon changes. At the same time, human beings have excessive development of groundwater resources, etc., all of which cause the above reasons to cause shortage of water resources in the rivers, and will affect and endanger half of the population in Asia.

The report predicts that if the Paris Climate Convention is scheduled, when the global temperature is heating by 1.5 to 2 degrees in 2050, the four of the above 10 rivers will have the risk of water resource drama. At the same time, the methods of relying on these rivers to generate power generation will not continue. At present, 46%of the total power of the Asian coastal country relies on the above river to assist in power generation.

Debratan, the person in charge of China Water Risk Think Tank and the main author of this report, said: "The uncertainty and extreme climate of these ten rivers' water volume have enabled us to establish a new energy and water resource system to strengthen climate change. The ability to deal with ... ... In order to manage water risk and higher and higher water needs, establishing a new system is imminent. "

** China is facing the problem of medium and high water risk power generation.

The report evaluates that in all countries, Laos, which is not around the sea, faces the highest water risk, Myanmar and Cambodia are high risks, China is high risk, and Vietnam is low risk. Among them, for China, in the above ten rivers, only the Amu River does not flow through China. The remaining Jiuhe River supports the daily life of 44%of China's population. Help China generate more than half of total electricity.

The report also pointed out that Asian countries highly depend on coal -fired power generation. This power generation model not only accelerates global warming, but also requires high dependence on water cooling and driving steam turbines. Therefore Facing an energy crisis. To deal with these issues, the report calls on Asian countries to cross -border cooperation and formulate common policies in water resources sharing, energy and development issues.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The court sentenced the oldest of the four of them to prison for 5 years and 8 months, and sent the other three to the teaching. The case was processed under the framework of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, and China implemented the law in Hong Kong in 2020.

The four defendants were aged 17 to 21 years old when they committed the crime. They were members of the little -known organization called "Light City" organization. The organization advocated Hong Kong independence and called for resistance after the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law.

The organization was charged with TATP explosives to make bombs in 2021 and detonated in the public area-including the court building. Before they purchased the materials, the national security police in Hong Kong arrested them in July that year.

Li Yunteng, a judge of Hong Kong High Court, believes that the 21 -year -old defendant Owen "obviously needs greater responsibility. It is said that he" participated in the work of renting, planning and preparations, and reconnaissance target buildings. " Prison.

The judge said that the other three defendants aged 17 to 18 are "basically ordinary soldiers in the conspiracy plan" and did not successfully purchase TATP explosive raw materials. They will be sent to the teaching office. A facilities that are dominated by rehabilitation can accommodate young people aged 14 to 20, where they live there for three years.

### ** Acknowledge "conspiracy to create explosion" **

How long does it take to be based on the evaluation of officials disciplined officials. The "Light City" organized this month to recognize the crime of "conspiracy manufacturing explosion", rather than the charges of "conspiracy to implement terrorist activities" proposed by the prosecution.

The former can be sentenced to a maximum 20 -year imprisonment in accordance with the Hong Kong Crime Regulations, but the latter can be sentenced to life imprisonment according to the Security Law.

The full name of the Hong Kong National Security Law, "The People's Republic of China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Maintenance of the National Security Law", was implemented after Hong Kong suffered a huge and often violent clashes in 2019.

The authorities said that this was to restore stability and order, but critics said that since the effectiveness of the law, Hong Kong's autonomy and the right to freedom of citizens have been weakened.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-25T14-16-00-04-00/000000.png)China has accelerated artificial intelligence and military applications. The picture shows the Chinese military's development of the brain signal to control the robot. [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05252023134238.html/@@images/image)Reuters information picture [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-05252023134238.html/@@stream)Audience friends, hello everyone. What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Today, talk about the application of artificial intelligence in the PLA's combat.

Bloomberg reported last week that China used the trend of artificial intelligence (AI) for war, from Silicon Valley to the Pentagon in the United States. Ericschmidt, a former CEO of Google, emphasized the severity of this issue at the parliamentary hearing. The "Special Competitive Research Plan" led by his leadership issued a report this month that the United States needs to redesign the army to respond to this threat.

** Artificial intelligence invading Taiwan soldiers push **

Schmidt warned at the hearing that in addition to the "military -civilian integration" plan that focused on the close cooperation between the Chinese military and the civilian industry, China should also consider that China's investment in national defense artificial intelligence far exceeds the United States. Although the United States has been "slightly leading" in key areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing for several years, China has invested more manpower to engage in research on the field of strategic artificial intelligence.

Many officials and members of the US Department of Defense believe that if the United States does not quickly develop strong artificial intelligence weapons, it may be defeated in potential conflicts with China in the future. The author stated to Bloomberg that the purpose of writing the report was to convey the urgency of accelerating the development of artificial intelligence to the Ministry of Defense, Congress and the public.

According to observations, China's investment and development focus on multiple key areas, including the research of artificial intelligence algorithms, big data analysis, machine learning, automation, and unmanned systems. In addition, China still uses artificial intelligence in military applications, develops smart missiles, autonomous drones and automated combat systems. Although the United States has led a few years, China is increasing investment in talent training, research and development institutions and laboratory construction, promoting artificial intelligence development, and applying it to national defense and military fields.

According to research and analysis of the US think tank, the Chinese military has used artificial intelligence to perform military chess in Taiwan. But it has not been confirmed by authoritative units. However, from some comments, articles and military public works in the PLA Daily, it has seen that artificial intelligence may be used in the PLA simulation and possible applications.

The first is that the situation is determined: artificial intelligence can help generate and simulate various battlefield situations, including geographical environment, behavior and response of enemy forces. Based on big data and machine learning technology, artificial intelligence can help the PLA create more real and diverse battle field scenes in simulation training, to evaluate and study various ideas of fighting Taiwan in a combatant way.

The second is command and control: artificial intelligence can provide assistance and support in command decision -making and combat command. Through data analysis and pattern recognition, artificial intelligence can help the commander better understand the battlefield situation, predict enemy intent, and support the formulation of decision -making. In addition, artificial intelligence can also assist commanders to perform the battlefieldist perception and decision -making optimization to improve command efficiency and combat effects.

** The decisive factor is that people are not things **

However, it should also be seen that although artificial intelligence can assist in command and decision -making process. But in actual situation, the experience and judgment of the commander are still important. The PLA's works have mentioned many times that although artificial intelligence can process massive data and simulation situations, in a highly complex and dynamic battlefield environment, uncertainty and accidents may be faced. Therefore, the flexibility, judgment, and rapid response ability of the commander become important, and these are unique to human decision -making. In the final analysis, the experience, intuition and decision -making ability of the commander are the key to ensuring success.

Mao Zedong once said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor, and the decisive factor is that people are not things." This sentence is deeply imprinted in the minds of the People's Liberation Army, becoming an unbreakable belief.

The third is to sort out the combat plan for Taiwan: artificial intelligence can be used to analyze and evaluate the effects and feasibility of various combat plans against Taiwan. By simulation and model deduction, assist the commander to better understand the advantages, weaknesses and potential results of different solutions, thereby optimizing and improving combat solutions. Artificial intelligence also helps to promote the organization and implementation of integrated combat combat, and generate and update the combat order required for future war forms.

In early August last year, NancyPelosi visited Taiwan, the President of the U.S. Parliament, and the PLA organized multi -military assault on the sea assault, fighting against land, air -making operations such as land, and air -making operations for 8 consecutive days. The purpose of refusing to stop the United States and Japan "is the purpose of the strategic deterrence, and breaks the central line of the strait to form a new normal to the Taiwan. The training was unified by the Eastern theater, and it was launched with a multi -military troops to become a system and full combat elements (from intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, command control, and joint strike to comprehensive guarantee). Without the assistance and support of artificial intelligence, the exercise operation is difficult to develop seamlessly in a short time.

In early April of this year, President Tsai Ing -wen in Taiwan and Kevinmccarthy, Speaker of the United States Congress, met in California in the United States. For favorable arrays, the trend of the siege is formed to the Taiwan. At the same time, the aircraft carrier -based aircraft of the aircraft carrier was used to take off from the eastern waters of Taiwan to coordinate with the western attack to Taiwan. It forms a storm of east -west clamping Taiwan Island. Without the assistance and support of artificial intelligence, it may be difficult to achieve such a tightly siege pressure effect.

** Intelligent training **

Since September last year, the PLA was investigated and unmanned, and there were at least 4 models. In April and May of this year, the PLA's three models of investigating all -in -one drones flew around Taiwan in the direction of the clock and clock for the first time, and began to enter intelligent training with drones. Military aircraft warships, collaboration between campaign and tactical levels, and mission collaboration between drones. At the same time, a new model of large -scale drones to the normalized reconnaissance of eastern Taiwan, conducting normalized reconnaissance on the battle base and weapon test field of the eastern part of Taiwan, supplementing satellite's time and regional reconnaissance gap, and can also be for the eastern part of Taiwan during the war to the eastern part of Taiwan. The combat power preservation area (or behind the strategy) forms a comprehensive and full -time reconnaissance, providing experience, route and data.Data is the basic requirements of artificial intelligence calculations. The greater the amount of data, the more realistic the amount of data. The better the training and generating effect of artificial intelligence. At present, the biggest deficiency of the PLA is the lack of actual data for artificial intelligence calculations. Practical experience can provide a large amount of real data and situations to help artificial intelligence systems learn and generate various complex battlefield conditions. Until now, the PLA mainly relies on computer simulation training and exercises, and has obtained data from military exchanges and technical cooperation with foreign forces. It is essentially different from the actual data of the US military.

In order to make up for this critical deficiency, the PLA has increased practical training in recent years, and focuses on the training field domain in the Taiwan Strait area.

The foundation of model optimization.

It is reported that the PLA's important goals for Taiwan are compiled into a directory, which is to use artificial intelligence and weapons and ammunition to use the nature of the target, the means and methods of strikes, and the need to fight. Outlet analysis and crackdown planning. Specifically, artificial intelligence can help the PLA achieve multiple functions.

** Catalog on the Taiwan target **

The first is target recognition and classification: artificial intelligence can automatically process and analyze various intelligence data, including satellite images, reconnaissance reports, and open source intelligence, and identify and classify important goals in Taiwan. Through training models and algorithms, the nature, characteristics and importance of the goal are automatically identified.

Secondly, target analysis and evaluation: artificial intelligence uses existing information and data, combined with model deduction and algorithms, analyze and evaluate the target, including the strength, defense ability, strike requirements, and possible strike methods of important goals, etc. evaluation of. In this way, artificial intelligence can assist the PLA to better grasp the characteristics of the goal and strike needs.

Then it is to combat planning and optimization: Based on the target compilation of the target, artificial intelligence uses optimization algorithms and decision -making models to combat planning and resource allocation. By considering factors such as different strike methods, weapons and equipment, and troops, artificial intelligence helps the PLA to formulate a more effective blow plan and optimize the configuration of combat resources.

However, the above are ideal. The application of artificial intelligence in the target catalog and crackdown planning is still exploring and developing. The accuracy and reliability requires comprehensive consideration of various factors. So you can understand it like this. The target catalog requires the PLA to continuously improve through the military chess confrontation, local simulation, and real soldiers.

In August last year and April this year, the PLA implemented military exercises in Taiwan. It can use this test and evaluate the accuracy, practicality and operability of the target and catalog, and obtain real -time intelligence in the nature, defense ability, and strike requirements of the target. Essence Such exercises help the PLA to improve the accuracy and effect of combat against Taiwan, and also provide valuable experience and data support for the further improvement and improvement of the target catalogs.

** Great development potential **

Taiwan and the United States have the intention of the PLA. Therefore, during the exercise, maintain the maximum restraint, do not make any tactical response, and do not give the PLA's opportunities to collect target intelligence, so that it cannot test and evaluate the nature and defense ability of the target. The outside world thinks that Taiwan and the United States show their weakness, but they are actually confidential. Data is combat power, the soil of artificial intelligence generated, and the key to the decisive victory of the war.

Artificial intelligence potential is endless. However, it should also be seen that the application of artificial intelligence technology is still in the early stage of development. There are still many challenges to be overcome for the complex combat environment and decision -making process. When applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy and data of the algorithm. Reliability, combined with the professional literacy of personnel, conduct comprehensive judgment and decision -making. From this perspective, the PLA has taken the pace and has huge development potential. Otherwise, the United States will not pull up alarm and fully deal with the challenges brought by China.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T14-27-00Z/63695579_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65735624/63695579)(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The "Daily News" website published an article saying that the actions adopted by China were not surprising. After all, the United States launched the export limit of chip and chip production equipment before, and it is also forbidden to enter high -tech products such as Huawei to enter the entry of high -tech products such as Huawei. U.S. However, this article entitled "Sino -US Technology Contents" is skeptical of whether American companies can really be decoupled. The article wrote:

"Over the years, analysts have been criticizing the huge dependence of US high -tech companies to the Chinese market. Taking Apple as an example, more than 90%of their smartphones are produced in the People's Republic of China. Apple is so densely concentrated in China. China's epidemic prevention and control measures have made Apple production difficulties, so that the crucial Christmas sales have been greatly affected. Discussion.

Economist Friedman, an economist of Cornell University, previously warned that [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印度能帮苹果摆脱中国困局吗/a-63711815)However, Bank of America Morgan Chase predicts that as of 2025, Apple's proportion of Apple's output in China will decrease from the current 95%to 75%.

However, it is not only American companies that move the production base from China to India, but some German companies have also begun to be optimistic about India. German automobile supplier Scholes has opened a new software and electronic technology research and development center in Pina, India. "

With the continuous intensification of geopolitics between China and the United States, some multinational companies have begun to reduce investment in China to avoid risks. But is India really a safe harbor for investment? The article wrote:

"India is actually not as risky as an investment destination, because the geopolitical signal sent by the country is also quite contradictory. Therefore, it is still unknown whether the country will have political differences with the Western camp in the future. For example, India is outside China outside China. The main buyers of Russian crude oil and natural gas. Robert Rethfeld, a marketing expert of corporate consulting company, said: 80%of Russian crude oil flows to India and China. '

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-25T14-27-00Z/63598262_401.jpg)In September last year, China's strict "zero measures" have caused Zhengzhou's Apple foundries for a discontinued production.

From this point of view, India is also indirectly funded Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. So far, the Western camp led by the United States seems to be a blind eye.

Participants pointed out that in recent years, China ’s irresponsible and opaque loan is an important factor that caused low -income countries to face the sovereign debt crisis. The United States needs to urge international financial institutions to play its core functions to resist China's debt trap risk.

[** "The Ten Anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative" is still effective to assist the development of the banner? **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-05242023103331.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/9-03082023154027.html)**

On May 25, the national security, illegal finance and international financial institution groups under the Financial Committee of the House of Representatives of the Congress held a hearing, focusing on the competition of large powers, China ’s extensive impact on global loan behavior on the world's economic system. The members of the committee and the participating experts reach a consensus, that is, only by enhancing the function of international financial institutions can we effectively fight China's global economic ambitions.

The chairman of the group committee, Blaineluetkemeyer, pointed out that as many as 60%of the world's low -income countries are currently facing debt dilemma. In the case of the slowdown of the global economy, if you do not restructuring or exempt from debt, it is not owed that owed. Loans will face huge risk of financial default.

"China has played an increasingly larger and uncoordinated role in providing funds ... ... At least 65 countries owe Chinese lenders that owe Chinese lenders exceeding 10%of their total foreign debt. When countries fall into financial dilemma, these large number of opaque China The debt has hindered the reorganization. "He said," Ironically, at the same time, the World Bank continues to provide more than $ 1 billion of loans to China each year. China is still one of the biggest debt countries of the World Bank and the biggest benefit of the world's bank expenditure. By."

Members of the Group Committee and Democratic Representative, Joycebeatty, emphasized that international financial institutions including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) provide financial assistance to countries in the crisis, and Supporting global development and fighting against China's use of foreign debt to expand global influence is crucial. She said that only if international financial institutions actively provide assistance to the debt countries, these countries will not turn to China for funds.

And it is essential to combat China's use of foreign debt to expand global influence. (Video screenshot/US Congress official website) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw-05252023140105.html/jw0525a.jpg)Jesse M.schreger, associate professor of business school in Columbia University, told the committee that China plays an important role in the sovereign debt crisis. He said that China is now the world's largest bilateral debt country, and most of its loans are settled in the US dollar. Chinese debt accounted for almost a quarter or half of the domestic GDP.

"China provides loans through policy banks controlled by the state to make it between traditional international private creditors such as bond investors and other official bilateral government lenders. He said, "((countries) in the end how much money owed China is not sure. China does not participate in the traditional credit and reporting system. It tends to set up confidentiality clauses to prevent the debt party from disclosing relevant information."

The Associated Press has recently reported that China's lending operation has now led to dozens of poor countries in the world facing the sovereign debt crisis and the economy is on the verge of collapse. These countries include Pakistan, Kenya, etc., of which Zambia and Sri Lanka have debt default. Some experts point out that unless China makes concessions, more debt defaults will occur in relevant borrowing countries. At the same time, although these countries are in crisis, the Chinese government is still unwilling to avoid debt.

Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) Agent Markrosen, executive director, strongly suggested US legislators to urge relevant international institutions to adhere to the core functions of providing assistance to the sovereign debt crisis. He also believes that China is the biggest challenge to maintain the stability of world finance.

"The biggest challenge facing the International Monetary Fund today is China. China provides a lot of funds to emerging markets and low -income countries in an opaque and irresponsible way. ","

He also said that China has been urging the increase in its share in the International Monetary Fund, but in view of its debt behavior, it is not the time to increase China's share.

Daniel F.Runde, senior vice president of the US Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS), emphasized that if the United States cannot play the leadership role of international financial institutions such as multilateral development banks in the competition of large powers, the majority of developing countries will be in the majority of developing countries will Turn to help in China and Russia. He also suggested that the United States should increase capital in the development of banking systems such as Fuxing and Development Bank in Europe, and incorporate Taiwan as an economy into the system to better support the global financial system led by the United States.

A recent research report published by the Research Team of the University of Okayama, Japan, pointed out that the grinding teeth may be related to food fiber intake during sleep, increasing food fiber intake or improving molar behavior.

Kyodo News reported that the research surveyed about 140 students aged 18 to 32 to 35 nutrients, and whether there were molars when sleeping. The results showed that the average food fiber intake of students who did not wear teeth was about 13 grams per day, and the food fiber intake of the grinding students was about 10 grams per day. The difference in three grams of three grams is the food fiber content of three bananas.

There is only food fiber associated with molars. There were previous studies that the more food fiber intake, the higher the sleep quality.

The research team of the University of Okayama said that molar can cause adverse effects such as tooth defects and periodontal disease. The lower the quality of sleep, the more prone to molars.

At present, the causes of molars are ingested with caffeine and alcohol, but no way to reduce the behavior of molars has not been found.

Reuters reported that Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday (May 24) that according to the communication of Ukrainian officials intercepted by the United States, the drone attack earlier this month was likely to be a special military or in Ukraine or Intelligence department planning.

However, American intelligence agencies do not know which unit in Ukraine has implemented the attack, and it is not clear whether the President of Ukraine or his senior officials know the operation.

The Kremlin spokesman Peskov said to the media on Thursday (25th): "We (after being attacked) immediately pointed out that the back of the attack was the Kiev power. In the final analysis, the attack was the attack of which unit of the Kiev government. ","

The Russian News Agency issued a statement on May 3 that the two drones attacked the Ke Palace on the same day, but were shot down by the Russian and intelligence department's electronic air defense system. Russia claims that the attack was implemented under the instructions of Ukraine in the United States in order to assassinate Russian President Putin and show that Russia reserves the right to revenge.

Ukraine at the time [](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230503-1390370)The United States also said that Russia was lying.

Ukrainian presidential consultant Mykhailo Podolyak said on Thursday that Ukraine and Kremlin's "strange and meaningless" attack has nothing to do.

He told Reuters that Russia tried to use Western concerns about Ukraine's possibility of attacking the Russian territory and causing an upgrade of the situation, thereby reducing the supply of weapons transported to Ukraine.

According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday (May 25), the number of net immigrants in the UK reached 6006,000 in 2022, a record high, and international students and migrant groups became the main British immigrant army.

Comprehensive Agence France -Presse and BBC reported that Jaylindop, director of the International Immigration Center of the National Bureau of Statistics, pointed out that the number of net immigrants has soared, mainly due to the purpose of "migrant workers, learning and humanitarian purposes, from non -EU countries for" migrant workers, learning and humanitarian purposes. "Driven by people.

In 2022, it is estimated that 1.2 million people arrived in the UK and 550,000 British immigrated to other countries. The difference between the two is the number of net immigrants.

Dr. Dr Peterwalsh at Oxford University of Oxford's immigration observation station said Britain is a popular destination for foreign students and workers. Government and universities have taken measures to recruit more students, especially students from countries such as India and Nigeria. They also brought about 100,000 partners and children.

International students usually have to pay high tuition fees, and these money can be used to subsidize the education costs of domestic students.

The rising number of net immigrants also surprised the British government. Prime Minister Sonak admitted that the number was "too high" in an interview on Thursday, but he had not lost control. He wanted to reduce it.

The Conservative Government led by Sunak has always strived to reduce the number of immigrants and hopes to end the free flow of EU personnel after Brexit through the increasingly stringent immigration policy, thereby allowing Britain to "recapture" the control of the border of the country.

The British authorities have just announced on Tuesday (23) that they will tighten the visa policy of overseas students and try to reduce the number of immigrants. The new policy stipulates that starting from next year, only international students participating in research master's programs can bring their families to Britain.

Sunak also promised to take more means, but did not disclose details.

A application intelligence company said that social media application Tiktok is testing a Tako of an artificial intelligence (AI) chat robot to communicate with users short videos and help them discover the content.

Reuters reports that the headquarters AI technology company Watchfultechnologies said that this AI chat robot known as Tako has been found in some versions of TIKTOK applications on Apple mobile devices.

According to the relevant screenshots and video information, Tako shows a ghost -shaped icon in the Tiktok program. Users can click on it when watching the video, make a text dialogue, and look for content with the help of Tako.

Tiktok's spokesman said: "In the selected market, we are promoting a new method of searching and excavation (content) on Tiktok. We look forward to learning from our user community and continue to create a safe place to bring entertainment , Stimulate creativity and promote culture. "

US media reported in April that Tiktok is testing a genetic AI tool that allows users to create avatars. According to Chinese media reports, TIKTOK's Chinese parent company's byte beating is developing a large AI model, but currently does not provide the function of providing AI chat robots on Tiktok's Chinese version.

According to information submitted to the US Patent and Trademarks last month, Tiktok has submitted a trademark application for "TIKTOK TAKO", which belongs to the "computer software for artificial human voice and text".

Watchful Technologies Researcher Danielbuchuk said that unlike Chatgpt ChatGPT, which is positioned as a multi -purpose, Tako feels more like a navigation assistant, focusing on encouraging users to watch more videos.

Buchak's demonstration shows that when users ask Tako, Tako will reply by summing up the tiktok user's prompts, and also recommend related videos.

TIKTOK set up a disclaimer, saying that TAKO is an experimental chat robot, and the answer may be inaccurate; Tiktok will talk to Tako for the purpose of security, and warn users not to share private information with Tako.

Ji Xinji, a scholar, wears thick glasses, and has a high degree of recognition. He took his mother tongue's German accent and talked about his wisdom, but his tone did not restrain frustration. Nevertheless, even the strictest critics have to be convinced of his talent.

Ji Xinji advocated real politics and defended power and national interests coldly. After he stepped down in 1977, he was basically outdated when he promoted moralism, but he could still be said to be still reputable.

Before the centennial birth, Ji Xinchi blown candles at the Economic Club of Newyork at the New York Economic Club. His Jewish family fled from Nazi Germany, and Ji Xinji grew up in the local area.

At the centenary birthday banquet, Ji Xinji showed that his worldview had not changed. He warned the United States to maintain the scope of "vital interests". He told guests present: "We must always be strong enough to resist any pressure."

In contrast to the point of view of most American decision makers, Ji Xinchi Lord Russia has suffered strategic frustration, calling for a diplomacy against Moscow to promote Ukraine's ceasefire.

Brock also proposed a recording that Ji Xinji told Nixon that the Air Force had ordered the Air Force to bomb the "any movement" in Cambodia. There is no differential bombing of civilians.

The veteran writer Christopher Hitchens appealed to the trial of Ji Xinchi because he acquiesced in Turkey in 1974 invasion of Sai Price.

Ji Xinji and Northern Vietnamese negotiated representative Le Ductho in 1973 became the Nobel Prize winner to recognize their contributions to the ceasefire in Vietnam. But Lede Shou refused to accept this peaceful award that caused controversy.

The relationship between Germany and Russia has almost ruptured since the start of the Russian and Ukraine War, and Xiao Zi may have recovered contact with Russia.

The last time the two leaders called in early December last year. In a one -hour call, Xiao Zi urged Pu Ting to withdraw from the Russian army from Ukraine, while Pu Ting accused the West in pursuing the "devastating" policy.

Since then, the tension between Moscow and Berlin has repeatedly increased. Russia is particularly dissatisfied with the Xiaozi government allowed to transport German -owned chariot to Ukraine in January this year.

In the interview, Xiao Zi insisted that his goal was still "actively supporting Ukraine", but "at the same time, the North Atlantic Convention (NATO) broke out directly with Russia."

He said, "Never do it alone, but to closely coordinate with our friends and allies."

When asked about the possibility of stopping the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations, Xiao Zi said that Pu Ting must understand that the war could not be eased by "barely reaching a certain fragile peaceful situation".

He said: "For example, turning the current front line into a" border "between Russia and Ukraine. On the contrary, this is about fairness and peace, and the prerequisite is that Russia withdraws troops."

After Moscow wielded the army in February last year, the relationship between Russia and Germany fell to freezing. Actions invading Ukraine and Moscow's reduction of natural gas supply in Europe have caused a particularly serious impact on Germany, because Germany depends on cheap Russian energy sources to provide motivation for its economy.

This conflict prompted Germany to abandon the peacetime position that has always been pursued, and the Berlin authorities will transport weapons to help Kiev from fighting against Moscow.

A total of 179 employees of four branches of its four branches have recently been taken away by the Anhui police. Three of them were approved for arrest. Yongxiong Group has previously complained. People familiar with the matter disclosed that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security supervised the case, and the Anhui police arrested people across provinces and detained in different places.

Hunan Yongxiong Asset Management Group, known as the "China's Largest Collection (Debt Reception) Company", released the "Complaint for All Employees" on Thursday, saying that the Anhui police arrested 179 employees across the provincial law enforcement. The funds were frozen, and it was difficult to operate. During the heyday of the group, there were more than 10,000 employees, and they also planned to go public in the United States. The founders said that the revenue target this year exceeded 1 billion yuan. However, employees' debt collection methods are controversial.

According to a retired police officer who is unwilling to disclose his name due to personal safety, Hunan told the station on Friday that the case may be a case of the supervision of the Ministry of Public Security, otherwise the Anhui police had no right to go to Hunan to take 179 people: "This case was taken over by the Anhui police to take over this case. , Instead of the Hunan Police, it shows that Yongxiong Company and Hunan officialdom and police have inextricable connections. The authorities handling cases in different places to eliminate interference. This is a case supervised by the Ministry of Public Security. "

Mr. Li Li, deputy director of the former police station in Hunan, said in an interview with this station that the debt collection of Yongxiong Company adopted the debt chase with a triad intimidation method, which has long aroused the attention of Beijing, but the Hunan police have been indifferent for a long time. He said, as the Chinese private economy fades out of the market, the business of these debt -chasing companies has shrunk, and there is no value in existence: "It (company) debt collection is a triad nature. If it is said to be bigger and stronger, The name, there is no official background behind it, it is impossible, it has been killed for a long time. Many years ago, there was a security company in Beijing that intercepting the petitioner named An Yuanding, which is also a triad. Cooperate with the government, when the government is inconvenient to come forward, it will come forward. "

** The arrested employees of the Ministry of Public Security involved in black and different places **

According to Red Star News, on May 25, the reporter called the Public Security Department of Anhui Province to ask about the details of the case of the Yongxiong Group. The relevant department replied: "The case is under investigation." Police investigating cases can exclude interference; exclude resistance; it is conducive to finding the facts.

The First Financial website reported that in 2023, Yongxiong Group will strive to achieve the annual task goals of the year in the year. However, in recent years, Yongxiong Group has been caught in the cusp of public opinion due to the collection incident. According to media statistics, as of May 22, Yongxiong Group's complaints on the black cat complaint platform reached 153. Among them, there were many complaints such as "SMS threats", "telephone bombing", "explosive address book", and "harassing others". There are even complaints about the situation where Yongxiong pretend to be public prosecutors.

Current affairs commentators Wang Zheng believes that the debt collection companies are similar to the results of the discipline execution judgment with the bailiffs. In the future, debt collection may be directly responsible for the court, which is also a considerable income for the government. He said to this station: "They (debt collection companies) touched the court's execution court system. This 'cake', the court will take it back. In the future, the debt dispute may be sued the court to the court and the court executes debt chase. Digital companies may cooperate with the court in the future. "

Yongxiong Group is known as the "largest domestic collection company". Its official website shows that the company was established in April 2014 and is headquartered in Changsha, Hunan. Branch covers more than 20 cities across the country. Management field. In 2019, Yongxiong Group submitted a listing application to the US Securities Regulatory Commission, and then withdrew the application.

At present, there are more than 3,000 collection companies in China, of which employees of Yongxiong Group have been reduced from 17,000 before the epidemic to about 3,000 people.

(Voice of Germany Chinese), Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao and US Minister of Commerce Ginaraimondo held a meeting in Washington on Thursday (May 25). The Ministry of Commerce China issued a statement saying that the two sides conducted a "frank, professional and constructive exchange" on the economic and trade issues of Sino -US economic and trade relations and common concern. China focuses on the expressed concerns of the US's economic and trade policies, semiconductor policies, export control, and foreign investment review.

The US Department of Commerce stated that when Raymondo met with Wang Wentao, he also expressed concern about a series of actions adopted by Chinese companies in China recently.

The meeting between Wang Wentao and Raymond is the first cabinet -level meeting held by Chinese and US officials in the U.S. capital since Bynden ruling. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that "the two parties agree to establish communication channels to maintain and strengthen exchanges on specific economic and trade concerns and cooperation matters."

According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, Wang Wentao has met with a number of American companies in Shanghai earlier this week, including Johnson & Johnson, 3M, Dow (DOW), Merck, Honeywell, Honeywell, and Honeywell. And told them: "China will continue to welcome US -funded enterprises to develop in China to achieve win -win."

Earlier this month, the US Minister of Commerce Raymond also met with a delegation of the American Chamber of Commerce in the People'sRepublic of China. People familiar with the matter revealed that during the period, she heard the representative of American companies [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國加強反間諜-諮詢公司涉危害國安遭查/a-65557271)Worries.

After the "spy balloon" incident earlier this year, Sino -US relations have continued to deteriorate, and the economic and trade relations between China and the United States have also had twists and turns.

### I expected to see Daiqi

Wang Wentao went to the United States to participate in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Minister of Trade, which was held on the 25th and 26th on the 25th and 26th. Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shu Tingting confirmed on the 25th that Wang Wentao would also meet with Katherinetai, a US trading representative during the APEC meeting.

Earlier this week, Daiqi once said to the South China Morning Post that he hoped to see Wang Wentao at the APEC conference. As of now, the Office of the US Trade Representative has not confirmed the meeting between Dai Qi and Wang Wentao. The White House spokesman Johnkirby said on the 24th that the discussion about the meeting with Daiqi continued.

Reuters reported that the two major US trade unions leaders said at the APEC Minister of Trade on the 25th that trade policies in the United States and China must achieve a fair balance between workers' needs and corporate profits. Shawnfain, chairman of the American Automobile Workers' Federation, said that they were not opposed to trade, but against unilateral trade, and pointed out that the trade between the United States and China was not balanced.

When discussing the role of workers in trade policies with Daiqi and Fien, the Secretary-General of the US Labor Federation Industrial Trade Union (AFL-CIO) FrederickRdmond toughly stated: "We do not expect Ambassador Daiqi to China The invasion of the invasion is a concession. "

###?

Before the APEC Minister of Trade, the Wall Street Journal published a report and analysis. After several months of accusations, US -China relations are about to enter a new stage. The meeting between Wang Wentao and Raymond may determine whether the two major powers can restore the previous high -level exchanges of the "spy balloon" incident.

An anonymous U.S. official revealed to the newspaper that Beijing's recent tentative restoration of diplomatic relations with Washington was partly because Chinese leaders believed that they are currently in a more favorable position. Xi Jinping has successively received a number of European leaders, trying to split the Western alliance, and establishes a solid trade relationship with Brazilian President. The US official said, "They think we don't look good."

With Washington will still strive to rebuild basic communication channels. "

Description: After the Hong Kong media people living in Taiwan, Zeng Zhihao observed that after China -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong -Hong Kong's organized organ transplantation and mutual aid mechanism, Hong Kong people canceled organized donations and deeper behind the "Cathay Poor Sister Incident". However, senior Hong Kong officials fail to observe public opinion, but always cater to Beijing's statement, it will only worsen this phenomenon.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) Hong Kong people have never thought that one day, the organs of their bodies have no autonomy, and the laughter between themselves and colleagues will shock the greeting of the special and "People's Daily". The most incredible thing is that organs and blankets may involve "national security", that is, one day, law enforcement officers of the National Security Office came to the door, because you may be "[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/国泰事件中国网络反崇洋媚外浪潮高涨/a-65732354)And unwilling to donate organs to the mainland compatriots? "

Like [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/罗杰叔叔youtube上发视频回应被中国封杀/a-65710227) ， [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察两条感觉受到侮辱的野狗/a-65730016)No wonder they can monitor the dialogue of Cathay Pacific flight attendant in the lounge.

Two news that seemingly unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory, in fact, have the same essence, behind the contradictions between China and Hong Kong.

Organ donations are intertwined in China and Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong government hopes to interoperate the organs of Hong Kong and the country. This seems to be a medical problem, but it will soon become a political issue.

Because Hong Kong people are super reluctant to the medical system in the Mainland, especially in organs transplantation, in the past, I heard that too many "death rowing organs" and "organ buying and selling" were heard. Who will fall in? Or flow into the buying and selling market? Or is the organ that moves into your body, is the source innocent or "agreed"?

All this is a reasonable doubt.

However, the Hong Kong government felt that behind the conspiracy of the opposition to make a matter of reason.

The earliest proposal to the Chinese and Hong Kong organ interoperability was Lu Yao Mao, a Xinhong Bureau. After a 2022 incident, he immediately proposed to study the mechanism of organ communication in Hong Kong.

At that time, the reporter asked "the Hong Kong medical community has a reservation of this proposal." He immediately asked, "The medical community is the first? The sound of the sound can come even more, go to support, and help more Hong Kong citizens. "The idea is that he does not want people to criticize the direction of China and Hong Kong.

This is a bit like the revision of the "Fugitive Regulations" that day. Many people in the legal community raised rational questions. As a result, the government's political suppression was in exchange for the opposition voices as "discrediting the Mainland Justice" and "singing and declining the environment of the Mainland." It's just that the "law" is replaced by "medical".

When the government criticizes the sound as "enemy", of course, Hong Kong people can only "protect themselves", so some people have proposed that since I am unable to resist mutual communication, at least I do n’t participate in the interoperability plan? So some people proposed to cancel the registration of organ donation. If they do not include their organs into the system, they will not be sent to the mainland. As a result, because a large number of people canceled organ donation, and even there were examples of unregistered applications, the Chief Executive was regarded as "unusual". Contempt the blood of compatriots in the two places in water and various selfless donations in the past, and the fact that the selfless donation organs in the Mainland save the case of life cases in Hong Kong. "

The big hat with "blood is thicker than water" and "big love spirit" was pressed down, which deepened the "China -Hong Kong contradiction" of the whole thing. Can you not donate organs if blood is thicker than water? The spirit of love can't be "organ" autonomous. I did not expect that Hong Kong people could no longer decide who was the Chief Executive.

Retreating 10,000 steps, even if Hong Kong people are really unwilling to donate organs to the Mainland, this is at most an educational issue. Why does it become a direction for police to file a case investigation? I have no happiness. Organic donations are "voluntary", not emotional extortion, and they will deduct a hat that "blood is thicker than water" or national security hats.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T02-48-00Z/61637115_401.jpg)According to the latest survey of the Institute of Public Opinion of Hong Kong, the Chief Executive Li Jiachao's civilian score was 56.9 points, but there were 0 points for him to give him 0 points.

### These Hong Kong people are "guilty"

The words are square, another [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/國泰航空遭指歧視中國客-官媒重拳整頓/a-65715856)Suddenly outbreak.

The "discrimination passenger" incident occurred by Cathay Pacific Airlines from Chengdu to Hong Kong. A passenger reported in Xiaohongshu, "Cathay Pacific Aircraft Cantonese used English and Cantonese to complain to passengers in English and Cantonese:" Youcannot Speak Blanket, You Cannot IT (you can't get a blanket if you can't talk about the blanket) "" , "Carpet is on thefloor (carpet is on the ground)." The reporters who reported that it might be "the front row passengers tried to use their English words to get the blankets from these" only English "flight attendants, but they were teased by the retorters." Playing, public opinion frying pot, determined that Cathay Pacific sister discriminated against the mainland people who did not understand English and asked to stop.

Cathay Pacific apologized quickly or even the three flight attendants involved in the case. Senior officials including the SAR, including the Chief Executive Li Jiachao, also quickly blamed the stewardess's improper behavior, "quite distressed" Yunyun. The "Knight Island" of "People's Daily" is also criticized, and it has been promoted to the political level. "Worshiping English and looking down on the current of Mandarin is bound to annihilated to the tide of history." It even suddenly emphasized that the incident background was "the situation in Hong Kong has changed from chaos to 2023 years."

The Hong Kong people suddenly understood that another political storm that suppressed Hong Kong people's survival status came. The Mainland has achieved overwhelming victory in politics, but still feels that Hong Kong people have not fully agreed to China in culture or ideology, which is the so -called "psychological return."

Officials believe that Hong Kong people admire English, do not speak or look down on Mandarin, are all manifestations of "psychological resistance to return to refuse to be Chinese". Therefore, as soon as the Cathay Pacific incident broke out, the people with the heart were allowed to play with the topic, and the Hong Kong government cooperated comprehensively. Without verification, Cathay Pacific ’s performance was accused of the performance of Cathay Pacific. This is actually in line with the role of the chief executive. It is to cooperate with Beijing to suppress the living position of Hong Kong people. As long as there is any contradiction between China and Hong Kong, the wrong party must be Hong Kong people. In the past Some people in Hong Kong have complained that officials will be accused of "discriminating against mainland compatriots."Why Hong Kong people are so angry about Cathay Pacific incident, because everyone sees that some people play their questions and do not target three stewardess, but Hong Kong citizens who have not yet surrendered in Hong Kong. Speaking English is sin, do not understand that Mandarin is a crime, politeness to foreigners is sin, not enthusiastic about mainland compatriots is sin, not wanting to donate organs to mainland compatriots, I do n’t think of the development of the Greater Bay Area. Sin ... as [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/对年轻人失去吸引力-香港警队再度降低入职要求/a-65723586)The organs to a blanket are guilty.

The first batch of thorn -needle -needle air defense missiles had arrived in Taiwan and accepted by the military.

[** U.S. Military Military Military Agreement of Taiwan 500 million US dollars of weapons Qiu Guozheng confirmed to negotiate **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st-05082023024059.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hx1-03022023100322.html)**

The U.S. government announced in 2019 that the FIM-92 Shoulder-shoulder sparning needle-aircraft aircraft-proof missiles were delayed so far. According to Taiwan media reports, some Boeing cargo machine arrived at Taoyuan Airport late at night on May 24th to carry a group of US-supporting Taiwan FIM-92 Shoulder-to-Type-type needle air defense missiles accepted by the Taiwan military. Taiwan ’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed low -key on the 25th.

These missiles are not projects purchased by Taiwan, but U.S. Defense Minister Lloyd Austin recently pointed out that the U.S. government uses the "Presidential Approval Right" plan to provide Taiwan with a $ 500 million military assistance.

** The United States uses the "Presidential Dial -up right" military aid in Taiwan **

Austin said on the 16th that "provides major additional security assistance to Taiwan." Li Shiqiang, the director of the Ministry of National Defense Regulations, said on the 25th that the assistance items were previously determined and they were all in stock, and it will begin recently.

The director of the Taiwan Institute of Defense and Safety, Shen Mingshu, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia on the 26th that "in order to respond to the threat of the Communist Party of China, some weapons ordered some weapons ordered by the United States have not yet been sent. Weighing Ukrainian demand and the most urgent project at the current national defense defense. "

Shen Mingshi said that the United States first looked for the inventory. In the early days of the United States, the US military aided Ukraine's benchmark missiles and thorn needle missiles played a lot of functions. Now Ukraine has obtained the Patriot missile system. Or it is not so urgent.

Researcher Jie Zhong, a researcher at the China Strategic Foresight Association in Taiwan, also pointed out that the Taiwan military has been fighting for the purchase of thorns for more than 20 years. The United States originally refused to sell. Assist Ukraine and NATO allies.

In response to the first batch of military aids in Taiwan at this time, Jiezhong's judgment is not an intelligence show that the war is about to start.

** US military assistance helps ** ** slow ** ** solve the "suspicion theory" in Taiwan

Jiezhong said: "The U.S. Indo -Pacific strategy hopes that countries around China and the United States to maintain close cooperation. If Taiwanese people cannot solve doubts about the United States due to the delay of military sales, they will worry about ensuring that Taiwan and the United States cooperate on major issues. I must hope that the U.S. administrative department will take some actions first, which must also be helpful for the DPP government's election and prestige. "

Jiezhong pointed out that the thorn -needle missile is a single -soldier shot, and the single soldier can operate. It is close and low at a close range. At the front line, if an enemy armed helicopter and fighter attack were encountered, it was impossible to get a dense and effective air defense cover. "

Jiezhong said: "US president should have a little advance in the order of weapons allocation in Taiwan, so you can first allocate some inventory in the status quo. To observe whether this is currently on this case, or in the future, or later China Is the status of the Republic of China ahead? "

Shen Ming's room mentioned that during the Cold War, the United States also took military assistance against Taiwan to provide weapons systems and ammunition to Taiwan. Taiwan did not need to pay. After the interruption of the United States, the Taiwan Relations Law. The military -sold weapons and ammunition in Taiwan for many years. The United States has not resumed diplomatic relations and has not signed any defense agreement. Last year, the United States passed a decision with the "National Defense Authorization Law" and passed the national defense budget. In the next five years, it will be US $ 2. billion a year, and a total of $ 10 billion in Taiwan for military aid for five years. Among them assistance. Therefore, there are the first batch of US $ 500 million military assistance this year, and it may assist the benchmark missiles and brackets in the future.

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) Taiwan talk show actor East District, from 2018 to 2019, signed a contract with China's "Twist Comedy" and performed in Beijing. he is [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被指冒犯解放军-脱口秀演员被警方立案调查/a-65638312)After the outbreak, logging in to WeChat, but found that the many talk shows he joined were taboo.

"There are so many talk show groups. No half of them discuss it." The 40 -year -old Eastern Demon told DW that his personal approach to the Chinese government was not surprising. What surprised him was that House performed in Beijing.

"This is the hidden rules of this circle. These (sensitive) things cannot be spoken." East District Germany said that when he was in China, he must be approved by the authorities and approved it. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察两条感觉受到侮辱的野狗/a-65730016)It is impossible to pass at all, and actors and audiences who engage in the talk show at the "Beijing's foot" are the worst self -examination.

He said, "Look [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国脱口秀在美国那些在国内不能讲的段子/a-64722978)Then he talked in Beijing. North America is so far away!At the foot of Tianzi, it must be the most sensitive place. "" So I don't know why House dared to take off in Beijing, it is really very kind. "

Another talk show actor A with performance experience on both sides of the strait expresses different views on this. He said that after the outbreak of the incident, in fact, many people in China in China have issued a message in space such as WeChat friends circle. Among them, after the post with a large number of coffee positions, the entire little red book and Weibo number will be "disappeared." The relatively small one is relatively unscrupulous, "because I feel that the remarks are not in charge of him."

A further supplemented. For the sensitive issues that House touched this time, or the "special theme" such as the fishy color, there is a talk show actor in China. But he has a negative emotion. He doesn't like a arbiter hanging on his head. Everyone will think that we usually scold each other. I say you have no level. The judge (referring to the Chinese authorities) is another matter. "

Although the punishment of the Chinese talk show in the world did not agree with the incident, Chinese actors seemed not to be surprised by the "laughing fruit accident". A admits that in recent years, the talk show industry has been running too fast in China, and Xiaoguo Culture is one of the unique and most powerful companies. "[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/墙外文摘脱口秀风波中的国家暴力/a-65689399)"".

As an example, he has been attacked by the Chinese authorities as an example. If there is an industry developing rapidly in China, "the leading company in that industry must basically kneel on the ground to rest and bleed bleeding, bleed bleeding, bleed bleeding first "For 3 years", the talk show has been in China for several years, and has entered the dilemma of incurableness, and there are also stars and companies with high income. "Everyone knows that one day the competent authority will want to check this matter Today, if it is not because of House, it may be because of the next person. "House is just" just stepped on the high -voltage line ", which has become an example of the authorities to kill chickens and monkeys.

### Talking Show with Chinese Characteristics- —— "Hold your mouth" art

As for the so -called "high -voltage line", A told DW according to a "official regulations on his hand" that the Chinese authorities listed the sensitive subjects that the Chinese authorities could not touch the actors. Or religious hatred, discrimination "," not endangering social stability, public order and good customs ", etc., are mostly" classic contents "that have also been controlled by the government in the fields of the Internet and artificial intelligence in recent years. National unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, harm the national honor interests ".

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T05-40-00Z/64873348_401.jpg)The talk show is a fire in China this year. The picture shows a talk show performance held in the Chongqing Municipal Government in 2022

A 28 -year -old foreign actor B, who had taught an English talk show in Shanghai, told DW that about 7 or 8 years ago, when he started a talk show in China, he knew that he could not talk about the government and "3 T -Taiwan Taiwan, Tibet (TIBET), Tiananmen Square (Tiananamensquare) "and other sensitive themes, but now these red lines have" become too much, and their (Chinese authorities) are constantly growing as the list of themes of improper content ... as long as you touch you touch When these subjects, they can block you with this pretext. "

B explains that if you talk about open wheat (OpenMic, no matter ammunition or professional comedy actor can come to the stage to practice, it can be practiced without tickets), or the audience is not required Approved by the Cultural and Trade Bureau beforehand; but if a large -scale session of a business performance or more than 100 viewers, you need to submit the word -by -time draft of the paragraph about one month before the performance, as well as a reading video without emotion.

"If they (Cultural Tourism Bureau), if the human beings are enough, they will send someone to sit in the audience and confirm that you have no manuscript to the manuscript. If you leave the draft or say any offense (the government), It is a fine of at least 20,000 jumps. "East District said that sometimes these official personnel will also bring a video camera behind the auditorium and record the whole process.

Based on the information provided by several respondents, the time required for approval of various cities in China is different, and some even half a year. Therefore, many talk show actors performed nearly one year ago, as far as 3 years ago. Start repeatedly using the paragraph. In addition, the respondents said that the talk show industry has developed rapidly in China and has too many clubs in recent years. In fact, the competent authority is in power. After stepped down, it will also be reminded by the club's manager or peer.

East District Germany said that regardless of performance, whether ticket sales, and whether they need to be approved in advance, the actors will avoid talking about sensitive remarks: "As long as there is a audience is a small pink, he has opinions and actively report to the authorities. Except for your actor," The clubs, organizers, and venues will suffer. Therefore, there is a potential consensus of "do not do this kind of harmful things" and "strictly discipline yourself, self -rhythmia".
###  The talk show in the Ukrainian air defense cave

### Actor with red line dancing

East District Germany said that in the case of "the relevant authorities' policies, politics, and sensitive current affairs, it is definitely not impossible to touch", in fact, the subject matter of doing talk shows in China is very limited. "The subject of resonance", try to make rice without rice. East District said that Chinese comedians "still played flowers" in a limited range that made him admire: "They (Chinese actors) may be used to it, but we (Taiwanese actors) have become more free, so we are more free, so we are more free, so It's painful for me. "

Another actor C, who also talked about the English talk show in Shanghai, also said that China's remarks review had a huge impact on his performance, "because my own jokes are talking about politics, and it is hundreds of times serious." He said that even in Shanghai, the English talk show with relatively loose scale and non -ticket sales, the subject matter is also limited. His joke basically "except for politics is sex", so he performed his hands and feet in China: "I may have to review a lot of content, but I have a lot of Punchline (key laughter) are political content. I Remove it all, and its funny level is about 60%. "

C revealed that he had put a discussion of political performance on the Internet. He wanted to "walk on the edge, and he should not step on that line." Threat; House's accident made him who was no longer performed in China, and began to re -examine his paragraphs. Some of them "won't talk about it anymore."

B, who also did an English talk show in Shanghai, I deeply felt that he was a foreign actor, and had more constraints on the stage. B recalled that he felt the first time that the Cultural Tourism Bureau began to suppress the talk show. It was after the 2020 China's well -known talk show actor Kamin was sentenced. At that time, even though B's paragraphs revolved around his love for China and did not criticize the Chinese government, it was still suspended by many clubs. On the stage, holding a microphone to speak to a group of Chinese people, they will feel that I want to preach the thinking of the anti -Chinese Communist Party. "

The timing was advanced to 2021 and 2022. The restrictions on foreign actors were loosened. B can gradually return to the large stage. Essence He said that because the talk show originated from the form of the West, it was not treated by the Chinese authorities, and no one knew when the industry would be completely banned. The endless and tightened censorship of China has also made him very worried about the situation of the same industry that is still performing in the local area: "If you are a comedian, stand on the stage and want to talk about a talk show, spend a happy time, but there is one The fool sent by the Communist Party of China is on the stage, waiting to pick you up at any time, pull you down, how uncomfortable the next few months will it be, and you will never know that the next game will be triggered. What will it be (subject matter). "

"Every talk show actor knows not to mention Tian'anmen, don't mention Taiwan, but the subject matter that cannot be said can't be finished. What else can you write? What else can you make? As a comedian? Your first priority should be considered "Will this subject be funny?" Instead of "Will this subject send me into jail or destroy my career?" B said that China lacks "freedom of speech". It is no longer news. Now even "expressing freedom" is lost, the development prospect of China's talk show has made him very pessimistic.

C, which is known for his political stalks, also said that the talk show can still be rising in China as a "offensive art". It is because Chinese audiences "have this demand". It is about to be suppressed and make him feel that "the only thing that restricts China is China himself." C said that there are many Chinese people and there are many art workers. There are so many creativity, but "now it is not just that the official wants to review you, you are afraid of being reported, so you have to review yourself, but you have to review each other, just like the Cultural Revolution." There is no room for creativity and talk show. A few days after the accident occurred, China also temporarily canceled the performance of overseas artists. In C's opinion, this matter is a vane of the "cultural and entertainment industry". I am afraid that in the future, it will also lead to a broad cicada effect in the Chinese art and cultural circle.

### What does the talk show "open your legs" look like?

Four interviewees with experience in both sides of the strait said that the differences between cross -strait talk circles can be attributed to two major points -economic scale and subject matter.

East District Germany and two other actors who have received commercial performances in China said that China's market throughput and capital scale are large enough to support the entire peripheral drama industry such as the entire talk show and even improvisation drama in the past few years. In the past 10 years, the talk show club of major cities in China has sprung up like a long -after growth. Even if a large number of creators have rushed and invested in the talk show actor, the needs of the entire industry are still far greater than the supply. , "One month can also receive more than a dozen business performances." For many actors who do not want to become superstars or rich people, they can have a professor of full -time health and relatively high sense of society. enough.

In contrast, Taiwan's talk show industry is still developing. Except for 1 or two popular star actors, few actors who can use this as full -time. In the society, if the actor shows the identity of "part -time talk show practitioners", he may be appreciated by "this person is cool" because of "a special interest", but if the actor resign and devote himself to investing, he devotes himself to investing. Talk show creation often receives the concerns of "Does your life continue?".

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T05-40-00Z/64873304_401.jpg)Cross -strait talk show development scale and cultural environment are different (data photo)

In terms of subject matter, except for cultural differences that make some laughter unable to share them on both sides of the strait, all interviewees have stated that a major difference between talking about talk shows in China and Taiwan is "consideration behind the selection of materials."

Dong District Germany said, "Taiwan is really super free, you love to talk about everything." There will not be a sensitive red line to consider, but this does not mean that he can talk about a talk show in Taiwan. He said that comedians still have some extent pursuit of "audience fate" and "audience recognition". Therefore, when choosing materials, he will avoid "epidemic prevention policies" and "celebrity suicide". Or when screening the performance clip of accessing the Internet, discard some controversial and explosive topics, and leave the laughing point at the scene.

East District said that Taiwanese actors have such considerations, and may be regarded as a self -examination, but "Taiwan's self -examination mechanism is not in what topic cannot be said, but what will be overly political and unacceptable to the audience." American society is now prevalent for "canceling culture" (netizens do not meet the political correctness of their recognition because the public figures do not meet the correct politics that they recognize, but the Internet exiles that they resist it in the community). Essence But he also added that the consequences of actors have no self -censorship in China, which is definitely more serious than in Taiwan.In addition, two actors who have performed the English talk show in Shanghai have stated that their self -examination motivation in Taiwan has nothing to do with the audience. The only consideration is that "Can this joke make the audience laugh?" Essence They told DW separately that they often composed of audiences in Taiwan to adjust their paragraphs in mobility -if they are mainly "foreign audiences who speak English", they will use "dirty", more challenging language language , Even incorporate some laughter that ridiculed Taiwan; if the table is mostly about Taiwan and Asia's faces, they tend to take the "family love" route, and they will also expect that "if the audience may be offended in Taiwan." Overall, when performing in Taiwan, they are more like their paragraphs entering the free market as a commodity. All of them are considered "market value" and "paragraph effects" without thinking about sensitive red line factors.

C told DW that "laugh" is an instinct that breaks through all norms and established values. The talk show borrows "constantly offense" and leads to "laugh" comedy. It is the difference between it and other arts and entertainment forms. Rock or Punkle, it is a very rebellious thing, you can't shape a rock music under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. "

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-26T07-02-07-00-00/000000.png)(Agence France -Presse, Washington, 25th) A survey released by the US Navy today found that the training of seal commanders was extremely difficult and worrying.

The survey was initiated after the dying during the training during the training during the training during the training, and found that "multiple systems failed, which led many students to face serious injuries."

The report pointed out that the leadership supervision, lack of risk assessment, and medical system "did not go through training, organization, integration or drill to ensure continuous and effective medical monitoring or care", as well as drugs such as improving training performance.

The survey found that Mu Lun died after completing the "Hell Week" and eventually diagnosed with pneumonia. During the Hell Week, students were fucked to their physical limits when they were deprived of their sleep, and other members of Mu Lun were admitted to the hospital.

Mu Lun and other members of the same class received medical treatment due to respiratory problems during the "Hell Week", but the relevant situation was not provided to the medical examination clinic.

In the military camp, Mu Lun was taken care of by "the rookie duty staff who did not receive medical or first -aid training". When Mulun's situation worsened, only one duty staff had called to be a classmate.

The medical officer said that if Mu Lun was "poor in physical condition", he could go to the hospital immediately, but because all trainers had to accept the evaluation that morning, Mu Lun himself repeatedly refused to seek medical treatment.

Medical staff said that if the trainees are "poor in physical condition", he can go to the hospital, but all candidates will be evaluated in the morning, but Malun repeatedly refuses to do so.

The survey also deeply explored the long -term problems using steroids and similar drugs for the trainees of SEALs.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Taiwan Executive Yuan announced on Thursday (May 25) that the relevant letter of the so -called "people of mainland China is also the people of the Republic of China" should be stopped from now on. This means that Taiwan officially identified that the people of the Chinese mainland do not have the nationality of the Republic of China, not a national, and therefore do not enjoy or bear the rights and obligations of the Republic of China.

According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, the Executive Yuan wrote that the "Regulations of the People's Relations of Taiwan and the Mainland" (referred to as the "Cross -Strait Regulations") only defined the people of Taiwan and the people of China, but some agencies have used it to have used it to have used it. The letter of interpretation allows "the people of the Chinese mainland to belong to the nationals (or people) of the Republic of China", or the rights and obligations of the people of the Chinese mainland are equivalent to the nationals of the Republic of China.

According to the Taiwan Executive Yuan, Taiwan has experienced democratic transformation and changes in the constitution, and the political situation and the development of cross -strait relations have changed. Whether the relevant interpretation letter makes it appropriate and it is necessary to review it. According to the definition of the Nationality Law, the people of the Chinese mainland do not have the nationality of the Republic of China, not the nationals of the Republic of China, and naturally do not enjoy or bear the rights and obligations of the Republic of China. No longer help.

### 1992 Consensus 30 years 30 Taiwanese watch "unified" like this

###

In 2018, a Chinese man named Qian Qian went to Taiwan to go around the island, and he was shown in Kaohsiung. Family members of the Taiwan Court offered a lawsuit in the sea, and the Taiwan court finally sentenced to victory over the lawsuit. The Kaohsiung Municipal Government needed to compensate NT $ 4.63 million.

The decision of the Taiwan court at that time quoted a letter of interpretation of the Taiwan Ministry of Legal Affairs in 1993. The content of the letter mentioned that "the people of mainland China are also the people of the Republic of China."

At that time, Ning Xin, a judge of the Kaohsiung Court of Taiwan, said in an interview with the Central News Agency that he asked the competent authority and the MAC who had asked the State Council before the verdict. The people of the region do not have clearly stipulated that "but based on human rights protection and humanitarian concepts, the State Compensation Law should be applied."

However, the Taiwan MAC subsequently stated that "there is a misunderstanding", emphasizing that "the people of the Chinese mainland are the nationals of the Republic of China", and accused those who have the nationals of the Republic of China according to the "Constitution of the Republic of China". 》 And other stipulates that the nationals of the Republic of China refer to the "household registered citizen or no household registration citizen in Taiwan where the Republic of China nationality lives in Taiwan."

The national compensation incident subsequently caused controversy in public opinion in Taiwan. Taiwan's "Free Times" reported that Song Chengen, deputy chief executive of the Taiwan Constitutional Foundation, said in February that the national compensation should be applied to the "home" to ensure that the human rights of foreigners should find another mechanism. Song Chengen questioned that the Taiwanese government promised "Taiwan, Taiwan, Taiwan", but the court's decision said that "Taiwan is also Chinese in Taiwan." He said, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美众议院兵棋推演台海冲突-结论必须全面武装台湾/a-65398180): "How do we say to the international ... isn't AIA who comes to assist in the defense to interfere with the Chinese civil war?"

Song Chengen believes that the root cause of the controversy lies in the Constitution of the Republic of China. Some public opinion in Taiwan believes that the judgment is unconstitutional and should be amended to the law; but some people believe that there is no conclusion on the opposite opinion.

### Taiwan Executive Dean: Avoid international misunderstandings

Chen Jianren, the president of Taiwan, was asked when he attended the event on the 26th. He said that the Executive Yuan issued a new order because the interpretation of the relevant authorities in the past was "unsuccessful" and did not conform to the current laws. In addition to trouble, avoid misunderstandings between Chinese and international. " As for whether the Cross -Strait Regulations will be further amended? He said that the MAC will examine the relevant content before making a decision.

According to the Lianhe Daily, Zheng Yunpeng, the legislator of the Taiwan DPP, said that the case of Chinese money men's country compensation is indeed the liability of the Kaohsiung Municipal Government. The judge believes that the people of the People's Republic of China belong to the people of the Republic of China. He pointed out, "In the future, there are similar citations and judgments in the future, that is, the personal ideological issue of the judge, that is, the wrong judgment must be accepted by the Chinese people."

Before the deadline, Chinese officials did not respond publicly on the Taiwan Executive Yuan's order.

Description: China is the country in the world's most death penalty. Although Taiwan promises to "gradually abolish", experts believe that the Taiwan government has not promoted substantial progress. The CEO of the French "Common Anti -Death State Organization" (ECPM) went to Taiwan to participate in the Asian regional seminars.

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Asian Ritual Death Strategy Symposium" appeared in Taiwan on Friday (May 26). This two -day meeting was sponsored by the French "Cooperative Anti -Death State Organization" (ECPM).

ECPM CEO Raphaël Chenuil-Hazan told DW that Taiwan has freedom of speech and the spirit of the rule of law. Moreover Use the death penalty, but go to the direction of good use of abolition, showing that you are not like the Chinese government, unlike Xi Jinping, but more tendency to democracy. "

He also said, "If Taiwan maintains the death penalty, who knows what will happen in the future and who knows if there is a government or dictator in the future? You should abolish the death penalty so that it will not be too late. "

Lin Xinyi, CEO of the Taiwan Waste Alliance, also said that in the face of intimidation of the Chinese totalitarian government, "Taiwanese are not afraid" and still adhere to democracy, freedom and human rights value. This is also different from the two sides of the strait.

ECPM held a three -year conference in Berlin, Germany last year. This year, it was decided to abolish Taiwan's death penalty to promote the league and Asian anti -death network (ADPAN) and other organizations to jointly hold regional meetings in Taipei. Lin Xinyi told DW that this was because Taiwan's human rights performance was seen by the outside world, and many people had a good opinion of Taiwan.

In the global death penalty report in the 2022 of the International Terminal, China described China as "the number one puppet hand in the world." [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球死刑数量创五年新高在中国仍是国家机密/a-65638885)Including China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries; although the Chinese government has not disclosed the number of executives, it is generally believed that at least a thousand people are believed.

In a speech at the seminar, Chennhazan pointed out that although China has been sentenced for thousands of years, the death penalty is by no means a "tradition" in China, and there have been a stage of abolishing the death penalty in history. However, under the administration of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong used the death penalty to consolidate political power and target people of objections; during the Xi Jinping period, the death penalty debate became "one of the most important ideological taboos in China", which was considered "preaching Western thought".

In contrast, Taiwan's death penalty environment is relatively mature. The last death penalty in Taiwan was in 2020, and there are currently 38 death prisoners. Although Wang Rongzhang, deputy chairman of the Taiwan National Human Rights Committee, said on the 26th that before the law was abolished, the "strongly required government to suspend the execution of the death penalty", but [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣卡關逐步廢死-專家死刑淪政客廉價操作/a-64859404)Essence

Guillermo Martinez, deputy director of the European Economic and Trade Office, and Jean-François Casonnave, director of the French Association in Taiwan, also attended the abolition strategy seminar on the 26th. The European Union and France support Taiwan to gradually move forward. Gongsun Meng bluntly stated that from his observation in the past four years, Taiwan's abolition has not made great progress, and what Taiwan most needs is more public discussions on the death penalty.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T09-43-00Z/65741480_401.jpg)The Asia's Research Seminar of the Disposal Penalty Strategy was held on the 26th in Taipei City. The opening ceremony invited Taiwan's injustice Su Jianhe (the first right of the back row).

###

At this stage, many Taiwanese are opposed to abolition, and the Taiwanese government is often [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界反死刑日民意是维持死刑的藉口/a-45807287)Essence The death penalty has also become a tool for some politicians to incite voters. In response, ECPM's Chekhazan responded that political leaders should respond to the actual situation, instead of using the death penalty to achieve political purposes. He said that there are many arguments that can support abolition, but the only arguments behind the death sentence are "revenge." He believes that after all, the death penalty cannot bring real healing for the victim's family members, nor can it be observed.

As the presidential election in Taiwan was approaching in 2024, some of them intended to run for the presidential claim that if they were elected, they would "shoot all the death penalty"; even some groups proposed a referendum that claimed that the death penalty should be performed within 6 months after the verdict.

"To be honest, human rights are not the value that everyone complies. Many human rights issues are actually the value that everyone opposes and hates." Lin Xinyi told DW that Taiwanese society should discuss "whether human rights can referery" and clearly think about what it looks like The topic can be referendum, otherwise, once a precedent is issued, "it has a great impact on the democracy and human rights in Taiwan."

Lin Xinyi described the proposal of abolition to say that it can be said to be "the most stressful and the most brave group of people." Sarakowal, a member of the Asia -Pacific anti -death network, also mentioned that the harassment and persecution encountered by Asian human rights workers are becoming more and more serious and cannot be ignored.

Lin Xinyi quoted [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不只行人地獄台灣捷運重大死傷案惹議/a-65585044)The words: "We feel that the only thing that can jump out of political awareness is to adhere to the concept of human rights and obtain the understanding of all the questioners as much as possible." She emphasized that she will not give up the opportunity to dialogue. There is no death penalty.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T09-43-00Z/65741425_401.jpg)Lin Xinyi, CEO of the Taiwan Waste Alliance, said in a speech that the proposal of the abolition of death can be said to be "the most stressful and brave group of people."

### The possibility of injustice

The opening ceremony also invited Su Jianhe, who was rehabilitated in Taiwan's death penalty case, to share his story to the abolition of the proposal and human rights groups from 14 countries.

"I was detained for 11 and a half years, and then wearing 2 kg of feet 镣 11 and a half years ... It was also suffering from being tortured, but there was no way to receive treatment. Not to mention when I was determined by the death sentence, it brought it with it, it brought it with The pressure comes is very cruel and inhumane. However, these things are caused by ... my case is caused by misjudgment. "The existence of the injustice shows that the judicial may be wrong, which is one of the basic claims of Taiwan's abolition of the proposal. But in addition, can Taiwan be a model of democratic democracy in Asia, can it be more positive on human rights issues and show democratic value?

Recently, news about the "709" human rights lawyer who has been silent for a while has recalled the attention of the world as they are constantly being driven by the bandit Beijing Public Security.

Human rights lawyers Li Heping, Wang Qiaoling, and Li Wenzu and Wang Quanzhang, who have always lived in Beijing, are still harassed by the CCP's Light. After several times a month, they still have nowhere to save themselves. Drive overnight.

As a last resort, the family of Li Heping and Wang Qiaoling moved from Chaoyang District to Tongzhou, and harassing their CCP's Light Light followed.

Li Wenzu lived with a few years old, Quanquan, who lived in the house of a friend Ye Jinghuan. The Chinese Communist Party's public security still has to kill. On the grounds that "someone reports that someone in the resident is gathered to take drugs", he knocked on the door many times in the middle of the night and asked to enter the room for inspection, and even threatened the door without opening the door. The homeowner Non -Jinghuan has been threatened by the "interview" of the local Xicheng Public Security branch more than once, and asked her to drive Li Wenzu's mother and son out of the house.

Dang Ye Jinghuan questioned the public security in person, "Do I let her live in my house illegal?" The public security said, "No illegal. But the police have a way to make her unable to live." It turned out that the "way" of the so -called "way to make her unable to live" was to use "check drugs" in the middle of the night to continuously harass them.

However, the communist slaves!Do you know that you are helping to do dogs for the CCP? Intersection

According to my experience, the CCP's damage is not just these. When the night fell tonight, Li Wenzu's child Quanquan saw that it was dark. After a while, he looked out the window and asked Li Wenzu in horror, "Mom, will the police come tonight?" Heartache!If you are you, what will you answer your child? Intersection Intersection

On May 14, 2023, Lawyer Li Heping was at home. The landlord broke into the small courtyard with more than a dozen individuals, forcing him to move, and issued a threat of "not to kill you". There are still five years in the rent contract, and the rental fee has been paid in autumn. Lawyer Li Heping certainly rejected such unreasonable demands. The landlord smashed the glass window of the bedroom on the spot, and the glass broke the ground. In desperation, lawyer Li Heping had to call the police. However, the police said, "The ownership of the house belongs to the landlord, but you rent, you pay, you should enjoy the service you should. However, the landlord has the right to dispose of the house ..." Illegal acts, saying, "If you can't talk, you can go to the court to prosecute."

Isn't the landlord rented a house to collect money? How can there be the reason why the tenant is driven away? Intersection In fact, anyone behind this knows: How can such a thing happen without the persecution behind the evil party? Intersection

Therefore, the key to the problem is the evil communist system. The Communist Party is the general root of all evil. Don't expect to solve institutional social injustice under the rules formulated by a group of privileges and laws on the constitution and law.

If you don’t understand yet, please see what the CCP ’s Light Claims said to me with a recording pen:" Don't say harassing you!Now you need to stir up with you. ""

Anyone, once the enemy of the Communist Party of the People's Public Enemy, the Communist Party will kill you all. You can do your best to disturb you. You can't live. The Communist Party believes that this is the need to intimidate the people and defend the autocracy of the Communist Party.

In short, if the communist tyranny will not be destroyed, all kinds of persecution will intensify and continue to occur on you and your descendants.

Among them, NATO retired pilots are the key targets of China recruited. Last year, there were media reports that China had recruited the British Air Force's active and retired pilots to let them teach the Chinese Air Force pilots about the knowledge of Western fighters and the "weakness" of Western military aircraft. The British Department of Defense said that about 30 former British pilots had provided relevant services to China.

Not long ago, the German Federal House Management Committee held a meeting to require strict legislation to regulate the private economy field after retiring the retirement of civil servants in sensitive areas. The German Ministry of Defense told the World News that the relevant parties are currently discussing whether it is necessary to correctly amend the current regulations. According to the current "Military Law" in Germany, the Air Force pilots from the safe and sensitive field are required to declare if they engage in new jobs within five years after retirement. There is no need to declare after the retirement period expires.

"In order to achieve the goal of occupying the world's hegemon in the political, economic, military and academic fields, Beijing has invested a lot of manpower and financial resources for its spy activity."

Haldewang said that in addition to cyber attacks, the Constitutional Defense Administration also found that China "has strengthened spy activities against all fields of German politics." He said that Russia is also working hard to impact German society, but Beijing's behavior is also acting, but Beijing's behavior But "more hidden and long -term strategic goals."

The British pilot exposed before providing a training incident for China, a flight school in South Africa attracted widespread attention: [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/路透社涉培训解放军前美军飞官-曾与飞行学校签约/a-63729234)The situation held by the World News shows that a German federal pilot has also traveled to the South African Testing Flight Academy as a faculty after retiring.

### Founder Li Zhiying

"Apple Daily" was founded by the wealthy businessman Li Zhiying in 1995. Li Zhiying, who smuggled from Guangdong to Hong Kong when he was a teenager, publicly supported the 89 Democratic Games and was therefore officially sanctioned by the mainland. After he founded One Media Co., Ltd. in 1990, he published newspapers such as "One Weekly" and other newspapers and magazines, and then expanded to TV, the Internet and other media, and founded Taiwan's "Apple Daily" in 2003. Li Zhiying bit the apple in the TV advertisement and said, "One apple daily, no one cheated me!"

[](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-05262023110227.html/@@images/image)Screenshot from the Taiwan Legislative Yuan Playing System [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-05262023110227.html/@@stream)The relevant provisions of the administrative courts in Taiwan have recently ordered the government departments to be outdated by the relevant provisions of the "people in the mainland are also the people of the Republic of China", and they have been discontinued from now on. It is reported that a man in mainland China was unfortunately killed in Taiwan five years ago. The Kaohsiung Court quoted the above provisions to make compensation rulings, and the latest statement of the Taiwan Executive Yuan caused heated public opinion.

[** Taiwan Executive Yuan Order: Mainlanders do not have the nationality of the Republic of China **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/10-05252023162022.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hx-03282023091540.html)**

The man named Qian Qian rode a bicycle around the island in Taiwan in August 2018. He was killed by electric shock through the light leakage of the street light through the Kaohsiung Road District. According to reports, in the first instance of Kaohsiung City, the Dead was the people of the mainland and did not apply to Taiwan's "National Compensation Law". However, the Kaohsiung District Court determined that the Kaohsiung City Conservation Work Office had liability for negligence. At the same time, "the people of mainland China are also the people of the Republic of China." The second trial of the case also maintained the first trial.

Recently, the DPP legislator Zheng Yunpeng pointed out in the Legislative Yuan that he did not oppose compensation on the grounds of human rights, but the reason for the judgment was based on the letters of the Ministry of Justice 30 years ago. This is obviously not in line with the current laws and national emotions and requires legal affairs to require legal affairs The interpretation of the letter was abolished.

Chen Mingtang, the second director of the Legal Affairs Department, said: "Later, the" Nationality Law "was amended for the definition of the people of the Republic of China, so it was about 90 years of the Republic of China.(year 2010)After that, the letters are not directly applicable. "

The DPP legislator Zheng Yunpeng: "Some courts were deliberately transferred to the central kitchen of cognitive operations. Compensation is to compensate, regardless of him, he is a native of China, Hong Kong and Macao. "

** The Taiwan Political Court ordered the people of the Chinese mainland to be non -national.

After Zheng Yunpeng's inquiry, he received Taiwan's Executive Yuan in Taiwan on the 25th. Do not enjoy or bear the rights and obligations of the Republic of China, and those who have the old letters to be confused should stop applying or not for use from now.

"In the future, the judge has similar references and judgments to the personal ideological issue of the judge, which is the wrong judgment. It is necessary to accept the criticism of the Chinese people. The next thing is the judicial court, and he has to explain the education and training uniform." Zheng Yunpeng proposed on Facebook. His view.

Lawyer Huang Diying has published related articles on this judgment many times. When he was interviewed by this station, he said that the judge interpreted itself and then introduced the administrative letter by himself. The judge knew that he was the national of the People's Republic of China, but he "interpreted the people of the People's Republic of China as the nationals of the Republic of China."

"Such a judgment is ridiculous, and the gap between the social gap and the normal judgment with the international judgment is very impressive." Huang Diying further pointed out that "the court's judgment was originally restrained by administrative letters. ","

** Qu Zhaoxiang: The judgment affects whether there is any existence of the Republic of China **

Professor Qu Zhaoxiang, a Professor of Rongguang from Taiwan Normal University, told this station that the key to the case lies in the inconsistency of the court and the administrative department, but the insights of the administrative department are not the last opinion or the most authoritative opinion. In the end To the Supreme Court: "I estimate that this case will be determined to enter the judge meeting of the judicial court."

He explained that although Taiwan ’s president Tsai Ing -wen stated that“ cross -strait does not belong to each other ”, it did not clearly define it as an administrative or legal sovereignty, so there is still a vague space. If the judge's meeting explained the case, there was no way to avoid it.

"This is equivalent to Pandora's box, and someone opened it. The monster had already ran out." Qu Zhaoxiang believes that this judgment has a profound impact and will affect whether the Republic of China of China is still there. If the judge's explanation is still the same as the administrative organs, "this is equivalent to legal Taiwan independence."

** Judge "No. 328 Explanation" Territory is a major political issue and cannot be explained by the judicial constitutional interpretation authority **

Huang Diying pointed out that the "explanation of No. 328" of the big judge has explained that territory is a political issue, not the judicial institute that can explain: "Therefore, the judges of the local courtyard actually overlook the judges and turn all the people of the People's Republic of China into our nationals."

According to the "interpretation of No. 328", Article 4 of the Constitution does not adopt a list of "territory of the Republic of China". Reasons in history. The definition of its inherent territory as a major political issue should not be explained by the constitutional interpretation authority of exercising judicial power.

Huang Diying reminded that this verdict should not be placed in the so -called context of cross -strait relations. He asked, interpreting the nationals of the People's Republic of China as the "Chinese" national, and 1.4 billion people in China are the nationals of the Republic of China. Now Taiwan is issuing 6,000 yuan in cash. Can these so -called "1.4 billion people of the Republic of China" be able to lead?

Surging News disclosed the news from the China Railway International Company on the 24th that the Yawan high -speed rail that China aid construction will start on May 22, Indonesia, starting at 4 pm (Beijing time at 5 pm) to ensure the EMU The train is running safely and stable, and it is expected to be opened to traffic in June.

According to reports, the Yawan high -speed rail connects the Indonesian capital of Jakarta to the tourist destination Bandung, with a total length of 142.3 kilometers. The maximum operating speed of the train will reach 350 kilometers per hour. It is the first time that China ’s high -speed rail has exported technology and standards overseas. In the future, Jaca's travel time will be shortened from more than 3 hours to 40 minutes.

According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, China has obtained the bidding of the project in 2015. China Railway and other state -owned enterprises and Indonesian state -owned enterprises are formulated by Indonesian Chinese high -speed rail companies with 40 % of Chinese capital. The project is expected to be completed in 2019, but engineering delays due to land acquisition and new crown epidemic.

Pengbai News reported that the Yawan High -speed Railway started on June 9, 2018 and was promoted by the heads of China and Indonesia. The project is of great significance to promote the high -quality development of the "Belt and Road" and the implementation of the "Global Marine fulcrum" strategy of Indonesia.

(Associated Press) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx1-05262023114150.html/2.jpg)** Taiwan scholars: Will China bear the support of overdraft debt? **

However, Shi Jianyu, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, accepted an interview with Liberty Asian Radio: "After all, it overdraws a billion US dollars, how to deal with it? Will China be willing to bear all? Loans from China Development Bank, and we must also pay for it to pay back. "

Shi Jianyu said that how high security is still a question mark. The Yawan Railway is symbolic in the "Belt and Road" maritime Silk Road blueprint in China, and Wanlong was also the place where Zhou Enlai attended the meeting.

Shi Jianyu: "Indonesia's anti -China sounds in the past, will this railway change to Indonesia's stereotypes of China's original? Lost, including the risk of overdraft and whether the initial operation stage is profitable, maybe all China must swallow. "

Chen Bingzheng, an associate professor of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Political University of Taiwan, accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty: "There were many controversy in this case, and the project was a bit delayed. Of course, Indonesia hopes to operate smoothly. Go to other Chinese high -speed rail output plans. "

(Reuters) [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hx1-05262023114150.html/3.jpg)** The Yawan high -speed rail is the test gold stone of China's high -speed rail technology and standard output **

Chen Bingyu mentioned: "Some criticisms feel that this is the victory of Chinese competition. Many people will regard it as a victory of geopolitical competition, but from the perspective of Indonesia, Indonesia may not think this is an indicator of geopolitical competition. Indonesia's demand To build a high -speed rail, there is no way to build it yourself, you must ask foreign countries to help build. "

Chen Bingzheng said that in recent years, China's high -speed rail has made great progress in China. The outside world has been watching how the Yawan high -speed rail construction is. If China ’s export of high -speed rail is successful, other countries will be more confident in China's high -speed rail technology.

Chen Bingzheng also said that for many countries, it is not good to use land politics to restrain the policy choice. If geopolitics can only do business with a certain country, unless you are willing to pay such money for geopolitics, Many countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, are unwilling to do so. Do these countries mainly consider whether there is a way to complete this project and how much money it costs, not that the country is good or bad in China.

Shi Jianyu mentioned that Japan was very interested in the Yawan Railway. In the end, he was disappointed without bidding. China was able to grab this project with its own affordable risks.

Shi Jianyu said: "After ten years of policy operations in the Belt and Road, China's economy is not as good as before. Is China willing to subsidize these projects from foreign blood transfusion? From this perspective, China must lose. Do not return, it is a very actual economic loss for China, but China has increased some influence. "

Shi Jianyu pointed out that the Indonesian territory needs high -speed rail long. The Yawan high -speed railway originally planned to reach more than 700 kilometers in Suraba. It is currently only more than 100 kilometers from Wandong, which is experimental. In the future, whether Wanlong will be left to China, Japan or Germany, the construction or cooperation will be worth observing each part of the construction, and there will be examples of multi -national high -speed rail in Turkey.

Shi Jianyu said that if China has obtained all projects, the risk of burden is great, and the influence will increase. If China does not participate in construction, the Yawan high -speed rail will not be considered so successful.

However, it is still different in the attitude towards online reviews and online fraud. So, where is the difference?

[** Bank card's daily transaction limit is 5,000 yuan? Response: To prevent telecommunications network fraud **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-02242023095815.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/1-05042023104610.html)**

Many public security departments in China issued a reminder of anti -fraud on the official Weibo on Thursday (May 25), saying that a number of netizens recently received a "mandatory gun" fraud text message, which refers to the credit fraud involving credit fraud, but The absence of the court has been positioned by "Skynet". The local law enforcement agencies and judicial personnel have been notified to bring a gun to lead the team to perform forced guns. A large number of netizens and bloggers posted documents and videos to discuss the serious situation of Chinese fraud.

?

Liang Guang, a Chinese netizen who pays attention to the incident, told this station that there are more messages related to fraud after the epidemic, and there are many types of fraud.

Liang Guang: "Some are business cooperation, and some are impersonated by banks, and some are impersonated by the public security department. They say that they are the Criminal Police Brigade who wants you to make a transcript and scare you to turn your heads. Clear, where do you live and how many deposits are, many people are confused to hook. I want to know what the unit is out of this information? "

** "Ping An Beijing" "Sending" is speechless "to beware of information. Netizens questioning the attitude of public security against fraud group **

The keywords of the "Gun Decision", on the official Weibo of Beijing Public Security "Ping An Beijing" to release the same reminder, once again aroused heated discussion among netizens, because the post was added with the description of "really speechless!" The keywords of speechless death have become hot search on Weibo. Netizens ridiculed the attitude of the public security organs and made people feel speechless, saying that even public security was speechless. How can ordinary people cope with the information of fraud. Some netizens questioned why the public security department only issued a reminder and did not enforce the law.

** Comment: The Public Prosecution Law only attaches importance to suppressing citizens' free "speechless".

Zhang Jianping, a commentator from Yixing in Jiangsu, believes that the public security organs expressed "speechlessness" and caused a warm response to netizens.

Zhang Jianping: "For example, Li Wenzu lived in the family of Yejing Ring. The public security was named in the name of reporting and harassing it in the middle of the night. As long as you take out the power of 10 points for the speech review to be targeting fraud, it is easy to curb. Therefore, the public security uses the "speechless" sentence so that the people do not buy it. This is also the root cause of the public security without credibility. "

** The victim of the online fraud personal experience experience the law enforcement tendency of public prosecution law to be interested in harming the interests of national interest **

Fang Yuan, a current affairs commentator, was also a victim of online fraud, and his friends he knew had been deceived, but he said that he was treated coldly when he reported to the public security.

Fang Yuan: "I was on Taobao, and fake customer service had scammed us. At that time, I lost more than 6,000 yuan and was scammed. I went to the public security report. The investment of some false projects was deceived to report the case, and they (public security) also shirked and did not give the case. It seemed that there was no interest. But the corresponding was several times we wrote some articles on the Internet, but they actively asked us to talk. These cases can be seen that there is a clear tendency in law enforcement, and things that are harmed by the people are basically not interested. "

Fang Yuan said that the public prosecution law department needs to remind the public not to believe in such ridiculous fraud messages, reflecting the Chinese people's fear of offending the public prosecution law department, no more ridiculous and unbelievable requirements, and obedience.

Fang Yuan: "The public power of the prosecution law is too strong, and the deterrent of the people of the civilians is enough to fear. Once people look at the news in this area, they will immediately look white, and even say that they are trembling. They are more willing to believe in these. Things are true, because in reality, if you do not cooperate with public power to enforce the law, you do not obey, then your consequences are imaginative, so this kind of fear is used by the fraud group. "

Fang Yuan said that in the era when China entered economic downturn and online fraud, it was difficult for the public to expect that the public security department could have to fight fraud. It can only protect themselves by increasing their legal knowledge to protect themselves.

(Voice of Germany) Consulting company Anyong (EY) reported this month that foreign investment in Germany fell to the lowest level in 2013. American companies are still the most important investors in Germany, and investment from China has declined.

The report wrote that although Chinese companies' investment in Germany has remained stable for a long time, Chinese projects have decreased in 2022. Nevertheless, Ernst & Young also pointed out that when Chinese companies invest in Europe, most investment is mainly in Germany. Among the total 222 Chinese investment projects, 85 were carried out in Germany; followed by France with a total of 32 projects.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/各国在德投资-美国蝉联榜首-中国排名下滑/a-65697529)The statistics released this week also have similar results. Despite the influence of the war and energy crisis, the number of foreign companies in Germany in 2022 remains stable. The United States is still the country with the most investment. Switzerland and Britain ranked second and third, and China slipped to fourth place. Among them, the number of investment projects from China fell to the lowest level since 2014.

Woodker said that it supports China to invest in some areas of Germany and in those areas where Germany has a technical gap with China, so that we can learn from China. "

### No longer favored by Chinese investors?

according to [ ](https://www.ey.com/de_de/news/2023/02/weniger-chinesische-firmenuebernahmen-in-deutschland)German companies are losing their attractiveness to investors. The report entitled "Chinese Enterprises in Europe" states that the number of Chinese companies' acquisitions on Germany and European companies is declining. In 2022, China conducted 139 acquisitions or investment in Europe, and 155 in 2021. The estimated value of these 139 investment was $ 4.3 billion (about 4. billion euros), which was almost two -thirds compared with 2021.

According to Ernst & Young statistics, China's acquisition in Germany in 2022 dropped from 35 to 26, and the investment amount also fell from $ 2 billion (about 1.87 billion euros) to nearly 290 million US dollars.

In contrast, in 2022, the United States acquired 242 companies in Germany, leading in other countries, and the second Britain acquired 128. China ranks 12th in the national ranking. The report pointed out that in 2021, China ranked 9th in this ranking, and in 2016, China was the fourth largest investor in Germany.

Compared with this year's record in 2016, China is particularly cautious. At that time, Ernst & Young calculated the case of Chinese investors' acquisitions or holdings of European companies from 309, with a total value of 86 billion euros. Seven years ago, the largest transaction in Germany was China -US group acquired Augsburg robotic manufacturer KUKA, with a single acquisition amount of $ 4.7 billion. Since then, these numbers have continued to decline almost, and there are few acquisitions in Germany in Germany. According to Ernst & Young data, only 26 Chinese investors acquired or invest in German companies last year. EY's data shows that buyers from China have now avoided large -scale acquisitions of controversial politics.

### In the face of Chinese investment, how should Europe be dealt with?

In 2022, the largest investment in Chinese buyers in Europe was that Wuxi's micro -core acquired the world's second largest mobile base station radio frequency semiconductor company, Dutch AMPLEON.

The larger transaction in Germany was East China Pharmaceutical Investment Holding Company's equity investment in Heidelberg Pharma, Heidelberg Pharmaceutical Company, as well as AMSOSRAM to sell its digital lighting system Europe and Asian business to Inventronics.

### Why does China reduce acquisitions and investment?

Sun Yi, the head of the reporter of the report and the German business department of Ernst & Estate, said: "The number of Chinese companies in Europe has maintained a relatively low level in the past few years." The reason is due to the new crown epidemic, Chinese businessmen have been unable to travel for a long time. On the other hand, for China, its expansion in Europe has obviously lost its importance.

Sun Yi further explained that Chinese companies faced considerable political resistance in the acquisition and trading cases of many European countries, such as infrastructure, such as infrastructure. She said: "Therefore, Chinese investors are now carefully examining the potential acquisition goals to avoid discussions on these sensitive issues by the government and the public."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T12-57-00Z/19317982_404.jpg)The reporter of the report, Sun Yi, the head of the German business department of the German District of Ernst & Estate, Sun Yi

Sun Yi also pointed out that the tense political relationship between China and the United States has also suppressed trading activities: "If the potential acquisition target has production facilities or R & D centers in the United States, potential Chinese buyers are usually not invited to participate because they are worried that they will be concerned about them. Rejected by the relevant U.S. departments. "

According to Ernst & Young data, in 2022, Chinese investors' acquisitions in Europe for high -tech companies in Europe first surpassed the traditional industrial field. The report pointed out that in 2022, Chinese investors are most interested in the medical industry. Of the 17 transactions in the fields of European biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical technology, 9 have occurred in Germany. The United Kingdom has once again become the most popular investment destination for Chinese companies.

Despite the decline in investment, Sun Yi believes that Chinese companies are still very interested in Germany. In the report, she pointed out: "Most of the transactions that have occurred in recent years are very successful. In this context, China and Germany have now established a close and flexible connection on many levels." She believes that there will be more Chinese companies this year Looking for acquisition objects in Europe. "However, the number of transactions will still be significantly lower than the period of prosperity."

According to the "Overview of China Overseas Investment in the first quarter of 2023" released by Ernst & Young on May 11, in the first quarter of this year, the amount of mergers and acquisitions announced by Chinese companies in Europe was US $ 950 million, a year -on -year decrease of 39%. It fell 24%, mainly investing in the United Kingdom (real estate, hotels and construction) and Germany (advanced manufacturing and transportation). The transactions of the two countries accounted for 86%of the total M & A announced by China Enterprise in Europe.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-26T13-02-07-00-00/000000.png)43 -year -old Victoria escaped Russia in front of Ukraine's occupation zone and was forced to apply for a Russian passport, but she said that she never wanted to do this because "I am a Ukrainian citizen."

The soldiers on the street warned her to get a passport, otherwise she could not submit important documents. She also heard that the authorities checked by the authorities, and people without Russian documents were deported.

Experts have pointed out that the Moscow authorities have been continuously forced to promote Russian passports, trying to prove the legitimacy of Russia's occupation and strengthen control, and at the same time to destroy the identity of the Ukraine.

Victoria told AFP in Zaporizhzhia: "I definitely don't want to do so."

But when she needs to register a house and car, she no longer resists. The authorities supported by Moscow must be submitted to Russian documents when conducting real estate and car transactions.

She began to apply for the necessary Russian translation for the Ukrainian marriage certificate and birth certificate. When she fled in East Ukraine in January this year, the relevant procedures were not completed.

She also said, "Even if I get a Russian passport, I am still Ukraine. For me, nothing will change."

Over the years, Russia has been controlled by the Donbas region (Donbas), eastern Ukraine and Crimea, eastern Ukraine's Ukraine.

But since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine 15 months ago, this passport has gradually become more aggressive.

Experts and local residents told AFP that many daily needs, such as receiving government welfare, job hunting or keeping work, and seeking medical services, all need documents issued by Russian authorities.

Pu Ting even signed a decree in April this year. If the Ukrainians in the occupation area did not obtain a Russian passport before July 1, 2024, they may be expelled.

The Moscow authorities announced in late November last year that it has issued 80,000 passports since Pu Ting claimed to be the territory in 4 regions in Ukraine last September.

The college graduation season is coming, and the problem of Chinese students in the United States has become a hot spot again. Coinciding with all walks of life in the United States worrying about the Chinese government's stealing technology and even threatening the national security of the United States, how does the sensitive professional students view their "Chinese" identity?

*** [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/eng-04302023075633.html)***[** A Chinese student faces US judicial allegations that have been tracked and harassed "White Paper Movement" supporter **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/bx-12152022135741.html)In Mayday of Phoenix Flowers, a large number of graduates of graduates in American universities weekends in almost every weekend wearing a bachelor's robe and a scientific hat. They lined up at the graduation ceremony and waited for the spike ceremony. They also symbolized that they were about to say goodbye to teenagers.

Looking at the graduate of this year, I left the school and Ais pine, a Chinese doctoral student who was studying in electronic engineering in Pennsylvania. According to the program, he still has half a year at school, and he does not need to grab the narrow door with other peers in the hot summer. Not only did the American science and technology market face the cold winter of employment this year, Ace's undergraduate background of the "Defense Seven Son" also made him have more "original sins" than other graduates.

Ace: "We are not treated by China, because we are anti -thief (opposed to the Communist Party) and are not treated by the United States, because we come from China to get angry on both sides."

** "National Defense Seven Son" in the United States? **

For personal safety considerations, Ace accepted an interview with this station in English. He has been investing resumes for internships a few months ago, but he contacted more than ten laboratories, including institutions funded by the US government, but none of them. Ace believes that his sensitive majors, the background of the defense seven sons and the identity of Chinese citizen let him eat closed doors all the way.

"I am a professional electronic information of the Seven Sons of Defense (university). Our sensitive and sensitive schools, I don't know how to refuse my human resources what to think. People will definitely not say the real reason. It may be considered the seven sons of the defense, especially in some national laboratories. "Ace couldn't help spitting bitter water to reporters.

In recent years, the Chinese government has actively dug in American sensitive scientific and technological talents and intellectual property rights, and some of the purpose even to strengthen the modernization and military capabilities of the Chinese PLA. Jillmurphy, deputy assistant director of the FBI (FBI), is in charge of the anti -intelligence work, recently testified to Congress that the threat of intelligence and economic spy from China constitutes the largest and long -term threat to the United States' scientific and technological innovation and economic security. In addition, Chinese scholars have been sued by the US government for stealing intellectual property rights, commercial secrets and returning relevant information back to China.

(Video Screenshot/Official Website of the House of Representatives) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/cm-05162023125741.html/cm0526a.jpg)** How do American recruitment companies view the "Chinese" background? **

However, will American companies be more guarded by Chinese students? An anonymous person who had served as a manager at a technology giant company in the United States revealed to this station that he also has the experience of sensitive industrial work. Because US laws are not allowed to discriminate against the race, nationality, gender, etc. It is not the primary focus of technology companies. Even if companies are concerned about citizens of specific countries when recruiting, they will not understand the notification. However, he believes that if you are in a sensitive industry, the application may be more special.

The American manager said: "Recruitment managers usually do not pay special attention (nationality of job seekers), unless this is a very sensitive industry, such as national defense or nuclear weapons. If it is a job seeker from Iran, China or North Korea I think it is easier to cause a dangerous signal. Recruitment units will independently examine all the background information of each job seeker, but broadly, people from Iran, China, North Korea and other countries may be more worrying. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-26T13-27-00-04-00/000002.png)On November 30, 2022, some Chinese students supported the domestic "White Paper Movement" (Associated Press picture) on the streets of New York in New York [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/cm-05162023125741.html/ap22334053694812.jpg)** The front and back of the coin **

Ace came to the United States with a student visa in 2018. He told the reporter that he was not immediately approved when he applied for a visa in the US Embassy in China. According to the official website of the US State Department, the embassy staff may require the applicant to further administrate the administrative trial when it is determined that more information is required to help decide or refuse to issue a visa.

"I got (visa) for three months for three months, and this process was still very torment. Because in the process of checking, many people did not pass it, so I rejected After passing, although it is a relatively sensitive major such as the seven sons and electronic information. "Ace recalled.

In addition, the US Trump administration issued an administrative order in 2020 to prohibit students related to the "Milital-Civil FusionStrategy" in China entered the United States. "Seven National Defense".

"Seven Defense" is the 7 universities directly under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, including Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Harbin University of Technology, Harbin University of Technology, Northwestern University of Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Nanjing University of Technology.

After the Biden government took office, the administrative order was still retained.And another Chinese student John in the United States believes that although the U.S. government's intention to defend national security is good, but if there is no proper planning and proper tools, I am afraid it will become a cup of cups and label all the Chinese students with sensitive professional backgrounds so that the United States will lose the United States to lose the United States. Opportunity to recruit top talents.

For safety reasons, John, who specializes in the field of biotechnology, is unwilling to use its name. He told Liberty Radio: "I agree with the United States to strengthen the prevention of China, but it depends on how to prevent it. Some precautions for China are actually mutually beneficial. For example Drive everyone away, (the United States) does not know what good talents are being driven away. "

** The decline in US -China relations is still the first choice for studying in China **

Although US -China relations are not as good as before, the United States is still the first choice for Chinese students. According to the "Open Portal Report in 2022" released by the US International Education Association (IIE), the 2021/2022 academic year, the total number of Chinese students studying in the United States accounted for about 33%of the total number of international students, ranking first, and China became the largest in the United States for 13 consecutive years. International students of international students. Among them, the proportion of mathematics and computer specialists accounted for nearly a quarter, followed by projects.

Professor Kim Defang revealed that her two Chinese students returned to work after graduation, and contacted her last year, hoping to help issue a recommendation letter from the American master's degree. She believes that many Chinese students are actually talented, and they have the potential to make great contributions to the United States in terms of economy and technology.

"Some of them may be spies, which will be judged by the Federal Investigation Agency." Kim Defang said.

Recently, the "Russian Liberal Legion shouts to talk about the Chinese People's Liberation Army" short video. The picture is a member of the Russian Liberal Legion spoke in Russian. Simplified Chinese subtitles say "Your Pig Head Emperor, like Putin, is a dictator who oppresses the people."

After investigation, the Liberty of RussioGion did release this video, but the content has nothing to do with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The translation of Chinese subtitles that have been circulating in Chinese subtitles are inconsistent with the original videos. It is added by Twitter users "Wall Country Word". But the publisher stated that most of his works were funny with subtitles. Asian facts investigation of the laboratory found that when some online media and netizens reposted this second -created Chinese subtitles short video, no subtitle was ironic creation, which may lead to the true faith.

Simplified Chinese subtitles read "Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, we are the Russian Liberty Legion, we will fight for our compatriots, fight for freedom ... Your pig head The emperor, like Putin, is a dictator who oppresses the people. "

First, we check the authenticity of the video. The "Russian Free Legion" released short videos on Twitter on May 22, and many media have reprinted and reported. According to [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cIjh3SY9qI), British "Times" [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rvyx-xFkF0)Reports and translations, the video content is roughly about lies, corruption, review, and restrictions on Russia under Putin's rule. It is time to end the Cremlin's rule, and Russia will be free. These news reports did not mention that the video involved related content involved in China and the Chinese PLA.

And his Twitter account introduction also wrote that the Chinese subtitles were edited by movies and TV clips for secondary creation, and in the form of funny and ironic, they exposed the ridiculous and evil of the dictatorship.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/驻华欧盟商会取消入境限制是正确的一小步/a-64220454)The chairman Woodkek told the "South Germany" that local officials in China were warmly welcomed by foreign investors on red carpets. However, under such charm, European companies still show great caution. He said: "China is not the same as before. Economic growth is not so strong. The top ten European companies in front of them account for 80 % of investment in China, and they continue to invest. Or leave. This is very different from the situation in the United States: the German economy there is very excited, and the industrialization of the German industry has also received orders. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济遭重创-在华德企商业信心探底/a-64092035)Essence "

Woodkek told the Nande will that the biggest problem in China's economy is in the real estate industry, accounting for a quarter of the national economy. Despite the continued construction of the suspension projects, there are almost no new development. In addition, in the field of exports, China exported 6.4 million containers to the EU last year, and the European Union had only 1.6 million containers to China. This shows China's dependence on European consumers. In terms of industrial production, energy supply has continued to have problems. The unemployment rate of youth remains high, about 20%in big cities.

### World Economic Engine Make no longer foreign companies want to evacuate the Chinese market?

Woodker said that China's private economy has a very smart and flexible mind. "China is promoted by Ma Yun or Tencent's Ma Yun or Tencent's Ma Yun or Tencent, and it is these people who are now punished. State -owned enterprises are supported."

The reporter of the "South Germany" reported that communism is now revealed? Woodker said: "State -owned enterprises and five -year plans have been giving directions, but in the past, private enterprises had more space, and former President Jiang Zemin also brought them to the party. The scene was repeated. At that time, private entrepreneurs took over the economy and the media, and the party collapsed. In China, we have not been in the 1960s when the Cultural Revolution, but the direction is like this. "

The reporter asked: In the past, the slogan of "transformation of trade promotion" in Germany's debate in Germany would always be mentioned. Is China's current situation that we can predict at the time? Woodkek replied: "The promotion of trade is realized. The Chinese have changed us. We have never thought of it in the past. Now we look at the nationality of investors in Germany. The Chinese show us industrial policy."

Woodke also said that China has great potential if it can be completely liberalized. But the party could not see this potential because I wanted to maintain control.

# The login of the "sensitive facilities" in the Hamburg Port in Hamburg Port was intentionally delayed?

Author: None (Language: zh)

Time: 2023-05-26T14:29:00Z

Description: The controversy caused by Chinese -funded Hamburg Portal Welfare Wharf is still being extended: it is reported that the relevant institutions have not listed this dock as a protected facility in time, and the expression of the Hamburg Port operator has previously said that the dock is not a sensitive facility. Colleagues do not match.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T14-29-00Z/63564330_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65746595/63564330)(Voice of Germany Chinese) Disputes on the Chinese -owned investment in Hamburg Portal Welfare Land finally settled in mid -May: The federal government completed the approval of this investment plan, allowing the Chinese capital to participate in the Hamburg Port CTT CTT Fuki Container Terminal Pier Essence At this point, many Federal Ministry of Germany have rejected the Federal Prime Minister's Palace on the objection to the transaction.

However, the decision -making of the Prime Minister's Palace is also controversial. On the eve of the federal government's approval, the relevant docks have been listed as a sensitive infrastructure worthy of special protection. The key to the problem is that this dock should be positioned as sensitive facilities earlier, and the government's approval results may be completely different under the case of selected sensitive facilities. So who should take responsibility for this?

According to the information obtained by West Germany and North Germany, the HHLA of Hambao Port and Logistics Co., Ltd. HHLA has announced many times during the government approval that the Fuyidi Wharf that Chinese capital to invest is not a sensitive facility. However, the operator is wrong with this position of Fudi Wharf. Because the annual throughput of the dock far exceeds the standard for the pier's selected sensitive infrastructure. A spokesman for Hamburg Port and Logistics Co., Ltd. did not refute relevant allegations when he was questioned by the media. She just said that all government departments can fully understand the operation of the pier at any time.

### error decision made under the premise

The problem of HHLA is that in accordance with relevant laws, port operators must not only inform government agencies in a timely manner, but also register sensitive facilities in a timely manner. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉堡港福地码头被列入关键基础设施-中远入股还有戏吗/a-65293775)It is said that the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs has urged the Ministry of the Interior to complete the login of sensitive facilities as soon as possible, but obviously has not been responded. Under the premise of such a mistake, the German government passed the approval procedure of Chinese capital to invest in Hamburg Port.

The error decision under the premise of this error has attracted the attention of many federal parliamentarians. This week, the Federal House Economic Council has questioned the Federal Information Security Administration and its superior Federal Ministry of the Interior. But who should be responsible for this wrong decision is not yet determined.

According to news surveys conducted by North Germany and West Germany, Chinese -funded shares have falsely fallen in the Hamburg Port approval procedure, and the time span has continued from the summer of 2021 to this day. In 2022, the new sensitive facilities came into effect. Hamburg Port should have completed the registration of sensitive facilities in Fudi Wharf before April 2022, but Hamburg Port did not do this.

On April 29, 2022, the relevant parties held a meeting in Berlin to discuss the approval procedures for the issue of Chinese investment. The participants were said to include HHLA, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Representative of the Prime Minister's Palace. During the meeting, the representative of the Hamburg Port showed a document that the Fudi Wharf was not a sensitive facility. But the error message at the time did not attract the attention of the participants. This is also the beginning of a series of wrong decisions.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T14-29-00Z/65711026_401.jpg)German Prime Minister Shulz and his Prime Minister's Palace are active promoters of Chinese -funded investment in Hamburg Port.

### Prime Minister Mansion hopes to promote port transactions

If the Field Wharf was included in a sensitive facility in accordance with the regulations, the subsequent government decision -making results may be very different. Because at that time, although the dock was not included in sensitive facilities, the six federal ministries participating in decision -making are opposed to the Chinese capital's investment in Hamburg. However, the German Prime Minister's Palace headed by Schilde was an active advocate of the transaction and turned on the green light for future negotiations. One of the core reasons proposed by the Prime Minister's Palace is that the Field Wharf is not a sensitive facility.

### The Green Party and the Alliance Party propose to criticize

Felix Banaszak, an expert in the Green Party, put forward a strong criticism of a series of errors in the approval procedures of the Hamburg Port. He said: "Unfortunately, the entire approval process allowed the German Prime Minister's Palace, the German Ministry of Political Affairs, and the German Information Security Administration to have no light. Especially after being positioned as a sensitive facility at the Field Pier, the German Prime Minister still obstructed the transaction to the transaction. Re -evaluation is undoubtedly a serious mistake.

Stefan Rouenhoff, a Federal MP, believes that there is still a series of problems to be clarified: "[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国内阁批准中资入股汉堡港-警告声不绝于耳/a-63562744)"Lainehov also criticized the Prime Minister's Palace and the Federal Information Security Agency. He said:" We have reason to question whether the German Ministry of the Internal Citizen under the leadership of the Social Democratic Party is covering a cover for the Prime Minister's Palace, so there is no (to the Field Pier (to the Field Wharf, The positioning of sensitive facilities) conducts in -depth review.

It is worth noting that a total of 30 Confucius Institutes opened by local universities and Chinese in the United Kingdom, while the University of Sarri University is not involved.

A US study found that chronic pain is related to activities in a specific area of the cerebral cortex, and the related brain activity model is different from acute pain. This discovery is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of chronic pain.

Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday (May 26) that the research conducted by the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions of the United States. For the first time monitoring the relationship between chronic pain and brain activity of human body, and published in the British "Nature · Neuroscience" magazine superior.

Data show that about 30%of people around the world are plagued by chronic pain, but the current therapy has no obvious effect on most cases, especially neurological pain, such as painful limb pain after stroke or amputation. In the past, most of the studies relied on patients to conduct subjective descriptions of pain, and they didn't know much about related neurological indicators.

The research team recruited four patients who suffered chronic pain due to stroke or amputation, and implanted electrodes and stimulators in their brain to record two areas related to pain in the brain -orbitofrontalcortex and ATERIOR Cingulating Cortex activity.

Volunteers write down the subjective feelings during chronic pain. At the same time, the equipment records the brain activity of 30 seconds, which is carried out many times a day for a maximum of six months. They also received hot stimulus experiments to record brain activity when acute pain occurred.

The analysis results show that chronic pain is related to the continuous changes of the orbital cortex activity, and acute pain is associated with the front buckle back to the cortex activity.

Researchers hope to conduct larger -scale experiments to deepen the relationship between pain and brain activity, identify personalized neurological indicators for patients, and help develop and treat equipment or drugs.

The Chinese real estate market has been cold, and new recruits for selling houses have continued. In Chongqing, Shenzhen and other places, the phenomenon of "negative first payment" and "zero down payment" in Chongqing, Shenzhen and other places have attracted attention. According to the Chinese media "Zhongxin Jingwei" report, negative payment "means that buyers not only need to pay the down payment, but also can be renovated and other funds.

For example, "Zhongxin Jingwei", a set of 5.2 million yuan in real estate in Luohu District, Shenzhen can loan 5.7 million yuan, which means that the down payment not only does not need to "pay for it", but also loans more than 500,000 yuan from the bank. I am afraid that it violates violated it Related financial credit policies.

On May 26, the Shenzhen Real Estate Intermediary Association issued a solemn reminder on "Prosperity to Prohibit the participation/assistance of" buying a house negative payment "and" zero down payment "and other violations of laws and illegal acts" to prepare to rectify.

"Zhongxinwei" also published Zhang Dawei, the chief analyst of Central Plains Real Estate on the same day that the "negative payment" house purchase is essentially a "high -review high loan" model, which is a illegal act of fraud. Wang Yuli, director of the Beijing Gold Prosecution Law Firm, also believes that this approach is obviously illegal and there are many legal risks.

# Column | Night Talk Zhongnanhai: Twenty is far from that Xi Jinping's considering "successor" for himself

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-26T17-09-00-04-00/000000.png)In March 2023, the CCP leader Xi Jinping was "elected" President at the National People's Congress. Reuters information picture [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05262023143937.html/@@stream)A few days ago, the Wall Street Journal of the United States published an article signed by Chun Hanwong, "Throughout the Mystery of Xi Jinping's Class", saying that "he (Xi Jinping) broke the ten -year governance cycle established by the previous Chinese leaders and in the party in the party, and in the party Consistent confidence in the interior, the age of these relatives, and the qualifications, are not enough to stir up the successors of the successor. "

According to the author of the article: "Xi Jinping, who is about to be 70 years old in June this June, this is a mystery he intentionally set. Under the case of unclear successors, the elite in the party needs to be careful to help Xi Jinping Maintain control and strive for time to evaluate the potential successors ... "

A few days ago, several Chinese media introduced the article by Dr. Wu Guoguang, a scholar published by the Institute of Policy of the American Asian Association in this month.

Dr. Wu Guoguang's article pointed out: The average age of the new Politburo members appointed by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was more than five years ago, ten years ago, or even twenty years ago. At the same time, after the 20th National Congress, Xi Jinping began to increase the post -60s and 70s upper position. However, Xi is the first leader who has not arranged a successor "Prince" since Deng Xiaoping.

Mr. Guoguang's "Prince" here is in the sense of "successor", not in the sense of "skirt". That is, the word Xi Jinping once used at the party meeting, "Chu Jun."

According to Wu Guoguang's calculation, the average age of the Politburo Standing Committee selected in October 2022 was 65.1 years old, 62.9 years in 2017, 63.1 years in 2012, and 62.0 years in 2002. This reflects Xi Jinping's deliberately promoting officials in his tenure and postponed the trend of promoting young officials.

The average age of the Standing Committee of the Politburo Standing Committee held in the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October last year, the reason why the Standing Committee of the 18th Central Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the 16th Central Politburo Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 16th Central Politburo was more than ten years ago. Yes, first because Xi Jinping himself broke the "seven, eight and eight", and the second was that Wang Huning, who was already 67 years old at the time of the 20th National Congress, was left in office. That is, Cai Qi, who is 66 years old, is Li Xi. In this way, the average age was pulled up.

Of course, in the newly promoted Politburo Standing Committee member of the Twenty National Congress, there was finally a post -60s, Ding Xuexiang, a member of the last Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Secretariat, born in September 1962.

However, Ding Xuexiang, the only post -60s of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee, was also over 60 years old at the conference. When he held the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China 15 years ago, at the same time Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, who are directly promoted to the Standing Committee of the Seventeenth Central Political Bureau, became the general secretary and the premier of the State Council, "spare tires".

If you compare it further, in the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2002, nine Politburo Standing Committee members were mainly 40s, and there were 3 30 generations, but they were born in the late 1930s. Among them, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao of the General Secretary of the successor and the Premier of the State Council are 60 years old, Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the National People's Congress, is 61 years old, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee of the CPPCC, is 62 years old. He became the youngest member of the Political Bureau of the Politburo after the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Here is another emphasis. Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, who were 16 years ago, were successfully successively successively successively successively successively successively successively. Today, the only post -60s post -60s, Ding Xuexiang, who is just 60 years old, is just a succession of a executive deputy prime minister.

In this way, when you can fully explain that Xi Jinping is considering the twenty high -level personnel arrangements, while determining that he is re -elected for the third and five years, in fact, there is no perspective from the "age echelon". That is, the issue of the "first -one hand handling" problem held by the Planning Council at the Twenty -first class held around October 2010.

For example, the author of the Shangwal Street Journal article analyzed that the secret establishment system of the Qing Dynasty was the invention of the Emperor Yongzheng, which was ascended to the throne in 1722. He was deeply felt in the tragedy of his father Kangxi Emperor Kangxi in the world. He decided to choose the secret of Chu Jun after his lifetime, and after his death, the ministers saw the widow of the imperial heir to see. Yongzheng believes that the establishment of secrets can reduce the risk of the princes, so as not to let the emperor's power fall next to the reign, and also avoid Chu Jun from competing for power from the emperor.

Today, three hundred years later, Xi Jinping, the biggest power of China's power after Mao Zedong, also seems to be happy. Xi Jinping, who opened the third general secretary last year, can choose his successor and successor time, but he has been reluctant to show the cards.

The author believes that in the article, Xi Jinping's private considerations of "successors" and the secret establishment of the "Qing Dynasty (emperor)" are far -fetched. The more accurate analysis should be that Xi Jinping's third term has undoubtedly had the third and fifth determination to design his third term. And this determined psychological factors, in addition to "the world's big people" and "who I am" from the perspective of ability, there are also "picking two hundred pounds of burden to take 20 miles of mountain roads and do not change shoulders" and " The "physical health, forever health" of "5 kilometers per day" is extremely confident. Therefore, at least when the age composition of the "leadership collective" of the third term that accompanied himself in the third term last year, Xi Jinping may consider the problem of the second hand and the third hand ... Announcement, consider his successor's succession tire. From his self -use analysis, he would not even consider his so -called "potential successor" from the perspective of "preventing accidents".

When four candidates of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Twenty of the 20 assigned specific positions, Xi Jinping also seemed to consider how to avoid the problem of "successor".

At this point, we might as well return the time back to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year.

At that time, the outside world commented or "internal news", and Ding Xuexiang, then Ding Xuexiang, was optimistic about the "big inner manager", but there was no analysis article. None of the "according to Beijing news," mentioned that Ding Xuexiang will be the executive vice prestigious vice prestigious of the State Council.The New York Times article also analyzed: Ding Xuexiang, 60, is the youngest member of the Standing Committee. But many analysts say that because of the lack of provincial leadership experience, he is unlikely to become Xi Jinping's successor. In this sense, for Xi Jinping, he may be the best candidate for fish and bear's paw: loyalty but not threatening.

In other words, Ding Xuexiang's 20th major "entered", which was originally considered to be "nailed" by the outside world.

However, if Xi Jinping's personnel arrangement of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the 20th National Congress of Politburo is the most "not published in accordance with the card", or the least "follow -up" is to take a day of the deputy prime minister of the State Council, or even Li Qiang, who has never experienced the work experience of the State Council for half a day, was directly promoted to the Prime Minister of the State Council from the position of the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. It has never been in the post of the "Inner Management" of the government leaders or government departments from the grassroots level to the central government or the government departments.

Theore to theoretically, when Xi Jinping must further use himself as the leader of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and his second general secretary, Ding Xuexiang, who is in the term of office of his second general secretary, judges in accordance with "common sense". Ding Xuexiang should take over the job of Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the 19th Central Political Bureau, and analyzes from the perspective of logically and familiar. So why not arrange this?

Imagine that if Xi Jinping after the 20th National Congress must make Ding people "enter", it is not because Ding is not arranged as the executive deputy prime minister of the State Council, but is arranged as a de facto party "Deputy Secretary" Then, whether it is inside or outside the party, there will definitely be Xi Jinping's nine -year -old Ding Xuexiang who is nine years older than himself.

In comparison, Xi Jinping arranged for Cai Qi, who was in the age group as the party's second leader, and did not constitute the "age echelon", which would not cause unnecessary conjectures of "successors". In fact, after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, when Cai Qi replaced Wang Huning's "Deputy Secretary", he was confirmed by his new Politburo Standing Committee and the Secretary of the Secretary of the Central Committee (1). It was the perspective of "Vice Chairman Lin" around Mao Zedong, but it was only from the perspective of "intimate assistant of" great leaders ", not from the perspective of" successor selected by the great leader himself ".

Of course, on the premise of rewarding Ding Xuexiang as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the State -level National -level, there is no other choice for its specific job arrangements. Such as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. As for the positions of the chairman of the National People's Congress and the chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, since it was arranged to give a re -elected member of the Politburo Standing Committee in the 1950s, it naturally excluded the post -60s and was the first time to enter the applicability of Ding Xuexiang.

So in the distribution of the two specific positions of the State Council Executive Vice Premier and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Xi Jinping gave Ding Xuexiang the post of executive deputy prime minister of the State Council. Obviously, he had a consideration of the next five years.

Regarding the so -called "seven, eight below", there is no need to explain in detail here. After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year, it was questioned that Xi Jinping "broke the hidden rules of seven up and eight." But in fact, in addition to Xi Jinping himself, only the military representative Zhang Youxia and the diplomatic representative Wang Yi are "exceptions". All other deputy national levels including the political bureau members are not members of the Politburo. "Age" is still "seven, eight and eight".

It should be noted that in addition to Xi Jinping himself, the 20th Political Bureau of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee is also the principle of strictly obeying the principle of "seven, eight, and eight". Out of the situation, and Cai Qi, who is 67 years old, is often entered.

One of the most convincing facts is that under the premise of failing to re -elected the Politburo Standing Committee because of age, Han being able to be arranged as a national vice chairman by Wang Qishan five years ago. Out of the situation is not politically losing Xi Jinping, but just like Wang Qishan, five years ago, the simple age.

In addition, the former member of the 19th Central Politburo, Secretary of the Secretariat and Minister of the Central Team. Xi Jinping's "Shangpu Brothers" Chen Xi when he was a student of workers and soldiers in Tsinghua University. Being able to obtain the opportunity to be promoted to the Standing Committee of the Politburo on the 20th National Congress is enough to explain that Xi Jinping's "hidden rules" in the decision of the 20th high -level personnel, or "age bar" "" ".

At this point, we will compare the six and twenty Central Political Bureau Standing Committee members of Xi Jinping one by one, and we can see that Xi Jinping's purpose is 5 years, that is, the existing 20 of the 2027 will be held in 2027. The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, from Cai Qi to Zhao Leji, from Wang Huning to Li Xi, coupled with Li Qiang, born in 1959, must be "due to age", leaving only Xi Jinping and Ding Xuexiang for re -election. At that time, Ding Xuexiang replaced the post of Prime Minister Li Qiang's post.

In fact, before the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a commentator who had guessed that Hu Chunhua would take over as the Prime Minister's position. One of the reasons he held was that Hu Chunhua was one year younger than Ding Xuexiang's age advantage. After deciding that he could take over Prime Minister Li Keqiang, he could be re -elected as Li Keqiang as Li Keqiang. Two sessions, and the premiers of the State Council for two sessions are important factor in maintaining the relatively stable work of the State Council and relatively coherent governance.

However, now that Xi Jinping has arranged for the 21 -year -old Li Qiang to take over the post of prime minister, the inner abacus is likely to be the Central Party and the main head of politics except Xi Jinping. Whether it is the "Deputy Secretary" or the Prime Minister of the State Council, whether it is the chairman of the National People's Congress or the chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, whether it is the Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission or the Vice President of the Standing Committee.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

However, some critics believe that the British's move is too "mild", and it cannot prevent Hong Kong from retreat from the rule of law and the unfair trial that Li Zhiying is about to face.

[** Two years over 110,000 Hong Kong people holding a BNO visa to move to Britain as high -tech talents **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-05262023110730.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/ec-04212023072020.html)**

According to Reuters on May 26, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently submitted to the parliament from July 1 to December 31, 2022, the "Sino -British Joint Statement" in Hong Kong. Guoan Law in the port area.

British Foreign Minister Claidley(James Cleverly, also translated: Qi Zhanming)In this report, he pointed out that he emphasized how the Hong Kong authorities used the National Security Law to suppress opponents at the United Nations hearing in February this year, and many of them were detained or forced to exile overseas. He called on the Beijing authorities to implement the suggestions made in a independent investigation report in July last year in a independent investigation report to cancel the "National Security Law" implemented in Hong Kong in Hong Kong in 2020.

Clever also stated in the preface that "we stand with our partners to condemn the continuous erosion of Hong Kong citizens and political rights, as well as the continuous erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy."

Yuan Gongyi, a well -known Hong Kong activist in Canada and the initiator of the "Hong Kong Parliament", said in an interview with this station that the British move was too "gentle". The government's pressure: "Britain should go to the United Nations and the Hague International Court to sue China to violate the" Sino -British Joint Statement ", but the United Kingdom dare not, and the United Kingdom dares not to sanction many officials in Hong Kong violate the Basic Law and the Sino -British Joint Statement."

He mentioned that even at the beginning of this month, Chinese vice chairman Han Zheng also invited Xi Jinping to attend the Coronation ceremony of the British king.

The British government pointed out in the above report that the law of law in Hong Kong has been eroded, including the transfer of "the power that once belonged to the judicial institution" to Hong Kong leaders who have been in Beijing, and those who face national security accusations cannot question the government's decision in court.

Cleverly mentioned that the Hong Kong media tycoon Li Zhiying, who will face the trial of Guoan in September this year, said that he had proposed to the Li Zhiying case to the Li Zhiying case this month.

Yang Jinxia, the convener of the New York Hong Kong people "NY4HK", told the station that the clause of the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District was blurred and the interpretation right was completely belonging to Beijing. Social stability. "

"Guoan Law has a great impact on Hong Kong, because this law has no procedures in the law, and many things are vague. It can be sued by what you do." She said, "Also There are conflicts with the human rights law in the world and the "UN Human Rights Charter". For many people, you do not know when the National Security Law is sentenced to being sentenced. "

Li Zhiying, 75, was the founder of the Hong Kong "Apple Daily". The newspaper was searched by the police in 2021 and then stopped.

This station previously reported that the Hong Kong court rejected Li Zhiying's judicial review application on hiring British lawyers to act as an agent of the British lawyer last week. According to the latest bill passed by the Hong Kong legislature, Hong Kong leaders have free tailoring to prevent foreign lawyers from acting as national security cases in Hong Kong. Pan Zhaochu, the chief judge who rejected Li Zhiying's review, stated in the judgment that the Hong Kong court has no judicial jurisdiction over the National Security Council, and the National Security Commission is not challenged by judicial review.

Yang Jinxia welcomes Western countries such as the United Kingdom to concern Hong Kong's democratic situation, but she does not have much hope for whether the trial of the upcoming Li Zhiying case can be fair.

"In Li Zhiying's case, some of the charges of some business, in the middle (whether) have evidence to sue him, all vague." She said: "Britain should speak more, and I am also glad that they finally speak. But will it affect Li Zhiying better when sentenced, I really have no confidence. "

At the same time, the Chinese government responded strongly to the British report. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference on the 26th that the British party "seriously violates the principles of international law and the basic principles of international relations." She said: "Britain has no sovereignty, governance, and supervision power to Hong Kong after the return. The Chinese government's legal basis for governing Hong Kong is the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law on Hong Kong, and it is by no means a" Sino -British Joint Statement "."

What is" interfered in the internal affairs'? China not only violates the "Joint Declaration", but also violates its own basic law. . The United Kingdom is still too gentle. "

The Hong Kong government also stated to the British "Hong Kong Issue Half -year Report" "strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition."

Hong Kong affairs that is purely in the Chinese internal affairs. "However, Yuan Gongyi believes that Li Zhiying, as a Hong Kong person holding a British passport, hired foreign lawyer agents in accordance with laws and regulations to avoid unsuccessful trials, which is exactly legitimate.
