<p>As the dam has been defeated, the large land of the downstream large land is flooded. The area located on the other side of the Hermuson (east bank) is actually a restricted area for the Ukrainian armored forces.</p>
<p><strong> After an important Ukrainian dam occupied by Russia, thousands of people are evacuating from the lower reaches of the dam. Russia and Ukraine accused each other the culprit that bombed the dam. </strong></p>
<p>Ukrainian President Zeleguski said that after the dam of Novakakhovka was destroyed, 80 towns and villages may be overwhelmed, and he blamed Russia. The rolling river is pouring into the De Nieberg River, and it is said that it has constituted a fatal risk of floods in Hermone.</p>
<p>Russia denied destroy this dam that was controlled and accused of being caused by Ukraine shells.</p>
<p>Kiev and Moscow have accused each other on the dam, and the claims of the two parties have not been confirmed by the BBC.</p>
<p>The KakhovkareServoir, located in the huge KakhovkareServio, is vital to the region. The reservoir provides water for local farmers and residents, and also provides water sources for Zaporizhzhia Nuclear PowerPlant. It is also an important channel for water transmission to southern Crimea occupied by Russia.</p>
<p>Ukraine State -owned Hydropower Management Institutions warned that the peak period of the downstream of the reservoir discharge on Wednesday (June 7), local time. Subsequently, it will enter a "stable period", and the water level is expected to drop rapidly within four to five days.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian dam was exploded and urgently withdrew tens of thousands of people, Russia and Ukraine denied the launch of the attack</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/_130015404_graphic_flood.png" />However, all circles have paid attention to the situation of how unexpectedly influenced the largest Zapolo nuclear power plant in Europe, because the nuclear power plant uses the water in the reservoir to cool down.</p>
<p>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the situation of the place is controlled, and the nuclear security "currently there is no immediately risk."</p>
<p>The video showed that the flood was over the dam, several towns have been flooded, and residents in downstream areas are forced to escape by bus and train.</p>

<p>The video showed that the flood was over the dam, several towns have been flooded, and residents in downstream areas are forced to escape by bus and train.</p>
<p>Ukraine Deputy Chief Captain Litvinova said on Ukraine TV that about 40,000 people need to evacuate, of which there are 17,000 people in the Western Region of the Denber River controlled by Ukraine and 25,000 people in the eastern region controlled by Russia.</p>
<p>Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Cryenco, who also spoke on Ukraine TV, said that about 1,000 people have been evacuated so far, and 24 settlements have been flooded. He accused Russia of artillery in the southern part of Hermuson. The region was evacuating personnel and warned that the exposed mines will bring danger after the water level rises.</p>
<p>A resident named Andre lived in a area near the dam. The dam was occupied by the Russian army shortly after Russia launched a comprehensive invasion in February 2022. He expressed his believe in Russia to "flood" his city.</p>
<p>In the Ukraine -controlled Helson, a lady named Su Demira is loading her items, including a washing machine to a trailer connected to a classic car. She said, "We are afraid of floods. We are moving things to high."</p>
<p>She urged the Russian army to "drive out ... they shot at us. They are drowning us and doing other bad things."</p>
<p>Another resident of the city also told BBC that he was worried that "everything here would be destroyed." He said: "All creatures, including humans, will be drowned by the water." He pointed at the nearby nearby. Houses and gardens signal.</p>

He said that the authorities would send 53 evacuation bus to send people with two settlements and two nearby settlements to safe areas. He added that the water level has risen to more than 11 meters, and some people have been taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>Officials assigned by the Kremlin said that the town Oleshky was also affected by serious floods.</p>
<p>The Kazkova Dibrozoo, located on the banks occupied by Russia, have been completely overwhelmed. The zoo said on its Facebook page that 300 animals in the park have died.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the dam was destroyed in the early morning of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence department accused Russia of intentionally bombing the dam.</p>
<p>This statement seems to be reasonable because Moscow may worry that the Ukrainian army will use the road on the dam to enter the territory they control, as part of the counterattack operation.Image source, getty images</p>

<p>Moscow may worry that the Ukrainian army will use the road on the dam to enter the territory controlled by Russia as part of the counterattack.</p>
<p>For Moscow, which is eager to keep in the southern Ukraine, this dam has become a problem that needs to be faced. Just like last fall, the Ukraine's road and railway bridge on the lower reaches of the dam, successfully isolated the Russian troops around Hermone, Moscow may decide to destroy the dam to stop Ukraine's counterattack.</p>
<p>They are worried that Ukraine's counterattack may come from multiple directions.</p>
<p>However, a Russian official claimed that Ukraine attacked the dam in order to divert the attention of the failure of its counterattack and deprive Crimea (in 2014 by Russia's illegal swallowing) freshwater supply.</p>
<p>It is always expected that Ukraine will launch a major counterattack. Kiev said that it would not start a warning offensive in advance, but recently, Ukrainian military activities have increased signs that the outside world is considered a counterattack may have begun.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Zerrenji said that the damage of the dam will not prevent Ukraine. He published a film conversation saying: "We will still liberate our land."</p>
<p>Earlier that day, Zelei held an emergency meeting of the National Security and National Defense Commission to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>Ukraine Deputy Minister of Defense, Hannamalia, said on Monday (June 5) that the Ukrainian army's offense around Bachurut's "enemy activity center" made progress. But she did not say whether the counterattack operation had begun.</p>
<p>In fact, Bachurut has been the center of fierce fighting for several months. It has little strategic value, but has important symbolic significance in Kiev and Moscow.</p>
<p>Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, a consultant of the Ministry of Defense, Yurisak, accepted an exclusive interview with BBC Fourth Radio "Today" that according to their telephone eavesdropping, Russia hopes to target more dams. He said: "They actually called for the bombing of more Dieberg dams."</p>
<p>Ukraine referred to the dams of the dam as an ecological disaster, and said that the 150 tons of engine oil leaked into the Dieber River. Ukraine Hydropower said that a power station related to the dam has been "completely destroyed ... the water conservancy structure has been washed away."</p>

<p>All circles are very concerned about how accidents affect the largest Zapolo nuclear power plant in Europe, because the nuclear power plant uses the water in the reservoir to cool down.</p>
<p>International leaders blame the explosion on Russia, and some people call it the crime of war. British Prime Minister Sonak (Xin Weicheng) said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam, it means that people will witness "Russia's aggression has reached a new low."</p>
<p>NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg criticized that the damage of the dam once again shows the brutal behavior of Russia in the Ukrainian war, while the European Council Chairman Michelle said that he was shocked by the "unprecedented attack".</p>
<p>The Geneva Convention clearly prohibits the target of dams in the war because it is dangerous to civilians.</p>
<p>In the past, a dam in Ukraine was destroyed and caused a disaster: in August 1941, with the advancement of the Germans, the Soviets quickly retreated in Ukraine. The military commander decided to destroy the bridge and dam of Zapolo to prevent the enemy from crossing the Dieber River. Civilians are not warned, and historians estimate that at least 3,000 people are killed.</p>
<h3>Is the dam of the dam?</h3>
<p>Professor Trysey Jendan from the Department of National Defense Research at King London said that the dam is a civil infrastructure and is usually not an effective military goal. She said: "In the armed conflict law, assuming that there is a Ukrainian military unit in the dam. Then, Russia can regard it as a military goal. But as far as I know, the situation is not the case."</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Elis, executive director of the International Lawyers Association, said: "Out of military needs, civil targets such as dams must be attacked; This will violate international law. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png" /></p>
<h3>Analysis: Who will benefit from the damage of this dam?</h3>
<p><strong> BBC reporter Frank Gardner </strong> **</p>
<p>In the case of Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of the shot of the dam, people remind people of the "Beixi" natural gas pipeline explosion of the unsolved mystery last year.</p>
<p>In these two cases, the West immediately doubted to Russia. But Moscow responded twice: "It's not us. Why do we do this? This harms our own interests!"</p>
<p>Now, in the case of the Carthova dam being penetrated, Russia can point out two damage to its own interests.</p>
<p>The floods of the downstream land forced Russia to evacuate the army and civilians eastward, away from the bank of the River River and the wide Timber River. This will provide some limited relief for Holson's residents, and they have always lived under Russia's shelling and missile attacks.</p>
<p>Secondly, this may affect the water supply of Crimea occupied by Russia. Crimea is a drought peninsula that depends on a canal near this dyke.</p>
<p>Since Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, the peninsula has become a land defense of heavy soldiers, and both Russia and Ukraine claim to have sovereignty.</p>
<p>However, the Khahofka Dam's damping needs to be placed in the wider context of the Ukrainian war, especially when the Ukrainian summer counterattack has shown that it has begun.</p>
<p>[Video-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65831170/P0FNC5CG/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65831170/p0fnc5cg/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/p0fnc60j.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>The Russian and Ukraine War: a counterattack that may change the war</p>
<p>In order to make this counterattack successful, Ukraine needs to break Russia's suppression of a large land occupied last year. This land connects Crimea with the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine. If Ukraine can find a strategy and successfully break through the Russian army defense line in southern Suparzhia, and divide the area into two, then Crimea can beolate and achieve a major strategic victory.</p>
<p>But since the full invasion of February last year, Russia has learned a lot of lessons: Moscow saw the map, calculated the most likely places for Ukraine to attack, and built a truly powerful defense work in the past few months, blocking Ukraine's towards the direction of Ukraine. Any action of Azahai's offense.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/_130011905_dam.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>As the dam has been decided, the large land of the downstream is flooded.</p>
<p>Now, as the dam has been defeated, the downstream large land is flooded, and the area located on the other side of Hermuson (east bank) has actually become the restricted area for the Ukrainian armored forces.</p>
<p>There is a historical note that Russia does have similar behaviors in this area. In 1941, the Soviet army bombed the dam on the same one of the Diebero River to block the forward of the Nazis. Thousands of Soviet citizens were said to be killed in subsequent floods.</p>
<p>However, the current bottom line is, no matter who has broken through the Carhofka dam now, it has disrupted the strategic chessboard in southern Ukraine and forced the two parties to make a series of major strategic adjustments. The next step in.</p>

<p>Today, Yan Bingtao will be banned for 5 years.</p>
<p>Zhao Xintong, 25, was banned for 20 months. Before the ban, he was the world's highest Chinese player.</p>
<p>After the verdict was announced, he issued a "apology statement" on social media in the early morning of Wednesday, saying that he was "shame to China Snooker."</p>
<p>He claimed that he was "dull and blocked" because of his long -standing overseas life, "blindly" imitating others to choose to "pass the time" with gambling. Essence</p>
<p>"I paid a heavy price for the stupid behavior at the time, and spent every day regret." Zhao Xintong said in a statement.</p>
<p>He also said that after the ban, he accepted the psychological consultation assistance provided by the World Professional Billiards and the Snooker Association, saying that he would "return to the stadium with a better image."</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Chinese Snoors players who have quickly risen in recent years have been involved in the fake ball scandal -2018, Chinese players Yu Delu and Cao Yupeng were held for 10 years, 9 months and 9 months, and respectively. After 6 years of ban, the Chinese Taiwan Association also added a lifelong forbidden race to Yu Delu afterwards. At that time, it was accused of the first time the Chinese Taiwan Association was punished for the first time in history.</p>
<p>The Chinese media had previously reported that the Chinese Billiards Association has noticed that the gambling behavior may penetrate into the Chinese player group, and in 2019, the Journey to the British Professional Players led by the famous Snooker Ding Junhui to supervise overseas Chinese professional players overseas Essence</p>
<p>Liang Wenbo, who was involved in the case, was also the Deputy Director of the Association. After the investigation of the case last year, he had been withdrawn the position by the Chinese Taiwan Association.</p>
<p>Some media commented that unlike many sports in China, Snooker professional players are not trained and managed by the official system, but are mostly invested and trained by their respective families. It is said that this makes it difficult for the Chinese Taiwan Association to manage the players uniformly.</p>
<p>Snooker history has been banned by many famous players for suspected corruption, including Quinten Hann, Stephen Lee, and so on.</p>

<p>After making a judgment by the World Professional Billiards and the Snooker Association, 10 players could appeal to the penalty decision before June 20."The Association will conduct warning education in the industry and launch a series of measures to carry out anti -gambling counterfeit to the end," said the China Taiwan Association, and said that it would "further increase the management of professional players in Britain."</p>
<p>On the other hand, some experts have pointed out that because China's criminal law has added "organizing the crime of organizing participation in the country (border)" in recent years, it is not ruled out that the players involved in the case may involve criminal crimes.</p>

<h3>Analysis: The punishment measure will play a "strong scarlet" role</h3>
<p>_ ——— BBC Fifth Radio (BBC 5) Snooker reporter Jamie Bladon (<em> _jamie Broughton</em> <em>) </em>) _</p>
<p>The World Professional Billiards and the Snooker Association work hard to investigate this complex case, and they will also be happy with the final punishment decision.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, the organization has shown determination to investigate corruption and has accused anyone who believes in improper behavior.</p>
<p>Snooker has experienced a lot of negative news in recent months, but the punishment of Liang Wenbo and Li Xing's lifelong suspension should be able to play a strong scary role in any player who wants to participate in fake balls.</p>
<p>For many Snooker fans, this case is truly sad why the two largest players in China Yan Bingtao and Zhao Xintong will involve it. Both players are considered potential to become a world champion in the future.</p>
<p>Now people will ask whether Snooker's management agencies can do more work worldwide to educate young players to risk corruption.</p>

<h1>"It's disappointing again": China's foreign trade data in May has dropped sharply</h1>

<p>Time: 2023-06-07T09:55:00Z</p>
<p>Description: The latest import and export data released by the General Administration of Customs of China makes people worry about the growth of China's economic recovery this year. In addition to the continuous increase in exports to Russia, in May, China's exports to ASEAN, the European Union, the United States, Japan, Africa, and Latin America all declined significantly. The soaring inflation, high interest rates and energy prices have all stressed the international demand for the purchase of "Made in China".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65847680/63041869"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T09-55-00Z/63041869_303.jpg" /></a>China's exports fell sharply in May this year.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The weakening of global market demand has led to a significant decrease in China's exports. Today (June 7), the latest statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China show that according to the US dollar, the import and export of China's imports and exports in May this year was US $ 50119 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 6.2%. Among them, the exports were US $ 283.5 billion, a decrease of 7.5%; imports were US $ 217.69 billion, a decrease of 4.5%; the trade surplus was US $ 65.81 billion, narrowing by 16.1%.</p>
<p>China's exports in April also increased by 8.5 percentage points year -on -year. But a month after a month, a sharp decline. The latest import and export statistics have made another worry about China's economic recovery growth this year.</p>
<p>In May this year, China only <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国一季度汽车出口超过日本-俄罗斯成为最大海外市场/a-65668908">export to Russia</a>Continuously increased, an increase of 114.3%, and imports increased by 10.1%year -on -year. In February last year, since Russia invaded Ukraine, China has unswervingly support Russian President Putin, and has never expressed condemnation of Russia's invasion.</p>
<p>In May, China's imports declined for two consecutive months. Although 4.5%decreases less than the expectations of experts, it is very eye -catching. Germany pointed out that this shows that China's domestic market is still weak.</p>
<p>Based on the US dollar, China ’s exports to ASEAN in May fell 15.9%year -on -year, the first time since May 2020.</p>
<p>China's imports from Germany have decreased by 3.8%, and the decline in exports to Germany is even as high as 8.3%. As the second largest trading partner in China, the EU's import and export volume of trade with China is also decreasing. In May, China decreased by 7%to EU exports, and imports dropped slightly by 0.9%.</p>
<p>China's imports and exports to the United States and Japan are also declining. Based on the US dollar, China's exports to the United States in May fell 18%year -on -year and imported from the United States by 9.8%year -on -year. In addition, exports to Africa fell from 49.9%in April to 12.9%, and exports to Latin American decreased from 10.5%to -1.1%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T09-55-00Z/64375290_401.jpg" />The high inflation, the continuous increase in bank interest rates, coupled with the soaring energy prices caused by the Ukrainian war, all pressure on the demand for "Made in China".</p>
<p>China's import and export data in May has been shaded for China's economic growth expectations this year. After China's abandonment of the "Clear Zero" epidemic prevention policy at the end of last year, the economic trend at the beginning of this year showed an optimistic trend. The Beijing side has set up about 5%of the growth goals for this year's economic growth. The economic growth rate in the first quarter of this year achieved 4.5%.</p>
<p>Yan Si, chief representative of the Beijing Representative Office of the German Industry and Commerce Conference(JensHildebrandt)The analysis said: "The latest import and export data indicates that the Chinese economy is still unstable. The local company's expectations of business growth are becoming more and more cautious." He also said: "In view of the current development, the medium -term recovery is more difficult to foresee. "</p>
<p>In April of this year, when China's import and export still realized 7.9%, concerns about the development of China's domestic market have emerged. In April, the [China Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index] announced by the National Bureau of Statistics of China(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/财新pmi上升-中国经济复苏出现不一致信号/a-65790590)(PMI) 49.2%, a decrease of 2.7 percentage points from the previous month. In May, the index further dropped to 48.8, which fell for the third consecutive month and was located in the contraction range for the second consecutive month.</p>
<p>The main reason for China's exports to drop sharply is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球经济增长放缓-广交会交易量未达疫情前水平/a-65553644">weak international market demand</a>Essence The high inflation, the continuous increase in bank interest rates, coupled with the soaring energy prices caused by the Ukrainian war, all pressure on the demand for "Made in China". The total value of China's imports and exports in the first five months of this year was US $ 2.44 trillion, a decrease of 2.8%, of which 6.2%in May in May.</p>
<p>Australian and New Bank analyst Khoongoh said that the latest import and export data is "disappointing again". These data are "concerned about economic growth expectations, and at the same time look forward to more policy support." Some observers speculate that in order to promote economic recovery, the People's Bank of China may be reduced. There are also some opinions that the central bank may soon release the policy news of interest rate cuts.</p>

<h3>"Stay to the door of China's home without thousands of miles"</h3>

<h1>The EU introduced counter -tooling tools to say "no"</h1>

<p>Description: In order to prevent China such as economic coercion and intervene in the political decision -making of EU member states, the European Union is about to launch counter -control tools. Previously, Lithuania agreed to set up a representative office in the country because Lithuania agreed to the establishment of a representative office in the country, and Beijing had imposed large -scale economic sanctions on Lithuania.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65849853/61306037"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T11-53-00Z/61306037_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In the future, if any country interfere with the political decision -making of the European Union and its member states, it will be sanctioned by the EU. On Tuesday, the representatives of the EU Parliament and the government representatives of the member states reached a consensus on a new sanction tool. In the future, if the third country tries to interfere with the political decision of the EU or its member states with improper economic sanctions, the EU will be able to counter the country's improving punitive tariffs.</p>
<p>Other response methods also include restricting the country's direct investment in the European Union and bidding in public projects in the European Union. In addition, the European Union also stated that restrictions on the relevant transactions of the service industry will also become possible sanctions.</p>
<p>The reason why the EU introduced the above countercroof tools was that in the past few years, the EU and its member states have become the target of economic coercion of the EU foreign countries many times. For example, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/立陶宛第一季度对华出口同比下降接近零/a-62141560">China has implemented trade restrictions on Lithuania, and the European Union believes that such restrictions do not meet the relevant provisions of the World Trade Organization, but also have a joint impact on the exports of the EU's internal market</a>Essence It is generally believed that the cause of economic sanctions on Lithuania was that Lithuania had previously upgraded diplomatic relations with Taiwan and allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in the country's capital. This move has caused strong indignation in China, because Beijing has always seen Taiwan Bay as a province in China and does not have an independent state status.</p>
<p>The European Commission stated that the newly introduced counter -tooling tools may have an impact on the EU's future legislation, or at least to avoid the tedious procedures of the EU temporarily opening sanctions. According to the relevant statement, for this purpose, the European Union can introduce additional, discriminatory tariffs, and deliberately delay or refuse to issue permits for specific businesses. Other methods that can be adopted also include additional border inspections and security inspections of goods from specific countries, or resisting goods and investment in specific countries.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T11-53-00Z/63942853_401.jpg" />EU Council Vice Chairman Dongbrovskis: "Anti -Tools will enable us to defend our legitimate rights and interests."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Veatisdombrovskis, vice chairman of the European Commission, who is responsible for economic affairs, said: "This anti -economic stress tool will enable us to firmly defend our legitimate rights and interests." He said, he said, he said, " The final consensus on this counter -tooling tool means that the European Union has taken an important step. East Brovskis emphasized that sanctions should only be used as the last means when they are unsuccessful. It is just a deterrent method. Before taking sanctions, we must first talk with relevant non -EU countries. When the dialogue is unsuccessful, the possibility of mediation, arbitration or judicial trial should also be considered.</p>
<p>Before the anti -economic coercion regulations are officially effective, they need to be approved by the EU Council and Parliament. However, it is generally believed that there is no suspense for the approval of the regulations. The European Commission believes that this new anti -economic stress tool can be officially opened this fall.</p>
<p>At a regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to the EU's "anti -economic stress tool". He said: "First of all, what I want to talk about is about Lithuania's error on the issue of Taiwan -related issues. Our China has repeatedly stated its position. China and the European Union are victims of economic coercion in the United States. The United States and other countries in accordance with the European Union and other countries restrict exported semiconductor production equipment to China. This scientific and technological bullying is seriously impacting the development of the semiconductor industry, which not only harms the interests of China and the EU, but also destroys the rules of multilateral trade rules. , Seriously impact the world economic order. We hope that the European Union and the international community will oppose the economic coercion of the United States. "</p>

Essence The report entitled "The Risk of Underrobe" wrote:</p>
<p>"Whether in Berlin, Brussels, or in Washington, the loss of technical loss has been included in an important agenda. At the Summit of the Seventh Kuchan Group in Japan in mid -May this year, countries for the first time to strengthen protection 'sensitive technology related to national security. 'Reach consensus. Although there was no name in China in the statement, all parties did not declare it.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the risk of spy behaviors, the German Constitution Conservation Bureau has continuously urged high -tech companies to be vigilant when academic exchanges. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国大学帮助习近平实现强军梦/a-61865167">People from the German intelligence circle said: 'In the above -mentioned field, there are still many people who are too naive. '</a>German Internal Affairs Minister Feise(Nancyfaeser)It is said that in order to eliminate spy behaviors, it is necessary to formulate a wide range of protection mechanisms in enterprises and research institutions. 'Only in this way can we discover and stop thorns' attempts in time. '</p>
<p>German politicians responsible for intelligence affairs also believe that Germany still has a lot of work to do in the field of anti -spy fields. Konstantin Vonnottz, the Green Party Chairman of the Federal House Intelligence Supervision Committee, said: 'warnings from intelligence agencies must attract great attention. 'He said that college students from China should not be listed as the subject of suspicion. ""</p>
<p>The "Business Daily" article lists an example of a North German medical technology company being stolen core technology by Chinese "academic exchange personnel". BRUNOKAHL, director of the German Federal Intelligence Agency, also stated that according to China's National Security Law, all Chinese companies and individuals need to bear the obligation to cooperate with information agencies.</p>

<p>"The German Ministry of Internal Political Affairs defines the risk of Chinese spy activities in the field of scientific research as 'high'. China cannot develop the technology required by the country in the middle and long term. The key goal. In view of this, the mechanism of the German Internal Affairs Minister Feisse hopes to prevent Chinese spy behavior can be improved accordingly: ['For me, there are three priority options in terms of security protection: discovering risks, resistance to resistance Danger and avoid dependence. She said that when Chinese people engaged in specific fields apply for German visas, they need to accept the "further review '.].(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国内政部长要求加强防范来自中国的间谍活动/a-65840153)The Beijing side refutes relevant allegations. The Chinese Embassy in Germany responded to the relevant inquiry of the "Business Daily": 'We resolutely oppose any subjective speculation against the Chinese government and unreasonable unreasonable allegations. 'And said that China has been urging domestic citizens to abide by local laws and regulations and customs. "</p>
<p>Regarding the recreational struggle incident in Yunnan not long ago, the New Zurich News wrote:</p>
<p>"Hanno Schedler, the German Association that threatened the National Association, said that in previous years, the CCP began to accuse the Mosque built by the people of the people over the Arab style. So far, thousands of mosques have been demolished or converted in China. Deller said: "Xi Jinping is very worried that these mosques will become a nest that breeds resistance. In the end, only those governments have been approved by the government, and they are monitored by the government and attracted tourists to survive. '</p>
<p>In addition to Islam, other religions are also under tremendous pressure. The commercialization of Buddhist temples is becoming more and more obvious. The cross in the Church of God's Christian Church was demolished, and the priests who were unwilling to cooperate with the government were suppressed and arrested. Zhang Xunmou, director of the Religious Research Center of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2019, said in 2019: "Adhere to the direction of my country's religious Sinicization '. In other words, the party's understanding of traditional Chinese culture will dominate everything: the diversification of religion and culture will be replaced by a little folk characteristics. "</p>

The British government announced the latest announcement that after investigating all China's "police service stations" in the country, no illegal activities were found, but the "police service station" that emphasized the government's permission was unacceptable and it was known that the Chinese Embassy in the UK in the UK was known to be confirmed by China to be confirmed by China These places have been permanently closed. However, China later had another set of statements to discover the British side discredit China.</p>

<p>The British Security Secretary of State Tomtugndhat (Tomtugndhat) explained the latest investigation of the Chinese "overseas police service station" to Congress on Tuesday (6th) in writing. The statement stated that the British police have visited all Chinese "police service stations" in the UK. There is currently no evidence that these "service stations" represent illegal activities on behalf of the Chinese government.</p>
<p><strong> British government: China </strong> <strong> "</strong> <strong> Police Service Station </strong> <strong>" </strong> <strong> Unacceptable </strong></p>
<p>However, Togen Dart emphasized that these "police service stations" are unacceptable anyway: "These 'police service stations' were established without our approval. How low will make those who leave China and seek safety and freedom in the United Kingdom are worried and scared. This is unacceptable. The Chinese authorities often criticize others to interfere in the internal affairs, but they think they can open up the British government and open it. These do not indicate the origin sites. "</p>
<p>Togen Dart said that the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated to the Chinese Embassy in the UK that the "police service stations" located in the UK are unacceptable and cannot operate in any form. He quoted the response of the Chinese Embassy, saying that all these places had been permanently closed and would be accused of investigating relevant British law.</p>
<p><strong> China said that overseas police station </strong> <strong> "</strong> <strong> does not exist </strong> <strong>" </strong> ** non -governmental organizations rebuked</p>
<p>However, the Chinese Embassy in the UK later issued a statement claiming that the so -called "overseas police station" was a "political lie." Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also denied again at the press conference: "We have already expressed their positions on the relevant issues, and there is no so -called 'secret police station' at all. China urges the British side to respect the facts and stop rendering speculation and discrediting China. Don't create obstacles to Sino -British relations. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000002.png" />The Chinese Embassy in Britain claims that the "Overseas Police Station" is a "political lie.(Screenshot of the official website of the Chinese Embassy in Britain)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/al-06072023110042.html/screenshot-2023-06-07-145910.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Demolition of the "Safeguard Defenders" of China's overseas "police service station", Lauraharth, responded in writing in writing, saying that when the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to their reports in the past, they have always acknowledged the existence of these overseas bases and Clearing their role is to perform "administrative tasks". It has been checked until now, but the Chinese side does not recognize it.</p>
<p>Reporting by party media. At the same time, the official statement of almost all Western democratic government acknowledged the existence and illegal nature of these 'police service stations'. "</p>
<p>Has pointed out that from the British statement, it can be seen that China closes the "police service station" according to the British requirements and also shows that they do exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000004.png" />Laura Harth, Director of SafeguardDefenders.(Associated Press information picture)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/al-06072023110042.html/ap22300329004595.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a></p>
<p>The statement said that these Chinese "police service stations" were accused of assisting Chinese overseas citizens to handle administrative affairs as packaging. In essence, they monitored and harassed Chinese diaspora, and were even used to coerce them to return to China.</p>
<p><strong> Followers: Evidence of illegal or early destroyed </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the failure of the British police to find the evidence of the "police service station" to engage in illegal activities, Zheng Wenjie, the founder of the "British Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Association", believes that the relevant evidence may have been destroyed, and it also shows that the British police's intelligence work has loopholes.</p>
<p>Zheng Wenjie said: "It is possible that these CCP overseas police liaison stations have been exposed by non -governmental organizations, and their behavior has turned low -key, so these things have not been exposed after the police intervene. It was blank, so they couldn't have the relevant information immediately before the matter was exposed. "</p>
<p>As a Hong Kong person approved by the British government, Zheng Wenjie believes that people who exile in the UK and avoid the persecution of the Chinese government have reasonable reasons to worry that the Chinese "overseas police station" will be abused to suppress and monitor the dissidents.</p>
<p>For the different claims of the British government and the Chinese side, Zheng Wenjie believes that it may be that the Chinese Embassy admits to the existence of the "police service station" to the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in private. According to the consistent practice, the allegations are denied in public. However, he emphasized that the Fuzhou Police Station and overseas Chinese groups of China have released public news about the "police service station" and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Luke Depulford, Executive Director of the "Transnational Parliament Alliance of China" (IPAC), told this station that the British government clearly pointed out that the Chinese "police service station" is illegal and major measures; He was disappointed that he was disappointed that these "police service stations" may have been removed early after being exposed in September last year.</p>
<p>He believes that the British government should expand the scope of investigation in the next step and investigate China's united front work in the UK.</p>

<p>At the same time, the military competition between the United States and the Chinese warships in the Taiwan Strait has also become increasingly upgraded, and the conflict of gunfire and fire in almost. Last Saturday (June 3), USS Chung-Hoon, the U.S. Millet destroyer, and the Royal Canadian Navy's naval naval defenders, HMCSMONTREAL, passed the Taiwan Strait to perform the task of defending freedom of navigation. However, during the sailing of the US and Canadian warships, the warships of the Chinese People's Liberation Army suddenly cut the front of the Yunyun at close range. The two sides were only 140 meters apart, which almost caused a crash incident.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of crashing in the U.S. and the Chinese warships, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin stated at a regular press conference this Monday that "the United States provoked", and China was only dealt with in accordance with the law. Wang Wenbin said: "The actions adopted by the Chinese army are necessary measures to deal with provocations related to the country, and they are completely reasonable and legal and safe.

Scholars: Chinese Credit International Marine Law Specification </strong></p>
<p>Regarding China claiming that "the Taiwan Strait is the China Sea, the two warships almost collided because the US warships are provocative", and Raymondkuo, a political scientist of the US Defense Research Consultation Institution Rand Tell reporters that China's claims have fundamental mistakes: "China has a strange understanding of international law, so China's interpretation is often refuted by the United Nations Marine Arbitration Court Committee. It is said that the Taiwan Strait is a channel for international navigation, so I don't think China can occupy and accept the Taiwan Strait as myself. "</p>
<p>Johndotson, deputy executive director of the Washington Think Tank Global Research Center (GTI), also said that China ’s understanding of international law has made international unacceptable:“ China ’s (for sea power) is decoupled from the international marine law. Most of them are based on nationalism, China ’s grievances about history, and their own imagination of their rights ... ... Even if we assume that Taiwan is really Chinese territory (the United States does not recognize this), the Taiwan Strait will not become China's territorial sea."</p>

<p>李尚福指出，中国对“无害通过”不持异议，但是“我们必须防止利用自由航行、无害通过行霸权之实的企图”，同时，李尚福也建议美国及其盟友照顾好“自己的领空和领海”，不要在他国领地附近活动。</p>
<p>而美国国防部长奥斯汀(LloydAustin)则同样在香格里拉安全对话会议上表示，美国在中国的“霸凌或胁迫面前绝不会退缩”，美国将继续在台湾海峡和南中国海定期航行与飞行，以捍卫国际海域与空域的航行自由。</p>
<p>此前，奥斯汀曾多次提议与李尚福在香格里拉对话会场进行双边会谈，不过中方却始终未对美方邀约做出回应。</p>

<p><strong> The US -China recent military conflict has increased </strong> <strong> Scholars: It should be related to Kangda's visit to China </strong></p>
<p>At the same time, the situation of the Sino -US military conflict is increasing. The U.S. Indo -Pacific Command announced a video at the end of May. The video shows that Chinese military planes intercept an American reconnaissance aircraft over the South China Sea on May 26. The Indo -Pacific Command of the United States pointed out that this was "unnecessary radical movement", and US reconnaissance aircraft at that time were carrying safety and routine flights.</p>
<p>Regarding the increasingly risky military behavior of China in the Taiwan Strait recently, Guo Hongjun believes that this may also be related to Kangda's visit to China: "China wants to pretend to be a conflict, the purpose is to retreat in the United States. I don't think Beijing I sincerely hope to start a war. It does not want the United States to retaliate, but it wants to convey to the United States. This is my territory and this is my waters' signal, especially the US State Department of Asia -Pacific Affairs Assistant Secretary of State is visiting China. "</p>

<p><strong> Will the Taiwan Strait wipe the gun due to military accidents? Scholars: Unlikely </strong></p>
<p>The outside world is worried that there are more and more military operations in the Taiwan Strait of the United States, China, and Taiwan, which also increases the risk of accidents that cause the gun to get angry. In this regard, Zheng Zhexuan analyzed that the possibility of upgrading the two sides of the Taiwan Strait because of military accidents is not very likely: "I think the possibility of evolution from military accidents into a comprehensive war in the short term is very low. I am more worried that this will create a diplomatic crisis, so Like the middle and US military aircraft collided in Hainan Island in 2001. "</p>
<p>Weng Luo, an associate professor of the Department of Political Department of Sam Houston State University in Texas, analyzed: "In fact, it is not accidental, but the political decision behind it. The possibility of wiping guns and getting angry is not high. However, if political considerations operate cross -strait issues, the possibility of crisis will increase. In 2024, Taiwan and the United States will enter the presidential election. Interest, I am afraid it is the key variable of stable situations on both sides of the strait. "</p>

<p>Even from the perspective of the long -term period since the reform and opening up, the current situation is not unusual.

Under multiple pressures such as debt expiration, deterioration of financing environment, and shrinking performance, large -scale public market debt defaults have occurred in large -scale public private housing companies. In recent years, the major event in the real estate market this year is not the "broken soul" news of the housing price of the Hangzhou West Lake Bridge. Instead, it is in the large A market. As the price of real estate sectors continues to go down, many real estate companies are on the verge of export. On the evening of May 23, ST Taihe announced that as of May 23, the closing price of the company's stock was less than 1 yuan for twelve consecutive trading days. According to relevant regulations, if the company's stock closing price is less than 1 yuan/share for 20 consecutive trading days, the company's shares will be terminated by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. ST Taihe is not the first delisting housing company, nor is it the last one.</p>
<p>Listed companies delisted, and they suffered a lot of investors, as well as financial institutions that climbed high branches of listed companies. Bank loans, etc. are an important channel for real estate development enterprises to obtain financing. The explosion and delisting of housing companies, the twisted cable of the huge debt chain, will directly settle the bank and hurt the bank's asset quality. Recently, data released by many listed banks show that the adverse rate of real estate loans has increased significantly. As of the end of 2022, the number of non -performing loans of the real estate industry of the six major state -owned banks totaled 197.76 billion yuan, of which the non -performing rate of real estate loans of four banks exceeded 4%. In the first half of this year, the market environment has not improved, and this number will continue to rise. Recently, Minsheng Bank responded to the Shanghai Stock Exchange's inquiry letter that the bank's balance on public real estate was 36.3344 billion yuan, accounting for 8.77%of the total loan. As of the end of 2022, the balance of non -performing loans to public real estate was 15.545 billion yuan, and the non -performing loan ratio was 4.28%. In order to prove that the change in the quality of the real estate assets of the bank is consistent with the trend of the overall changes in the same industry, and the response also lists the poor real estate loan in the industry in detail.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-08T-18-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />Five rulings on same -sex marriage in all parts of Japan have been released. Although there is no court ruling to give damage compensation, there are different judgments that do not allow Japanese sex to be unconstitutional. Japan is the only country in the seven major industrial groups (G7) that does not have the combination of homosexuality.</p>
<p>Kato Kato, a lawyer who filed a lawsuit in Sapporo, said that these judgments gave activists a hint of hope, because all courts agreed to disclose legislation to publicly recognize same -sex partners and give them the same legal guarantee as heterosexual partners.</p>
<p>The ruling of Fukuoka Prefecture is similar to the previous judgment of Tokyo Prefecture. It is believed that the status quo of the legal system that does not make same -sex couples a partner or family is "constitutional."</p>

He said that he hoped that the flight would not be canceled, and it could be controlled within a few minutes if there were delays.</p>
<p>"If we want to prove that we have prepared to defend this country and the alliance, we must accept this." Gehaz pointed out: "You cannot obtain security guarantee at a price."</p>
<p>However, Matthiasmaas, chairman of the German Air Navigation Services Union (GDF), has different views. He told Dexin News Agency that the exercise "Of course, it will have a huge impact on civil aviation flow."

<h4>terror behavior from the air and sea</h4>
<p>Russia responded to Ukraine's counterattack by strengthening the air raid against civilians.</p>
<p>The posted photos show that the Ukrainian military intelligence headquarters was attacked by several Iranian witnesses in the days in late May in late May.</p>
<p>The General Staff of Ukraine stated that it destroyed all 10 Iskander ballistic missiles launched by the Russian army on June 1st. Three days later, the General Staff said that his troops shot down six KH-101 and KH-555 cruise The four of the missiles and six of the eight witnesses Shenfeng dare to death team.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Air Force said on Tuesday that it shot down all 35 air-fired cruise missiles launched in the middle of the night and said that the KH-101 and KH-555 missiles flew to the capital Kiev.Mariar said, "They are now establishing production, in fact, they are supplemented by their missile inventory. With this motivation, they cannot add so much that they have already consumed, but they supplement them."</p>
<p>These numbers seemed to confirm their claims. The Ukrainian military said it destroyed 85 missiles and 169 drones over Kiev in May, setting a historical record.</p>
<p>However, the largest incident in the war in recent weeks occurred on Tuesday. The Russian army occupied the Dieberka Hydropower Dam on the Dieberg River.</p>
<p>Ukraine said that the occupation army attacked the dam through explosives in the turbine room, and the General Staff of Ukraine stated that "they blew up the internal structure of the Khahofka power plant."</p>
<p>About 60,000 people lived in the flooding area, and 3,000 people have been evacuated.</p>
<p>Mariar said that Russia means "the process of preventing Ukraine's defense forces from evacuating and transferring the public's attention from events that occur from the Belgo Rhoda region."</p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov accused Ukrainian militants from destroying the dam because "the Ukrainian armed forces did not achieve their goals in large -scale offensive operations."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-08T02-44-54/1-1686192129.png" />The Russian and Ukraine F-16 fighter Ukraine is promoting the fourth-generation Western supersonic fighter, including the US F-16 to help it fight Russia.</p>
<h4>F-16 fighter</h4>
<p>Zeleiski said he received a commitment to provide F-16 jet aircraft during the meeting during the European Political Community Summit.</p>
<p>Ukraine President Zelei said, "I have got some opinions on this number from some of our European partners -it is very powerful, and I am very happy to receive information from some countries."</p>
<p>The Dutch Prime Minister Mark Lutch said that the alliance composed of the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain, and Belgium will start training Ukraine pilots to drive F-16 fighters.</p>
<p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistoris said that Germany would decide whether to send a F-16 fighter to Ukraine within two weeks. Check what is possible and what we want and what we can do. "</p>
<p>The Australian Financial Review said that after the United States approval, Australia is sending 41 Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18 Big Hornet fighters with the United States to negotiate with the United States.</p>
<p>Ukraine Minister of Defense Oleksey Pitzonikov said Australia may announce a military assistance plan against Ukraine in July.</p>
<p>Ukraine said that it takes at least six months to train pilots. Therefore, the F-16 fighter will not play a role in the current counterattack, which indicates that there will be more intense ground battles in the future.</p>
<p>US National Security Consultant Jack Shalvan told the Farteda Zakaria of the United States Cable Television News Network, "We really believe that this counterattack will make Ukraine recapture strategic territories," but he did not say that this would be this. It is the last blow to Russia.</p>
<p>Crumrych, who is currently the vice president of security consulting company Global Guardian, agreed to this, saying, "We still have a few years."</p>
<p>Crumryi said, "What Ukraine is doing is to continue pressure," he added, "Do not try to capture Crimea tomorrow, Russia's offensive will collapse at its own weight. This is not possible continuous."</p>

<p>WeChat has become one of the communication or payment tools of users in most Chinese and even other parts of the world. Taiwan ’s online R &amp; D personnel, a master's degree in the University of Science and Technology of China, recently demonstrated the situation of WeChat's 24 -hour monitoring of WeChat in a video. The video was circulating in WeChat this week, triggering many netizens' security concerns about their own WeChat chat.</p>
<p>Ah Huan said that some users reported that WeChat occupied 1 G space in its computer. At first, Ah Huan felt that this was fine, but it was not simple to find a problem. He explained: "This G space turned out to be a bunch of encrypted log files, which greatly triggered my curiosity. Under normal circumstances, some logs of software occupation of the disk Look? The key is my own computer, but you do n’t let me see it. It really ca n’t say it. The most scary is that WeChat may upload these files. "</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah Huan said that he used the same Apple laptop and testing tools as other technical personnel, and opened his computer WeChat disk but found a problem.</p>
<p>He said: "Because we want to see what files did WeChat read and write in the background, we chose the file monitoring function. After opening, we chose the monitoring program and then open the monitoring recording function. During this period, our WeChat software can be able to Keep silent in the background. After about five minutes, we stopped the monitoring recording function. At this time, we saw the data on the computer on the computer in the panel below. Related operation. "</p>
<p>Programmer Ah Huan said that after fast filtering the keyword of XLOA, after opening the Xloa file: "The show is a bunch of garbled code, which has been encrypted. We seem to have not operated WeChat. Why are these log files generated? After a long time of observation, about three to eight minutes on my computer, this file will increase by about 30KB. This feeling is really uncomfortable. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T02-47-00-04-00/000002.png" />A Yan said that these encrypted data are updated every three to eight minutes.

<p>However, most users do not have Ah's professional skills and cannot judge whether personal computers and mobile phones have been invaded. Mr. Cai, a WeChat user, told this station that WeChat occupies a larger space than other applications in both mobile phones and computers, and most users know about WeChat collecting user data, but for the convenience of use.</p>
<p>He said: "My mobile phone has more than 500 G memory, and now WeChat accounts for more than 200 G. I delete WeChat every time after a period of time. Because people are mainly obtaining information through WeChat now. I have accidentally sent some pictures in the circle of friends now, and I basically do not speak at other times. "<strong> WeChat users are worried about data being monitored </strong></p>
<p>Public welfare person He Peirong told this station that she learned from a programmer that mobile phones using WeChat are often used as databases to store personal mobile activity information. She said: "I also found that WeChat occupies a very large memory space, and I can't delete it on a mobile phone. After I find this problem, two mobile phones are available all year round, one uses WeChat and domestic software on one mobile phone; Use, equipped with foreign apps. "</p>
<p>According to official data released by China, as of December last year, WeChat users reached about 1.3 billion. But people have many concerns about WeChat security, the main reason is data surveillance. Earlier reports have disclosed that WeChat company cooperates with the Chinese government to conduct data monitoring and provide some sensitive information to government agencies, which has aroused concerns about the public's personal information and remarks.</p>

<h1>The Chinese government tries to erase the "June 4th" massacre, but we must not forget</h1>
<p>Creator: 纪思道</p>

<p>Description: The "June 4th" became a taboo in China, and the Tiananmen incident has fallen into a "struggle for memory and forgetting". But history cannot be wiped out. One day, the truth will be seen again, and the hero will be praised. Jeff Widner/Associateed Press In June 1989, someone held a photo on Chang'an Street, Beijing, and they said it was the deceased who sacrificed in the violent suppression of Tiananmen Democratic protesters.</p>
<p>Images: ["<a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/08/opinion/07Kristof-1/07Kristof-1-master1050.jpg">07Kristof-1-m...</a>"]</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-08T02-49-27-08-00/07Kristof-1-master1050.jpg" />Throughout my decades of reporting career, one of the most painful experiences is that Beijing in 1989 witnessed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to use war weapons to a large number of non -incoming democratic protesters.</p>
<p>Therefore, a few days ago, the massacre of the city ushered in the 34th anniversary, the Chinese government's <a href="https://tiananmen-trolls.doublethinklab.org/en/">defender</a>Resolutely denying that this was shocked. To make matters worse, I found that I became one of the witnesses they cited.</p>
<p>All this explains that the Chinese government is trying to rewrite history, so it is necessary to refute, saying that I am from June 3rd to 4th, 1989, the terrible night <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/world/crackdown-beijing-troops-attack-crush-beijing-protest-thousands-fight-back.html">see</a>What.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 3rd, when the government sent at least about 200,000 troops to enter the capital into the capital, this democratic movement in China has lasted for seven weeks, and students who occupied Tiananmen have won widespread support.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>When the army arrived, I was on Tiananmen Square, and they opened a fire to my crowd. I hid any bunker I could find and watched the People's Republic of China kill for a few hours of killing their sons.</p>
<p>Government supporters said protesters used violence. This is not completely fake: this democratic movement has always been peaceful, but that night, the angry civilians threw brick stones to the troops, and committed a few scattered soldiers. I also saw the two armored troops ignited by their own burning bombs.</p>
<p>But only the army had guns, so the situation of the night was not against the two armies, but a massacre.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to exaggerate the degree of cruelty. A student who was studying in Japan returned to China that night. He got into the car from the airport, but the taxi could not pass Chang'an Street. After getting out of the car, he tried to walk over, and as a result, he played in the back. An acquaintance we know, a teenage child in the family ride a bicycle to work on the morning of June 4, did not approach Tiananmen or any protesters at all. As a result, the soldiers were shot and killed.</p>
<p>My wife and I (also a journalist colleague of the Times) <a href="https://www.kristoffarms.com/team">Wu Jiefang</a>Desperate use of all relationships and want to know the number of deaths in various hospitals in Beijing. Our estimate at the time was that the number of people killed in the capital was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/21/world/a-reassessment-of-how-many-died-in-the-military-crackdown-in-beijing.html">400 to 800</a>Thousands of people were injured between people.</p>
<p>At that time, I learned some important things: the victim would lie with the victim. After experiencing any extremely unfair things, we often do not trust the oppression, and at the same time give the oppressed to more tolerance and understanding. But in fact, holding a doubt about all parties is cautious, because when a person survives in the atrocities, he will naturally respond to anger. This anger either causes more anger or cause them to hear the way of hearing as his own eyes. What you see.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Westerners are too easy to trust; the British ambassador at that time was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html">Telegraph</a>In China, at least 10,000 people were killed. The New York Times reproduced a description of the monument of the monument of the students who was reported by the students in Tiananmen. The Times subsequently published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/13/world/turmoil-china-tiananmen-crackdown-student-s-account-questioned-major-points.html">My response</a>It means that there is no slaughter in that position in the square -after the heroic musician Hou Dejian negotiated fiercely with the officer, the students near the monument were allowed to leave. The shot location is located in Chang'an Street north of Tiananmen. The army is still closer to the west and many other places.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Chinese government denied that Beijing's massacre was based on my article to a certain extent. They hinted that I had reported that there was no massacre no matter where they had. I want to ensure that history has been accurately recorded, but it is used to promote the false fabrication of the Chinese government, which is crazy.</p>
<p>This week, I talked to a Chinese journalist in the United States. He said that these denials on social media are outside, and China generally does not appear in China.</p>
<p>"In China, this denial is not allowed," he said. "Who knows if you deny this matter?" Chinese intellectuals are very good at <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2023/06/folk-rock-band-slap-melds-ming-dynasty-fiction-with-shrewd-social-satire/">ironic</a>The witty tone repeated the official rhetoric.</p>
<p>Therefore, in China, the government's handling of this topic is not about the history of the official version, but to suppress all discussions. This incident has become a taboo that no one can mention. Hong Kong was the treasure trove of memory of the Democratic Movement of Tiananmen, but China shattered the spirit of the city and imprisoned independent thinkers, such as publishers and democratic activists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/16/jimmy-lai-editors-from-around-the-world-call-for-release-of-hong-kong-media-mogul">Li Zhiying</a>Essence</p>
<p>Overall, the effect of Chinese rewriting history is good, partly because it is the choice of wording. In Chinese, the Communist Revolution in 1949 is called "liberation". The Korean War was "the War of Resistance to the United States and aid the DPRK". From 1959 to 1962, the most serious famine in history was caused by the "three years of natural disaster. "" ".</p>
<p>advertiseOf course, many countries have problems with distortions. Movement to the Robinian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/genocide-myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh.html">race extinction</a>Previously, Myanmar denied their existence and called them illegal immigrants. Saudi Arabia was decorated with my friend, the Washington Post columnist Jamille Kashuji. Even the United States is no exception, about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/us/desantis-florida-social-studies-textbooks.html">History Course</a>Cultural warfare with historical narratives abound.</p>
<p>"Whoever controls the past will control the future," George Orwell wrote in "1984".</p>
<p>However, Orwell may be too pessimistic, because in Poland, Romania, Mongolia, Indonesia, South Korea, and Taiwan, I see the buried history eventually see the day, just like Chinese idioms, as "springing after the rain", and there are many emergence of "after the rain". Essence In Taiwan, the slaughter of protesters in 1947 became taboos; now there is a park that commemorates the victims.</p>
<p>I believe that one day China will also praise those heroes in 1989. At the same time, what we can do is to try to respect the truth of chaotic and subtle, and still hiding the mystery, so as to make my own force in the so -called "memory and forgetful struggle" of Czech writer Milan Kundera Essence</p>

The strong smoke across the border, forcing millions of Canadians and Americans to stay indoors, and a large part of the two countries became dark.</p>
<p>This year, more than 400 fires occurred in Canada, and the fire had burned about 39,000 hectares of forests -officials said that this was [10 times more than 10 times more] in the same period last year.(https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/07/us/canada-wildfires-air-quality-smoke#an-unusually-large-number-of-fires-are-burning-in-canada)——The thick smoke on the east coast of the United States has been rolling from New York to Washington Special Economic Zone, and has been west to Minnesota.</p>
<p>In Canada, which is famous for picturesque and orderly, out of control has triggered anxiety of people across the country. In a huge and scattered country, fire protection work is managed by provincial -level, wildfires make fire resources tense, and the global warming has exacerbated the wildfire season, making coordination work more difficult.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, in the Canadian capital Ottawa, the strong haze shrouded over the Gothic building of Parliament and the Canadian parliament building, which made people feel that the entire country has been surrounded.</p>

<p>Canada wildfires also spread to the United States. On Wednesday, smoke shrouded the Skyrim in New York City and turned the outline of the skyscraper into a ghost -like silhouette.</p>
<p>Climate research shows that more and more and more fierce fires occur in Canada are mainly due to high temperature and drought related to global warming.</p>
<p>Canada has the world's largest complete forest ecosystem. Many areas of the country have recently experienced drought and high temperatures, which may make trees easier to get angry, and make any other substances at the bottom of the bottom of the prince, pine needle, and forest ground more dry. They will hit the fire when the fire sweeps the forest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/us/dixie-fire-what-to-know.html">Wildfire expert</a>Seeing signs of climate change from dry, hot, and longer fires, this makes these fires more extreme.</p>
<p>In the large area of North America, as the sun was blocked by smoke, the commuters walked on the street wearing a mask, and the school canceled the field teaching project. Stay indoors.</p>
<p>In Canada, wildfires have caused serious casualties, including driving tens of thousands of people. The unpredictability caused by the fire is very high, so the relevant departments of British Columbia are responsible for managing wildfires to warn local residents to prepare emergency luggage and formulate evacuation plans.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, millions of Canadians in Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal woke up and found that most of their cities are shrouded in smoke. The wildfire spreads to some remote provinces that have not been affected by the fire.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said hundreds of soldiers have been deployed across the country to assist the fire extinguishing. "Unfortunately, in the past few years, we have seen that the intensity of extreme weather events is increasing, and the impact on Canadians is also increasing. Essence</p>
<p>Throughout Wednesday, the cities in the northeast of the United States are shrouded in different yellow haze. Like doomsday, it has caused New York people to worry about climate change. · Adams issued a health warning.</p>
<p>In the most affected cities, including Bafafaro and Binfelon in northern New York State. The thick orange clouds have caused abnormal low temperatures in the area, and the situation in the entire Northeast region has also deteriorated. Schools in New York City and Washington have canceled outdoor activities on the day. In order to protect animals in advance, Philadelphia warned residents to stay indoors in order to protect animals.</p>
<p>The quality of smoke and bad air has also caused various cultural performances and sports events to be canceled, including the Yankees of Brenz and Philadelphia in the Philadelphia. As the smoke penetrated into the theater in New York City, the audience and performers were panicked. Broadway's "Hamilton" and "Hamlet in the Park" "Hamlet" both canceled the performance.</p>
<p>"People don't dare to take a strong smoke," said Rimi Eldus, a 40 -year -old resident of Blanx, for takeaway for Uber Eats and Doordash. "I think it's like the end of the world."</p>

<p>The Minister of Environmental Protection of the New York State Barzel Caigos said that the smog in New York may continue on Thursday and Friday and may last until the weekend. On Wednesday, he told reporters that cleaning up the sky requires God's actions. He said: "We will pray to rain in the north and pray for the change of wind direction."</p>
<p>Most parts of New York State are in air quality and health <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/press/127831.html">early warning</a>In status, the alert will continue until Wednesday night.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, the air quality index in New York City has exceeded 400, which is the worst level since the US Environmental Protection Administration has recorded air quality data since 1999.</p>
<p>Such reading shows that air is unhealthy to everyone, not just a vulnerable group. This is in Jakarta or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html">New Delhi</a>It is typical to wait for the big haze cities, but it is unusual for New York City. For decades, state and federal law in New York have been promoting reduction of emissions and purifying air, especially in the middle and upper -level communities.</p>
<p>The scope and scale of Canadian wildfire highlights the challenge to extinguish the fire in a vast country. The emergency management of wild fire should be responsible for each of the ten provinces and three regions in Canada, but hundreds of fires from all over the country have made local resources stretched, making people once again call for the establishment of national fire protection services.</p>
<p>"It is rare to see so many wildfires in Canada at the same time," said Rob Stevezer, Executive Director of British Columbia's BC wildfire service agency. "In the past, all provinces can share resources, but now, considering the number of fires, this sharing is facing pressure."</p>

<p>New Democratic member Richard Campnings said that under frequent wildfire, national equipment reserves should be established as soon as possible, including the establishment of a firefighting aircraft team, which can be deployed to the disaster area at any time.</p>
<p>In an interview with reporters on Wednesday, Trudeau did not respond to the establishment of a national fire department, but he said that his government was considering establishing a federal disaster response. "We need to continue to ensure that when extreme weather comes, we must do everything possible to ensure the safety of the Canadian people. At the same time, we must ensure that everything may be predicted, protected and reactions before such disasters."</p>
<p>Firefighters from the United States, South Africa, France, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Canadian armed forces are supporting the overwhelming local fire brigade.The health department warns that smoke may cause many symptoms such as tingling, tears to cough, dizziness, chest pain, and palpitations. Some health officials suggested that residents wear protective masks, which aroused painful memories of the popular era.</p>
<p>Hogel in New York State said that the state government will take out 1 million N-95 masks from the reserve and distribute it in public places such as parks and subway stations.</p>

<p>Meteorologists estimate that due to the impact of the style, the smoke in Toronto, the largest city and the financial center in Canada, will deteriorate on Thursday. The Canadian Ministry of Environment reminds residents to prepare for the worse air.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the city's Full -Football Team Ottawa Red Black Team has been trained indoors. In Toronto, the Blue Birds team announced that it will close the stadium ceiling during Wednesday night against the Houston Spaceman.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, in Ottawa, the 72 -year -old hot dog stall owner Pogdan Wozniak said worriedly that his business has always been affected by the weather, but the challenge brought by wildfire is nothing. "Smoke is coming, there is nothing to prepare," he said. "At most, we wear a mask."</p>

<h4>Ukraine denied</h4>
<p>The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Commission of Ukraine Alexese Danilov denied the statement of Russian officials, and they claimed that Ukraine's counterattack had begun.</p>
<p>Dannlov said in an interview with Reuters, "It's not true. When will this start to be determined by our army. When we start to counterattack, everyone will know and see it."</p>
<p>He added that Russian officials mistakenly believed that Ukraine's advancement in certain areas of the front line was the beginning of a major action.</p>
<p>Danilov said that there was no doubt that Russia caused the destruction of the Khahofka Dam on the Hermone River on the Southern Hulmaton area on Tuesday, 6th. The region has been in occupation since the Russian war began.</p>

<h4>Investigation Committee</h4>
<p>In terms of politics, Turkish President Rejap Tidpei Erdogan and Ukrainian President Zelei and Russian President Putin had two calls.</p>
<p>In the contact with President Ukraine, Erdogan called for an international investigation committee on the Cahofka Dam.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zeleiski said that he and Erdogan talked about the humanitarian and environmental consequences of Russia's "terrorist behavior" at the Khahofka Hydropower Station, including the Zapolo Reflection Power Station danger.</p>
<p>In Russia, the Kremlin said that President Vladimir Putin told his Turkish counterpart in the call that Kiev's bombing against the Khahova dam was Western instigasure and said that the move was "barbaric".</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Khahofka Dam was built in the 1950s and has strategic value and is responsible for pulling the water into the North Crimea Canal. The canal starts from southern Ukraine and spans the entire Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Hermuson's pro -Russian local authorities said that the damage of the dam was derived from the 4,000 people in the flood areas, and they were transferred to a temporary asylum. They also announced that due to the explosion of the dam, about 2,700 houses sank in floods.</p>
<p>President Ukraine once again pointed out that the destruction of the Carhofka Dam made hundreds of thousands of residents from getting drinking water.</p>
<p>Satellite images taken by Maxar Technology (Maxar Technology) showed that there was a large flood in southern Ukraine, and the dams and hydropower stations in the region were seriously damaged.</p>
<p>The company said that more than 2,500 square kilometers between the new Carhofka and the Diebero Bay is located in the southwest of Hermuson, overlooking the Black Sea. The image of the area shows that many towns and villages have flooded in the area.</p>
<p>These images show that houses and buildings are flooded in water, and many of them can only see roofs, and gardens, land and infrastructure are also flooded.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T03-51-29-00-00/000183725_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Recently, French President Macron denied the establishment of a office in Tokyo, which aroused widespread attention in the world. According to reports: Macron said at a meeting that NATO should not expand its tentacles to the North Atlantic region, and added: "If ... we promote the expansion of NATO expansion and geographical areas, we will make a big mistake. . "This statement aroused a great uproar, and more importantly, this actually made NATO's establishment office in Tokyo, which became complicated and would not go smoothly.</p>
<p>However, objectively speaking, France does have the ability to put NATO into Asia. On the one hand, this is because the voting method of the North Atlantic Council of NATO's decision -making agencies is the integration principle of the whole; on the other hand, French diplomacy is actually a double foreign minister system, and the French government and French president have each diplomatic team. This reality also makes it not easy for NATO to enter the Asian station.</p>
<p><strong> France has the ability to veto NATO resolution </strong></p>
<p>Judging from the voting methods of the North Atlantic Council of NATO decision -making institutions and the military strength and political status of France in NATO, France is fully capable of rejected the resolution of NATO's entry into Asia.</p>
<p>First of all, from the decision -making voting method of the North Atlantic Council, the decision -making agency implements the principle of "all consistency", that is, the current 30 member states of NATO must agree with any decision -making. Through it, let alone a European country like France. Therefore, fundamentally, this decision -making mechanism, in the context of the current economic and trade relations between China and Europe, has a certain difficulty on issues involving China. Moreover Essence</p>
<p>Of course, if the United States go to NATO to do work, it may play a certain role, but this has little effect on small countries, and most NATO countries are small countries. Because the small country is different from a large country like France, it has a special sense of responsibility for NATO. At the same time, it is considered to consider the problem. You need to look forward to it. Once such a small country is determined to resolutely oppose it, the United States' restriction on this country is not as good as to the big country as much as a big country. Method.</p>
<p>In addition, French military strength is second only to the United States in NATO, and it often ranks first in Europe. It is a very important military force that NATO must rely on Europe. Especially: France emphasizes independence of national defense. It has the most complete national defense industry research and development system in Europe. Most of the key weapons have achieved independent research and development and independent production. Moreover The nuclear force of the trinity composed of airborne missiles is completely independent. In this context, France's right to speak among NATO member states is very large, and this will inevitably bring a broad political impact to France.</p>
<p>A French diplomatic authority once told the author: "Don't look at the secretary -general of NATO every day, he also works (for the United States), but offended France, his work must not be able to fight!"</p>
<p>Therefore, on the issue of the establishment of a office in Tokyo, France's influence is beyond doubt, and it has completely rejected the ability of this action.</p>
<p>As far as France's consideration of NATO's establishment of a office in Tokyo, Chinese factors are undoubtedly very important. According to international media reports, French officials who did not want to disclose their name last Monday said: The French government's hesitation of "NATO to Asia" is largely derived from the relationship between China, because according to commitment, the organization (NATO) should put the organization of this organization (NATO) should put the organization of this organization (NATO) should put the organization of this organization (NATO) should put the organization of this organization (NATO) should put the organization of this organization (NATO). The event is limited to acting in the North Atlantic framework. We cannot ask China to not break the rules of military aid Russia, and on the other hand, we "destroy" to stimulate China.</p>
<p>This conversation explanation: France and China have consensus on the development direction of NATO, and it is likely that there are even "commitments" and agreed.</p>
<p><strong> Countries that implement dual -foreign ministerial system </strong></p>
<p>The reason why NATO's establishment of a office in Tokyo may be stranded, which is also related to the management mechanism of French diplomacy. France actually implemented a system similar to the "Double Foreign Minister" system, that is, the French government has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Minister in charge of diplomatic work; however There is a working team serving this position. This "Presidential Foreign Affairs Consultant" and foreign ministers serve the diplomatic work of the president at the same time. Under this mechanism, the president's control of diplomacy is quite large.</p>
<p>According to French diplomatic authority, the author: "French Presidential Foreign Affairs Consultant" often has a huge impact on French president's diplomacy, especially at the policy level of French diplomacy. Its influence is sometimes greater than foreign ministers, especially in China.</p>
<p>I have met the "French Presidential Foreign Affairs Consultant" that Chinese is better than the author, and obviously feels that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials who accompany him to meet the author are full of respect for the "foreign affairs consultant".</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, said on June 5 with a phone call with French presidential foreign affairs consultant Bona. Fang's independent diplomatic tradition, European countries have also actively conducting conversation with China, and China expresses this. "</p>
<p>The report also said: Wang Yi believes that France will continue to pursue rational and active policies to China, and play a constructive role for the healthy and stable development of China -Europe relations. Thinking about cooperation, less rely on opponents, and work together to provide more stability for the world.</p>
<p>Obviously, "French’ s independent diplomatic traditions "and believe that" France will continue to pursue rational and active policies to China "explains: This" response call "is related to the set off office in Tokyo. China is affecting the French government. Decisions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, China Foreign Minister has not talked to French Foreign Ministers, which shows that China is walking along the orbit of the heads of state of the two heads, which leads to the greater power of "presidential foreign affairs consultant".</p>
<p>International media reports: Sources pointed out that unless NATO's internal opposition to their expansion policies, these very few factions are easily forced to compromise. However, public opinion commented on this: "Even if Macron is unable to change the result in the end, his decisive rejection will at least make NATO's process of establishing an office in Japan more difficult, and it will also convey a clear signal to NATO: if it is more aggressive in Asia in Asia There will be greater opposition to action. At present, not all European powers are willing to follow the United States to enter the Asia -Pacific. "</p>
<p>Obviously, in terms of Sino -French relations, Macron is affecting the "presidential foreign affairs consultant" or they are influenced.</p>

The composition title once rushed to the hot search to become the focus of attention. Some analysts said that during the Xi era, the idea was extremely left, and the thoughts of Xi must enter the mind. There was a quotation of Xi on the college entrance examination composition, which is not worth a fuss.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hx2-04112023070604.html"><strong> Return to personal worship: the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ordered the "Selection of Xi Jinping's Works" </strong></a><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/ql2-09162019065635.html">Chinese Confucian Confucius is integrated into Christian Xi to accept the Ten Commandments of the Bible</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/ec-09012021070212.html">Xi thought into the campus 140,000 "supervisors" to enter primary and secondary schools</a></em>*</p>
<p>According to the Chinese official media CCTV, the Chinese college entrance examination Chinese subject examination has a total of 7 test papers this year. Among them, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin's Chinese test paper independent propositions, composition questions are separated alone; other provinces are uniform The fate system includes 4 sets of national Volume A, Volume B, New Curriculum Standard, Volume II of the New Curriculum Standard, and 4 Chinese composition test questions.</p>
<p>Among them, the contents of the national volume B composition are selected from the two paragraphs of Xi Jinping's general secretary of the Communist Party of China, "Blowing out the lights of others will not make yourself more bright; blocking others will not make yourself further." " One flower is not spring, and the flowers are full of spring. "If there is only one kind of flowers in the world, even if such flowers are beautiful, it is monotonous.</p>
<p>The first paragraph comes from March this year. When Xi Jinping attended the conversation between the Communist Party of China and the high -level dialogue between the Chinese Communist Party, the country emphasized that the country in front should really help other countries to develop. "Blowing out the lights of others will not make yourself more bright; blocking others' way will not make yourself go further." In the second paragraph, when Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the Boao Forum for Asia in 2013, he quoted a paragraph of "The ancient and modern sages".</p>
<p>Cai Shenkun, a commentator from the United States, told this station that in the past few years, the Ministry of Education of China has tried to highlight Xi Jinping's individual in the college entrance examination, and some are special areas. But this year is Volume B, covering a wide range of coverage, accounting for half of the mountains and mountains.</p>
<p>"Candidates are mentally prepared, because Xi Jinping's words are the highest instructions now. High school students must involve his scope at the compulsory stage, especially the composition of Chinese projects, because now focusing on political education education." Cai Shenkun added supplemented Said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 7, Xi Jinping's quotation historically entered the Chinese college entrance examination Chinese test questions. … [Pic.twitter.com/mg124ufcgy&gt;]](https://t.co/Mg124UFcgy)&gt;&gt; - Liberty Asia Radio(@RFA_Chinese)<a href="https://twitter.com/RFA_Chinese/status/1666585321247588354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> June 7, 2023&gt; </a><strong> The second Cultural Revolution comes in different ways </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Xi Jinping and Xi Huning or Wang Huning have openly violated the Constitution and the Party Constitution, and prohibit all forms of personal worship. From this perspective, the second Cultural Revolution is coming."</p>
<p>Chen Pokong mentioned that in April this year, at a meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee at a meeting of studying thoughts, he asked questions to party members and cadres, "Is it true that he has worked in the college entrance examination and the postgraduate entrance examination?" At that time, everyone I felt that the secretary of the provincial party committee was too silent, but I did not expect to turn into reality.</p>
<p>He believes that the Second Cultural Revolution is coming in different ways. "Now, in addition to network management, urban management, agricultural management, and recent cultural management, the college entrance examination examination does not need to be a fuss. It will be more outrageous in the future. This is just the beginning. "" "!</p>
<p>The "Educator" magazine of the Communist Party of China "Guangming Daily" found the middle school teacher to solve the problem. Among them, the teacher Chen Weixian from Beijing reminded the candidates, "The first is that General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasizes that any country pursues modernization, he should uphold it. The concept of unity and cooperation and common development, take the road to discussion and sharing and win -win. "</p>
<p>Another teacher Zhang Qizhou from Henan told the candidates that this question focuses on the fundamental task of "Lide Shuren". With the "Centennial Change Bureau" as the background, it will guide those who are thinking about the country. Times youth.</p>

<p>Chen Pankong believes that if you do not answer the CCP's standards, it will not only have a low score or even zero points, but the dream of the college entrance examination will be destroyed. The college entrance examination is an important pass for young people's lives. It is a major moment when the carp leaps the dragon door. If you write different positions, even if the composition is better, it will still not be able to enter the university. This is a very clear signal. He said, "When speaking according to the party's caliber, he can get a high score to college. Therefore, when the Chinese Communist Party is choosing a college student, he is already carrying out ideological choices. It is for your personal ideological position to let you go to college."Hangzhou.com analyzes the title of Volume B's composition "one flower is not spring". "Today, in the future of various countries, the future and fate of various countries are closely linked, and different civilizations are tolerant and coexist, communicate and learn from each other. It has an irreplaceable role. "</p>
<p>Some public opinion believes that these two sentences are targeted at international relations and even imply that this is aimed at US -China relations. Baidu composition wrote in writing guidance. Students who usually care about national affairs can be cut in with national and world events, and their own views, such as mutual benefit and win -win open strategies, diversity of civilization, building a community of human destiny, and the community of human destiny, and as well as Explore the self -reliance and reference in the development of scientific and technological development with current affairs between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Cai Shenkun interpreted that these two words of Xi Xue show that China is now very confident. It seems that in the world already has the right to speak, challenging the so -called international rules in the United States in the past, "now it is exercising according to its own style."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T05-05-51-00-00/000183186_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>The "economic recession" was still landing. The official data released by the German Federal Bureau of Statistics on May 25 shows that the German economy has fallen into a recession. After the price, seasons and working days were adjusted, Germany fell 0.3%from the previous quarter of this year, a correction of the 0%growth forecast released in the previous month. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Germany's GDP fell 0.5%month -on -month. Here, Germany's GDP declined in two consecutive quarters and fell into the "technical recession" of economists. Germany has temporarily survived the energy crisis in the winter in the past, but unable to stop the economy from continuing to decline.</p>
<p>After 2000, the German economy has experienced two economic contractions under the financial crisis and the new crisis. In 2009, the German economy fell 5.7%and fell 3.7%in 2020. Between the two crises, Germany has experienced ten years of economic prosperity. Today, under the strikes of the epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War, the German economy ushered in a dim prospective prospect.</p>
<p>However, the movement of the boots falling is still smaller than expected. In the summer of 2022, economic experts made a forecast of deep decline, with economic contraction of 4%to 6%. In this sense, Germany has actually alleviated the consequences of energy to Russia and high inflation, and there is no increase in unemployment rate. The worst situation in Germany, which was trapped in a gentle decline, did not make the tide.</p>
<p>Even if Germany launched a series of weight loss plans and energy price braking policies, consumption confidence is still downturn. In the first quarter of 2023, German private consumption expenditure decreased by 1.2%month -on -month, and consumption in food, drinks and shoes, decoration, and car was decreasing. The car can be traced back to this year's electric vehicle purchase subsidies. Government consumption expenditure also decreased by 4.9%month -on -month. However, construction investment and foreign trade have increased. In the first quarter of this year, the exports of goods and services increased by 0.4%month -on -month, especially in synthetic materials and metal products. Imports decreased by 0.9%, mainly due to the decrease in imports of mineral fuel.</p>
<p>While the German economy has fallen into a decline, the EU and some EU countries have increased their economies. After the price, seasons and working days were adjusted, the first quarter of the euro zone increased by 0.1%from the previous quarter, and the EU overall GDP increased by 0.2%month -on -month. Among EU member states with large economic volume, Italy and Spain have increased by 0.5%, and France is 0.2%, which only accounts for nearly 30%of the economic output of economic output in Europe in Europe.</p>
<p>Of course, compared with Germany, Spain and Italy have a greater impact on the epidemic, economic losses are heavier, and the economic recovery of these countries is greater. Under the energy crisis of the epidemic, unlike Spain's tourism industry, Germany's industry is impacted by the tension of supply chain and the energy crisis. Moreover, the EU countries have different dependence on Russia's energy. The German Economic Minister of Economic Minister Habeck believes that Germany's energy dependence on Russia is the most important reason for Germany to fall into economic decline.</p>
<p>Some economists also attribute deeper reasons to the position of Germany as industrial bases have been weakened. They call the two consecutive economic declines as the alarm bells to the industrial power. The German economy is currently facing the challenge of energy transformation, professional talents and labor shortage. While the Institute of Economic Research Institute of Economic Foreign Economic Forecast, Timowolmershäuser, while emphasizing the problem of labor shortage, also pointed out that the German automotive industry bears pinching from China and the United States. More leading technology produces in other countries, allowing Germany's production base status has been impacted. Volmershr said that the German model is under tremendous pressure.</p>
<p>Under the crisis, the German government conveyed optimistic signals on the one hand, and on the other hand, they were arguing internally due to large and small issues. Facing the media reporters, Prime Minister Tsurtz said that Germany is vigorously investing in green power construction, battery and chip factories, and Germany's economic prospects are very good. Treasury Secretary Lindona said that Germany was facing the danger of downgrading, so he also faced the turning point of the era of economic policies. He proposed to improve the speed of government planning and approval, improve the investment environment, and attract more professional talents.</p>
<p>With the establishment of a new traffic light government alliance in Germany at the end of 2021, Germany first entered the era of the Three -Party Alliance by the Boltity Alliance. In terms of crisis, the three -party alliance must be reached and more difficult. In terms of energy transformation, the Green Party advocated that through taxes for the rich to invest in climate protection, the Liberal Democratic Party, which advocates the free market and in charge of the Ministry of Finance, resolutely oppose it. For ordinary people, the biggest uneasy factor is heating transformation. German families do not know how huge expenditure is the next heating equipment replacement and improvement of energy renovation. According to RTL/NTVTRENDBAROMETER at the end of May, 76%of the interviewed people opposed the installation of new gas and fuel heating equipment from 2024. 85%did not believe that the draft heating law promoted by the Green Party was passed by the Federal House in early July. 57%of interviewees do not believe that any party can solve problems currently facing Germany.</p>
<p>The surge in living costs and the delayed heating transformation route brings great uncertainty to the family, and uncertainty often cracks down on consumer confidence. The GFK forecast of consumer research institutions predicts that the German consumer confidence index increased by 1.6 points to -24.2 points in June, reaching the highest value since April 2022. However, consumer emotions have continued to maintain their downturn since the epidemic and control in early 2020. Consumers are not sure what the German economy will be in the next few months. The forecast states that consumption will not become a driving force for economic growth in 2023.</p>
<p>Marceelfratzscher, director of the Institute of Economic Research, said that it was an unfair recession because the most impact was low -income people. A large part of the consumption expenditure of low -income groups is energy and food, and the price of energy and food is particularly increased, which seriously affects the quality of life of low -income people. According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, Germany's average inflation rate in 2022 was 6.9%. Vlash Sage pointed out that the inflation rate this year is estimated to be 6%, which will be significantly higher than the increase in wages and pensions. In the next year, the quality of life of low -income people will continue to decline.In 2023, the German economy will continue to bear the burden brought by the Russian -Ukrainian war, energy transformation and labor shortage, and it will be difficult.</p>

Chang Weiping's wife, Chen Zijuan, condemned the authorities' prosecutions and the judgment was unreasonable. Some lawyers pointed out that the case highlighted the Chinese authorities as a tool for political persecution.</p>

<p>Chinese human rights lawyer Chang Weiping attended the "Xiamen party" in 2019 and was charged with Xu Zhiyong, a well -known legal scholar who had been re -sentenced to the well -known legal scholar who had been sentenced to "subverting the state power". Chang Weiping's case was sentenced to the Fengxian Detention Center of Baoji City, Baoji City, Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Chang Weiping's wife, Chen Zijuan, told this station that although her husband's sentence was shorter than the same case Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, they were sentenced to 14 years and twelve years in prison, but people involved in "Xiamen party" did not have a crime, sentence and sentence, sentence and sentence, sentence, and sentence Imprisonment cannot be accepted for a day.</p>
<p>Chen Zijuan: "For him, the three and a half -year and two -year deprivation of political rights, even compared to Xu Zhiyong and the Ding family, it looks a bit slightly slightly slightly slightly more absurd from beginning to end. I also judged more, and it shouldn't be given to him for a day. "</p>
<p>** Chang Weiping's wife is worried that her husband will still be free.</p>
<p>Chen Zijuan said that Chang Weiping had been detained and monitored for a long time before his sentence, and was worried about his physical condition. She said that the time to deduct Chang Weiping's detention should be full as soon as July next year. However, according to the practice of dealing with political prisoners and dissidents in Beijing in the past ten years, she was worried that her husband would not have real freedom after serving the sentence.</p>
<p>Chen Zijuan: "He is already the longest person in the detention center. His physical condition must be a problem that I am very concerned about. There is also a problem. In fact, the so -called deprivation of political rights means restricting his exit . From the usual practice of the CCP's political prisoners, they will restrict them. Even after the addition of their prison and depriving political rights, they are still difficult for them to have freedom and freedom of freedom without exit. , Also have been in a state of supervision. "</p>
<p>As for whether the appeal will be appealed, Chen Zijuan said that according to the agent lawyer, Chang Weiping is still considering that she will respect her husband's decision.</p>

<p>Liu Shihui, a Chinese human rights lawyer who has been paying attention to the case, said that the sentence of Xu Zhiyong, Ding Jiaxi and Chang Weiping showed the barbaric of the CCP's laws. Although Chang Weiping had the right to appeal, the opportunity to change the original judgment was almost zero.</p>
<p>Liu Shihui: "If the appeal, it means to pass the scene anyway. In fact, everyone knows that this kind of conscience case will not change the judgment at all, that is, political persecution. The case has been sentenced for more than three years. I want to torture you in the detention center. Torture you to you, and then pronounce it. Because everyone knows that it is really hell in the detention center, and it is as good as the year. "</p>
<p><strong> Teng Biao: The authorities regard Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi as the main criminals </strong></p>
<p>Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights lawyer in the United States, said that three people have been sentenced in the "Xiamen gathering" case, and once again proves that the law has become a tool for political persecution of the Chinese authorities. It can be seen from the difference between the three sentences of the three people.</p>
<p>Teng Biao: "The authorities should think that Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi played a leading role in the Xiamen case. But from a legal perspective, whether Xu Zhiyong, Ding Jiaxi, and Chang Weiping and other people in this case are . The sentence of their sentence and the crime of subverting the state power is completely a kind of political persecution, a rough violation of citizen rights and freedom.</p>
<p>Teng Biao believes that the case is a blow to human rights lawyers after the 709th arrest. The encounter of human rights lawyers can reflect the harsh human rights situation in China and the degree of retreat from the rule of law. In addition to continuing to pay attention to Xu Zhiyong, Ding Jiaxi and Chang Weiping, the international community must also pay attention to other defendants who have not been sentenced and the status of conscience of conscience in prison.</p>

<p>The filial son was sexually assaulted many times when he was teenage. She later launched the anti -"idiot" campaign, including the colorful badge. The badge reads: "‘ idiot ’is a crime!” People can express their attitudes towards “idiots” through wearing badges.</p>
<p><strong> Women who have encountered sexual assault on public transport in East Asia are also facing another risk: sexual assaults secretly shooting the indecent process and put the film on the Internet for sale. After more than a year of investigation, the BBC International Channel Survey Group "BBC's Eye" was undercover to expose behind the scenes of the scene through sexual violence. </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png" />In the early peak time in Tokyo, the train car was crowded and shaking.</p>
<p>The 15 -year -old filial piety (pseudonym) is going to school, and she tries to hold the armrest in the car.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt that she touched her skirt with one hand. She thought someone accidentally hit her.</p>
<p>But the hand then grabbed her.</p>
<p>"At that time, I realized that I encountered 'idiots'," Xiaozi recalled.</p>
<p>The hand disappeared quickly in the crowd.</p>
<p>"I can't do anything," that day, Xiaozi cried to school.</p>
<p>It was the first time she was obscene on public transportation (Volkswagen Transport System), but after that, she repeatedly encountered sexual harassment on the train. On many nights, she washed her face with tears.</p>
<p>"I think my life has no hope."</p>
<p>Many women encounter obscenity in public places like filial piety. Some of them have to face another kind of infringement: the process of sexual assault is photographed, and the film is even sold online.</p>
<p>We found that three Chinese websites sold and produced thousands of sexual assault films.</p>
<p>Most of the films are exactly the same: a man shot and track a woman from the back. A few seconds later, he was obscene of the woman. The behavior of these men was hidden, and the victims did not seem to realize that they were being sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>After more than a year of investigation, we tracked behind the scenes behind this dark industry through sexual violence: a rock musician, a sociological graduate, and their cautious "leaders".</p>
<h3>"idiot": Japan's serious social problem</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130029682_train.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>

<p>Tokyo's subway trains sometimes become abnormally crowded.</p>
<p>The filial son encountered obscenity on the train to school almost every day. Due to fear and shame, she did not speak up when the victim. But every night, she will cover her mouth with a towel, and repeatedly practice how to drink a degenerate sexual assault person in front of the mirror: "This person is a" idiot "!"</p>
<p>"Idiot" is Japanese, which refers to sexual assault occurred in public places, especially the "salty pig hand" behavior on public transport. The word is also used to describe the criminals who have made this obscene behavior.</p>
<p>"Idiot" criminals usually start in a crowded place, using the victims to do not want to make trouble in public. In Japan, speaking is too directly frank, it may be regarded as a rude performance.</p>
<p>There are thousands of cases arrested every year due to the "idiot" behavior. However, more such crimes have not been discovered and punished. Mental Health Expert Saito Zhang Jia wrote a book about "idiot". He believes that only about 10 % of the victims will report to the police such crimes.</p>
<p>The Japanese police encouraged the victims and witnesses to speak, but the crime was far from being eradicated. The British and Canadian governments even reminded their citizens who are about to go to Japan to prevent them from "idiots".</p>
<p>Commodities and services with the theme of "idiots" are ubiquitous in the Japanese adult entertainment industry, and people are gradually accustomed to them. Adult films of "idiot" theme are one of the most popular pornographic films in Japan, and these films have also been spread to other countries in Asia.</p>
<p>In the Chinese world, the word "idiot" is becoming more and more widely known. In recent years, the crime of "salty pig hands" similar to "idiot" has also occurred.</p>
<h3>"idiot" website</h3>
<p>A Chinese website called "can't stand" caught our attention.</p>
<p>This website sells real "idiots" obscenity short films. These films are filmed with mobile phones. The location is usually in public places where people are crowded, such as subways and buses. The film is filmed in East Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Most of the films are shot in mainland China.</p>
<p>On this website, some short films are sold at a price of RMB. The website even allows users to customize sexual assaults.</p>
<p>We found two related sites on "unable to hold": "street shooting" and "idiot club", both selling the same type of film.</p>
<p>The website also has a Telegram group, with 4,000 members to share sexual assault skills in it.</p>
<p>A name has repeatedly appeared on these "idiots" websites: "Uncle Qi".</p>
<p>He was called "Great God" by the people in this community. There are no dozens of sexual assault films he signed. On Twitter, he publicly published a preview of website films, and there were more than 80,000 fans. But who is "Uncle Qi"?</p>
<p>We observed silently in that telegram group and found a clue. One day, a administrator sent several information, claiming that he had sex with a woman with "Uncle Qi".</p>
<p>He also posted a few photos, and there was a woman standing in a place that looked like a subway platform.</p>
<p>Within a few hours, we found this place: Ikebukuro Station in Tokyo.</p>
<p>There are more clues to bring us to Japan.</p>
<p>There is a PayPal account on the "Can't Hold", which is charged for yen payment. We found the registered mailbox of this account. When we entered the mailbox in the Google contact person, the displayed user avatar was a young man with exquisite makeup and exaggerated shapes.</p>
<p>Through reverse search, we found the man in the photo. His name is NOCTIS ZANG (Zang Xinyu), a 30 -year -old Chinese musician. He lived in Tokyo and was the lead singer of a heavy metal band called "TheVersus".</p>

<p>Through reverse search, we found the man in the photo. His name is NOCTIS ZANG (Zang Xinyu), a 30 -year -old Chinese musician (the picture shows Noctis Zang's Facebook picture).In early 2022, the photographer of "The Versus" posted on Weibo that NOCTIS and another member of the band Lupus Fu (Fu Yan) created the "yellow website" together.</p>
<p>The photographer also posted some laptop photos, including some accounting accounts and notes similar to the category of website videos. He said these notes were written by Noctis. He also released a video, which seemed to be a NOCTIS web browsing record, including the "idiot club" and "street shooting" pages, as well as the "unable to top" management center.</p>
<p>Is this rock musician might be "Uncle Qi"?</p>
<h3>website administrator</h3>
<p>Our undercover reporter "Ian" contacted NOCTIS as a music agent and asked him to meet in a high -end rooftop bar in Tokyo.</p>
<p>They talked about music first, but the topic slowly turned. When Ian said his company had made adult movies before, NOCTIS seemed interested.</p>
<p>The two of them met many times and celebrated NOCTIS's birthday together.</p>
<p>NOCTIS introduced Ian to know his band member Lupus. Lupus is also a Chinese, and he studied sociology in Japan before.</p>
<p>Ian said his company plans to invest in pornographic websites in Japan, and he asked them if they had contacted the business.</p>
<p>NOCTIS frankly said that he had "a little contact a little bit" before. His friend "Cat" founded his pornographic website and sold the "niche content" related to "subway" on it.</p>
<p>IAN lightly mentioned the website "Can't Top Top".</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Our undercover reporter Ian met with key figures related to one of the personal assault movies in a bar in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Lupus and Noctis laughed at the same time, and they replied, "That's a" cat "website!"</p>
<p>They revealed that the behind -the -scenes of the three "idiots" websites were a Chinese who was a "cat" and in Tokyo. According to them, the "cat" has a weird personality and suspicious paranoia.</p>
<p>NOCTIS and Lupus also admit that they have served as administrators for these websites.</p>
<p>They talk about the business model of the website. "China is the most depressed place," Noctis said. "Some men are psychologically perverted, and they want to see these women's quilt." Lupus took over the stubble: "Det."</p>

<p>Photos of NOCTIS and Lupus by BBC reporters undercover.</p>
<p>Noctis revealed that he uploaded more than 5,000 films for the website. He was also responsible for receiving money for the website. He took 30%of the commission and transferred the remaining income to "cat".</p>
<p>Lupus said he was responsible for promoting sexual assault on Twitter. He also said that he could help introduce Ian to know "cats".</p>
<h3>"idiot" club</h3>
<p>In a quiet back alley in Yokohama, Japan, a store decorated into a subway station is very eye -catching. The sign of the door summarizes the concept of this custom store: "legal 'idiot' train."</p>
<p>In this custom store called "peak time", customers can pay the experience of "idiots" legal.</p>
<p>Lian Xiuping, the manager of the store, welcomes us to "get on the car". "We let people do what they can't do outside. This is why they patronize here."</p>
<p>The shop is filled with clean and greasy taste. The private room is decorated as a train carriage, and the sound system can play the sound of the subway station. Even the member card in the store is exactly the same as the Japanese traffic card.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The "Peak Moment" Sexual Club is decorated like a train car, providing customers with the opportunity to realize the fantasy of public sex.</p>
<p>"I think men are necessary to vent in such a place, so that they can avoid rape," Mr. Lian Tian said.</p>
<p>But Japanese mental health expert Saito Zhangjia said that sexual crimes are not as simple as sexual desire.</p>
<p>He said that the desire to control women has driven most of the sexual criminals to commit crimes.</p>
<p>"They do not treat their victims as equal people, but materialize them," Said Saito Zhang Jia said.</p>
<p>After a year of sexual assault, the filial son decided to fight back one day.</p>
<p>In the crowded carriage, she felt that a hand reached into her skirt, and she immediately shouted: "This person is a" idiot "!" She grabbed the wrist of sexual assaults and gave him to the police.</p>
<p>The filial son finally brought the man to court, but he was only sentenced to probation, although he had been arrested many times before because of "idiot".</p>
<p>Xiaozi was disappointed with the results of the case. She began to carry out the anti -"idiot" campaign, including the colorful badge. The badge reads: "‘ idiot ’is a crime!” People can express their attitudes towards “idiots” through wearing badges.</p>
<p>"This is a warning for the offender," Xiaozi said. She is now 24 years old. The anti -"idiot" movement she supports has gradually grown. Now Japan has an annual anti -"idiot" badge design competition to open to high school students across the country.</p>
<h3>hamster</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130010618_chikan_japan_nh_17.jpg" />Image source, noriko hayashi</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Activists make anti -"idiot" badges to improve the public's understanding of sexual assault incidents on public transport.</p>
<p>According to Lupus, the character of "cat" is like hamsters.</p>
<p>"Human and animals are harmless, but be careful about everything, and sometimes it is easy to be excited."</p>
<p>Lupus is right. "Cat" repeatedly refused to meet Ian.</p>
<p>But on New Year's Eve in the Lunar New Year, our luck suddenly came. "Cat" agreed to meet at a karaoke club in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The club is filled with a strong smell of smoke. Some people sing Chinese popular songs, and the sound of guests touch the cup.</p>
<p>Those who come to the appointment are unexpected. It was a thin young man, wearing half -edged glasses, wearing a dark long trench coat. "Cat" looks like a college student. He said he was 27 years old.</p>
<p>Ian showed his interest in investing in the "Cat" website and asked him how the income of this business was.</p>
<p>"Our turnover is about 5,000 to 100,000 (RMB) per day," "Cat" proudly, and still showing the transaction details on mobile phones. "The amount is very stable."</p>
<p>Ian pretended to admire and mentioned the name "Uncle Qi".</p>
<p>"Cat" immediately admitted: "I am Uncle Qi.""Cat" has three "idiots" websites to provide sexual assault videos (the picture shows the sexual assault video website of the BBC reporter's undercover video.</p>
<p>But what surprised us was that he also revealed that "Uncle Qi" was not just a person.</p>
<p>"Cat" manages a 15 -person team, of which 10 of them produced a film in China under the name "Uncle Qi". Every month, "cats" received 30 to 100 pieces from them.</p>
<p>These films were immediately sold on three "idiots" websites, and "cats" acknowledged that he was the owner of these websites. There are more than 10,000 paid members on the website, most of which are Chinese men.</p>
<p>"The most important thing must be true, and it must be true," "Cat" said. He later told us that his website even sold real rape films.</p>
<p>When talking about his business, "cat" is like talking about a startup startup. He described his team "very hot" and "dare to go to break". He even said lightly that he was training other people to perform sexual assaults and shoot movies in public places.</p>
<p>But one thing he never mentioned: those women in his film seem to be worthless for him.</p>
<h3>Demonstrate "Cat"</h3>
<p>We want to know the true identity of "cat". Ian met with "cat" again, and he revealed how he first came into contact with the industry.</p>
<p>Like many boys, "cats" liked Superman, Anime and Games when they were young. But when he was 14 years old, he started watching sexual assault on the Internet, and the content inside was not far from the films he was selling.</p>
<p>He knew that this business was not risky.</p>
<p>"Do you know why I am so cautious and only let myself operate? Because I can do it for so long, it is always safety first." In order to avoid the investigation of Chinese law enforcement agencies, he plans to join the Japanese nationality.</p>
<p>Although "cat" was so cautious, he made a mistake.</p>
<p>When Ian asked where to transfer the investment funds, the "cat" took out his bank card from his wallet and handed it to Ian.</p>
<p>There is his real name on the card: Tang Zhuoran (transliteration).</p>
<p>After that, we found his address in Tokyo and proposed our allegations to "cats".</p>
<p>When we approached him, he did not answer our inquiries, and tried to cover his face and walk in other directions. Then, he suddenly started to attack the camera and the BBC team.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, we saw "cats" at the airport the next day. He left Japan.</p>
<p>The Twitter account of "Uncle Qi" is still active, and it is still publicly promoting sexual assault. Twitter did not respond to our comment request. They only sent us a symbol of stool, which is an automatic reply from Twitter News mailboxes since March this year.</p>
<p>We put forward our allegations to NOCTIS and Lupus. They did not respond. During the reporting production, we learned that the two no longer cooperated with "cats".</p>
<p>On a gentle spring day, we reunited with filial piety and shared our investigations with her.</p>
<p>She was shocked. She said: "Our women are just the content of the film that satisfies their desire to them. They materialize us. They don't think we are living people."</p>
<p>Xiaozi advocated more severe laws to crack down on these crimes.</p>
<p>Japan is about to pass the first pushing method, which will prohibit films and photos containing sexual exploitation content without the consent. Actors are advocating the introduction of laws that severely punish "idiots".</p>
<p>Before that, filial piety would not give up lightly. "We won't cry and fall asleep."</p>

<h1>Interview: The college entrance examination system is not the root of China's "inner volume"</h1>

<p>Description: The pressure of academic competition in Chinese teenagers is increasing, and the national unemployment rate of youth is also high. What are the factor in promoting the "inner volume" of Chinese society? Can everyone strive for privileges and strive to be the social mentality of "people"? Voice of Germany interviewed Professor Xiang Bi, Chinese director of the Institute of Social Anthropology, Germany.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65852365/65846280"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T05-59-00Z/65846280_303.jpg" /></a>On June 7, outside a college entrance examination room in Beijing, students, parents, and teachers embraced each other before starting the test.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人生忧患高考始考生已忧就业难/a-65858735">The number of applicants for the college entrance examination in China hit a new high, nearly 13 million</a>At the same time, the number released by the National Bureau of Statistics recently shows that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/毕业即失业-中国年轻人失业率居高不下/a-64834417">National Youth unemployment rate</a>It has reached </strong><strong> 20.4%</strong> <strong>, and it is also the highest value since the record. From the perspective of these two figures, can the degree of internal volumes of Chinese society be intensified for a while? </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Biao: The so -called inner roll is a fierce competition in the case of no large income, or in a lot of money to win a little return, or even a little return. What promotes this kind of competition is almost illusory hope. I think there will be an inflection point to a certain extent, and everyone may give up this unlimited competition. Of course, this will be gradual. It is impossible for all Chinese youths to do this together. We guess that this will start with the group with the least opportunities. They will "lie flat" first.</p>
<p>Back to these two numbers you mentioned: a clear conclusion is not the enhancement of the inner volume, but represents a depression and even disillusionment emotion. At least everyone's frustration will increase. The expansion of universities has been saturated, and the number of universities is unlikely to grow, and many high school graduates will not be able to get their ideal universities. If he entered a "two" universities, he would feel that his entire future was slim. In many examples, we see that they are immersed in depression and unwillingness throughout the university stage. Of course, there is another choice, which is to apply for graduate students, and some people even take the postgraduate entrance examination many times. Especially those "two" college students, they prepared for the postgraduate entrance examination very early, because they felt that there would be no good job opportunities. This "inner volume" is different from the past: they no longer think that "inner volumes" can bring back, but more and more trying to escape some setbacks. In other words, the driving force is not hope, but pressure. From a statistical point of view, many people must not get the expected returns in the end, so they have a sense of frustration and disillusionment. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国大学生找工作到底有多卷/a-65425013">20%of young people can't find a job</a>That is to say, there is no chance of the inner volume. How do they handle their lives? This will be a new problem.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T05-59-00Z/63515858_404.jpg" />In August 2022, a job exhibition in Beijing</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Chinese born in the 1970s and 1980s seem to be difficult to appreciate the fierce competition pressure faced by young people today. Although this is a subjective feeling, it is indeed a subjective feeling that many people have. Can you explain why this is? </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Du: Inlea, this is related to the large -scale expansion of Chinese universities since 1999. Entering university is easier, but competition has become more intense. This involves a concept: Chinese -style internal rolls are very inclusive, which means that it is very "participation". Before the expansion of the Chinese university, the Chinese university is taking the elite education route. Although it is unfair, it has the function of promoting self -differentiation: everyone generally feels that only a few children are suitable for college, and most children should find another way. This is actually a bit like Germany. Of course, China's social mentality is still slightly different, and it is always a bit inferior to not being able to pass the university. But no matter what, no one will squeeze on the road. After the expansion of 1999, a kind of atmosphere was formed in the society. I felt that everyone should go to college. In addition, the universalization of the only child, the family's investment in children has increased significantly. This involves the issue of the Chinese economy, the gap between the rich and the poor. Parents can intuitively feel whether it can seize a high -quality job opportunity and enter the so -called "white -collar life", which will cause a very large difference in life quality. Due to the fear of further intensification of the division of the rich and the poor, parents will invest in their children at all, hoping that children can be admitted to a good university.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T05-59-00Z/56574328_404.jpg" />Migrant workers who are returning from Beijing on their way back(January 2021)<strong> Voice of Germany: So, your main point is that the important reason for the extent of the inner volume and the greater competitive pressure is that the gap between the rich and the poor is widening? </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Du: This is a very important part. But it should be pointed out that if we make an international comparison, we will find that most society is very unequal. In this context, how should the "inner volume" of Chinese society explain? If there is no inequality, of course, there will be no such fear and anxiety, nor will there be such unlimited investment. But only equality is not sufficient conditions. There are three points here: 1. China still has some socialist traditions; 2. The reform in the 1980s is inclusive, and the success of the society will benefit from progress. Therefore That is, everyone should benefit from development; 3. Although China's economic development is rapid, there is almost no improvement in social consciousness and tolerance for diversified value. This has caused the whole society to have a confidence, want to be admitted to a good university, live a life of urban white -collar workers, go to first -tier cities, and so on. If one billion people believe that there is only one good lifestyle, then this homogeneous thought will be disconnected from objective facts. Further analysis, in fact, this qualitative social consciousness formed by more than one billion people is essentially the awareness of a minority elite, making the remaining 90%of them think that they are not worth living in the current lifestyle. This has caused most people to be essentially dissatisfied with their current life. I call it a "suspended" state, that is, the negation of self. This is the main reason why the Chinese people are currently anxious. Everyone can do everything possible to live "the life of others."</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Everyone competes as "people"? </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Du: Yes. All in all, everyone realized that the gap between the rich and the poor was increasing, but did not think about the reasons and solutions of the gap between the rich and the poor critical. Instead, they hope that they can benefit in this unequal environment. Others become "superior" instead of staying in the lower level in the unequal relationship. Everyone is constantly chasing becoming "people" without thinking about the reasons behind it, and not thinking about how to change their surrounding environment and change their lifestyle without thinking about "people". But it is impossible for everyone to become "people", so everyone is anxious.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T05-59-00Z/65853163_404.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: How to change this situation? The gap between the rich and the poor and the mentality of striving to be the "people" seems to be difficult to solve. It is not easy for everyone to accept "lying flat" ... </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Biao: The opposite of "Inner Volume" is not "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国年轻人拒绝加油干只想躺平了/a-57791341">lying flat</a>", At least it should not be" lying ", because hard work is still necessary. Abandoned" lying flat "is nothing to do. This is actually difficult. Only those who have multiple real estate in the first -tier cities. It can only be done by the square. And another "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国躺平族都是怎么想的/a-57814519">lying flat</a>"It is exit, I call it active" lying flat ", that is, not participating in this" inner roll "game, not cutting his head to fight for" people ". Thinking, finding a dignified lifestyle on the basis of resolving the livelihood, and doing things that you find them very interesting and others feel very interesting. The so -called "exit" is to find what you really want to do. Doing the ground. Maybe this will make people live relatively poor, but there will be no sense of emptiness and anxiety. Of course, how to live is a very microscopic thing and can only start from countless trivial matters. For speaking, it is difficult for me to understand China's economic policy, difficult to figure out the intention of the upper -level decision makers, and the idea of the intermediate executor, but at least one point is clear: simply rely on economic growth to give everyone hope, let everyone sully work hard to catch up, Train, this state can no longer be maintained. Now what everyone wants is a practical prospect, not the future of imagination. This is a grand theoretical proposition, which is not expressed for the time being. In short, China needs to change from material production to people -oriented production. This includes care, entertainment, art, education, leisure and other aspects, and issues related to "meaning" will become more and more important.</p>
<p>These issues actually have strong political meanings. In all times at the age of all economic development, social justice, etc., became the corner material issue in leisure. Today, the important degree of non -economic issues has increased significantly. It involves many problems, such as how people's energy is allocated? Human energy is actually the most important social resources. What are we willing to allocate our energy? In the age of increasingly higher material life, the problem of energy distribution will become more important. Therefore, I think that for the "inner volume", there is no direct solution, and it is impossible to solve it through a set of policies. The key is that everyone must consciously discuss and explore their own lifestyle. Self -change.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T05-59-00Z/63987118_404.jpg" />A middle school in Hangzhou(2018 data chart)<strong> Voice of Germany: In other words, do you not think that through some reforms of the college entrance examination system to alleviate the "inner volume" of society? </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Du: It is difficult to alleviate the "inner volume" through some technical adjustments for the college entrance examination system. Suppose we now give up completely <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國高考登場習語錄入題-考生數創新高/a-65847010">College Entrance Examination</a>Instead, it is engaged in university independent propositions and students' initiative to apply.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专家谈中国教育改革-减少考试减不了竞争压力/a-59077486)Essence At that time, there will be many companies that teach you how to write resumes. Some companies will organize middle school students to participate in volunteer activities and help you write the corresponding resumes. Because the Chinese people's awareness of universities is generally: university gives cultural capital; everyone will think of "I have entered Peking University and Tsinghua University, and the whole person is different." In Germany, universities do not have such a halo. I think this is a place where Germany has done better than other countries. Entering universities just show that this child is more suitable for theoretical thinking, which does not mean that superior is superior. In addition, Chinese society's hierarchical concept of university is deeply ingrained, and almost no social forces are found to oppose this hierarchy. The students who come out also strive to maintain this halo and strengthen the level of level. Paradoxically, the "two" universities and non -elite college students also have the psychology of worship of Peking University and Tsinghua University, and there is no autonomous discourse system.</p>
<p>This returns to the participation of the Chinese -style "inside roll" we said before. Everyone agrees with a concept of homogeneity, and is willing to arrange everything for the best and disadvantages of everything. Of course, this is not related to the power system. The significance of the existence of various universities is not what you are doing, but "I am better than you", "I am more halo than you." From the perspective of "energy distribution", the "entering aura" is the best mobilization of the Chinese mentality. As for the meaning of "entering the halo" itself, it is very meaningful to themselves, others, and society, few people have asked. If these things are not changed, no matter what test system, what is the most concerned about "entering the aura" what is used. With so many people in a single evaluation system, the competition must be very fierce and anxious.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T05-59-00Z/62128865_404.jpg" />Does Chinese companies expanding overseas will help alleviate domestic "internal rolls"?</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: On social networking sites in China, we noticed that many netizens believe that the root cause of the "inside roll" of Chinese society is that the per capita economic resources are too small, so to change the rules of the international economic division of labor formulated by the old developed countries So as "cake bigger", solve the "inner roll" of Chinese society at the world. Does this say this? Will this cause the danger of Chinese -style "inside rolls" to overflow abroad? </strong></p>
<p>Xiang Du: The so -called "overflow" risk, one is that after the Chinese people go abroad, bring the "inner volume" culture outside, forcing foreigners to only compete with "inner volume". Another is to force Africans or Europeans to "inside" to maintain competitiveness with the expansion of China's economic influence. The development of China's manufacturing industry has made the competition of global industries more intense. From this perspective, the "inner volume" seems to be really risky. But that is not the case. What happened in the economic field is that after the rise of China's industries, industries in various countries have entered the process of "subdivision" and "diversified", not "inner curl" competition. Although we have always said that the market economy is to compete, in fact competition is an unreasonable behavior. What everyone actually thinks is: "Why should I compete with you positively? I can find a way to do something else." So in fact, this is to avoid competition. For example, Chinese produce shoes, then other countries will quickly adjust to produce other products.</p>
<p>As for the young Chinese who "Run" to foreign countries, they don't want to "roll" "inner". We can see that Chinese in Germany generally appreciate the balance of life and work here.This extension: It is 100 % fallacy to expect to solve the contradiction between "wolves and less flesh" by taking foreign "meat" abroad. Looking back at history: After capitalism develops to a certain degree, the return on investment will decline, so the external expansion market will be used as a means to deal with crisis. However, in human history, almost all of this form of capitalist expansion has led to catastrophic consequences. And today's international community is no longer colonialism, and production capacity is not allowed without restrictions.</p>
<p>As for "dividing the global meat to China", what we actually see is that this has strengthened the domestic "internal roll". There are very few people who can benefit in the international market, and they do not know the "meat" that they take back to the people of the country, which will only be more irresponsible to Chinese society: in China, they are Without a profit, they ran. This is actually a global issue, and the same is true in Germany: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国人也爱躺平不求发财还仇富/a-57881422">German multinational financial institutions, multinational speculators are poor in word of mouth in German society</a>Essence These people are opportunists around the world. They have no "public" concept. They don't care about their lives. They just pursue the maximum benefits worldwide and are unwilling to share their benefits with others.</p>

The latest polls show that about a quarter of Europeans will support the United States in potential conflicts.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The European Foreign Relations Committee (ECFR) released a poll on Wednesday (August) showing that nearly three -quarters of Europeans (74%) believed that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/馬克宏的歐洲願景真能實現嗎/a-65309253">reduce military dependence on the United States</a>, Improve Europe's own defense capabilities; most people also hope <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/馬克宏與拜登通話-兩方聲明對台說法有落差/a-65391858">maintain neutrality on the Taiwan issue</a>Essence</p>
<p>The report surveyed from 11 EU countries, including France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Bulgaria. A total of 1,6168 respondents were held in April this year. The results show: "Europeans want to see the European Union more self -reliance in foreign policy and establish their own defense capabilities."</p>
<p>In terms of Taiwan -related issues, polls pointed out that if the United States and China broke out on the Taiwan issue, the average number of interviewees in the average of a quarter of the respondents hoped that their country or Europe would stand on the side of the United States, as high as the public advocated neutrality. Even the most people (about 30%) express that nearly half of the respondents will still choose to maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>In addition, 43%of the EU people believe that China is a "necessary partner", which is higher than positioning Beijing as "opponent" or "enemy" (35%). However, in the Russian -Ukraine issue, if Beijing decides to provide ammunition and weapons to Moscow, more EU people support sanctions in China (41%of 33%), even if it means that it will seriously damage its country's economy.</p>
<p>In terms of Chinese -funded shares, more than 50%of the respondents opposed Chinese funds to enter Europe, including bridges or ports (65%), technology companies (52%), and newspapers (58%) in its country.</p>
<h3>and Mark Hong's position consistent</h3>
<p>As a result of polls, most European people and French President Emmanuel Macron coincided with previous stance on Sino -US relations and Taiwan issues.</p>
<p>In April of this year, Mark Hong publicly stated that the huge risk faced in Europe was "involved in the crisis that does not belong to us", including the differences in the US -China issue on the Taiwan issue. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不想當美國小弟專家指歐洲在戰略自主上沒有共識/a-65299420)Essence</p>
<p>"Europeans must answer a question is to raise Taiwan's tension in line with our interests? No." Macong told the US media Politico on April 9th, the worst situation is that Europe has become a "follower in Taiwan issues. "," Followed by the U.S. political agenda and China's excessive response "," Why should we follow the rhythm selected by others? "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T06-17-00Z/65248957_401.jpg" />Markho met with Xi Jinping in mid -April, and then called on the EU to avoid being involved in the US -China conflict due to Taiwan issues.</p>
<p>These remarks caused a lot of criticism at the time. German foreign affairs expert Norbert Röttgen told the German Radio that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马克龙的战略自主被批孤立自己削弱欧洲/a-65269516">Mark Hong's remarks "isolated yourself, weakened in Europe"</a><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体马克龙冯德莱恩在中国扮演红白脸/a-65246117">And the position of Ursula von der Leyen, chairman of the European Commission, runs counter to</a>Essence</p>
<p>At the end of March, Feng Delin said in a think tank event that peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait was of absolute significance, and did not support any party to unilaterally change the status quo by force.</p>
<h3>EU: Highly concerned about the Taiwan Strait</h3>
<p>At the same time, the EU's Asia -Pacific Division Gunnar Wiegand, the EU's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, emphasized on the 8th that the EU and the United States also highly concerned about the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Vigo said at a forum at the Center for Strategy and International Research (CSIS) that the EU has its own clear "No. 1 Middle" policy and should do everything possible to maintain the status quo to meet global interests. He also said that the United States -China re -establishing communication channels is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>In response, Kurtcampbell, the US White House Indian Affairs coordination officer, said in the same forum that the US dialogue door continued to open, but competition is still the leading framework of US -China relations. The United States will ensure "responsible competition", avoid differences between differences into opposites or convey a message of the new Cold War.</p>
<h3>In response to the dispute, Macron emphasized that the position of Taiwan is unchanged</h3>

<p><strong> Byte Betting (TIKTOK parent company) is accused of allowing members of the Communist Party of China (CCP) to obtain user data from Hong Kong civil rights and demonstrators. </strong></p>
<p>Yintao Yu (transliteration) submitted by the US court claims that users who submitted to the US court will be identified and monitored by the company by the company who uploaded "related content related to demonstrations".</p>
<p>Yu Yingtao also said that some senior officials of the Communist Party of China can also read data from Tiktok users in the United States. The spokesperson of byte beating denied these allegations and called it "basically basically."</p>
<p>These allegations appeared in a lawsuit submitted by Yu Yingtao in the San Francisco High Court this week.</p>
<p>In the document, Yu Yingtao claims that the CCP has a committee in the company that can obtain "super user" certification. It is also known as the so -called "God certification" and can review all the data collected by "byte beating".</p>
<p>He said that these Communist Party committees are not byte -by -line mobilization employees, but they can move around the company's office in Beijing.</p>
<p>Yu Yingtao said that this is what company executives know. He served as an engineering director in the United States from August 2017 to 2018.</p>

<p>In 2014, large -scale protests broke out in Hong Kong, the so -called "umbrella movement", and people demanded that they have the right to vote for their own chief executives. Since then, the protesters have begun a series of smaller demonstration protests. In 2019, the protest of the "Anti -Repair" movement reached its peak. However, Beijing's severe "Hong Kong National Security Law" suppressed, which made Hong Kong's public protests almost extinct.</p>

<p>When the BBC contact the byte beating, a spokesman denied the allegations: "We firmly deny this complaint and have no current allegations and claims."</p>
<p>The company's spokesman also said that Yu Yingtao worked for less than a year in the company and during this period, he participated in a suspended application Flipagram: "It is strange that his work in Flipagram was in July 2018 In the five years after the termination, these allegations have never been proposed.

<p>Bloomberg reported that Pence said on Wednesday (June 7) in the campaign declaration released near Demein, the capital of Aiwa, saying that Trump gave up conservative positions, split the country, and in January 6, 2021 In the Japanese Congress riot incident, he mistakenly requested him to violate his vowing for the US Constitution and overthrow the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>"Anyone who placed himself on the constitution should not be the president of the United States in the constitution, and anyone who requires others to put themselves on the constitution should not become the president of the United States."

<p>The Financial Times pointed out that the Pentagon and the Presidential Palace of Taiwan have refused to comment on the matter.</p>
<h3>Experts: Improved Political Mutual Trust of the United States, Japan and Taiwan</h3>
<p>Su Ziyun, director of the National Defense Strategy and Resources Research Institute of the Taiwan National Defense Council, told DW that he believed that the matter had a certain degree of credibility. In addition to obtaining the news many times in the past, the current international situation has indeed allowed the United States and Japan to share no one to share no one.

The steps to greatly improve the efficiency of information sharing.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun told DW that the drone plays the role of "terminal" and is responsible for collecting about 200 to 300 kilometers of sea intelligence in the surrounding area of its flight. These emotional funds are shared with allies through Link-22 and other communication networks. For example, the current radar in Taiwan can detect about information within about 300 to 400 kilometers around. If the allies' drone sharing information is added, "it is equivalent to the coverage of the original 400 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers. , Or even 1500 kilometers ", forming a" General Combat Map "liaison network that can play an early warning effectiveness can not only make the battlefield management capabilities among the allies more complete, but also make Taiwan's firepower and troops more effective.</p>
<h3>Not only relying on the US military fire Taiwan to strengthen the defense capabilities</h3>
<h3>will co -discuss drone cooperation strategies</h3>
<p>According to the Financial Times, a military official involved in the plan said that the US, Japan, and Taiwan military will receive training using the UAV system together.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Pacific Marine Corps Commander and Retired Lieutenant General Stevenrudder said that the MQ-9 Death Investigation machine is a relatively new system for the Taiwan Strait, so the United States is committed to developing M- Q9's navigation rail network.</p>
<p>Rudel added that the U.S. Marine Corps received the first MQ-9 in Hawaii, and that after the US Air Force deployed in Japan was also allowed to fly out of Japan, the Japanese maritime police team and the Navy immediately started to deploy drones The allies participating in this plan will also begin exploring common combat plans.</p>
<p>Heinoklinck, former senior official of Asian affairs, said that in view of the recent invasion of Taiwan ’s air defense identification zone, the Chinese PLA has increasingly invaded the air defense identification zone in Taiwan. Want to strengthen the intention of cooperation.</p>

<p>Pengding revealed that the reason why he decided to publish public diary publicly is related to the current actions of Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities. In recent years, the Beijing authorities have gradually tightened the space of Hong Kong society, increased their control intensity, and broke the promise of "50 years unchanged". Pengding Kang said that after leaving Hong Kong, he was actually not sure if Hong Kong could maintain an open state. Now I think Beijing wants to see "Hong Kong without Hong Kong people ', which is why I decided to publish it later."</p>
<p>In response to the situation in Hong Kong, Peng Dingkang said that although Beijing has promised Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" and "50 years unchanged", etc., the Beijing authorities have now increased their control over Hong Kong. In Taiwan, he called on Taiwanese people to use Hong Kong experience as a mirror. "What is the last time the CCP's commitment to Hong Kong?"</p>
<p>Peng Dingkang said that Taiwan is no stranger to him. As early as 1989, it had dealt with and exposed issues related to Taiwan. It described Taiwan as an open and free society. Like Hong Kong in the past, Taiwan was also "one country, two systems". The slogan is no stranger. However, he pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party signed a joint statement in China and Britain that it promised to give Hong Kong's original freedom for at least 50 years. When he was transferred in Hong Kong's sovereignty, he thought that if China was in the Hong Kong issue, he would lose his credit in front of the world. Based on this, he felt that he could believe in China at that time. However China is not trustworthy.</p>
<p>For cross -strait relations, Peng Dingkang dislikes the completely decoupling practice because it will damage related interests, but it is in favor of Taiwan's constant threat to the mainland in the Taiwan Strait, and it needs to strengthen regional security work to protect and strengthen its own interests.</p>

<p>"We have made a request to Google to put the national anthem correctly. Unfortunately, Google rejected it," said Deng Bingqiang, director of the Hong Kong Security Bureau, said at a press conference in December last year. "I believe this statement is incredible, and Hong Kong people will not accept it."</p>
<p>The government has always applied for a ban on playing or spreading this protest song this week. This is the latest attempt by the authorities to eradicate the political abnormalities in Hong Kong. right. Under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, great changes have taken place in Hong Kong. From the previous prosperity center of foreign corporate friendship, it has become the forefront of the Chinese government to maintain the national security movement.</p>

<p>Google and Meta refused to comment for this article. Twitter did not respond to the comment request.</p>
<p>American technology companies usually comply with laws and regulations of their countries and regions, and sometimes delete content. The possible scope of the Hong Kong banned order is unclear. Critics said that the formulation of the "Hong Kong National Security Law" aims at the purpose of supervising the actions outside Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"People in any place in the world can violate the" Hong Kong National Security Law "," said Xu Luowen, who was the person in charge of the free sector of the Google Asia -Pacific region. "The question is whether the scope of the application of this ban is similar to that of the National Security Law."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000000.png" />This year, Henan, Henan, encountered the weather in "rains". The wheat was soaked in water and mighty. As the phenomenon of the saints is about to be reported, farmers are worried about eating. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06082023092848.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Reuters-1-LINK: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaayuan/GRN-06082023092848.html/@stream]](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06082023092848.html/@@stream)At the end of May, Chinese wheat entered the summer harvest season, but Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong and other places continued to be trapped in rainy days. Country, Henan's output accounts for a quarter. This year, it encountered the worst "rotten rain" weather in the past 10 years. "Look at the sky to eat". Australia is also pessimistic to foresee the year of arrears. Wheat has been planted since April, and then the second dry May since the record has been developed. The drought weather system is developing. The phenomenon of the holy infant of the wheel returns, and the local wheat output will decrease sharply by 34%in the next quarter. Bad news followed, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) alert on May 17, greenhouse gas emissions plus holy infant phenomenon, from 2023 to 2027, there will be a record of at least one year in the record. Dr. Wang Zhonghe Wang Zhonghe, a researcher at the Institute of Earth Sciences of the Taiwan Central Academy of Sciences, explained that during the year of strong holy infant, the average annual temperature of the surface would rise significantly. , Increase the average temperature of the surface by 0.2 ° C. Due to warmth plus strong saints, the average annual temperature of the earth in 2016 was 1.37 ° C. Essence Wang Zhonghe further said that the phenomenon of holy babies in the summer of 2023 will appear again. From the perspective of observation data, its strength will not be low. This summer will be a high -temperature hot and hot wave sky in the summer. Temperature phenomenon, many meteorological units estimate that the annual average temperature difference in 2023 will fall between 1.29 and 1.41 ° C. 2022 is the fifth year in history. The high temperature ranking in 2023 will exceed 2022, at least it will be at least, at least it will In the top 4, there is also a chance to surpass 2016.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000002.png" />Climate warming increases the extremes of holy infant phenomena, and extreme weather events are more likely to occur. (Associated Press) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06082023092848.html/2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Warm incubation giant baby? </strong> The warming effect of this round makes people tighten the nerves. The babies are on the road. Many national scientists predict that the possibility of developing a "giant baby" is not small. The research team led by the special professor of the Marine Research Institute of Taiwan University participated in the world's main sanctuary collection forecast system. He said that because the temperature of the seawater below the equatorial Pacific Ocean is now higher than usual, and the phenomenon of anti -sanctuary phenomenon in the past 3 years has been in the past 3 years. (Lani ，a, also known as La Nina), gradually accumulated warm water to the equatorial Pacific. It has stored a lot of energy. At present, some power model forecast is the year of strong saints, but from some statistical models, including the research team of the National Taiwan University Within the forecast model, the current Saint Baby prediction is not so strong, because the development process and trigger mechanism of the phenomenon of holy infant also involved the interaction between the atmospheric wind farms, atmosphere and the ocean, and even the sea temperature of the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. These may affect the development of the next holy infant. "The energy accumulated in the ocean is like oil and fuel, and the interaction of the ocean and atmosphere is like a lighter. When you ignite it, you can inspire a strong phenomenon of holy babies." Zeng Yung met this metaphor, "So the most important thing is the equator Is there a very severe ocean and atmospheric interaction on the top of the Pacific Ocean. "The Special Committee of the United Nations Intergovernmental Climate Change Special Committee (IPCC) said that the phenomenon of holy babies that occurred since 1950 is far from the phenomenon that occurred from 1850 to 1950 to 1950. More intense. Wang Zhonghe believes that there is a great chance of the year of strong sanctification in the next year. Looking back at history, the phenomenon of holy babies has been stronger than one at a time from 1950. From 1982 to 1983, it was called the year of super holy infant at the time. The strength of the young infant is stronger, and the super holy infants from 2015 to 2016 later lived up, and the phenomenon of the saints continued to increase the strength. Climate change quietly plays the factors that help the flames. Wang Zhonghe pointed out that the phenomenon of saints and anti -saint babies is the way to regulate the temperature of the earth. It can be said that it is the main promoter of the energy balance of the earth, but with the rapid accumulation of the gas concentration of the atmosphere, more and more thermal energy can be accumulated on the surface. Among them, the ocean has absorbed 90%, causing the phenomenon of holy babies and anti -saint babies to become increasingly extreme. From the sudden increase in the increase of the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere, the clue of the trend of the carbon dioxide concentration. According to the analysis of Wang Zhonghe, the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere in 1850 was 284 ppm. Until 1950, it increased by 28.8 ppm, rising to 312.8ppm. The increase in 70 years has exceeded 100 ppm. Such a fast increase means that the ecological environment has changed in the past, and the ocean is particularly obvious. Zeng Yuheng pointed out that with the intensification of global warming, the marine and atmospheric feedback are stronger. In terms of the phenomenon of strong saint babies from 2015 to 2016, warming does deepen the effect of the sanctuary. In the future warming situation, tropical on the tropical situation The changes in water and gas and the changes in flow are stronger, the impact of strong sacred infants on the climate will be greater, and extreme events are more likely to occur. The condition of drought, extremely heat or heavy rainfall is more likely to occur.<strong> The flood in the Yangtze River Basin heating up </strong> Extreme weather incidents caused by the phenomenon of holy infants in the past are vividly vivid. At the time from 1997 to 1998, there was a large area of floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. The same period of history, this year, experts also reminded the Yangtze River Basin to prevent floods strictly. Zeng Yuheng said that from the past climate statistics, due to the impact of the phenomenon of holy infant phenomena, the precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin increased, and the risk of floods may increase this year. However Related to many atmospheric conditions. Wang Zhonghe pointed out that when the phenomenon of holy babies occurs, high -latitude jet air flow will be snake, and the sea temperature of low latitudes will change significantly in the direction of the east and west directions, so on the one hand, it will bring extreme weather. In terms of this year, the World Meteorological Organization specially attached an extreme change in global rainfall during the forecast of the holy infant. The East Pacific was particularly strong due to high temperature, which caused a particularly strong rainfall. Droughts usually occur in Southeast Asia and Australia. On the other hand, in the drought surrounded areas, water and gas will be extremely abundant, and Central China must beware of heavy rain. In addition, the holy baby usually enhances the typhoon activities of the Pacific Ocean. Inactive. <strong> Who broke the grain bag </strong> With the new round of holy infant phenomenon, the grain crisis cannot be underestimated. In the past, strong saints often caused major food prices such as rice, corn, and sucrose. Deputy Minister Rexestoperez said that the phenomenon of saints will affect local rice production because many farmland began to dry up before the expected drought in the second half of this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000006.png" />At present, global rice prices are at the highest level of nearly 10 years. (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06082023092848.html/4.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000007.png" /></a>At present, the global rice price has climbed to the highest level of nearly 10 years, because the major farmland of rice producing countries in China in the second half of last year was hit by rainstorms and floods in summer, and Pakistan was also severely flooded, leading to a shortage of global rice. In May this year, There were 42 rivers in 10 provinces (autonomous regions, cities) in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi, China, and the crops continued to be affected. The abnormal climate caused by climate change and the phenomenon of holy infants seriously threatens granary in various places. Wang Zhonghe pointed out that the Spanish heat waves came in advance in April this year, and the rainfall decreased significantly for three consecutive years. It is estimated that the summer farmers are expected to be 60%short. The current global food is not only facing the impact of the Russian and Urban War, but also the impact of extreme weather, so the pressure of food in the future will be greater. Not only crops, fishery fishing has also been affected. In the past, in the year of the sanctuary, squid and salmon in the Americas were reduced. Once explained in Heng, under normal circumstances, the rising flow will bring the nutrient -rich seawater from the depths of the ocean. The stages of the holy infant will inhibit this phenomenon, resulting in the change of the marine food chain. In addition, the ocean heat wave accompanied by holy infant will also exacerbate the risk of coral brutal. <strong> This child opened the pressure cooker </strong> Looking back at the strong sanctuary incident from 2015 to 2016, Wang Zhonghe said in a heavy tone that the coral reefs in the north of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia were alternately; Peru experienced disaster floods; Amazon Rain Forest The drought and fire caused 2.5 billion trees to die; Indonesia experienced a large area of forest wildfires, and carbon released to the atmosphere every day was more emitted than the entire EU burned fossil fuels in the same period; these are the Antarctic Rose ice shed in the Antarctica in January 2016. Large -scale melting behind the scenes, the melting area was larger than Texas, USA.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000008.png" />From 2015 to 2016, a strong holy infant incident, large -scale albinization appeared in coral reefs in Australia. (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06082023092848.html/5.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-02-21-04-00/000009.png" /></a>The hidden dangers of public health should not be allowed to be light -hearted, and Wang Zhonghe reminds that when the phenomenon of the saints occurs, it is easy to make the tropical popular virus reproduce and ravage in a wet and warm climate area, such as dengue fever, Han and other viruses, encephalitis, cholera, and cholera. Malaria, etc., the pressure of public hygiene rises to heating up. The pressure faced by the energy system is not small. Wang Zhonghe said that whenever the high temperature and hot waves, the demand for power continues to rise, this summer will be particularly hot and long -lasting, so the pressure is more pressure. Report, the number of household air conditioners worldwide in 2018 is 1.6 billion units, because of the influence of climate warming, it will increase to 5.6 billion units in 2050. It is estimated that the electricity consumption of air conditioners alone is equivalent to the one -year power consumption of mainland China. quantity. Under the dual threat of warming the holy babies, the climate crisis may not only smash the rice bowl, but also the earth's environment is also in a high -pressure state. This year, the holy baby suddenly opened the "pressure cooker". Can you hear the alarm?</p>

<p>Affected by the continued south of Canadian wildfire, some areas in the eastern United States are shrouded in "orange haze". On Wednesday (June 7), New York became the worst air pollution in the world.</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, according to data released by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the New York City Air Pollution Index exceeded 400 in the afternoon of the 7th and refreshed the highest record in decades. This shows that the city's air pollution is extremely serious. Following the global air quality <a href="https://www.iqair.com/">IQAIR website</a>The released data show that New York ranks first in the global air pollution cities that day.</p>
<p>New York State Governor Hochrr said at a press conference: "The current situation is very dangerous, and we are facing a crisis." She said that the New York people have never seen such a scene since the 1970s. This time air pollution is caused by Canadian wildfires. It has gradually intensified in the past 48 hours, and it is expected to affect New York for many days.</p>
<p>She called on everyone to reduce outdoor activities as much as possible and remind people who are sensitive to air quality to protect them.</p>
<p>Many American media reported that air pollution said that many places in New York were shrouded in "orange haze". The smoke permeated in these areas contains very small particulate matter. After inhalation, it can penetrate deeply into the lung tissue and enter the blood, which causes diseases such as asthma and heart disease. Considering the above -mentioned health impact, various institutions, including schools, have canceled outdoor activities.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-40-00-04-00/000000.png" />The editor-in-chief editor of Taiwan Eight Banner Culture Press, Fucha Yanhe, Taiwan ’s splendid time Southeast Asia theme bookstore provided <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/yujie/yj2-05262023103351.html/m0601-yj5ee.mp3/@@stream">Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/yujie/yj2-0526202351.html/m0601-yj5eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee .mp3/@@ stream</a><strong> As a publisher, Fucha: He has an unusual love for publishing </strong></p>
<p>Since the publishing debut "Fire and Ice" in 1998, I have published more than 80 books and translations in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and Italy, and have contacted hundreds of publishers.</p>
<p>Among this group, some people are a book vendor full of copper odor -the side of the business is more important than the book. The book is just a means of getting rich. Some people are scholars, writers, and intellectuals, and they are quite different from the market and readers. Fucha is a rare publisher who loves books and has a keen feeling for the market. He loves the publishing industry in an indifferent way. He has rare passion and focus on publishing. Only such talents are worthy of being called "publisher". Essence</p>
<p>Before arriving in Taiwan, Fucha was already the deputy editor -in -chief of Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House. Why did he abandon his career in Shanghai, and came to Taiwan from scratch? The first is for love and family -his wife as a Taiwanese has been living in Shanghai for a while, and he has always been unable to adapt. He hopes that the whole family will return to Taiwan. Secondly, it is to look forward to the freedom of publishing in Taiwan. In China, which has no freedom of publishing, no matter how big the market is, position and income, the publisher's fear and pain of walking in the minefield with handcuffs can be described as unforgettable. Scholar Zhao Yuesheng has an article about the editor -in -chief of the Sanlian Press, the founder of "Reading" magazine, and the Chinese academic publishing Mr. Shen Changwen: Shen Gong, a generation of people, is not easy in the publishing community. The publishing community of the Guo Dynasty was a large prison without walls, with only two kinds of people, jailers and prisoners. Moreover, their identity needs to be changed at any time. Few people do not have both. They are jailers today and will be prisoners tomorrow. Shen Changwen himself said that he "published it with an unyielding method" and "do not tolerate the author to talk more, especially not letting foreign authors say anything." You can imagine the appearance of Shen Gong's pillow. The responsibility of his full jailer is really because he is also a prisoner, and a jailer on his head, around him, and behind him was watching him. He sought for dozens of years, and he thought that "it was a life of cattle -style publishing, obedient, and pleasing", and it was still "the front and back of the post." But he actually had anti -bones. He was neither willing to be a jailer nor a prisoner.</p>
<p>Fucha is unwilling to become a new generation of Shen Changwen -he does not have the endurance and toughness of Shen Changwen. The new emperor in China is also more unique and naked by the old emperor. Therefore, Fucha resolutely gave up the so -called success in China and enjoyed what Harbin said in Taiwan. In Taiwan, you can choose a new ethnic group and identity. He abandoned the Han name Li Yanhe and used the Manchu name Fucha. In the island Taiwan, you can break free of chains. He founded the Eight Banners Publishing House and became the brightest brand of the "Reading Republic" in just a few years. The number and quality of humanities and social science books published by this small publishing house can be with the old -fashioned Scriptures, Times, wheatfields, and Yuanliu and other large communities.</p>
<p>Every time Fucha talked about a good book, it was endless and bright. In his opinion, in addition to the text content and ideas of good books, there are also markets and sales. He does not agree with the concepts such as "wine incense is not afraid of deep alleys" and "tunes and widows", and strives to make good books into best -selling books. He discovered and discovered the acuity of the new topic selection, one of the best in the publishers I came into contact. At the end of February and early March, before he went to China to cancel the household registration, I had a call with him. After talking about the manuscript, I talked about the child. He said that he spent a lot of time to coach his daughter's mathematics homework. I shared my son's learning experience in Thomas Jehison Technology High School in the United States "No. 1 High School". He immediately said that this is a good subject, you can write a book, eight flags come out!</p>
<p>Fucha said in an article that he has always believed that publishing is in the real estate industry. There are 23 million people in Taiwan. It is a small market, but it can become lustrous, vibrant, uniquely vitality, uniqueness, Essence The publishers in Taiwan want to get out of the misunderstanding of the "Greater China market imagination" and focus on readers on the local area. "If readers are interested in us, it is not to hear our sip, but to hear some mysterious theology. The call from each book. If the reader heard our call and came to participate with us, it is enough The broom is self -cherished. "</p>
<p>** As a friend's Fucha: He has an ancient armal intestine from the black water of Bai Mountain.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Yingshi said that he only had far -reaching and comment on politics. That's the same. Fucha has no interest in this. He only likes to publish this matter and convey knowledge, ideas and ideas by publishing. His friends did not distinguish between blue and green, and his publishing books also run through left, middle and right.</p>
<p>I and Fucha all left China in the end of Hu Jintao. I went to the United States and he went to Taiwan. With the loss of freedom of publication in Hong Kong and the collapse of the publishing industry, Taiwan has become the only place in the entire Chinese world with freedom of publishing and publishing markets. My book can only be published in Taiwan. In 2013, I visited Taiwan and met Fucha. At that time, he was pushing the book of my schoolmate Xu Zhiyuan.</p>
<p>When I met for the first time, I talked to Fucha about the book "1927: The Death of the Republic of China". He was very interested after hearing, and immediately signed a contract with me. In the past few years, Eight Banner published my "1927: Death of the Republic of China", "1927: Republican collapse", "Freedom of the Freedom Country: Liu Xiaobo's Life and Thought World", "Govern the country with common sense to rule the country with common sense, : Nine books such as the Wisdom of the Right -Piercing Merchant Trump, Da Guang Trilogy, "The Crisis of the United States", "Reform Reformists: Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Jingguo".</p>
<p>Fucha also declined my many manuscripts, most of them because the subject matter was too "sensitive" or sharp. For example, "Towards the Emperor: Xi Jinping and his Chinese Dream" and "Hong Kong Independence", Fucha bluntly told me, he dare not touch it. After he was detained by the CCP's terrible crime of "inciting the crime of subverting the state power", I checked the previous communication records and found that he once said to me: "Published your book, I have both market pressure and political pressure. It is the truth. Because the spectrum of the Eight Banners is not so politically, we just publish some books related to China, which will inevitably involve political issues. I understand that you have no taboos. The concerns of the Chinese Communist Party's pressure are mainly a generation of parents who do not ask politics or politics. They are old and sick. However, Zhao Sile's books have been rolled into some. I do n’t have the courage like you and Sile. The descendants of the Manchuria Warriors are ashamed. "I and Fucha are not only the work relationship between the author and the publisher, but also a friend who talks about it. Every time he came to Taiwan, he would treat me enthusiastically, and personally hosted a number of new books for me, and took the high -speed rail to Kaohsiung to the south of the high -speed rail, or drove to Hsinchu. Of course he will not agree with all my views, but we can always find a topic of deep chat. He has a valuable trait. He is a PhD, but he still draws new knowledge from every talker like a sponge. Of course, he will not forget to take me to taste food and watch the beauty. He once took me to the cat to drink tea, went to the Zhu Ming Art Museum at the North Coast, and went to Jinshan to buy a handmade silk quilt. He has the spirit of the Manchu people who remain in the mountains. He can reach the mountains and go down to the deep sea. He also said that he would take me to climb and make a tide. Cut the thorns.</p>
<p>After the Chinese virus was soaring, Taiwan's publishing industry was almost cut off, and Eight Banners faced huge market pressure. But Fucha never thought of leaving this "sunset industry" he loved. He believes that books will not disappear, and those who love reading will not disappear. Every time he called, he also discussed with me how to send good books to more readers. He believed that the concept could change his destiny. He also said very well that knowing that you face a lot of life pressure in the United States, so you want to sell more books and give you more taxes.</p>
<p>The publisher is like a stage, provided to the actors with different styles to perform on the stage, and let the actors (writers) interact with the audience (readers). Fucha said that his duty was to cultivate the stage greater. Today, the Communist Party of China has deprived the freedom of Fucha's body, but it cannot destroy the eight flags published and will also publish good books. I want to give the classic lines in the movie "Shawshank's Redemption" to the Fucha in the prison: "Some birds are destined to not be locked in a cage, because each of their feathers shine with the glory of freedom . "I am more convinced that Fucha will return to free Taiwan, return to my family and colleagues, and continue to publish my career. He is like Sui Qing, the publisher of the Emperor Russia, the publishing spirit of "Can't give up!To achieve the goal!" , Write his "life for books".</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-45-00-04-00/000000.png" />At the ritual of Dallanara on March 8, the tenth -year -old Tenzoba Zun Danba gave a confession to the Dalai Lama. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023141126.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-45-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>The picture is taken from VOT</p>
<p>Me: India is indeed a very complicated country, multi -nation and religion. You say that Indian strategic people do not want the Himalaya to spread Buddhism, but this world is not only military is power, and economy is power, no. If you have a gun, you have the greatest power, or if you have money, you have the greatest power, not necessarily. From the perspective of human history, religion is a greater power related to the spirit of human beings and human souls. It is born in life, can compete with weapons, and can compete with money. The power of faith is intangible and cannot be estimated. Otherwise, how many countries in the world are replaced, politicians rotate, what about guns, what about money? Religious beliefs have always existed, Buddhism has been for thousands of years, and Christian Islam has also been.</p>
<p>In addition, I also thought that it should be a very important ritual in Dallanasala during the March. At the ritual, the key rituals were also specially authorized. In fact, in the hearts of Mongolian believers, Garva Rinpoche is also important in the hearts of Mongolian believers such as Bridge, Tuwa, Carmec and other Mongolian regions. So is the incident of stigma, what response does this incident have? But we don't know yet. The relationship between Britt's regions and totalitarian countries such as Russia is destined to be sensitive areas, and now they are in the Russian and Ukraine War. Many people are killed on the battlefield and are considered by Putin's cleaning of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Friends: I know more about Mongolian countries and Mongolians. It is also more complicated and related to history. They were influenced by communist thought. After all, it has been ruled by Communist Soviet for more than 70 years, and the two generations have not been educated by Buddhist culture. But they also have historical memories. Buddhist culture is very important for them. Basically, there are three kinds of people in Mongolia. One believes that Mongolia does not need Buddhism. Mongolia has only Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan decides everything. Some people think that we are Buddhists, but we are Mongolians, so we are Mongolian Buddhists, not Tibetan Buddhists. The Mongolians have little impact on Tibetan Buddhists. Of course, some people believe in other religions.</p>
<p>The Mongolians are distributed in two countries, part of them in Russia, and partly in Mongolia. Because of the relationship with China, from economic and political considerations, many words do not say, unwilling to say. Moreover, because there is no Buddhism in seven or eighty years, although it is slowly there now, many people are still confused and cannot find their own path. If you communicate with Mongolian scholars, you can know that they have a sense of insecurity. They don't know where to go? Therefore, Mongolia does not respond to the incident of the His Holiness, which is understandable.</p>
<p>The question is not whether Mongolia should respond, or will it go to the streets. The problem is something else. As I said earlier, first of all, from a person's perspective, there is nothing wrong with the Dalai Lama. This is the fact that this is now recognized by the world. Whether it is a religious person or a scholar, such as a psychologist anthropologist, etc., the Dalai Lama has not made mistakes. Of course, some people think he is wrong, which has become a challenging issue. A person does not make mistakes, but is considered to make mistakes, so how to solve this problem? This has become a big problem. For believers, including Tibetans and the Himalayas, the Dalai Lama was originally a lama, a high -level lama, but now it has become another level of lama, a living bodhisattva. Existing divinity.</p>
<p>Some of the choices in India have two ideas: one believes that Buddhism in the Himalayas, or Tibetan Buddhism may be more conducive to India's control, so they will establish a lot of connections between the Indian government and the Dalai Lama. There is also a Tibetan Buddhism in the Himalayan region, and even further, that is, the Dalai Lamaization of the Himalayan region, so that there is uncertainty. In other words, India is not sure if the Dalai Lama is a problem one day, what will happen to the Himalayan area? Therefore, some people think that Himalayan can Tibetan Buddhism, but Himalayan should not be Dalai Lama. In the past, in the Tibetan community in exile, the exile Tibetans in the school and the temple were clearly divided into people in the Himalayas. We are Tibetans and you are from the Himalayas. There are fewer and fewer students and monks from Tibet. On the other hand, more and more people from the Himalayas are, and the education systems of schools and temples are all Tibetan culture and Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore It is inevitable to stimulate such a big response in the Himalayas. This is obviously wrong.</p>
<p>Not to mention China. Chinese decision makers are all Han. They want to use this to attack the Dalai Lama, which is completely wrong. I think the Chinese government has made a big mistake. They do not understand the influence of religion and the power of faith. They are just very rude, very simple, to handle this matter in a way of self -righteousness.</p>
<p>The Westerners' understanding of the Dalai Lama has not been as much as before, but I just heard of the name of the Dalai Lama. I have observed many Western websites and a website of more than 100,000 people related to Tibetan Buddhism. After this incident, they said that I saw the Dalai Lama more than ten years ago more than 20 years ago. , But I have forgotten it slowly, so another motivation has appeared. They want to know who the Dalai Lama is and what his thoughts are? As they understand, they realize that he is innocent, but they will support the Dalai Lama. If the Dalai Lama has made a mistake before and now makes a second mistake, it will be considered by Westerners. But the Dalai Lama is not wrong. If you do n’t accept it, it is not the problem of the Dalai Lama, but the problem of those people. Of course, many young people do not understand. They are easily affected by the publicity of the Internet, but they will soon be attracted by new hotspots.</p>
<p>Me: From April 20th to 21st, the first Global Buddhist Summit was held in Delhi. His Holiness took a plane on the 19th. On the same day, Dallanasara dropped the heavy rain. Early in the morning, he took a car to the airport before he was loud. Many people sent Hada to the rain. On the 20th, His Holiness took a day off at the hotel. Yesterday I attended the conference and made a speech. I returned to Dallanasara today, this time is very tight. From the Internet, I saw that Garva Rinpoche returned to Lan Sara from Delhi. Numerous Tibetans lined up and welcomed them, singing and dancing, and the scene was touching. It is a home, a holy place. And this is of course because of His Holiness.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-45-00-04-00/000004.png" />On April 20, His Holiness Dalai Lama presented the statue of the Buddha to the Supreme Fa of the Karga Karju. (The picture is taken from Facebook)![] [] <a href="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-45-00-04-00/000005.png"></a>](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023141126.html/66708rfa535a5ba22-003.jpeg)His Holiness met a lot of people on the day of the rest of Delhi. I noticed that there are about five photos seen from the Internet. The first group is to meet with the Supreme French king of Naigong Kaga. After leaving Lhasa, the earliest in the Radakh Customs Repair France for many years. Many temples in Radakhs are the temples of Naigong Kagawa. He has a very high prestige in Radakh. Radak's influence will be great.</p>
<p>The second group of photos was a meeting with a minister of Sikkim. He looked like a Tibetan and was also very devout. And where is Sikkim? It is a country that has been annexed by India and is now a region in India. Like Radakh, it is actually the Himalayan region of Tibetan Buddhist belief. The third group of photos is the sister of the seventeenth Karmapa. Because Karmapa's temple Rond Temple is in Sikkim, Karmapa specially published a public letter supporting the Dalai Lama. The fourth group was Ladakh officials to meet the His Holiness. He was very respectful. Like believers, he must be also a believer. There is also a group of photos of Arunecchal's head of Twitter. He has 260,000 fans. He brought the whole family to worship the respected, hoeed his head, and presented Hada. These groups of photos have deep meaning.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-45-00-04-00/000006.png" />On April 20, the chief chief of Arunachel and the family brought the family to the Lama Lama. (The picture is taken from Twitter) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023141126.html/66708rfa535a5ba22-004.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T10-45-00-04-00/000007.png" /></a>The first Global Buddhist Summit held in Delhi is important. This importance makes me think it may be the incident of the stigma of the stigma and ferment at this time. Maybe it is related to this, because some people may want to make obstacles.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw the Global Buddhist Summit's speech at the Global Buddhist Summit. I believe many people are very happy. Obviously, although His Holiness is getting older and bigger, he is 88 years old, but his thinking is agile. The scriptures are a large -scale back, and tens of minutes of speeches do not need to read manuscripts at all. Without any degradation, his wisdom is very amazing. At the summit, it is also expected. There are so many monks and scholars in the Mahayana Vajrayana, and so many scholars. This scene is as beautiful as the Buddha recorded in the scriptures and many bodhisattvas. One of the words was impressed by me: "At first glance, as far as our current situation is concerned, it is indeed false and difficult to do. In terms of, the more violations, the higher the wisdom and experience value, the more you can get close to the way to become a Buddha. Therefore, French friends must strengthen the Bodhicitta and empty opinion. This is very important. This is very important. . When you know how to turn violations into Taoism, it is equivalent to removing all violations. "</p>
<p>Of course I still get angry when I think of it. This world similar to "others is hell" requires His Holiness Dalai Lama for all compassion and love for the older life of 88 years and the future. His dedication. On the other hand, when the world's dilemma almost forgotten the Tibetan people, His Holiness Dalai Lama re -blame the world to "see" Tobert in this way. At the same time, most of the Tibetan Tibetan Buddhists who belief in Tibetan Buddhism are condensed together. It is also like Buddhism often talks about the inverse edge into a smooth fate. The facts have proven that all karma has reversed. And the emergence of this incident may be very close to the future, so I agree with what you said, this is not a bad thing but a good thing.</p>
<p>Oh, we have talked for a long time, or that's it, it will be very long if I want to sort it.</p>
<p>Friend: Okay, see you, the weather is so good. (over)</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website)Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng was invited to attend the welcome event held by the National Committee of the United States and China Trade on Wednesday (June 7), and said in a speech in a speech that he did feel that "many American friends have promoting Sino -US cooperation in cooperation between China and the United States. Stress, worry, worry about being criticized "politics".</p>
<p>Xie Feng said that "the environment is good, everyone can get rich with peace of mind." Sino -US relations have deteriorated, and the industrial and commercial circles are the first. He expressed his hope that he could communicate more. "The problem is that I am often tied to the problems in bilateral relations now, and I feel that I am not enough to work 24 hours a day."</p>
<p>He pointed out that preventing Sino -US conflicts from confrontation and the stable development of Sino -US relations is to safeguard the common interests of the two countries and peoples, or make a significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world.</p>
<p>Xie Feng said that the United States should respect the development path, political system and development rights chosen by the Chinese people, and respect the core interests and major concerns of the Chinese side. When he mentioned the issue of Taiwan, no one hoped to solve the Taiwan problem peacefully than China, and he was unwilling to see the Taiwan Strait. He criticized the "Taiwan authorities" leaning on the beauty of the beauty "and some people in the United States to make noise" to make the Taiwan China "is the biggest threat to the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait."</p>
<p>Xie Feng also said that every country attaches great importance to national security, but it cannot be generalized, and it cannot be used as an excuse to promote protectionism and curb opponents. He also secretly criticized the United States. "There is a saying in China called" Chengcheng is Spiritual ". Dialogue cooperation must respect each other and lead the results. While putting the other party on the sanctions list, it is unacceptable to ask for dialogue and cooperation." He pointed out that the gate of China's dialogue is always open. The key is that high -level exchanges are particularly "full management", "create a good atmosphere before the conversation, accumulate positive results in the conversation, and promote the implementation after the dialogue."</p>
<h3>China -U.S. warship meets the Taiwan Strait</h3>
<h3>U.S. criticizing China is increasingly "aggressive"</h3>
<p>In the Shangri -La dialogue last week, US Secretary of Defense Austin just <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国防长批北京拒绝对话-中国责任在美方/a-65815175">criticized China to dialogue on military crisis management</a>Essence At the same time, the US and Canadian warships passed through the Taiwan Strait on Saturday (June 3) and met the Chinese Navy warships in the Taiwan Strait. The United States said that Chinese warships "unsafe" interception on US warships is less than 140 meters apart. This incident has once again triggered the intensive tension between China and the United States. Earlier, the United States also accused a Chinese fighter aircraft in the international airspace in the South China Sea a few days ago.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/南海較勁美稱中國戰鬥機逼近挑釁攔截/a-65775811)Essence</p>
<p>The United States said on Monday that China's actions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea reflect the "increasingly aggressive" of the Chinese military, which increases the risk of harm. White House spokesman Johnkirby pointed out that China's interception operations are "unsafe" and "unprofessional", which can easily cause misjudgment or injuries.</p>
<p>Cerbine said that if China wants to convey the information in the region, it is unpopular in the region, or it wants US aircraft and ships to stop flying and sailing based on international law. "This is impossible."</p>
<p>The German "TagesSchau" pointed out that recent incidents show that in addition to long -term economic competition, military competition between the United States and China has also increased significantly. The United States has been dominated by military forces in the Pacific region for a long time, and they want to maintain the status quo as much as possible; while China's current military expansion and Beijing's verbal threat to Taiwan may shake this situation. But from the perspective of China, the situation is completely different. China's self -confidence has increased significantly due to economic and increasing military strength. For Beijing, Washington is the provocative side because American warships and fighter jets continue to approach Chinese territory.</p>
<h3>Interview: The United States is time to indicate the willingness to dialogue</h3>
<h3>The United States seeks "predictable relationship"</h3>
<p>Despite the upgrading of tensions, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said the Bayeon government "hopes to continue to maintain predictable relationships with China."</p>
<p>"President Bayeng made it clear that we did not seek any new Cold War, our competition could not evolve into a conflict."</p>
<p>US -China relations are in a trough. China's support for Russia in the Ukrainian war, threats on Taiwan, and continuous trade war have aroused controversy. Some independent analysts said that recent incidents show that China is adopting a more aggressive strategy to deal with the military power of the United States and its allies. On the other hand, US officials have described the Chinese army in the past year to adopt a more confrontation.</p>
<p>Derek Grossmann, a senior defense analyst at Rand Corporation, said: "China is just increasing the possibility of misjudgment-that is, accidental collision of ships or airplanes-this may evolve into armed conflict ","</p>
<p>In order to avoid such a situation, the White House spokesman Cerby said that the US President Biden will talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping again at an appropriate time. The two sides will definitely talk about the challenges of US -China relations and the opportunities in bilateral relations.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) On June 7, candidate Xiao Liang went to a test room in the center of Shanghai under the accompaniment of her mother. Facing this <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访高考制度并非中国内卷的根源/a-65852365">the most important test in your life</a>She acknowledged that she was a bit nervous to Deduanglian reporters.</p>
<p>Xiao Liang said that a few days ago, she also went to a temple with her parents to burn incense. Her mother Ms. Wang said that she hoped that the Bodhisattva would bless her daughter to go smoothly.</p>
<p>For young people in China, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國高考登場習語錄入題-考生數創新高/a-65847010">college entrance examination</a>Maybe it's just the beginning of life. Today, only academic achievements in middle schools and universities are not enough to live an ideal life. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics recently, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/毕业即失业-中国年轻人失业率居高不下/a-64834417">National Youth Unemployment Rate has reached 20.4% of the record</a>Essence <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率居高不下-靠孔乙己脱长衫解决/a-65732307">This means a large number of university graduates cannot find a job</a> 。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T10-58-00Z/65846274_404.jpg" />On June 7, candidates in Beijing encouraged themselves before entering the examination room</p>
<p>Although the 18 -year -old Liang has not yet entered the university campus, he also paid attention to this news. She told Deguanglian reporter that she was really worried about the future, because "the gold content of college diplomas is not as high as before."</p>
<p>In the past two decades, Chinese universities have been expanding the scale of enrollment, and the number of college graduates has grown rapidly each year. Today's college graduates are no longer the so -called "pride of heaven", but they are just a member of tens of millions of ordinary people. This year, 11.6 million colleges and universities across the country poured into the employment market, and this number also set a historical record.</p>
<h3><strong> Supply and demand does not match </strong></h3>
<p>Yi Fuxian, an expert in Chinese population issues at the University of Wisconsin, pointed out that China's service industry cannot provide sufficient employment positions for so many college graduates, and the industrial department cannot respond to such a high proportion of university graduates among job seekers; Many college graduates can only engage in professional non -counterparts. Yi Fuxian told Deguang Lian that this was "a huge waste of educational resources."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T10-58-00Z/57501991_404.jpg" />Among the university graduates who can not find a counterpart, many people have forced to send out takeaway in their livelihood.</p>
<p>Among college graduates who could not find counterparts, many people forced their lives to send express delivery and takeaway. Wang Dan, chief economist of Hang Seng Bank, pointed out in an interview with Deguanglian that the Chinese employment market still has sufficient labor demand, but the problem of supply and demand is more prominent. "There are too many college students studying finance in recent years, but greater demand is in other fields. In addition, manufacturing also requires technical workers who have graduated from college."</p>
<p>For example, Wang Dan said that China now urgently needs talents in artificial intelligence and industrial design, and also need to operate technical workers who can operate CNC machine tools, but the entire manufacturing industry is difficult to find labor for these requirements. She suggested that China should learn from the German vocational education and training system to keep education and industry needs closely linked.</p>
<p>At present, the combination of vocational education schools, technical secondary schools, colleges and industries is not close.</p>
<h3><strong> Slowing soldiers: study for a master's degree </strong></h3>
<p>In the Jing'an Temple in the center of Shanghai, a reporter from Deguang Lian encountered a high school graduate who did not want to disclose his name on the day of the college entrance examination. He did not take the college entrance examination because he thought that he had "poor grades and had no chance." He plans to apply for colleges and universities next year, and accumulate experience through internships this year. "I will work in a cafe and look for my own positioning." He came to Jing'an Temple to pray for friends and classmates who participated in the college entrance examination.</p>
<p>The 16 -year -old high school student Xiao Zhang also came to Jing'an Temple today. Although she has not been in the college entrance examination, she has also begun to worry about future. She told Deguanglian reporter that she plans to study for graduate students after her undergraduate undergraduate, because she is worried that "the undergraduate diploma will not find a job."</p>
<p>Studying a master's or doctoral students is the choice of many Chinese college students at the moment. They hope that when graduate graduate graduates, the Chinese employment market can provide more high -end counterparts.</p>

After the four -year sentence of Cai Jinshu, the four -year additional punishment of political rights was deprived of the four -year additional sentence. Recently, it was reported that Gulangyu, which was placed under house arrest in Xiamen. The Taiwan Sea Foundation calls for the land to protect his personal safety and legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Cai Jinshu, chairman of the "South Taiwan Cross -Strait Relations Association Federation", disappeared in 2018. In 2020, the "focus interview" program of Chinese official media CCTV was broadcast for three consecutive days. Like other political prisoners, Cai Jinshu was forced to "confess and plead guilty", saying that "the use of the intelligence bureau to make behaviors that endanger the national security of the mainland. This is a place that I was unexpected and regretted."</p>
<p>Cai Jinshu, who was sentenced to four years in prison by the Chinese court, was released from prison in May this year. However, he could not return directly to Taiwan. According to the Taiwan Media Free Times, people on both sides of the strait revealed that Cai Jinshu also deprived of political rights for four years of additional punishment. Like Li Mengju, another console spy, was not allowed to return to Taiwan for deprivation of political rights. Cai Jinshu was taken to live in Gulangyu, Xiamen.</p>
<p>In this regard, Cai Mengjun, a spokesman for the sea base, confirmed that Cai Jinshu had been released from prison on June 8 and contacted his family members and himself. She said that she will continue to pay attention to this case. In addition to calling on the land to protect his personal safety and legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law, he will continue to keep in touch with him and provide necessary assistance in time to cooperate with the needs and willingness. Regarding Cai Jinshu was placed under house arrest and could not return to Taiwan in Gulangyu, Cai Mengjun said, "There is no further explanation of the case."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-08T11-42-00-04-00/000002.png" />Taiwanese Li Mengju was forced to "plead guilty" (video screenshot/CCTV) in CCTV program after being arrested in China</p>
<p>** Taiwanese people are detained by China for additional punishment benefits.</p>
<p>Also in the Chinese service "additional punishment", Li Mengju and Cai Jinshu's treatment are still different. Li Mengju's relatives and friends once told this station that when he was released from prison, he still needed to report to the police station every month. After a period of time, big data can master his whereabouts and no longer need to report. But Cai Jinshu was arranged under house arrest in Gulangyu.</p>
<p>Li Mingzhe, a Taiwanese NGO worker who had been sentenced to 5 years in prison for the "subverted state regime case", said in an interview with this station that even if it was a Chinese native, political rights were deprived and did not include personal freedom. In fact, there are no political rights in China without any political rights. Therefore, Cai Jinshu's restrictions are in Gulangyu, which is completely expanding the law in China, but this is not unusual in China.</p>
<p>"Many Chinese political criminals were placed under house arrest after being released from prison. They were expanded and explained the additional punishment because of additional punishment. They were worried that political prisoners from prison may speak on the Internet or outside." Li Mingzhe said further. Speaking, it is restricted as political rights. "</p>
<p>Li Mengju served in July 2021 for one year and 10 months. He was deprived of political rights for 2 years and has not yet left China. Cai Jinshu is also facing the same situation. In contrast, Li Mingzhe, who is also detained in China and has been deprived of political rights for 2 years, believes that this should be related to his wife Li Jingyu and Taiwanese human rights groups who are trying to run for Li Mingzhe at home and abroad to strive for international support, but this is only because of his own. Just speculate. "The Chinese government has to make it clear, why can Li Mingzhe come back, and Cai Jinshu and Li Mengju cannot come back. Where is the standard?"</p>
<p><strong> legislator: Cai Jinshu case explains that Taiwan and China are not the same country </strong></p>
<p>DPP legislator Lin Jingyi said on the 8th of the party members of the Legislative Yuan when he was asked about related issues, "China has always used various ways to pretend that Taiwan as China is the same country as China. In fact, in these processes, we all know that. are different."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) On Wednesday, a middle -aged man wearing a pink T -shirt and a young woman in a pink skirt held in more than ten seconds of videos to go shopping in Chinese social media. The middle -aged man was exposed to the executive director, party committee secretary, and general manager of PetroChina's wholly -owned subsidiary of PetroChina, Hu Jiyong, and a young woman who was an employee of the technical department of Hu Jiyong's unit. The street shooting location is Chengdu Taikoo Li. On the same day, the public account of the WeChat public account of CNPC Beijing Project Management Company reported that Hu Jiyong, the person involved, has been removed from the executive director, party committee secretary, and general manager of the global project management company, and accepts the company's disciplinary committee for verification.</p>
<h3>Strange example?</h3>
<p>The news that Hu Jiyong was removal continued to cause heated discussions on the Internet. The former editor -in -chief of the Global Times Hu Xijin posted a Weibo at noon on June 7: "The report comes to, clear, clear. This person does not know what to stun his mind, his eyes are bold, and he is a strange example." He is a strange example. "</p>
<p>Some netizens told post, "This is too fast, I have never reached the work for a long time,"; "Is he a strange example, is it a microcosm, everyone should know it?"; "Power is the best one Aphrodisiac, this person has used the medicine for many years, and finally weird, the appraisal is complete. "</p>
<p>Some people also wrote, "Bad eyes, the crime of the wind? Just sneaky?"; "Lao Hu, you have been reminding the vested interests many times, the people who have a good night walk, why don't they listen!"; "Old Hu means that it shouldn't be so high -profile and stunned. You must quietly. "Some netizens asked," I did not say anything to verify the results, so I would be exempted directly? "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Official media such as Chinanews.com and China Securities Network also tracked the "Hand in Hand". Relevant reports revealed that the global project management company was established on October 27, 1995. It is located in Beijing with a registered capital of 30 million yuan. Project 100%holding.

The total investment of the project is nearly 30 billion yuan. On January 26, 2022, Hu Jiyong became the company's legal representative.</p>
<h3>Is not high enough?</h3>
<p>Social media hot search and official media followed quickly. Why is this "holding hands" fermentation so fast? China News Network wrote that China Petroleum official website released news in April that the tenth inspection team of the Central Committee will work in China Petroleum and Natural Gas Group Co., Ltd. for about 2 and a half months.</p>
<p>The media people and the Internet big V Kele posted on Weibo, "This is not like a sneak shot, like a follow -up shooting, it is like hiring money for close -ups. Street shooting is not illegal. .. Especially in Chengdu during the day, it was intentional. " Some netizens responded to posts, "Naka always does not understand Chengdu Taikooli. This kind of street shooting is common in Taikoo Li, Chengdu. Welcome to visit Taikoory." It is reported that after the fire of "holding hands", the parties used to be the party. In contact the photographer, he said that he had violated the right to portrait, and the video was quickly hidden, but the video had been reposted and spread a lot.</p>
<p>Netizens believe that the incident is closely related to Hu Jiyong's identity as the leader of state -owned enterprises, and it is "street shooting anti -corruption blockbuster." Some netizens commented: "Petroleum petrochemical loses money every year, it will be paid for these people"; "The reason for the loss of three barrels of oil was found."</p>
<p>There is no more information on the Internet about Hu Jiyong himself. The woman in the "Handbarians" was exposed to a lot of information. On June 8th, some media reports that the woman has also been suspended, and its Weibo has deleted all the content and sold. Previously, the Weibo account was suspected of showing off wealth. China's comprehensive news website surging news wrote in an article that this is not an ordinary "romantic affairs", it is the serious problem of disciplinary style of state -owned enterprise leading cadres and whether the state -owned enterprises have "Ren Ren", "Ren".</p>
<p>However, for Hu Jiyong's speed, some netizens speculate that this is "fighting for power, fighting for power, fighting for a dark", or "the background is not hard enough? Or is the Internet lethal power too much now, and the background dare not take risks." Some netizens think of <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/张高丽朴素清廉形象毁于一旦/a-59907682">Peng Shuai accused Zhang Gaoli sexual harassment</a>The incident also wrote: "The official level is not high enough is the main reason.</p>

<p>As the above warnings were issued, the U.S. and EU's special envoys ended their visit to Kosovo and Serbia for the tension situation. Last week, violent incidents that broke out in northern Kosova caused dozens of NATO peacekeeping forces and the Sai protesters injured.</p>
<p>After the Kosovo authorities appointed the mayor of Albania to hold the municipal duties, violent incidents broke out in the local area. After the majority of the Serians who occupied the majority of the region to resist local elections, the mayor was elected in an election with a vote rate of only 3.5%.</p>
<p>Gabriel Escobar, a special envoy in the United States, said that if Kosovo wants to further join NATO and the European Union, it should give the Syesens a greater autonomy of cities with the majority of cities.</p>
<p>Before Esco Barbourne headed to Belgrade on Tuesday, he issued a statement to the media in Kosovo that taking some measures or not taking some measures may have an impact on some relationships between Kosovo and the United States.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-08T12-11-35/image-1686225495.jpg" />The United States and the EU special envoy visits Kosovo(news agency)Neither Escobar and EU Special EU Miroslav Lacheck did not explain in detail. If their requirements were not responded, then the "Prime Minister" Albin Kulti, which is mainly Albania, may be the Kosova government. What other consequences will face.</p>
<p>Kulti told reporters on the 7th, "I don't think these things can be resolved through pressure and consequences and even sanctions."</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union demanded that Kurdi relieved the newly appointed mayor and withdrew the special police forces in the northern cities.</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union also demanded that Kosovo held a new, Saiye participation in the northern region, and required Kosovo to implement an agreement reached in 2013, that is, the establishment of a Serbian city alliance and giving the organization more autonomous power.</p>
<p>Kosovo's "President" Vozosa Osmanani said on the 7th that she was open to hold a new municipal election in the major regions of the Series.</p>
<p>Osmanani said in an exclusive interview with Reuters that she believes that petitions are the "most democratic way" to start the new election -this will ensure that the Citizen citizen's participation is because they will make a request. But she also pointed out that before the new election was held, Kosovo hoped that the international community would stop Serbia's intervention.</p>
<p>Osmani added that Kosovo hoped that the NATO forces still stayed on its territory before it officially joined NATO.</p>
<p>NATO has nearly 4,000 soldiers in Kosovo. Due to the continuous upgrade of local violence, NATO has ordered to send 700 soldiers to the local area.</p>

<p>The European Foreign Relations Commission surveyed more than 6,000 people in 11 EU members in April <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/keeping-america-close-russia-down-and-china-far-away-how-europeans-navigate-a-competitive-world/">Display</a>Although Beijing is moving closer to Moscow, although Ukraine has had a war, most Europeans still regard China as "a necessary partner."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>According to public opinion surveys, if the military conflict between the two big powers is upgraded, most people in all 11 countries are unwilling to support the United States to fight against China, but want to maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia is increasingly regarded as rivals or opponents, and about 64%of the respondents hold this view, and in <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/crisis-of-confidence-how-europeans-see-their-place-in-the-world/">a public opinion survey in 2021</a>This ratio is about one -third.</p>
<p>"Europeans obviously saw the Russian -China Alliance, thinking that it was targeted at the West, but they had different attitudes towards China and Russia," said Ana Poglin, the co -author of the investigation report. "Only when China provides weapons to Russia, the situation will change."</p>
<p>In fact, if Beijing provides a large number of military assistance to Russia invading Ukraine, 41%of Europeans support economic sanctions against China, and 33%of them oppose this measure.</p>
<p>The error amplitude of the survey in a larger country is two percentage points of positive and negative, and the error amplitude in smaller countries is three percentage points of positive and negative.</p>
<p>Although I hope to cooperate with Beijing on global issues such as climate change, according to the European Union's strategic document "<a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/strategic_compass_en3_web.pdf">strategic compass</a>"European leaders officially regarded China as" systemic opponents "and" economic competitors ".</p>
<p>European Commission Chairman Feng Delin's at the end of March <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_2063">Speech</a>China has adopted a tough position for Beijing, saying that China is entering a new era of "security and control". Its policy is to "divide the law". Europe must "de -risk" for key departments to make it no longer relying on China.</p>

<p>Pig Leirin said that Feng Delin's point of view is closer to the Bayeon government's point of view, but European public opinion is closer to Macron's point of view.</p>
<p>However, Macron's remarks after visiting China in April received <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230412/macron-china-allies/">wide criticism</a>He said that Europe should not be a "follower" on the Taiwan issue, or "let us adapt to the rhythm of the United States and the excessive response to China."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>He said that the crisis that "not belonging to us" will fall into "traps set for Europe." Europeans should continue to develop their own strategic autonomy and become the "third pole" of world order, rather than adventure to become the "vassal" of the United States and China confrontation. Like Souls, Macron dull the competition, saying that China is a "strategy and global partner."</p>
<p>However, although France is the main partner of Beijing, "the reality is that the fantasy of French companies in the Chinese market has been shattered, and the long -term prospects of the China -French economic partnership are also dim." Chinese problem scholar Lu Ke(Philippele correct)warn.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the most important discovery of this survey is that French interviewees are quite negative about China. Only 31%of the French and 33%of the Germans regard China as a "partner", and 50%of the Germans And 41%of the French people regard China as opponents or opponents.</p>

<p>This seems to make the two leaders face greater challenges in China -although they are more consistent with Europe, it may make Germany more likely to reduce serious dependence on Chinese trade, especially in the key automobile industry.</p>
<p>Lu Ke said that in other respects, Europeans either "basically do not care" or be cautious, especially for China's investment in European infrastructure, technology companies and media. "Europeans do not want China to increase direct investment -'Belt and Road'," Luke said. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20200120/china-belt-and-road/">"Belt and Road" refers to the plan to promote the construction of ports, railways and telecommunications networks in all parts of the world</a>Essence</p>
<p>The co -author of the report, Pavier Zelka, pointed out that his views on Russia have become tough. Most people regard Russia as opponents. Even if they traditional France and Italy in Russia traditionally big.</p>

<p>About half of the respondents believe that even if Ukraine realizes peace, the relationship with Russia should be "limited" in the future. But in Bulgaria and Hungary, most respondents regard Russia as "allies" or "partners", and they are generally willing to cooperate with Moscow after the war.Pig Leirin said that in general, "Europeans are happy to praise cross -Atlantic relations. They think that benefits are greater than disadvantages, but they do not think it is accompanied by obligations." They did not see that Taiwan was regarded as a basic component of the US strategy as a basic component of the US strategy. It does not think that Taiwan is related to Ukraine. "In addition, they do not think that Taiwan is related to the Pacific Channel that the European Trade depends on.</p>
<p>"Few people realize that after the United States has invested so much in Europe, there will be problems without standing in the United States," she said. "They regard neutral as a choice."</p>

<p>The flood burst out of the large dam of Khahofka, a port in southern Ukraine. The rescue organization of the Red Cross International Committee warned that this brought a catastrophic impact on the landmine positioning work in the flood drowns.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that Eriktollefsen, director of the Red Cross International Committee's weapon pollution department, said: "We originally knew where there was dangerous, now we don't know." He said that what they know now is only a downstream of a certain downstream. Some places are dangerous. This will not only affect residents, but also affect all those who go to rescue.</p>
<p>When Poruffon delivered a speech on Wednesday (June 7), the committee showed a new type of drone equipped with artificial intelligence. This drone uses artificial intelligence to locate them according to the heat from the landmines and other wars.</p>
<p>This drone can complete the area for six months within one day, but it is currently only tested in Jordan. The committee hopes to use this drone for the first time near Aleppo in northwestern Syria this year.</p>
<p>The Red Cross International Committee has been assisting Ukraine for minesweeper for many months, including marking lightning areas and providing training and equipment.

Diplomatic activities, this will be a diplomatic breakthrough. It is reported that two of the sources who requested anonymous because they were not authorized said that Wu Zhaozheng was expected to visit the EU headquarters Brussels, but refused to disclose the details. The other two sources said that he would also visit the Czech capital Prague. A source revealed that Wu Zhaozheng will attend a security meeting held in Prague on June 14 and will speak after the opening of the Czech President Pavil, and then delivered a speech. In view of the fact that European leaders usually do not have the same stage with senior Taiwanese officials, this seems unusual. The Taiwan Foreign Ministry refused to comment on Wu Zhaozheng's European travel plan. Pavil's office did not answer a call for comment. Wu Zhaozheng visited Brussels in a low -key manner in 2021, as well as Czech and Slovakia. He also delivered a speech at the Copenhagen Democratic Summit in Denmark in 2019.

According to U.S. officials familiar with highly confidential intelligence, Cuba has reached a secret agreement with China, allowing China to establish electronic eavesdropping stations on its islands. China has agreed to pay billions of dollars to Cuba with tight funds for this. According to exclusive news from the Wall Street Journal, Cuban eavesdropping facilities, located about 100 miles from Florida, will enable the Chinese intelligence department to eavesdo electronic communications in the southeast of the United States with many military bases and monitor American ship traffic. As Cuba was close to the United States, the plans were found to be alert within the Bayeng government. The United States regards Beijing as its most important economic and military competitors.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-08T13-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />In 2018, the two sides began to negotiate for free trade from chemical products to cosmetics, etc., but because Australia insisted on the names of their alcohol, cheese and pickled meat, the negotiations were repeatedly stuck in the final stage.</p>
<p>The famous European producers that pursue protectiveism have advocated that only cheese from specific regions of France can be called Roquefort Cheese, and GOUDACHEESE must be produced in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Although this agreement is expected to bring huge economic interests, Australia refuses to concessions, and Agricultural Minister Murray Watt refers to the controversy of relevant naming rights as "emotional issues."</p>
<p>He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC): "This is not only an emotional problem for European manufacturers, but also an emotional problem for Australian manufacturers."</p>
<p>"After World War II, many people immigrated from Europe to Australia. Our manufacturers bring their products from the motherland and produce here."</p>
<p>Watt said that if Australia "cannot talk about a good agreement, then we better give up."</p>
<p>The European Union provided a list to Australia, which listed more than 400 product names for the EU, including Feta Cheese, Prosciutto Diparma, and Irish Cream Spirits.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Australia will abandon the naming instead in exchange for more concessions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Australia hopes that this free trade agreement will reduce the high tariffs imposed on many agricultural exports, while the European Union hopes to reduce its dependence on trade partners such as Russia.</p>
<p>Watt said that although the negotiations were in a deadlock, the two sides still agreed to "continue to negotiate." (Translator: Liu Wenyu/Calculating Draft: Chen Zhengyi)</p>

<p>"Guardian" in this article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/whistleblower-ufo-alien-tech-spacecraft">Report</a>According to China, former American intelligence official David Grush, who was responsible for leading the analysis of the Pentagon's abnormal phenomenon, confirmed that the US government had a non -human source spacecraft.</p>
<p>This report quoted the US news website "DEBRIEF" that Grush said that the information related to these spacecraft had been illegally concealed by the US Congress. He also said that when he transferred confidential information about the spacecraft to the US Congress, he Has been retaliated by government officials and resigned from public office in April this year, and he had previously worked in the American intelligence department for 14 years.</p>
<p>This report added that the National Aerospace Intelligence Center, which is responsible for analyzing the abnormal phenomenon that cannot be explained(NASIC)Jonathan Gray, an current American intelligence official, also confirmed the existence of "unknown material" to the media.</p>
<h4>Interesting interest in unknown space objects</h4>
<p>The British "Guardian" pointed out that before revealing this information, a wave of witnesses and reliable reports in recent years has re -ignited people's interest in unknown flying objects and even alien creatures.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that in 2021, the Pentagon issued an abnormal phenomenon report (the competent department prefers to use this word rather than an unknown flight), which contains more than 140 unprepared phenomena.</p>
<p>The report of the Pentagon was released after some military leak leaks occurred in the air, which seemed to be unpredictable, and the naval pilot also testified that they had encountered unknown flights on the United States coast.</p>
<h4>A good and non -destructive spacecraft</h4>
<p>Gruh said in an interview with the "Debrief" website that for decades, the US government and national defense contractors have been recycling non -human sources of spacecraft fragments, and in some cases, they can even get intact or partial spacecraft.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-08T13-36-10/image-1-1686231038.jpg" />Unknown flight(Social networking site)Grush told the website that the analysis of these objects can determine that they come from "unknown sources", which means that they are manufactured by non -human intelligence, whether it is aliens or the origin of unknown. He also added that the assessment was made based on the form of spacecraft, material science testing, and atomic arrangement and radioactive characteristics.</p>
<p>Jonathan Gray confirmed Grush's statement and added that the phenomenon of non -human intelligence was real. He also pointed out that the United States is not the only country that has these things, but we still fail to find a global solution.</p>
<h4>A reputation</h4>
<p>The Guardian pointed out that the reporter of the "Debrief" website learned about his character from several former colleagues in Grush. Among them, Colonel Karl Nel, a retired Army, said Grory's reputation was outside. In a 2022 performance evaluation held by the website, Gruh was described as "a military officer with the most powerful morality."</p>
<p>Nick Pop, who had investigated abnormal phenomena for the British Department of Defense in the early 1990s, said that Gruh and Gray's description of these abnormal phenomena was "extremely important" because they were real people.</p>
<p>Nick Pope added that when these people filed a formal appeal, their approach was based on such a fact that if they deliberately provided false statements, they would face huge fines or were imprisoned.</p>
<h4>What is worth paying attention to</h4>
<p>Pop went on to say that it is unusual to do this to do this to the Congress and the Intelligence Supervisor, because if they are not true, they will face the consequences of unimaginable imagination.</p>
<p>The "DeBrief" website reported that Grush's understanding of the material and spacecraft of non -human sources came from his close conversation with high -level intelligence officials, and he had told Congress to exist in "plans to obtain unknown material", " And the plan is carried out on all levels. He also knows a specific personnel of the project, including his current and predecessor.</p>
<p>The Guardian pointed out that in June 2021, a report from the Office of the National Intelligence Director said that from 2004 to 2021, military pilots encountered 144 abnormal incidents, of which 80 incidents were through multiple sensors. In these 144 incidents, only the "highly credible" explanation was obtained together, and it was a large -scale balloon.</p>

<p>Germany accused Russian President Putin from destroying the [Khahofka Dam] in Ukraine(https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/world/story20230606-1401870)Other European members in Europe also condemned this as "the crime of war."</p>
<p>The German Defense Secretary of Defense Pistorius, who visited Mumbai on Wednesday (June 7), told reporters: "This is an obvious sin of war ... This is an incredible violence and destruction. Putin can't do it. "</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that German Prime Minister Tsutz directly accused Russia, saying that Moscow destroyed the dam to prevent Ukraine from launching a long -standing counterattack. He said that this is "the latest one of the countless crimes we saw in Ukraine."</p>
<p>A Western official said on Tuesday that other allies, including the United States, are still evaluating who is responsible, but they tend to Russia. Analysts believe that Moscow will benefit the most military, because the flood drowns the potential attack channels of the Ukrainian army, making it unable to pass.</p>
<p>The Kremlin denied the execution of the attack and pointed out that Ukraine was the black hand behind the Carhofka Hydropower Station.</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Agency quoted the Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov that Putin ordered the emergency minister to organize the work to help and eliminate the consequences of disaster. He blamed the disaster on the "destruction of the Kiev Government".</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Sonak said. The British military and intelligence agencies are trying to determine who should be responsible. He said: "We have seen Russia have deliberately attacked civilian infrastructure many times."</p>
<p>During his visit to Washington, he said to Talktv: "I think this is very abominable. If this attack is indeed intentional, this will break through the bottom line representing Russia's barbaric behavior."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65861392/62238410"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T14-16-00Z/62238410_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The New Zurich News reported that in April this year, after the French President Macron finished visiting China, it said that in the Taiwan Strait crisis, Europe should not become the vassal of the United States because the "Taiwan crisis is not us. Crisis ". His remarks caused extensive controversy and criticism in European countries. However, the latest poll released shows that among the European people, Macron's "non -participation theory" has a high degree of support. This article entitled "Europe to Maintain Neutrality in the Sino -US conflict":</p>
<p>"Most people in the European Union hold a similar point of view to Macron: They do not want their country to get involved in military conflicts between China and the United States. In their opinion, it is not so important to say that China is an indispensable The lack of partners. And they don't think that because the United States has actively showing a positive performance in NATO, Europe should strengthen the participation of Indo -Pacific affairs.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of the latest polls of the European Council of Diplomacy, the European Foreign Relations Council. About 60%of interviewees believe that Europe should maintain neutrality, and only 23%of the respondents believe that once China and the United States start war, Europe should support the United States. The writers of the polls Jana Puglierin and Pawel Zerka wrote: 'Although the United States has made many efforts in fighting against Russian aggression, only Europeans believe that Europe responds to this. '</p>
<p>The polls of the European Foreign Relations Council were carried out among 11 member states of the European Union in April this year, with a number of interviewees of about 16,000. The focus of the questionnaire survey is what positions should Europe be adopted in the moment when the US -China and Russia's 'big country competition' is becoming increasingly intensified. "</p>
<p>The questionnaire survey shows that after the fifteen months of the Wharpy War in Russia, two -thirds of Europeans regard Moscow as their opponents or opponents. They also agree with the European Union's suspension of Russia's natural gas and the decision to sanction in Russia.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-08T14-16-00Z/64953196_401.jpg" />The President of the European Commission, Feng Delin, called for promoting the "de -risk" policy to China.</p>
<p>"However, on the question of how to view China, most Europeans hope to adopt cooperative policy -oriented policies. They do not agree with the tough policies of the European Commission Chairman Feng Delin. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/冯德莱恩欧盟需要一致的对华战略/a-65357710">This spring, Feng De Ryan accuses Beijing for trying to change international order and call on EU member states to reflect on their respective policies to China. "</a>The latest polls of the European Foreign Relations Council also attracted the attention of the "South Germany Will". The newspaper wrote:</p>
<p>"There are many discussions on how to deal with Beijing recently, and it will also become a topic of the EU Summit at the end of June. Feng Delin, chairman of the European Commission, accused China of consciously using 'economic dependence and economic impact' to make weak countries The only life is from, so Feng Delin calls for reducing dependence on China in order to achieve the "risk" purpose. But the opposite, French President Macron and German Chancellor Salz are open to cooperation with China. . According to the European Foreign Relations Council experts' generalization of poll data: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体马克龙的超级大国梦分裂西方/a-65281213">Macron's support is higher than the von derine.</a>Beginning in 2019, the European Union has positioned China as 'opponents, competitors and partners', but for the EU people, China is first of all a 'necessary partner'. Nevertheless, many Europeans do not agree with China to purchase ports, high -tech companies or media institutions in their country. In Germany, the proportion of people holding this position is 70%, which is higher than the average level of EU countries.</p>
<p>However, the questionnaire also shows that once China exports weapons to Russia, 41%of the respondents believe that the European Union should impose sanctions on China and is willing to bear economic losses for this. However, once a military conflict between China and the United States had a military conflict due to Taiwan, the Europeans' position is very clear: nearly two -thirds of the respondents believe that Europe should not intervene and should not provide support for the United States.

It was suddenly aware that some of the main characteristics of the "Helsinki Agreement" era in the late Cold War in the last century had appeared in contemporary China.</p>
<p><strong> Three, "</strong> <strong> Herbinym time </strong> <strong>" </strong> <strong> has come to China </strong></p>
<p><strong> What is the "Helsinki Agreement"? </strong></p>
<p>In the Cold War era, in order to ease tensions, the two major camps in the East and the West signed the famous Helsinki agreement on August 1, 1975. The documents involved the disarmament of the disarmament, the military deployment of European, and only changing the European regional boundaries in peacetime and based on international law, as well as issues of economic and trade, industrial and scientific and technological cooperation, humanistic exchanges and environmental protection issues. In addition, it is specifically mentioned in chapters 7 ** that signed countries should respect human rights, religious and faith in accordance with the UN Charter and World Human Rights Declaration.</p>
<p><strong> The background generated </strong></p>
<p>At that time, the major environment of the Soviet Union may cause the Soviet Union to be unwilling to fight, so he was willing to sign the Helsinki agreement with the West. East -West needs to ease. The Communist Party has a one-party monopoly regime, which has caused the Soviet social atmosphere to be very abnormal. Khrushchev's goal of achieving communism in 1980 to the Blogennevi era was not realized at all. What's more, while people think that the level of living has declined, in the competition with the West, the Soviet Union has begun to fall behind in economics, technology, culture, and many areas.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the conflict between the Sino -Soviet border in 1969, the two major Communist countries in the world played a big deal, and the socialist camp was divided, and the Soviet Union's status in the international communist camp was weakened. In particular, the thawing of US -China relations was later to avoid being isolated.</p>
<p>The West also faced the large -scale civil rights movement in China at that time, as well as the economic crisis, and the United States fell into the Vietnam War. In addition, the US -Soviet nuclear military power was basically the same at the time, and the continuous arms competition became meaningless. Therefore, in 1973, the European Security and Cooperation Conference began to promote the two major camps from East and West to from confrontation to cooperation. Except for Albania, almost all European countries and the United States and Canada attended the meeting. After two years of talks, the Helsinki agreement was finally signed.</p>
<p><strong> The historical function and consequences of the "Helsinki Agreement" </strong></p>
<p>After Mikhail Gorbachev took the Soviet Union, the Helsinki agreement had a significant impact in the political life of the Soviet Union at that time.</p>
<p>The Helsinki Agreement has a special chapter specifically mentioned ** human rights and freedom. This is a spiritual fermentation agent. It provides support and basis for the rise of the wave of large -scale democratic movements in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The collapse of local communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Former Soviet Union was a multi -ethnic country, Ukrainians in the territory, various ethnic groups in the Baltic Sea, Crimea, and Soviet Jews, etc. At that time, they were actively striving for their own national rights. The Helsinki Agreement also mentioned that the signed countries should respect the local minority groups, and their rights should be protected.</p>
<p>At that time, the Soviet Communist Party authorities were eager to sign the Helsinki agreement to concession to the West, and let the West join the relevant human rights chapters in the agreement. Some Russian media later commented that Blieniev and his assistants could not think of this document when signing this document. More than ten years later, communism will collapse, and the Soviet Union will disintegrate. Essence The Soviet leaders simply did not take care of the West at that time, and even sneered, thinking that the West was naive and ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong> _ 1_ </strong> <strong> <em>) Provide legal basis for freedom of association and freedom of speech</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the time, there were public opinion in the West that the Soviet Union had more profits from the West by using the Herbinyl Agreement. However, the later historical development proof is precisely the human rights chapter in this document to laid a foreshadowing for the later historical process. For the large number of democracy in Eastern Europe, the organization and movement of the Communist Party, including the unity of the unity of the Communist Party, including the Poland, including Poland, including Poland, including Poland's unity union. The Czech Charter 77 provides support and legal basis.</p>
<p>Even more studies believe that in the wave of democratization in Eastern Europe, the impact of the Helsinki agreement may exceed Western economic sanctions and geopolitics against the Soviet Union. Human rights have become foreign policy tools for the first time.</p>
<p>Less than a year after the Herbinky agreement was signed, the Moscow Hernesons Club first announced its establishment on May 12, 1976. Subsequently, Ukraine and Lithuania, Georgia and Armenia's Helsinki Clubs were established.</p>
<p>Former Czech president, the well -known person with different politicians, Harveil, served as the chairman of the Czech Herbinky Club in January 1977. Harveil later pushed the Czech Charter 77. Because of the influence of the Helsinki agreement, the well -known Polish politicians from physicists, at that time, still formed the Polish Defense Workers' Council, who was still holding different politicians. Later, he became the leader of the Helsinki club in Poland. Characters are invested in the unity of the union movement. After the unity of the union's ruling, Romanvski has been elected as members and deputy speaker of Polish Parliament many times.</p>
<p>After the signing of the Helsinki agreement, in Soviet cities such as Moscow, Leninrad, there were some special open -air places. Many people who cared about politics gathered there to discuss the current situation.</p>
<p>After Gorbachev's administration, the Helsinki agreement, especially in the political life of the Soviet Union at the time. Because there were a large number of non -governmental organizations established in the people at the time, these organizations usually cited and based on the Helsinki agreement.</p>
<p><strong> _ 2_ </strong> <strong> _) _ </strong> _ Main work: verification_ _ reveal the Soviet Union's violations_. _ As an international agreement, it is binding on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe_</p>
<p>After the signing of the Helsinki agreement, the CPSU authorities believed that it was an important diplomatic victory. At that time, the objections specially paid attention to the human rights part, but felt that the statement was weak and could not be compared with the world human rights declaration.</p>
<p>However, although the content of the world human rights declaration is good, there is no binding force on many countries. However, the Helsinki agreement is an international treaty, which violates the content, which is equivalent to the Soviet Union's violation of the international agreement.</p>
<p>The work of the Moscow Herneson Club when it was founded was to verify the situation of the Soviet Union's violation of the Helsinki agreement, and issued news briefings to introduce the specific cases one by one to report the international community, especially Western countries. For example, illegal trials are arrested for reasons for reasons such as different political stances, religious positions, or members of the Herbonia Club in other regions of the Soviet Union. "Because the main propaganda tone of the Soviet Union at the time was to defend peace and freedom and opposed the war, it was exposed to violate the agreement, which made the Soviet Union very embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong> Fourth, China, in the face of the strong enclosure and isolation of the United States and the West (with formal league contracts and intangible public opinion), it has entered the era of the "Hernesie Agreement" similar to the former Soviet Union </strong></p>
<p>The CCP violates (or ignores) the international treaty and agreement. There are many things, and it is difficult to book, such as: the joint statement of China and Britain (about Hong Kong), which has been filed in the United Nations, and rejected the special court of the Hague arbitral tribunal. The arbitration case proposed by the South China Sea violated a series of commitments signed by China in 2001 to steal the intellectual property rights of other countries and implement economic, foreign coercion and military harassment deterrent to Taiwan and other countries. Implementing large -scale racial persecution or even extinction in Xinjiang ...The international community's compassion for maintaining peace and freedom to be backdoed, which is essentially equivalent to the restrictions and warnings of the Herbin -ky agreement of the former socialist camp. Western requires Beijing to abide by the "rules -based international order" since World War II, which has a real restraint, because as a backing, the only language that the CCP understands -democratic countries far exceed the strength of the CCP.</p>
<p><strong> Fifth, Xi Jinping's response in the era of the "Helsinki Agreement" and its destiny </strong></p>
<p><strong> Reverse Operation Ge's </strong></p>
<p>Faced with the pressure and warnings of the Herbinyl Agreement performed by the United States and Western allies to Xi Jinping's political power, in order to avoid the fate of the former Soviet Union, Xi Jinping's basic response is: reverse operation Gorbachev's "New Deal":</p>
<p>If Gorbachev faces west, Xi Jinping will facing east; "new thinking" for Gorbachev, Xi Jinping's old thinking of "party leadership"; "The" seven non -speaking "operated by Xi Dai and the world's most severe Great Wall firewall and speech monitoring and suppression; ............ As a result, in fact, Gorbachev has become a mantra for Xi Jinping's political behavior, and it has become a "inverse dogmatic" that he has never remembered. It dominates Xi's thinking mode and behavior. Yue Lei Chi is one step.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping "see everything Gorbachev does as a textbook that should not be done."</p>
<p><strong> Bow breaks the political death </strong></p>
<p>To be paradoxically, instead of its original intention, the result of Xi Jinping's reverse behavior was in different ways. It drove the current situation of China to the similar situation of internal affairs and diplomacy in the former Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991, and even the difficulty of the CCP's internal and external difficulties. It also surpassed the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>To this day, Xi Jinping is already angry and grievances. The domestic high pressure continues, the economy falls, and the thousands of husbands are pointed out; foreign swords are tense, threatened to be close to neighbors, economic coercion, and became a public enemy. From the perspective of economic, politics, diplomacy, etc., Xi Jinping's gang holds the Chinese Communist Party with internal and external problems. It's a bureau. In fact, whether the internal resentment of the Soviet Union at that time or the hostileness of relations with Western countries such as the United States and Europe was better than the current Xi Jinping regime. Xi was too tight to the bow of the struggle. He lacked political wisdom and did not understand the way of culture and martial arts. Blindly tight, it will eventually break. Xi Yue wanted to get rid of the fate of the Soviet Union, but his inverse and hesitation quickly moved to the unavoidable fate.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping has been more hostile to encounter than Gorbachev, and the ending will be more extreme. It drives the current situation of China to quickly move towards the ultimate situation of internal affairs and diplomacy of the former Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991. It is estimated that it is no longer needed for 14 years from the signing agreement to Su Dongbo.</p>
<p><strong> Two 74 -year </strong> **</p>
<p>Compared with the history of the Communist Party of China and the CPSU, there is a meaningful number: the first Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, and 1917, which was originally established in 1917, was 74 years; In 1949, it was also 74 years. What do these two same numbers mean?</p>
<p>Of course, we don't think that the number of these two regimes must be the same, but the difference may not be too large.</p>
<p>However, one thing can be determined that as the two national leaders who are in the opposite direction in their later years, although they are Communists, Gorbachev's contribution to human beings has been determined and carried out in history. On the contrary,.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230606-1401606">Khakhofka Dam was blown up</a>As a result, part of the waters of the Dieber River could not be navigable, and Ukraine lost an important agricultural export route.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the Ukraine National Shipping Bureau issued a statement on Thursday (June 8th) that the Dieber River is the "great artery" of the Ukraine River transport, and the Khahofka vessels are the last Niebie vessels that let all ships out of the sea. After the dam was blown, the export portal of Ukraine was actually blocked.</p>
<p>The Ukraine Bureau said that about 50 ships in the Khahofka Reservoir were stranded and the water level was declining. The authorities are trying to transfer the stranded vessel to the upper reaches of the Dieber River in Zapolo. The ships can be navigated upstream, but the downstream will take a while to resume sailing.</p>
<p>Ukraine is an important global producer of food and oil seeds, but the export volume of Wu Grain has been from <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/e-wu-zhan-zheng">Russia and Ukraine War</a>Since the outbreak, it has dropped sharply. The Dieber River was previously a fast and cheap grain and oil transportation route. It can be shipped to the Black Sea Port by the barrier, or it can be shipped directly to the buyer by the river vessels.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, several black sea ports in Ukraine were blocked. In July last year, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations reached the "Black Sea Grain Export Initiative" to assist Ukraine to continue exporting food from the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Although the initiative has been postponed again last month, <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230605-1401504">the prospect is still unclear</a>Therefore, losing the Ling River's route has become another problem in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition, the Russian side said on Wednesday (7th) that Black destroyers bombed the Taliadi Adessa ammonia for ammonia for ammonia. The Kremlin said on Thursday that the incident would only have a negative impact on the "Black Sea Grain Export Initiative", making the initiative more complicated.</p>

<p>Description: On Tuesday (June 6), a number of major US media reported that US Secretary of State Anthony Blintken is expected to visit China in the next few weeks. Recently, the Biden government has sent several senior officials to visit Beijing. If Brinken is successful, this will be the first visit to China since the outbreak of the US -China tension caused by the Chinese spy balloon incident earlier this year. These signs make the outside world seem to see the US -China relations falling into the trough. American experts and scholars have different reactions. Some scholars believe that the US contact policy in China in the past half century has failed, but the Bayeng government is still chasing to talk to Beijing; but some experts believe that maintaining contact is the top priority of preventing conflicts. The Chinese competition plus dialogue is a "more accurate and rigid" policy of China.</p>
