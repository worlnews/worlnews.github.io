"

Long -term attention to the situation of Guo Feixiong's case and the human rights situation of Chinese human rights situation, Zhou Feng Suo, the chairman of the Chinese human rights situation, emphasized that before the sentence was sentenced, Guo Feixiong had caused his family to "wife away" due to two jails.

He said: "Guo Feixiong was sentenced to 8 years in prison because of his request to visit his dangerous wife.
Yang Maoping revealed to DW that because Guo Feixiong was arrested this time, he has been on a hunger strike, so his weight has dropped from 67.5 to 75 kg to 45 kg.

Very emotional. He often wrote to his father through me, and I would also transfer Guo Feixiong's letter to them. But because he was more introverted, and because he had never seen his dad herself, Guo Feixiong was The sentence of sentence is a great blow to him. "
 Yang Maoping said that because Guo Feixiong has been arrested this time, he has been on a hunger strike, and his weight has dropped from 67.5 to 75 kg to 45 kg.
In fact, because the families of most rights protection lawyers or disagreements continue to face government threats in China, many wives of rights protection lawyers will eventually be forced to take their children in exile overseas. However, because most of the rights protection lawyers or disagreements expire, most of them will face the exit ban imposed by the Chinese government, which also causes families of most rights protection lawyers to face long -term unable to gather after their wives and children choose to exile overseas.Zhou Fengsuo called on the international community to continue to voiced cases of the government's detained or sentenced by the government, because in view of the Chinese government's influence in the international community in recent years, they will pose a threat to the world. He said: "In the past few years, some countries led by the United States have begun to wake up and have a relatively clear and pragmatic view on the Chinese government. But I still want to remind people who do business with the CCP. Maintain this regime and help them to do evil. I hope Guo Feixiong's case can make the world realize this. "
He added that in the case of a number of disagreements including Xu Zhiyong, Ding Jiaxi and Guo Feixiong, the Chinese government was facing an unprecedented challenge in the case of heavy sentences of the Chinese government. He said: "Whether it is the power of the state machine or the fineness of the CCP's high -tech, it is difficult for a few people tracked by the Chinese authorities to gather in the current circumstances. However It is difficult to last. So no matter how miserable the Chinese authorities ’suppression of the disagreements, many people will try to seek freedom."

 Taiwanese soldiers who monitor Chinese military operations
(Voice of Germany)) As the Washington Post quoted a It is said that Taiwan will be difficult to deal with air strikes from China, which has made Taiwan's air defense capabilities focus in recent weeks.
The disclosed document in April mentioned that Taiwanese officials suspected whether their air defense system could "accurately detect missile launch from China", and Taiwan's military aircraft did not have enough "full task ability". The document also emphasizes that Taiwan's fighter jets may become the goal of Chinese missile attacks because it takes at least a week to transfer them to a safe place.
The Taiwan Department of Defense said that the US media reported "not a fact" and emphasized that Taiwan has made appropriate modifications on the combat plan, and also continued to strengthen its military preparation. Some analysts said that the leaked documents underestimated Taiwan's "powerful" missile defense capabilities. Tonyhu, a senior director of the Ministry of Defense China, Taiwan and Mongolia Office, said that Taiwan's long -range warning radar and space warning can be found in a few seconds. system.
Is Taiwan the ability to fight a large number of Chinese military aircraft? 
Nevertheless, people still have some doubts about the overall air defense capacity of the island. One of the reasons is Essence According to the ranking of military capabilities of various countries based on the military website "Global Firepower": the Chinese People's Liberation Army has more than 3,000 military aircraft and nearly 400,000 air force personnel, while Taiwan has only more than 700 military aircraft and more than 30,000 Air Force soldiers.
However, experts told DW that although China's advantages in air strength can suppress air defense in some areas of Taiwan, Taiwan can use air defense missiles to resolve the gap. Su Ziyun, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, pointed out: "In the Ukrainian war, although there is a huge gap between the number of military aircraft in Ukraine and the Russian Air Force, Ukraine can use short -range stab missiles to obtain some air defense capabilities."
 Because Taiwan has remote, medium -range and short -range air defense missiles, Su Ziyun believes that this Essence He said: "Although they only have short -range missiles, Ukraine has done a good job in air defense. Taiwan has a wider air defense missile, so I believe that it can be done better in terms of air defense."
According to data released by the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) in 2021, the Taiwan's missile plan is mainly composed of six different range of missiles-Tianjian, Xiongfeng Type Types, Xiongfeng Type 3, Wanjian, Xiongfeng E, and Xiongfeng Yunfeng. In addition, there are Tiantong missiles, which are land -to -air -to -ball missiles developed by Taiwan. Although Taiwan has restricted its missile forces in defense in the past, CSIS pointed out that the island has begun to develop missiles designed as cracking down mission.

Although Taiwan can fight against China's military strength through investment in air -to -air missiles, some studies have shown that the PLA's efforts to make the Air Force's modernization are being achieved. According to a blog post published in February, the Institute of International Strategy (IISS) said that the institute's annual evaluation data of the military capabilities of 173 countries showed that the PLA is accelerating the expansion of the fighter group. According to data from the Institute of International Strategy, the PLA Air Force now has more than 600 aircraft deployment in 19 front-line combat brigades, and the annual production speed of combat aircraft such as J-20 has doubled in the past three years.
Hu Zhendong, an official of the first Pentagon, told DW that Beijing has achieved success in the production of new combat aircraft, including the J-35 stealth fighter. He said that this shows that "the great growth of China's capabilities is a concerned issue."
However, Hu Zhendong also added that China's progress in the production of a large number of combat aircraft may not be enough to reverse the situation of Taiwan, because Taiwan also has aircraft and other systems provided by the United States to help support Taiwan's combat capabilities. As a part of strengthening Taiwan's air defense capabilities, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense signed two parts and aviation materials transactions worth about $ 420 million on April 21 this year, which can be used to maintain Taiwan's fighters.
In addition, Hanxiang Aviation Industry (AIDC), one of Taiwan's national defense contractors, said earlier this month that Taiwan is seeking US support to create the next self -developed fighter. Hu Kaihong, chairman of Hanxiang, said: "We hope that the United States will support Taiwan to develop its own fighter aircraft, including engines, aviation electronic equipment, control systems, environmental control, etc. These are all opportunities for Taiwan and the United States to cooperate."

Although experts such as Hu Zhendong and Su Ziyun believe that Taiwan ’s air defense capabilities can resist China's air strikes to a certain extent, they also expressed concern about the continuous activities of China’ s gray areas around Taiwan. And the PLA's increasingly frequent blockade of military exercises around Taiwan.
Since April 2023, China has increased the frequency of the gray zone around Taiwan, including Essence In addition, the PLA also showed new tactics and deployed operations drones around Taiwan. Du Zhenyi, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, mentioned: "Beijing is being displayed, and drones have become part of their action in the gray area."
 The Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan announced on May 2nd of the Chinese military aircraft activities. One of the BZK-005 drones was bypassing Taiwan in a clockwise direction
Hu Zhendong, an official of the first Pentagon, warned that the main purpose of China's action around Taiwan was to instill the concept of "failure" to the people of Taiwan, while affecting the island's air defense preparation status and ability. He said: "Wars are already carried out, because China's primary goal is to keep pressure to scare the people of Taiwan."

 Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong returned to Seoul on May 7 to hold a head talks with South Korean President Yin Xiyue
(Voice of Germany Chinese) Essence With the increasingly concerned about provocative military activities on North Korea and China's influence, the two leaders tried to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea.
During the summit, Yin Xiyue said that the efforts to deepen the bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea should not be hindered by the historical disputes that have not yet been resolved. As the first Japanese leader who visited Seoul for more than five years, Kishida Wenxiong said that since Yin Xiyue visited Tokyo in March, the relationship between these two Asian countries has been developing "vibrant".
Both leaders promised to promote cooperation and coordination, and urged officials of both parties to formulate specific steps to improve each other's security and economic cooperation. The meeting was less than two weeks after the Seventh -way Group summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Kishida Wenxiong has invited Yin Xiyue to the summit. Two leaders are expected to hold a third -side meeting with US President Biden Biden during the Seventh National Group's meeting.
Some analysts say that the trip to Seoul, Kishida, reflects that Japan and South Korea want to reconcile bilateral issues and maintain harmonious relationships. Yin Xiyue visited Tokyo in March and was widely considered a diplomatic breakthrough. Eleanorhughes, a very resident researcher in the think tank in Chicago, said: "In this regard, aspect, Tian Wenxiong decided to invite Yin Xiyue to attend the G7 summit of the Hiroshima, which successfully opened the door for the two countries to obtain policy in deepening security and economic relations."
Combined concerns about regional security 
During the Sunday meeting, Kishida Wenxiong and Yin Xiyue acknowledged that Japan and South Korea jointly responded to the rising security threats of the region due to the repeated missile tests and the promotion of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Although the two leaders did not mention China directly, some experts believed that Beijing's continuous expansion in the region was also an important factor in deepening bilateral relations in Tokyo and Seoul.
"Japan understands that the wider challenge of the region is the rise of China, and how this will cause destructive power to the economy, diplomacy, and security." Stephennagy, a professor at the Department of Political and International Studies of the Japan International Christian University, said, "" " Tokyo, of course, I hope to cooperate with South Korea to ensure that the region remains stable and prosperous. "
Although Japan has been increasing the challenges brought about by China's rise, South Korea has adopted a more tough speech to describe China's impact on aggressive expansion in the region. In an interview with Reuters last month, Yin Xiyue said that the intensification of tensions around Taiwan was caused by trying to change the status quo with force, and he tried to oppose it.
Yin Xiyue's remarks were strongly protested by Beijing. The deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Sun Weidong, qualitated the speech of the President of South Korea as "wrong" and "completely unacceptable".
Professor Najib told Germany that the Yin Xiyue government made it clear in most communication that they believe that China's current development direction is not necessarily positive for the region and South Korea. "Therefore, Seoul needs to cooperate with Japan and the United States and other like -minded countries to make South Korea better respond to future challenges related to China's rise." He explained.
Although some people are worried that due to the greater economic impact of China on South Korea, South Korea is still relatively weak on the China issue, but some experts believe that because China and North Korea seem to be unlikely to change their actions in the region, Seoul and Tokyo The relationship between the between will continue to deepen.
East Asian affairs expert at the University of Foreign Languages, Joelatkinson, said: "The actions of China and North Korea are the key factor to promote South Korea and Japan." He also believes that because Beijing and Pyongyang stubbornly insist on himself. Line ", the relationship between Seoul and Tokyo will continue to heat up.
resistance from domestic politics from Korea 
Although experts generally believe that the second summit of the two leaders shows that it will further strengthen the bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea, some people expressed doubts about the long -term prospects of this relationship, and they are worried that Yin Xiyue lacks public support. Progress caused obstacles.
As an expert in East Asian affairs, Atkinson, a Korean University of Foreign Languages, said: "Yin Xiyue is easily described as a pro -Japanese faction by the opposition party.
 In August 2019, a large number of South Korean people held protest demonstrations in front of the Japanese Embassy in Korea, asking Japanese officials to formally apologize to Japanese workers in Japan during World War II.
According to him, this visit may give Yin Xiyue's critics more pragmatic, and it may also show him to Korean voters that the two countries are developing in a way that is conducive to South Korea. Atkinson told Germany: "In the long run, whether the summit will strengthen the relationship between the two countries depends on the response of the Korean public."
On the other hand, Japan is still cautious about advancing relations with South Korea. In 2018, Yin Xiyue's former Wen Zaiyin ruling, the South Korean court ruled that the two Japanese companies had compensated some of the former Korean employees on the forced labor during World War II, causing disputes between the two countries.
"(Tokyo) I hope that Yin Xiyue's government will be successful, but they are worried that he may not be re -elected." Najib of Japan International Christian University said, "Therefore, Japan is very cautious in how to deepen the relationship with South Korea. Consolidate the stable factors. "
Because Tokyo had 35 years of colonial occupation on the Korean Peninsula in 1945, the relationship between Japan and South Korea has long been in disputes. The atrocities made by the Japanese militarium government, including sexual slavery and forced labor, made reconciliation very difficult. Although Yin Xiyue tried to establish a closer relationship with Japan on the basis of joint focus on the security challenges caused by North Korea and China, he faced continuous criticism because he made concessions to Tokyo.
Li Zaiming, the leader of the co -Democratic Party of South Korea, said: "The normalization of relations between South Korea and Japan is necessary. I agree with this, but it cannot be at the expense of our national interests, national dignity, history, and justice." His presidential election in 2022 was elected Zhong Yi's weak disadvantage lost to Yin Xiyue.
The United States is the " bonding agent " of the United States in the United States " 
Although Tokyo and Seoul are facing some challenges in promoting bilateral relations, experts said that the United States plays an important role in helping the two countries to promote bilateral relations. Professor Atkinson said: "The White House's approach is to encourage speech and inspire the progress of the reputation with the close relationship with the US President."
Atkinson told Germany that the most valuable support that the United States can provide is military deterrence because North Korea and China are unwilling to fight against the United States. He said: "The cooperation between South Korea and Japan shows that they are more willing to support each other in the crisis, and the United States rewards Seoul by agreeing with more risks."#

Selling weapons to Taiwan 
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it is the main military supporter of Taiwan. For decades, Washington has sold "defensive" weapons to Taiwan based on the "Relations with Taiwan". After August last August, after the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States House, Plogsi visited Taiwan, the Chinese PLA launched the largest real -scale military exercise in the surrounding waters around Taiwan for decades. Then in September, the Bayeng government announced the 6th degree of Taiwan military sales case worth 1.16 billion US dollars. The US Ginseng Institute also passed the "National Defense Authorization Act" at the end of last year. The law plans to send US government officials to Taiwan to strengthen the bilateral cooperation of the United States and Taiwan.
Professor Najib of Japan's International Christian University added that in addition to the United States, other like -minded democratic countries also believe that the relationship between South Korea and Japan needs to surpass historical disputes and should try more cooperation. He said: "The United States is the adhesive to maintain dialogue between the two countries, but the governments of many other countries are also working hard to encourage the cooperation between the two countries."
Due to a similar vision for maintaining the rules -based order in the Indo -Pacific region, Najib believes that South Korea and Japan can cooperate with his like -minded countries to create a wider range of political economy in the Indo -Pacific region. These efforts can be implemented through multilateral cooperation such as "small bilateral cooperation" between four to five countries or multilateral cooperation like Yintai's economic framework.
"Rather than saying that China is the center of the economy in the region, we can see that more regional cooperation is becoming the center of the economy of Southeast and South Asia." He told Germany and added that when China loses the asymmetric economic advantages, South Korea and Japan and other countries will be more capable of balanced China ’s scale and military challenges in the Indo -Pacific region.

 (Voice of Germany) The German Railway Transport Trade Union (EVG) was originally scheduled to conduct a 50 -hour strike from this Sunday. News from the evening of Saturday was agreed with the Deutsche Railway Corporation (DB) and suspended the strike.
The strike originally caused the long -distance railway passenger transportation to stagnate on Monday and Tuesday. The Deutsche Railway Corporation (DB) said that after reaching a suspension of strikes, the staff of about 50,000 trains must be arranged as soon as possible, and the specific vehicle table will be announced on Sunday afternoon.
However, the German railway transport union emphasized that only the strike of the German Railway Company was suspended, and other railway transport companies may still hold a strike.
On Thursday evening, the German railway transport union negotiated with the German Railway Company, and the German Railway Company resorted to the law and asked for a suspension. Because the strike is suspected of "excessive" and harms the interests of passengers and customers.
The German railway trade unions and various railway companies are conducting 230,000 employees, of which 180,000 are employed by the German Railway Corporation. The negotiation dispute points also include the minimum wage problem.

Türkiye Sunday (May 14) President Erdogan's competitors Kilmal Kilicdaroglu poll slightly ahead, and Erdogan was facing challenges.
Reuters reports that Turkish voters will begin voting at 8 am local time (1 pm Singapore time) and end voting at 5 pm on the same day (8 pm Singapore time). According to the Turkish Election Law, any election results are prohibited before 9 pm.
But later on the same day, there may be significant signs that Turkey must be selected for voting. Without candidates to get more than 50%of the support in the first round of voting, the country will conduct a second round of voting on May 28.
The latest pre -election poll shows that the support rate of the polls of the "National Alliance" camp candidate for the "National Alliance" camp, which is composed of six opposition parties, slightly leading Erdogan's justice and the Development Party and its League Party. "People".
Xinhua News Agency quoted Turkey's last five pre -election poll data reports that Kleshdaru Lu and Erdogan's support rates were close, and the two sides were leading each other, with a gap between 1.7 and 5.8 percentage points.
 Cedar, a candidate for the "National Alliance" camp, promised that it will promote Turkey's economic development and transformation and industrial upgrading, achieve economic growth exceeding 5.5%, and make the national per capita income of more than 20,000 US dollars (about S $ 26,000) Essence (Reuters)
The analysis believes that in the presidential elections in 2014 and 2018, Erdogan was directly elected in the first round of voting with more than 50%of the vote. However, in this presidential election, Erdogan sought a severe challenge for re -election due to the strong lineup of the opposition party alliance and poor domestic economic conditions.
In addition, the election situation showed that even if Kellechidalolu finally successfully defeated Erdogan's election, his ruling career was hard to sail.
On the other hand, the "National Alliance" also received the support of the third largest party of the parliament and the Kurdish left -wing party's Democratic Party, while the number of voters of Kurdish votes accounted for 15%to 20%of the total votes, which has a key decisive role.
Because it is officially considered to be associated with Kurdish "terrorist organizations", the former leader of the People's Democratic Party Demil Tash was imprisoned. The party will not participate in the presidential election this year, but it has called voters to support the "National Alliance".

A study in the United States shows that Saturn's ring may have less than 400 million years of history. Compared with Saturn, which has been born in 4.5 billion years, "young" has been "young" for at least 4 billion years.
According to the Xinhua News Agency on Sunday (May 14), researchers from the University of Colorado and other institutions said that they analyzed the 163 universe captured by the "Cassini" detector in the periphery area of the Saturn ring from 2004 to 2017. Dust, through their movement status, calculate the speed of dust in the Saturn's ring, inferring that the unearthed star ring is 100 million to 400 million years.
Related papers were published on Friday (12th) in the new issue of "Scientific Progress" magazine in the new issue.
The traditional view of the academic community is that the Saturn and Saturn were born at the same time. In recent years, new theories have believed that the Saturn ring is relatively young. This study provides evidence for the latter.
Researchers say that the Saturn ring is mainly composed of water ice particles, and the volume of other solid impurities accounts for less than 2%. If the Saturn ring has been born billions of years, it should not be so "clean".
It is not clear how the Saturn's ring is born. Observations in recent years have shown that Saturn's ring is constantly being eroded and may disappear completely within 100 million years.
At the end of 2018, a study of the American Astronautics Agency showed that Saturn is "eating" Saturn's Ring around, absorbing these particles into the upper atmosphere through gravity, saying that this effect may disappear Saturn's ring after 300 million years.
The Saturn ring is mainly composed of water ice particles from micrometers to rice. The speed of the granules is originally in a balanced state with Saturn's gravity. Balance, let the particles fall down.

Lin Guanying, Chairman of the Democratic Action Party of Malaysia, believes that the lack of consistency between the National Bank (Central Bank) and the federal government policy, or make it difficult for Malaysia to maintain strong economic growth in the second quarter of 2023.
"Oriental Daily" reported that Lin Guanying Sunday (May 14) issued a statement saying that The median value higher than the market forecast is because the government and the central bank have maintained the same economic policy and focus on sustainable GDP growth.
"However, on May 3rd, the State Bank unexpectedly raised overnight policy interest rates, making more than 80%of economic forecast economists surprised, which may make it difficult for Malaysia to repeat the first quarter of the first quarter of 2023 to repeat the first quarter of the first quarter. 5.6%GDP growth. "
Lin Guanying said that Nor Shanxia, the president of the central bank of Malaysia, recently explained that the central bank had unexpectedly raised interest rates to hopes to curb inflation and rebound, but this statement caused some confusion. Because the core inflation rate slowed to 3.9%as early as the first quarter of this year, and 4.2%in the last quarter of 2022.
"Why does the inflation problem now need to raise interest rates, and it is not a problem when the National Bank suspended overnight policy interest rate in January 2023 and March? Interest rate (OPR)? "
Lin Guanying questioned that if the core inflation is a serious problem in accordance with Nuoshan Xia, why is the central bank suspended the interest rate hike twice in January and March this year? If the central bank is very worried about overall inflation and core inflation, it should immediately raise the overnight policy interest rate in January and March this year, instead of waiting until now.
Lin Guanying said that although the Bank of China did not raise interest rates in January and March this year, the overall inflation rate and core inflation rates successfully dropped to 3.4%and 3.8%in March 2023, respectively. Even though the Bank of China has not raised overnight policy interest rates, the overall and core inflation have been controlled.
He believes that without any signs that inflation will rise again, the central bank's measure of overnight interest rates will cause unnecessary financial difficulties to individuals and small and medium -sized enterprises.

Examination and counter -review in Yanmei Culture 
Singapore's "Portal Media" published article "Participating Examination: Special Combination of Internet Reports, Special Commercial Commercialization of Fans and China Danmei Culture", author Bai Lu and Tan Jia pointed out that the conviction of the author of Yanmei novels reflects the face of Chinese fans facing. Special situation: The government's continuous review of network content and the internal standards of further tightening the platform under supervision. In this case, although a large number of members in the Tanmei community oppose this malicious reporting behavior and actively support the victims, this ultra -high -efficiency "victory opponent" has entered the vision of everyone, "participating review" The procedures and validity have been learned by more people in the process of understanding the incident. As the report became a powerful weapon to suppress the "enemy", the situation of the battle became more and more intense, and gradually became a part of the "tool" that fans need to face or even use. The forum and social media platforms also continue to change the composition of the page, and put the reporting function in a convenient and fast position for use.
The article discusses the practical practice of opposing commercialization and review systems. The author pointed out that as the participating censorship appeared widely among the fan groups, the alternative strategy was created by fans. For example, fans use various methods to replace sensitive words, or spread in the form of flip pictures, encrypted network disks, chat groups, etc., so as to ensure that Kae's content can be fully published and transmitted.
According to the author, because the participating censorship relies on platform design to a large extent, such as reporting functions and sensitive word restrictions, many fans have shifted to overseas platforms or other non -profit websites to express their dissatisfaction with existing platforms. In addition to using alternative platforms, other nomadic tactics have also been invented to resist network censorship. Faced with the stigma of creative and consumer pornographic content, some fans of Yanmei initiated the call of writing "standing street articles", and issued a "every pair of CPs with their own street essays", encouraging Yanmei fans to boldly embrace taboos, and Refuse sex shame. This writing movement temporarily opens an unintended network space as an alternative to commercialized censorship.

Where is the "Wolf Diplomacy"? 
No longer "to keep the light" 
In recent years, Beijing has changed Deng Xiaoping's tone to keep the tone. CNN has reported that compared with Chinese diplomats who have been gentle in the past few decades, "Wolf Diplomacy" is a completely different type. These Chinese diplomats will not issue a lengthy statement, but on Twitter and other social media platforms to directly attack any criticism of China or the Communist Party.

Where is the "Wolf Diplomacy"? 
There are wolves in the wolf? 
The "Wolf Diplomacy" statement is taken from the successful movie "War Wolf", which was released in China in 2015 and has been successfully released in 2015. The nationalist emotions of the film are quite strong. Chinese diplomats did not deny this expression at first. According to the Chinese official media CCTV, in May 2020, then the then Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming once said that China insists on taking the peace route. However, because there is a "wolf" in the world, China needs "wolf warfare" to defend national dignity. The picture shows the stills of "War Wolf 2".

Wolf spokesman 
One of the representatives of the "War Wolf Diplomacy" was Zhao Lijian, a former Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, and his remarks have caused controversy many times. For example, in March 2020, he said on Twitter that the U.S. military may bring the new crown epidemic to Wuhan. After the Foreign Minister of the Five Eyes Alliance issued a statement on the issue of Hong Kong, he responded at a routine conference that whether they had "five eyes" or "ten eyes", as long as they dare to damage China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits, Be careful of their eyes being blinded. He also released a tweet and false pictures that criticized Australian soldiers in the so -called war crimes in Afghanistan. Australian Prime Minister Morrison said that the Chinese government should be ashamed of this tweet.

Farewell to the "War Wolf" style? 
In January 2023, 50 -year -old Zhao Lijian unloaded the position of spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was transferred to the deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Marine Affairs. Almost at the same time, the former ambassador to the United States Qin Gang (pictured) replaced Wang Yi as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Some political analysts believe that these personnel changes means that China has intended to change the "wolf war" diplomatic image established in the past few years. However, after the new foreign minister took office, the edge did not lose his predecessor. The spokesman's attitude faced the international media without any ease.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately clarified that China "respects the sovereign state status of the Republic of the Republic after the disintegration of the Soviet Union."

Where is the "Wolf Diplomacy"? 
The rhythm is a bit messy 
Reuters reports that Chinese diplomats have increasingly criticized human rights in the United States and Western countries in public comments. The information passed is that Western countries are not qualified to criticize China, and China has been attacked by more Western countries. The report quoted Western diplomats that China's war wolf diplomacy "has strong defensive and urgent", but the effect is counterproductive, and the audience of information transmission is not clear, and it is a bit "chaotic."

will have more "wolf" diplomat attack the free world 
Recently Zhao Wei, a diplomat in Toronto, caused diplomatic storms. Taiwan's "report" published an article "Xi Jinping will release more" Lushaye ". The author Du Zheng believes that whether Zhao Wei or Lu Shaye will be regarded by the CCP as a hero. Because Xi Jinping has been instilling "daring to fight and good at struggle" to diplomatic officials in recent years, the CCP will also use these diplomatic incidents as a "front" textbook for training these evil wolves. In the political vocabulary of the Communist Party of China, the so -called "war wolf" was originally righteous.
The article said that the continuous sports in the history of the Communist Party of China are training people's wolf nature. The CCP diplomats are now trained by the murderous fighting style. It is trained by teaching materials formed during the Cultural Revolution. Modern diplomatic science is just embellishment. The author believes that China used to be a state of etiquette, but after the CCP's rule, a party culture was forcibly constructed, and the theory of struggle was the core theory of governing the country. The struggle must be violent, cruel, bloody, and no human. CCP diplomats express their "political correctness" in this regard, and often receive rewards from high -level CCP.
The author pointed out that the CCP is facing diplomatic dilemma, and Xi Jinping cannot give up the tough route. He only understands to return his teeth. Then he actually needs more exposed rogue wolves like Lu Shayan to charge for the party state. In the future, more CCP diplomats who have been trained to the wolf -haired hair will treat the world as a wasteland, arbitrarily attack the crowd, and free society must be deeply guarded.

 About 61 million Turkish citizens have voting qualifications for this election
(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Turkey held a president and Congress election on May 14. This vote was regarded as a major test of the current President Erdogan. Voters will also select 600 from 87 constituencies. Congress of Congress with a term of 5 years.
About 61 million Turkish citizens have voting qualifications, including nearly 5 million first voters. The voting stations from all over the country are open at 8 am local time and closed at 5 pm. According to laws, Turkish media prohibit reporting of votes from various places before 9 pm on the 14th.
Erdogan said earlier on a primary school in Istanbul in Skandan, Sunday, and said that after the voting at night, he hoped that the voting result was "for the future of our country and the democracy of Turkey. "". The last time Erdogan won 52.6%votes in the first round of presidential elections in 2018. The current public opinion survey shows that its support is hovering around 44-45%.
On the other hand, Kemalkilicdaroglu, one of the Turkish presidential candidates, told the media after voting that he would be committed to restoring democracy. He said, "You will see that the spring of Heaven will be blessed. The spring of this country will come."
The opposition competitor is the chairman of the Republican Party (CHP), which was established by the founder of modern Turkey Mustafa Kemalaturk. Kiricidallu said that he and his six -party alliance plan to "realize the people's desire for democracy."
 Kirichidallu, one of the presidential candidates, said it will be committed to restoring democracy
What are the presidential candidates? 
The current president and 69 -year -old Erdogan is the founder and leader of the Rights and Development Party (AKP) of the Right -wing Party (AKP). He served as the mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998, and then promoted to the highest position of the country. From 2003 to 2014, he served as the Prime Minister, and then won the first direct election of Turkey as a president in August 2014.
His critics said that Erdogan made Turkey's long -term advocacy of evidence to get rid of religion to religious conservatives.
 The current President Erdogan said: I hope the results of the voting are "good for Turkey's democracy."
In order to compete with it, the six opposition parties in Turkish politics formed a united front to overthrow Erdogan's leader. Among them, Kiric Dalogulu became the presidential candidate launched by the Six Party Opposition Alliance. The 74 -year -old Kilic Darroglu has been the Chairman of the Republican Party since 2007. He and the opposition alliance hopes to revoke the constitutional provisions that Erdogan's previous amendments can be revised as much as possible.
Two politicians are running for the president, but one of them will temporarily withdrawn from the election on May 11th, which may be able to add some chances of winning for the opposition candidate Kiriqidalu. The last candidate was Sinanogan, but the opportunity to win the presidential election may be the most slim. He received the support of a small extreme nationalist party alliance.
Inflation, Türkiye is ushered in a general election 
How to view this election 
Turkey is in the economic collapse, and its currency Turkish lira plunged to the lowest point in history, while inflation was rampant. In February this year, the Erdogan government's treatment of the Great Earthquake also caused criticism and harmed his re -election prospect.
According to official data, more than 50,000 people were killed in Türkiye alone. However, many people have not been settled three months after the earthquake, and many regions have not restored basic livelihood supply such as hydropower.
However, DW found that two cities in the "Earthquake Area" have a very different view on Sunday elections. Kahramanmaras, a city in southeast Turkey, is located in the earthquake in February. The region is considered to be the base of justice and the development of the party. Therefore It may weaken because of the earthquake.
The situation seems to be different in Hatiei, a city near the Syrian border. Many local people have criticized the government that they believe that other cities have received more assistance after the earthquake. So far, many residents of Hatiei still lack clean water, clothing and sanitary products.
Most Germans want Erdogan to step down 
A survey showed that two -thirds of the Germans were happy to see Erdogan's elimination after 20 years in power. The national study by the market survey agency YOUGOV asked: "This Sunday, Turkey will hold a presidential election. Do you want the current President Erdogan to be re -elected or was eliminated?" About 70%of the respondents believe that Erdogan should should He stepped down, and 10%believed that he should be re -elected, and another 20%said he did not know or did not give the answer.
 Former German feet, Turkish football player Ozil took a photo with Erdogan before the 2018 World Cup, causing German public opinion uproar
Although Erdogan's supporters of Justice and the Development Party often caused controversy in Germany, the Turkish leader did have a strong support foundation in Germany.
Democratic "Last Opportunity" 
Michaelroth, chairman of the Federal House of Federal House of Federal House, pointed out that the election may be the "last opportunity" of the Turkish opposition to drive Erdogan's justice and the Development Party in a democratic way after 20 years.
Ross told the media that the "German Editorial Department Network" may be free, although the president and parliamentary elections may be free, they may not be fair, because Erdogan and its supporters are stepping up their control of media, election committees and judicial agencies. Rose also pointed out that at the same time, Russia seemed to be trying to publicize Turkish opposition through false information.
