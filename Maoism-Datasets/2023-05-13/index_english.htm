<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-12T-16-00-00-04-00/000000.png" />Shandong Zibo Barbecue Festival held on May 2, 2023 <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediansaomiao/econ-05122023135633.html/@@images/image"></a>Agencence France -Presse <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediansaomiao/econ-05122023135633.html/@@stream"></a>Good audience and friends, welcome to listen to the financial and epochs of Liberty Asia, I am Rao Yiming.</p>
<p>Recently, Zibo's barbecue culture has attracted great attention across the country. The degree of hotness is not the same, it can be said that it is red throughout the network, and the whole city is hot!The secretaries and mayor of various places have organized a group to "go to Zi Bake Chasa" to learn the city's management and management. Many places, such as Shenzhen and other places, have begun to imitate Zibo's lifting of the stall economy. What are the factors behind Zibo barbecue? Why can Zibo City successfully become a new hot spot in cultural tourism? Zibo barbecue has become a trend or a flash? How much help can it help to unblock the stall economy in many places? This program will discuss the above topics. The guests who participated in the discussion were Qin Weiping, an economist in the United States.</p>
<p><strong> Zibo barbecue overnight red </strong></p>
<p>In the past May Day Golden Week, people at the country were overcrowded, and the most popular was the number of people in Zibo, Shandong, and it was estimated that 120,000 people were going. It is said that the local government has even issued open faith "dismissal" tourists.</p>
<p>The city is so hot, mainly because Zibo barbecue became popular overnight, and tourists swarmed to make fun. Some netizens said that a barbecue restaurant could not come, and the boss kneeling to forgive me. Another Duan Zi said that the local deputy director served as a waiter to help beer. These information reflect a signal, that is, Zibo is too hot.</p>
<p>The cause behind this phenomenon is complicated, the dissemination effect of the "Douyin era", and some retaliatory consumption caused by the three -year blocker of the epidemic, as well as the display of local governments to survive and change.</p>
<p>So, how did Zibo barbecue get angry? It is understood that the Zibo Municipal Government held the "Famous School Talents Express" in Beijing in March. Ma Xiaolei, secretary of the municipal party committee, went to Tsinghua and Peking University to preach, inviting students to develop in Zibo.</p>
<p>To this end, he proposed to visit the two universities for free to visit the tour during the May 1st period and eat it. Some Tsinghua and Bei University students began to search for Zibo scenic spots and found that Zibo barbecue was interesting. Therefore, discussions on platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu. Based on the algorithm effect, Zibo barbecue became more popular and out of control.</p>
<p><strong> Zibo government performance is remarkable and available </strong></p>
<p>In order to allow foreign tourists to "bake in Zibo", leaders at all levels of Zibo have also ushered in a Great Leap Forward for ideological liberation, urban management capabilities and informatization levels.</p>
<p>It is understood that Zibo made a set of combined fists, "overall planning, upper and lower linkage, and the city's heart", and released two open letters to all citizens and tourists. In order to do a good job of daily management, no leaks are not leaked, and various meetings such as mobilization, coordination, and promotion meeting every day will open until 3 or four in the morning.</p>
<p>Multiple Zibo barbecue stalls temporarily build welcoming tourists, and have unlicensed operations, but local urban management no longer crack down. Under the call of the municipal government, they roll up their sleeves with other civil servants and guests.</p>
<p>In order to create Zibo barbecue, the city will pick up and deliver tourists for free, and provide free accommodation without lack of two less. There are also 21 "barbecue" bus lines and opened a special line for barbecue. The phenomenon of taxis slaughter.</p>
<p>The barbecue feast of Zibo also brought people's changes in Zibo and Shandong.</p>
<p>In fact, Zibo used to be a cities with heavy industries. For a long time, Zibo's traditional industry proportion reached 70%, and the heavy chemical industry accounted for 70%of the traditional industries. This is a typical traditional industry. Traditional industries such as chemical industry, building pottery, medicine, and textile were once the foundation of the city.</p>
<p>In recent years, Zibo has seized the historical opportunities of Shandong's green and low -carbon high -quality development pioneer, and promoted the transformation of old industrial cities and the conversion of new and old kinetic energy. Old trees have developed new branches, new materials, intelligent equipment, new medicine, electronic information, etc. "Strong" industry is rejuvenating.</p>
<p>Walking in Zibo City, when you look at it, you will find that the traditional labels that have been posted by people over the years have long been torn off. This ancient city has a lot of net red temperament, because this time the barbecue is famous, although there are accidental components, it is not completely surprising.</p>
<p><strong> The stall economy has become the driving force for domestic demand? </strong></p>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that Shenzhen has announced that it will no longer prohibit roadside stalls from September. Previously, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Hangzhou and other places have announced the relaxation of stalls. According to the Huaxia Times, there are 28 cities in the open -stall economy in China.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone reported that Shenzhen recently amended the regulations on the management of city and environmental sanitation, allowing street offices to be based on "facilitating the masses", "reasonable layout", "orderly supervision" and other principles. Under the circumstances, the venue of stalls is delineated. The stipulated shops can also place the goods outside the store's entrance to solicit customers.</p>
<p>Professor Zhu Lijia of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China told the media that liberalizing the "roadside stall" policy is worthy of recognition, which is good for the development of the economy and satisfying the daily life and exchanges of the people. The "roadside stall" itself does not have fundamental contradictions with urban management. As long as it is well managed, it can develop benign. Of course, this also tests the wisdom and level of urban managers.</p>
<p>When the former Prime Minister of the State Council of the State Council went to Yantai, Shandong in June 2020, he had described the stall economy as "fireworks of the world" and "Chinese vitality". However, at that time, official media such as Beijing Daily were not suitable for Beijing and other comments. Therefore, the open stall economy can be said to be a "concession" of the government's living space at the bottom of the people. Similar to poverty alleviation to alleviate the social conflicts and crises that may cause high unemployment rates.</p>

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified.

The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to export blacklists. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

However, the Kremlin Palace stated that there is no plan to meet with Chinese envoys at present.</p>

<p>At the regular press conference, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, responded to the official media CCTV reporter: "From May 15th, the Chinese government Eurasian Ambassador Li Hui will go to Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany Visit with the five Russian nations to communicate with the Ukrainian crisis with all parties.

<p>Since the outbreak of the Russian -Ukraine conflict, the international community has been holding a high degree of doubt about the so -called "neutral stance" of Beijing and whether it can play the "mediation person". On the eve of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China had announced a "unlimited" cooperation with Russia. After the outbreak of the war, Beijing has always rejected condemnation of Russia's aggression, but has accused the United States and NATO from provoking conflicts. On the first anniversary of the Russian -Ukraine conflict, China also released a 12 -point peace plan to resolve the Russian -Ukraine conflict. Among them, only the words were not required to withdraw troops from Ukraine, which caused criticism from Ukraine and the international community.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has phone calls with the President of Ukraine in April. This is also the first time that China -Ukraine leaders have been talked about since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal of the United States pointed out that this shows that Beijing is trying to shape itself as a "potential peaceful founder" that has been shaped itself as a conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

Global diplomatic influence.</p>
<p>After the United States and its allies cut off most of Russia's procurement trade, the relationship between China and Moscow was closer. As the largest buyer of Russia's oil and natural gas, Beijing has a strong economic influence on Moscow. At the same time, Beijing also regards Moscow as a diplomatic partner against the United States leading global affairs, and uses the status of the UN Security Council to transfer the international community's diplomatic attack on Russia.</p>
<p>At the same time as Sino -Russian relations are increasingly close, US -China relations have continued to deteriorate, and with the Chinese spy balloon incident in February this year, it has fallen into the bottom. U.S. Secretary of State Brosky was forced to cancel its original visit to China, and the relevant plans have not yet re -arranged.</p>
<p>However, China's highest diplomat Wang Yi and US national security adviser Jack Jack Sakali text held talks in Vienna, Austria on Wednesday and Thursday. According to the Chinese press release, the two sides conducted a discussion of "frank, deep, substantial, and constructive" on promoting Sino -US relations to "eliminate obstacles and stop falling stability".

Scholars of the participants focused on how regional allies should cooperate to maintain peace and stability in the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan scholars: The United States should abandon the strategy blur </strong></p>
<p>At the meeting, Wang Hongren, Deputy CEO of the National Policy Research Institute of the Taiwan Think Tank, believes that the US strategic fuzzy policy should be changed because the purpose of strategic fuzzy is to obstacle China not to change the status quo of the Taiwan Straits one -sided, but according to China ’s recent cultural attacks against Taiwan Looking at it, the strategic blur does not seem to have the effect: "(Strategic fuzzy) goal has obviously failed."</p>

Vagueness will lead to appeasement or disaster. Strategic blurring will pass the error message to Chinese leaders, so that Chinese leaders will mistakenly believe that in any circumstances, the United States will not intervene in the Taiwan Strait War. "</p>
<p>Wang Hongren suggested that the United States should establish a military alliance similar to the North Atlantic Convention in Asia, and cover Taiwan to effectively scare Chinese forces to invade Taiwan: "Such an alliance can make Chinese leaders think again and again, whether to be right? Taiwan or neighboring country moves martial arts? "</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: Strategic blurring makes American allies more willing to be on the same front as Taiwan </strong></p>
<p>In response to the issue of strategic fuzzy, Bonnylin, director of the China Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) China Power Project, expressed different views. Lin Yang believes that maintaining a strategy of Taiwan will encourage American allies to support Taiwan on Taiwan issues: "From the perspective of the United States, if you want to give Taiwan the most support, the best way is that the American allies also join Taiwan. Assistance; and if there are more vague space for American allies, they will be more willing to join. On the contrary, if we clearly propose a solution to assist Taiwan, I think this will make it difficult for many countries to join the ranks of helping Taiwan. "</p>

<p><strong> Aesthetic scholars: greater threats than North Korea China to the world </strong></p>
<p>At the meeting, Korean scholars questioned why the United States actively encouraged allies to have a clearer position on Taiwan's issue, but did not respond to the security issues brought by North Korea with the same positive attitude. In this regard, Lin Yang pointed out that the United States has not ignored the North Korean issue, but the US government has recently had more ink on the Taiwan issue because China is a great threat to the world.</p>
<p>Lin Yang said: "For the United States, China is a more threatened opponent. It is a global security concern. China also brings huge economic threats. From a global perspective, compared with North Korea, China has brought the United States to the United States. More challenges. Another thing to notice is that South Korea is quite prepared in the North Korean crisis, but Taiwan still needs to make more preparations. "</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) On May 11, Guo Feixiong (name Yang Maodong), a well -known human rights defender in China (name Yang Maodong) in China again, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/维权人士郭飞雄煽颠罪名被判八年监禁/a-65588550"></a>Essence Since 1989, Guo Feixiong has participated in various democratic protests and rights protection activities, and has been in prison for 11 years.</p>
<p>According to reports, Guo Feixiong was convicted by the court to "incite the crime of subverting the state power", and its "criminal facts" were long -term writing and publishing articles on the Internet. Article, a system of interviews with Radio Asian Radio in Liberty Asia when the outbound outbound was blocked on January 27, 2021, a system of attacking and slandering Chinese politics for a long time.</p>
<p>In other words, this is a complete "crime of speech". Just because of some articles and accepted some media interviews, he was sentenced to eight years. This absurd reality that happened in the 21st century was staged in a place called "court".</p>
<h3>"Degrees without the yin and yang"</h3>
<p>Especially cruel is that one of the "criminal speech" is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国异议人士郭飞雄传失联-在美癌末妻吁中方放行/a-60038942"></a>And a pair of young children.</p>
<p>In January 2021, Guo Feixiong published the "Emergency Call for China's Supreme Leaders" and said that his wife's life was high after cancer surgery. Essence He resorted to people's common sense: "My wife's actuality caused me to hurt my heart and lungs, and every day I was tortured. Every day I was tortured. Everyone and servant were also husbands. The authorities' response was to prevent him from boarding at Shanghai Pudong Airport.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Guo Feixiong issued an open letter to the Chinese leader again, asking him to leave him out of the country to visit his wife. The authorities' response was detained by him. On January 10, 2022, Zhang Qing died in the United States. Two days later, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北京冬奥倒数两周-中国警方以煽颠罪逮捕维权人士/a-60456317"></a>Essence</p>

<h3>Pocket crime of criticism</h3>
<p>Guo Feixiong, like many Chinese human rights defenders, hopes to promote China's politics out of dictatorship and embark on the path of democracy and rule of law. However, due to the strict control of the Chinese authorities in society, they were almost blocked, detained and sentenced when they just made remarks. Most of the so -called "criminal facts" of "crime of subverting state power" are articles or reports that ordinary Chinese cannot read.</p>
<p><strong> More reading- <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察绝食百日郭飞雄不该孤单/a-19478330"></a> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T08-52-00Z/19152120_404.jpg" />Current affairs commentator, author of this article Changping</p>
<p>The law of "inciting the crime of subverting the state power" stipulates that the current paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law currently in China refers to the act of "inciting the subversion of rumors, defamation or other methods to incite the subversion of the state power and overthrow the socialist system." Article 104 of the Criminal Law stipulates that the "armed rebellion and riots" include "organizational, planning, implementation" and other behaviors. Therefore, in legal interpretation and judicial practice, "sin" is a naked "crime of peaceful speech". Because there is no concepts such as "subversion", "overturning", and what is the "socialist system", this crime will become a "pocket crime" that can be used at will, which includes political and freedom politics that requires democracy and freedom to be free. Proposal also includes criticism of calling for reforms in the system. Chinese legal scholars and human rights defenders have repeatedly called for the abolition of the crime of remarks.</p>
<p>Guo Feixiong said in the court's defense words: "In all sectors of Chinese officials and people, there are almost no objections that, in view of my long -term speech stance and objective social impact, I am recognized as the main representative of the gentle rightists close to the middle zone in mainland China. One. "However, from the perspective of the authorities, his following sentence is already a political declaration of radicals:" First of all, I must declare that from December 1986, And political ideals have never changed: in China to completely realize the real free and democratic human rights rule of human rights.

<p>Four diplomats disclosed to Reuters that Groos, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), plans to submit an agreement to protect the Ukraine Zhaparo Nuclear Power Station to the United Nations Security Council within this month.</p>
<p>The plan was proposed by IAEA to Russia and Ukraine, showing that Russia and Ukraine had approached an agreement.</p>
<p>One of the diplomats believe that the Russia and Ukraine are "very promising" to ensure that the nuclear power plant is safely reached. Other diplomats said that Kiev, who has been working against IAEA's plans, now nodded now, but Russia's position is not clear.</p>
<p>A diplomatic officer said that Gronci plans to submit the plan to the Security Council this month, but the submission date has not been determined, and it is said that Griecis is contacted by the President of the Security Council this month.</p>
<p>Four diplomatic officials also said that Gronci will outline the "principle" of the Zapolo Nuclear Power Station to the Security Council. These principles should be supported by Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Zapolo Nuclear Power Station was the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Russia had controlled the nuclear power plant shortly last year.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the risk of Russian and Ukraine's conflict caused by catastrophic nuclear accidents, Groass has been striving to reach an agreement with Moscow and Kiev for several months.</p>
<p>Ukraine is preparing to launch a counterattack against Russia, which means that the battle near the Zapolo Nuclear Power Plant and its six reactors may increase.</p>
<p>The Zapolo Nuclear Power Station has repeatedly passed the power out of power due to the bombardment nearby.

<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) The EU's 27 EU Foreign Minister held a meeting in Stockholm on Friday (May 12) to discuss how to amend the relationship with Beijing, including reducing the EU's economic dependence on China and responding to security challenges. Given that a stronger Beijing impact on the world stage, Brussels calls on EU member states to reach an agreement on how to deal with China.</p>
<p>At a conference hosted by Sweden, Josepborne, the head of the European Union's foreign policy, submitted a document to the EU Foreign Minister to outline the necessity of "definition" and "re -calibration of China's position".</p>
<p>"Considering China's recent evolution and its foreign policy trajectory, they agreed to re -adjust our basic policies for China."</p>
<p>Berrely said that the EU maintains its existing views on China and believes that China is a partner, competitors and opponents. He also emphasized that in the face of fundamental different values and economic systems and seeking to reduce EU dependence, contact with Beijing is still important.</p>
<p>He said that the adjustment policy is not to "decide" in Europe and this world's second largest economy, but to balance this relationship.</p>
<p>China is the EU's largest imported trade partner. According to the European Union Commission statistics, China's imports in 2022 were 20.8%. In some key raw materials, China has almost occupied a monopoly position.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Belbak and other senior diplomats believe that the EU must learn lessons from past errors and re -examine relations with China.</p>
<p>Belbak said that the past situation showed that this hope that strong economic relations can provide security may be deceived. In the past, the European Union believed that Russia, which reached a billion US dollar natural gas order with the EU, would not risk fighting against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Lithuania Foreign Minister Gabrieliuslandsbergis also put forward a similar point of view, calling on EU peers to make mistakes when dealing with Beijing. He said on Friday: "In some cases, we see that the trajectory has not changed and the habit has not changed."</p>
<p>Lans Bergis pointed out that some of the situations are not that we want to cut trade relations with China, but "but because of the development of the situation, for example, the status quo of the Taiwan Strait is changed by force."</p>
<p>He said that "China is establishing a new world order," the EU cannot become passive onlookers.</p>
<p>Belbak agrees to reduce the security risks composed of dependence, and calls on the EU to unite within and "confidently" use the EU's common market. "We are not the largest country in the world, but the European Union, as a whole, especially in Europe, naturally has a force and strength that we should not underestimate."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T10-02-00Z/62976492_401.jpg" />EU Foreign Minister Foreign Policy Borelli said that the EU Foreign Minister agreed to "re -calibrate" to China's position on China</p>
<h3>Discussion around the Russian and Ukraine War</h3>
<p>At a conference on Friday, the most urgent issue in the controversy was that China refused to condemn its intimate ally Russia to invade Ukraine or pressure Russia to stop attacking.</p>
<p>Berrey admits that in the continuous Ukraine conflict, European -China relations are tight because of China's position. He said, "If China does not push Russia to withdraw from Ukraine, the relationship between the European Union and China will not develop normally."</p>
<p>Brussels has been proposed <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705"></a>, Angry Beijing.</p>
<p>While visiting Europe this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that if the EU implements any sanctions, China will "take necessary measures" to safeguard Chinese corporate rights and interests.</p>
<p>Qin Gang argued with the Ukraine issue with Belbak in Berlin. Belbak insisted that "neutral means standing on the side of the invaders."</p>
<p>On Friday, Belbak emphasized that the proposal was "not about economic sanctions", but to prevent "other countries from transporting war supplies to Russia."</p>
<p>When visiting China last month, French President Macron torn a crack in the European Union. He said that the European Union should not follow the US policy automatically and should avoid "not our crisis."</p>
<p>Macron's speech was fiercely criticized by the European allies, and the latter regarded the United States as a security guarantee against Russia.</p>
<p>Paweljablonski, deputy minister of Foreign Affairs, said on Friday that "any destruction of international law" or "worsening" attempts should be "decisive". He also emphasized that the EU does not rely on the importance of China and will compare it with Europe's dependence on Russia's energy.</p>
<p>"We should not let ourselves depend on any country in the future. We should find a way to become partners rather than customers."</p>
<h3>DW Conflict Zone: What is the plan for the European Union if Beijing attacks Taiwan?</h3>
<h3>Qin Gang: Central and EU should be opposed to the "New Cold War" together</h3>
<p>At the same time, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang appealed to Europe and China to oppose the "New Cold War" when visiting Norway on Friday.</p>
<p>Qin Gang said that "the" New Cold War "will only bring greater disasters, seriously damage the interests of the people and the people of the Chinese and European peoples, and seriously impact multilateralism and global governance."</p>
<p>"Central and EU should be opposed to the" New Cold War ", take the lead in promoting the coordination and benign interaction of great powers, and use strength and resources to promote common development and prosperity."</p>
<p>He also emphasized that "China is a partner for risk challenges in Europe, and China exports insurance instead of risks to Europe and the world."</p>
<p>At the EU Foreign Minister Conference on Stockholm on Friday, the goal is not to reach any specific conclusion, and the debate around China will continue at the June Leader Summit.</p>
<p>EU ministers will hold meetings with their peers in the Asia -Pacific region on Saturday to continue discussing Chinese issues.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse pointed out that with the turn of the talks to security issues, including the tension of the Taiwan Strait, Beijing will once again become a "elephant in the room", which means that although it is obviously a collective and avoiding it. But a senior EU official said that the conference focused on "establishing partnerships."</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Lisbon on the 12th) After a long argument, Portugal Parliament passed the bill today to allow suffering and terminally ill people to accept euthanasia. At present, only a few countries in the world have implemented legal euthanasia.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-13T10-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />Portugal is deeply influenced by Catholic beliefs, and society has a serious disagreement on euthanasia. The conservative president of the devotion, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has repeatedly opposed it.</p>
<p>According to the new law provisions, if the person over 18 years old is ill and is unbearable, it will be required to assist death.</p>
<p>The new law only allows people who are in good mental state and "long -term" to endure "unbearable" pain to accept euthanasia.</p>
<p>The new law only allows Portuguese citizens and legal residents to apply, and does not expand to those foreigners who seek suicide in Portugal.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Parliament has passed the euthanasia bill 4 degrees in three years, but because of the opposition of President Desha, he was returned to the constitutional review each time.</p>
<p>The ruling Socialist Party (PS) has absolutely mastered the majority of Congress. With the support of the Socialist Party, it finally passed the final version of the bill today.</p>
<p>The Portuguese media mentioned that Disha is now promulgating the new law for a week. The fastest autumn is effective in the new law.</p>
<p>Dezosha had previously rejected the previous bill on the grounds of "extremely inaccurate concept", and then said that words used to describe the end -stage condition are still contradictory and must be clarified. Now the new law stipulates that only when "patients are unlikely to take medical assistance to commit suicide due to physical disorders", euthanasia is allowed.</p>
<p>However, in Portugal, the debate about medical assistance to death is far from over.</p>
<p>Paulosantos, a member of Right To Die with Dignity, said that Portugal passed the speed of euthanasia faster than other countries, and many doctors may not execute it on the grounds of morality, just like 2007 in 2007 After the legalization of abortion, "the resistance encountered by euthanasia is likely to be greater."</p>
<p>Those who oppose medical assistance to commit suicide regret for this issue without the decision of the citizen's vote. They hope that the opposition members can once again ask the Constitutional Court to review the bill.</p>
<p>There are only a few countries in the world that euthanasia and assist in suicide, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain.</p>

<p>In fact, because the families of most rights protection lawyers or disagreements continue to face government threats in China, many wives of rights protection lawyers will eventually be forced to take their children in exile overseas. However, because most of the rights protection lawyers or disagreements expire, most of them will face the exit ban imposed by the Chinese government, which also causes families of most rights protection lawyers to face long -term unable to gather after their wives and children choose to exile overseas.Zhou Fengsuo called on the international community to continue to voiced cases of the government's detained or sentenced by the government, because in view of the Chinese government's influence in the international community in recent years, they will pose a threat to the world. He said: "In the past few years, some countries led by the United States have begun to wake up and have a relatively clear and pragmatic view on the Chinese government. But I still want to remind people who do business with the CCP. Maintain this regime and help them to do evil. I hope Guo Feixiong's case can make the world realize this. "</p>
<p>He added that in the case of a number of disagreements including Xu Zhiyong, Ding Jiaxi and Guo Feixiong, the Chinese government was facing an unprecedented challenge in the case of heavy sentences of the Chinese government. He said: "Whether it is the power of the state machine or the fineness of the CCP's high -tech, it is difficult for a few people tracked by the Chinese authorities to gather in the current circumstances. However It is difficult to last. So no matter how miserable the Chinese authorities ’suppression of the disagreements, many people will try to seek freedom."</p>

<p>Recently, the Chinese government launched a special operation of the "Stable Grain Supply" of the National Agricultural Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement in 2023, that is, the implementation of "retreating forests and returning farming" in various places. A large number of trees planted under the guidance of the "Returning Powding Return to Forest" were cleared overnight, and the original forest land became arable land. For example, Chengdu will flatten the green belt of tens of billions of yuan, and it is planned to build the same area into 100,000 acres of farmland within three years. In addition, a large number of "agricultural management" were sent all over the place. With the assistance of local officials and police, they went to the fields and asked farmers to stop planting crops and change their cultivated land. Judging from the videos circulating on social media, agricultural management in various places often ignores farmers 'wishes to force farmers' non -grain crops. For example, on April 23, the police and the agricultural management team eliminated more than 6,000 acres of tobacco leaves. In addition, there are many farmers such as bamboo, fruit trees, and flowers in various places, which have suffered a lot of losses.</p>
<p>This operation originated from the documents released at the beginning of the year. On February 13 this year, the Central Government issued Document No. 1, emphasizing that it has been able to grasp the stable and safe supply of food and important agricultural products, and resolutely keep the 1.8 billion mu of cultivated land red line. Some observers believe that the outbreak of the outbreak and the Russian and Ukraine War in recent years have severely impacted the global food supply chain. In this context, food security has once again become an important issue for decision -making. In recent years, the relationship between China and the international community has continued to deteriorate, and the implementation of "retreating forests and returning farming" may also be prepared for potential food shortage in the future.</p>
<p>But is this sport -type approach really useful? I deeply doubt. In my opinion, China's food crisis is probably more serious than the outside world. It is entirely possible to appear new famines in China. One of the reasons is that the expansion of the planting area cannot fundamentally solve the grain problem. The focus is on the mechanism of allocating resources. This is not agricultural issue or a political issue. According to the research of the Nobel Prize winner of Economic Ama, Amatia Sen's research on famine, famine occurred in modern society is not just because of food shortages. The more important reason is the unfairness of the food distribution mechanism, that is, people's legitimate rights have not obtained institutionality. Guarantee. Although many famines did happen after the production of grain production, some famine occurred during the peak of grain output, such as the Bangladesh famine in 1974. In 1974, Bangladesh's grain output increased 13%over the previous year, and per capita grain output increased by 5.3%. However, due to the flood disasters that have occurred before, the local farmers were unable to sell their labor force to obtain employment opportunities, and the opportunity to obtain grain through transactions was greatly reduced. It seems that the real problem is not whether the food supply is sufficient, but whether the channels for people to obtain food are unobstructed. When people are not guaranteed to be hungry, it is not helpful for food to harvest again. Mori further concluded that in modern history, a democratic society with independent opposition parties and the media has never suffered a famine, and the place where famine occurred was because of lack of food.</p>
<p>The second reason for the risk of famine in China is that administrative intervention production must have no good results. U.S. political scientist James Scott, in his famous masterpiece "Perspective of the Country", argued in the case of failure in Germany, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Tanzania and other countries that the top -down planning project will only bring disaster. The most obvious example was the Great Famine in Ukraine in 1933 and the three-year famine that occurred in China in 1959-61. Use strongly to prevent farmers from self -rescue (forced food, preventing farmers from escaping waste, etc.). It can be seen from the simple thinking of retreating forests. Xi Jinping's idea of solving economic problems is still the way to use mass movements. The various disasters of the Mao era are the result of disregarding economic laws and basic humanity, and the result of administrative non -intervention. This old thinking will greatly limit the options for the CCP to face the crisis.</p>

<p>Japanese media said that the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) rich countries will reaching an agreement on the formulation of a new plan for developing countries to distribute vaccines in developing countries at the leadership summit next week.</p>
<p>Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported on Saturday (May 13) that according to the Japanese government sources, in addition to the G7 countries, the Twenty Group (G20) countries such as India and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank of the World Bank also Will participate in this new vaccine plan.</p>
<p>During the popularity of the crown disease, with the support of the WHO and Global Vaccine Immunization Alliance (Gavi), the Global acquisition mechanism (COVAX) of the Corruption vaccine provided nearly 2 billion doses of coronary vaccine to emerging countries.</p>
<p>However, the global acquisition mechanism of the coronary vaccine faces frustration in ensuring fair acquisition, because rich countries give priority to taking vaccines for their own citizens, and the insufficient storage facilities in poor countries have caused the vaccine supply to be postponed. The vaccine was abandoned.</p>
<p>The new vaccine plan of the G7 leader is designed to gather a plan for planning to plan for vaccine production and procurement, and invest in the training of low -temperature storage equipment and health personnel to prepare for the next global epidemic disease.</p>
<p>This year's G7 summit Rotating Chairman, Kika, hopes to strive for the support of emerging countries in the supply chain, food security and climate change to fight against the increasing influence of China and Russia.</p>
<p>The G7 Finance Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank agreed to provide assistance to low -income and middle -income countries in a meeting of the central bank to help improve their roles in the energy -related product supply chain.</p>

<p>Description: In 2008, the Chinese government helped Western countries through the financial crisis with a huge economic incentive plan. However, this time, the recovery of China's recovery after the new crown epidemic, coupled with the threat to Taiwan ’s military threats, means that it is unlikely to make a difference in preventing the global economic recession.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) With the crumbling edge of the other parts of the world on the edge of economic recession, Western decision makers do not want to see China -the biggest driving force of global economic growth since the 2008 financial crisis - It's uncertain. Unfortunately, this is what is happening.</p>
<p>After abandoning a strict zero -epidemic prevention policy in December last year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/降薪招致抗议中央抓就业中国经济的艰难日子来了/a-65606559"></a>Essence</p>
<p>China ’s imports in April were shrinking sharply by 7.9%, while export growth was only 8.5%, which was lower than 14.8%in March. In April, the increase in consumer prices was a new low of more than two years, and according to the prices provided by Chinese industrial wholesalers, the factory shipments have intensified.</p>
<p>At the same time, the decline in new bank loans in April exceeded expectations. The bank issued 718.8 billion yuan of new RMB loans that month, less than one -fifth of the total in March.</p>
<h3>The golden age of China's economy is over?</h3>
<p>"The Chinese economy will not collapse, but it will not return to the golden decade of double -digit growth in the 2010s." Steve Tsang, director of the China Research Center, director of the China Research Center of the University of London, told Germany.</p>
<p>If the Chinese economy rebounds strongly, it will help offset the stimulus of the central bank's currency tightening policy in the past 12 to 18 months in the past 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>The huge stimulus plan introduced by China after the financial crisis from 2008-2009 helps the global economic recovery, partly because China has huge demand for imported raw materials for infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>However, these past stimulus measures have caused China to be trapped in debt quagmires. In March of this year, the International Monetary Fund warned that the debt of local government alone had risen to a record 6.6 trillion yuan, which was equivalent to half of China's GDP.</p>
<p>Zeng Ruisheng believes that those Western decision makers who hope to revive the economy now need to "look at new political and economic reality without wearing a chromosome."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T13-35-00Z/59177611_401.jpg" />After experiencing a huge architecture, China's unprecedented real estate is dragging down the housing market and inhibiting the overall growth</p>
<h3>threatened Taiwan to be isolated by the West by the West</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美众议院兵棋推演台海冲突-结论必须全面武装台湾/a-65398180"></a>Essence The friendly relationship between the Chinese government and Moscow and the "neutral" on the issue of invasion of Ukraine in Russia also brought risks to global economic cooperation.</p>
<p>"As far as the Taiwan issue is concerned, the upgrading of tensions or war will cause tremendous changes." Pushandutt, a professor of economics at the European School of Business, Singapore, told Germany that in that case, "multinational companies will withdraw from exit China, its export market will be closed, and the West will impose sanctions on it. "</p>
<p>The tension between the Chinese government and Washington in the Trump era continued to the present, and the tit -for -tat tariff war led the United States to impose sanctions on several Chinese companies and some officials. Washington also restricts China's semiconductor and artificial intelligence (AI) technology on the grounds of national security.</p>
<p>Zeng Ruisheng pointed out that "Chinese President Xi Jinping's tough foreign policy has led to the decision or de -risk of the United States and other Western countries in the economic connection with China, which means that a key factor in supporting China's rapid growth is weakening."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T13-35-00Z/64451073_401.jpg" />The International Monetary Fund believes that China will continue to be the biggest driving force for global economic growth in the next five years</p>
<p>Western decision makers are increasingly regarding China's "Belt and Road" initiative as a threat to their interests. The initiative invested 840 billion US dollars in more than 150 countries/regions to build roads, bridges, ports and hospitals. More and more people are worried that the project has led developing countries to the debt trap with huge loans that cannot be afforded and weaken their relationship with Western countries.</p>
<p>Last month, the European Central Bank Chide Lagarde also regretted that the global economy may be split into a competitive group headed by China and the United States, and warned that it would increase the growth and exacerbate inflation.</p>
<h3>Why is the economic recovery unsatisfactory?</h3>
<p>In addition, the Chinese government has promoted the economy to the upper and reaches of the value chain to give priority to the quality of growth rather than quantity. But these reforms take time. This also led to the incompetence of China's economic recovery.</p>
<p>"China has been working hard to achieve the transformation from low -end manufacturers to future industries (artificial intelligence, robotics, semiconductor, etc.)." Consumption and slowing growth are "natural results".</p>
<p>Zeng Ruisheng told the Voice of Germany that although Xi Jinping explicitly hopes that the Chinese economy will become more motivated, energetic, powerful and innovative, "his policy often has the opposite effect." He said: "As Xi Jinping strengthens the control of power, the control of power And refused to admit mistakes, Chinese technical bureaucrats cannot actually make necessary adjustments to revitalize the economy. "</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>At the same time, the International Monetary Fund predicts that in the next five years, China will continue to become the greatest driving force for global economic growth, with a contribution rate of global economic growth of about 22.6%, while the United States is only 11.3%.</p>
<p>Although the slowdown in Western demand will continue to have a negative impact on China's exports, there are still many aspects of China's domestic economy, especially due to the depression of demand due to three -year epidemic prevention blockade.</p>
<p>"During the epidemic, Chinese consumers accumulated $ 2.6 trillion in excess savings." Duterto told Germany's voice, "Therefore, it is expected that the service industry is expected to pick up the relics in the short term.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany)) As the Washington Post quoted a <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/fbi逮捕美國情報洩密門嫌犯/a-65309261"></a>It is said that Taiwan will be difficult to deal with air strikes from China, which has made Taiwan's air defense capabilities focus in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The disclosed document in April mentioned that Taiwanese officials suspected whether their air defense system could "accurately detect missile launch from China", and Taiwan's military aircraft did not have enough "full task ability". The document also emphasizes that Taiwan's fighter jets may become the goal of Chinese missile attacks because it takes at least a week to transfer them to a safe place.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Department of Defense said that the US media reported "not a fact" and emphasized that Taiwan has made appropriate modifications on the combat plan, and also continued to strengthen its military preparation. Some analysts said that the leaked documents underestimated Taiwan's "powerful" missile defense capabilities. Tonyhu, a senior director of the Ministry of Defense China, Taiwan and Mongolia Office, said that Taiwan's long -range warning radar and space warning can be found in a few seconds. system.</p>
<h3>Is Taiwan the ability to fight a large number of Chinese military aircraft?</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, people still have some doubts about the overall air defense capacity of the island. One of the reasons is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/一目了然-图表看两岸军力对比/a-62699196"></a>Essence According to the ranking of military capabilities of various countries based on the military website "Global Firepower": the Chinese People's Liberation Army has more than 3,000 military aircraft and nearly 400,000 air force personnel, while Taiwan has only more than 700 military aircraft and more than 30,000 Air Force soldiers.</p>
<p>However, experts told DW that although China's advantages in air strength can suppress air defense in some areas of Taiwan, Taiwan can use air defense missiles to resolve the gap. Su Ziyun, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, pointed out: "In the Ukrainian war, although there is a huge gap between the number of military aircraft in Ukraine and the Russian Air Force, Ukraine can use short -range stab missiles to obtain some air defense capabilities."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T13-47-00Z/62699022_7.png" />Because Taiwan has remote, medium -range and short -range air defense missiles, Su Ziyun believes that this <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台湾启动防御系统应对中国侵扰/a-64580821"></a>Essence He said: "Although they only have short -range missiles, Ukraine has done a good job in air defense. Taiwan has a wider air defense missile, so I believe that it can be done better in terms of air defense."</p>
<p>According to data released by the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CSIS) in 2021, the Taiwan's missile plan is mainly composed of six different range of missiles-Tianjian, Xiongfeng Type Types, Xiongfeng Type 3, Wanjian, Xiongfeng E, and Xiongfeng Yunfeng. In addition, there are Tiantong missiles, which are land -to -air -to -ball missiles developed by Taiwan. Although Taiwan has restricted its missile forces in defense in the past, CSIS pointed out that the island has begun to develop missiles designed as cracking down mission.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Although Taiwan can fight against China's military strength through investment in air -to -air missiles, some studies have shown that the PLA's efforts to make the Air Force's modernization are being achieved. According to a blog post published in February, the Institute of International Strategy (IISS) said that the institute's annual evaluation data of the military capabilities of 173 countries showed that the PLA is accelerating the expansion of the fighter group. According to data from the Institute of International Strategy, the PLA Air Force now has more than 600 aircraft deployment in 19 front-line combat brigades, and the annual production speed of combat aircraft such as J-20 has doubled in the past three years.</p>
<p>Hu Zhendong, an official of the first Pentagon, told DW that Beijing has achieved success in the production of new combat aircraft, including the J-35 stealth fighter. He said that this shows that "the great growth of China's capabilities is a concerned issue."</p>
<p>However, Hu Zhendong also added that China's progress in the production of a large number of combat aircraft may not be enough to reverse the situation of Taiwan, because Taiwan also has aircraft and other systems provided by the United States to help support Taiwan's combat capabilities. As a part of strengthening Taiwan's air defense capabilities, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense signed two parts and aviation materials transactions worth about $ 420 million on April 21 this year, which can be used to maintain Taiwan's fighters.</p>
<p>In addition, Hanxiang Aviation Industry (AIDC), one of Taiwan's national defense contractors, said earlier this month that Taiwan is seeking US support to create the next self -developed fighter. Hu Kaihong, chairman of Hanxiang, said: "We hope that the United States will support Taiwan to develop its own fighter aircraft, including engines, aviation electronic equipment, control systems, environmental control, etc. These are all opportunities for Taiwan and the United States to cooperate."</p>

<h3>from China</h3>
<p>Although experts such as Hu Zhendong and Su Ziyun believe that Taiwan ’s air defense capabilities can resist China's air strikes to a certain extent, they also expressed concern about the continuous activities of China’ s gray areas around Taiwan. And the PLA's increasingly frequent blockade of military exercises around Taiwan.</p>
<p>Since April 2023, China has increased the frequency of the gray zone around Taiwan, including <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國擾台軍機數創新高-專家解析北京戰術/a-65275022"></a>Essence In addition, the PLA also showed new tactics and deployed operations drones around Taiwan. Du Zhenyi, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, mentioned: "Beijing is being displayed, and drones have become part of their action in the gray area."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T13-47-00Z/65497507_401.jpg" />The Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan announced on May 2nd of the Chinese military aircraft activities. One of the BZK-005 drones was bypassing Taiwan in a clockwise direction</p>
<p>Hu Zhendong, an official of the first Pentagon, warned that the main purpose of China's action around Taiwan was to instill the concept of "failure" to the people of Taiwan, while affecting the island's air defense preparation status and ability. He said: "Wars are already carried out, because China's primary goal is to keep pressure to scare the people of Taiwan."</p>
<p>Hu Zhendong added that allowing the Taiwan Air Force to drive new military planes to intercept Chinese aircraft to disrupt their usual training and increase the cost of maintaining aircraft. He said: "Taiwan should consider using the upcoming military aircraft to intercept these, and recruit retired pilots to perform these tasks."</p>
<p>In order to better cope with the increasing risk brought by the potential cross -strait conflicts, Hu Zhendong believes that in addition to formulating a response plan for China's actions, Taiwan should also ensure sufficient war reserve materials. He told DW: "It is very important to ensure that the necessary supplies of Taiwan's necessary materials are in place."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday (May 12) that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国特别代表李辉下周访问乌克兰等国/a-65604536"></a>Visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from next Monday (May 15). This is the highest -level diplomat sent to Ukraine since Moscow's invasion last year.</p>
<p>"Münchnermerkur" (Münchnermerkur) pays attention to the latest move in China to try to play the role of mediation in the Ukrainian crisis, and propose a key question: send a "Putin friend" to take on peaceful mission, how many opportunities to succeed in peace, Intersection</p>
<p>The reporter, Senhauberg, noticed a photo photo (picture of this article) -a was a photo of Li Hui, then the then Chinese ambassador to Russia, and President Putin. In the photo, Putin had a trace of or even a shy smile, while Li Hui, with a thick black hair, posted a gesture that seemed to be a leading way.</p>
<p>"At that time, it can be clearly seen that China is the direction that guides the relationship between the two superpowers .... So some people think that China can impose influence on Putin and finally end up This war in Ukraine. French President Macron and Brazilian President Lula belong to these people who have not yet given up hope. They believe that after the Ukrainian war lasted for more than a year, when will Beijing change from friends from Russia to peace? The creator. "</p>
<p>The author believes that from now on, Beijing is still on the side of the Kremlin on any occasion. While calling with President of Ukraine, Chinese President Xi Jinping only made some empty commitments. Anyway, one of the commitments is now fulfilled -Li Hui, as an Eurasian East, will visit Kiev on Monday.</p>
<p>The article quotes German Asian affairs expert Saskiahieber analyzed that Li Hui's qualifications in regional affairs are undoubted, but this is not the most lucky candidate for Ukraine. "This diplomat has worked in Moscow for 10 years since 2009. It can speak fluent Russian. His entire career has devoted himself to the relationship between China and the Soviet Union and his subsequent countries. Easy and pleasant. In addition, he has also served as the deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years -this person is definitely not a small person in a diplomatic circle. " - People can guess that this candidate may have coordinated with the Kremlin in advance.</p>
<p>As for how serious China ’s efforts to rebuild peace in Ukraine, the article pointed out that what Beijing definitely does not want to see is Russia’ s “completely defeated”. China has never suggested that Russia's withdrawal from the occupied Ukraine land has repeatedly emphasized that the safety demands of all parties should be respected. When Xi Jinping visited Russia this spring, he told Putin, "We will promote it together in a century -old change." The author pointed out whether there is no place to know if there is a place for Ukraine's national interests in such a change process.</p>
<p>The article summarizes that China may eventually become a winner no matter what China. "Even if Li Hui's diplomatic mediation mission returns without success, Beijing can emphasize that he has made at least efforts -and continue to push the guilt of war killing to NATO and the United States."</p>
<p>At the same time, it is still difficult for the European Union to coordinate the unified China policy. The article from the Frankfurt Report reported from the Stockholm venue pointed out that although countries still have a unified stand to face China, the so -called European diplomatic "strategic autonomy" theory proposed by Macron obviously has not much support.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T13-52-00Z/65608426_401.jpg" />Foreign Minister of EU countries take a photo in Stockholm</p>
<p>Author's evaluation <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟希望重新校准对中国立场/a-65612520"></a>It reflects a very difficult "balance technology": on the one hand, it emphasizes that the rise of China's rise in the middle of this century has become the goal of the world -leading power of the world, and the risk avoidance measures that Europe must take; on the other hand It is concluded that the European Union should be decoupled from China, but it advocates adopting a "firm, but not opposite position" to China.</p>
<p>"As for whether this balance technology can be done in practice, it will be reflected in the newly brewing sanctions of the European Union." The article pointed out that the European Commission has recently accused eight Chinese companies importing goods from Europe and transferring it to Russia helps the country for war. So far, the European Union has not taken specific measures on such acts. However, in the future, the European Commission plans to formulate a new sanctions mechanism. The first step is to list the list of high -risk risks that have gained high risk in Russia's sanctions. The second step is to prohibit exports to these countries.</p>
<p>The article also pointed out that at the venue of Stockholm, it can be clearly felt that Macron's argument about Europeans "should not be involved in Taiwan's conflict" is not much supporters. Lithuania Foreign Minister Langzbelgis also said that the upgrade of the Taiwan Strait situation may lead to decoupled with Europe. He added that in fact, an informal foreign minister meeting like this time is the right time to discuss the topic.</p>

<p>On the eve of the stop publication, Zunzi was interviewed by DW. Although he lost his final creative position, he still said: "Ming Pao has been able to adhere to the controversial comics so far, he is much better than other newspapers."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T15-16-00Z/65613867_401.jpg" />"Ming Pao" also published a special manuscript on the 13th.</p>
<h3>The authorities "constantly pressurize"</h3>
<p>Zunzi's real name Huang Jijun has been serialized in the Ming Pao since 1983. It is famous for its irony and Chinese politics. The brushes are hot and sharp, and they can be warm. In the past, it was created in "Apple News" and "One Weekly", which have been suspended one after another. "Ming Pao" is the last place where Zunzi published a column in the mainstream media in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the Hong Kong authorities have named six times and criticized Zunzi's comic "Pets", "Discovering", and made "biased, misleading and misunderstood allegations". The last time was the "Zunzi Comic" criticized the Hong Kong Council of Hong Kong this week.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/讽刺时政遭当局点名-香港漫画家尊子被迫停载/a-65588165)Essence</p>

<p>In the last issue of "Zunzi Comics", the editorial room of the Ming Pao thanked Zunzi for "witness the changes of the times together" in the past 40 years, but did not mention the reason for the suspension. Earlier, Zunzi told the media that the reason for the suspension "Everyone knows where the pressure comes from. The pressure is getting bigger and bigger, and this decision is helpless."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-13T15-16-00Z/65613907_401.jpeg" />Forty years, as a day, the political comics created by Zunzi are the memories of many Hong Kong people (the author authorized by Zunzi).</p>
<h3>News and Creation Freedom narrowed</h3>
<p>The anti -repair campaign broke out in Hong Kong in 2019. China was introduced in 2020 [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港国安法域外适用首案留日学生返港被捕/a-65431047"></a>After that, the space and creation space in Hong Kong continued to narrow, and Zunzi stopped publishing storms once again triggered a wide range of discussions.</p>
<p>Vawongsir, a Hong Kong political cartoonist who is currently settled in Taiwan, believes that the incident highlights the shrinking of Hong Kong's political comic space. He said, "The teacher's work has been growing up with me and has been watching his work growing up, so I feel that in the past for so many years, Hong Kong still seems to have some freedom to criticize the government or give the government opinion, but after the" National Security Law " Now -really today -I really feel that even a tradition is a tradition. Even our (political comics) are gone, it is not allowed to criticize the government in a humorous way, or to give government opinions. So I really feel that there is really no freedom or human rights in Hong Kong. "</p>
<p>After Zunzi comics announced the suspension of publication, Vawongsir released his work, which wrote "Hong Kong today, Tomorrow Newspaper." VAWONGSIR told DW that Hong Kong news is now more reviewed. He expressed it: "In fact, we don't know what to watch, or there is nothing to watch."</p>
<p>According to the latest "World Press Freedom Index" of non -border reporters, [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/年度新聞自由指數出爐-中國排名全球倒數/a-65498888"></a>Essence In 2019, Hong Kong is still 73.</p>
<p>"Ming Pao" removed Zunzi comics. The Hong Kong Reporter Association issued a statement saying "sad" and criticizing "the SAR government with huge resources and public power to snip a literati, reflects the voice of not being criticized in Hong Kong; The content has been violently criticized or accused of illegal law, thereby exacerbating self -examination, and damage to the free space for news and speech that is guaranteed by the Basic Law, which has no benefit to society. "</p>

<p>In the work, a kite with "H.K (Hong Kong)" shakes the air, symbolizing two men in China and Britain grasping the kite line on the ground. According to one side, the dialogue reads "Ask the vast earth, who is floating."</p>
<p>Hong Kong media person Tan Yanyun posted on Facebook, "Zunzi's work span the history of Hong Kong for forty years, and witnessed the mood of the Hong Kong portrait kite being pulled by the Chinese and British parties when the Chinese and English negotiations in the 1980s and 1990s; Including Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Xi Jinping, the Governor of Hong Kong Governor Pengding, etc., all became the protagonists in his pen.

He told DW: "Deng Xiaoping returned in the 1980s, proposed open reforms, domestic folks gradually emancipated their minds, and even cartoonists were active to break a lot of ideas. Hong Kong's left newspapers also followed the general trend. In the new western art article, there are suddenly more comics parks, and even the "comic version" is opened for professional and amateur painters to contribute.</p>
<p>Forty years of openness and narrowing, when asked which work was most impressive during the period, Zunzi told DW that "every period has an important incident, and it is difficult to give an example." It can condense complex things, "expressing the most economical images," emotional "and" reasoning "are there."</p>
<p>A few days ago, Zunzi told the media that suspension is also part of today's "Hong Kong Story", but "even if it is rugged, there is still ahead." The front road was unknown. Every creator in Hong Kong is telling the story of Hong Kong. "</p>
<p>Except for the readers in the Ming Pao, "Free garden needs free soil. Everything in daily life of citizens is the" soil "of this city. Let's work hard together." He also told Dw: "The development of world political and economic development is often There is a surprising new situation, and it often impacted the political trajectory of a small place. You can be happy when you "success". You do n’t need to be discouraged when you fail.</p>

<p>Germany will provide Ukraine with a military reserve of 2.7 billion euros (about 3.95 billion yuan), including 30 leopard tanks. This is the largest military aid provided by Germany to Ukraine so far.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that President Ukraine's staff chief of staff said on social media on Saturday (May 13) that Germany will also provide four IRIS-T air defense systems, 20 weasel infantry chariots (MARDER), 200 unmanned reconnaissance aircraft , 100 armored vehicles and a lot of ammunition.</p>
<p>German Defense Minister Borispistorius issued a statement saying that Germany's military aid supporting facilities showed that Berlin was seriously supporting the invaded Ukraine and would continue to do it. "We all want to end this terrible and illegal war as soon as possible. Unfortunately, it is not yet foreseeable (end of the war). Therefore, Germany will do everything to provide any help, no matter how long it takes."</p>
<p>Because it is expected to face Russia's counterattacks in the next few weeks or months, Ukraine has urged allies to provide remote weapons, military aircraft and ammunition. Germany was initially unwilling to provide heavy weapons for Ukraine, fearing that this might have promoted battle upgrade. But Germany agreed to provide leopard tanks in January this year, and it shows that it will cooperate with the allies to provide more tanks for Ukraine.</p>
