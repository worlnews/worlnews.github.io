<p>Description: Beijing prohibits key information infrastructure to use Meicuang products to counter the United States' further tightening of Chinese chip exports. Analysis believes that this may be a new means used in future geopolitical disputes. But China must also realize the impact of such countermeasures on the country's economy.</p>

"</p>
<p>Washington expressed serious concerns. The announcement of Beijing's announcement was on the occasion of the G7 summit to urge Beijing to end the "economic coercion".</p>
<p>Garyng, a senior economist of French Foreign Trade Bank (Natixis) specializing in global chip trade, told AFN that this response from China is of iconic significance. He said that since the United States has tightened the export restrictions on China in 2021, China has conducted network security censorship on a foreign company for the first time, and the scope of review is rare <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制美國北京以國安為由審查美晶片商/a-65224796">expanded to national security concerns</a>Essence He said that when he encountered other geopolitical affairs in the future, "if the regulatory authorities use this as a means of revenge, I will not be surprised."</p>
<p>Georgetown University's scholar Emilyweinstein, a scholar who studies US -China technology confrontation, said that the definition of "key information infrastructure" is very extensive, from online government services to national defense and medical and water conservancy. "Technically, it can refer to any areas that meet this condition," she said. "China has always established protectionist barriers for national security", including the mandatory technology transfer agreement, requiring the company to store all data locally, and to require foreign entities to establish a joint venture with local partners in some fields.</p>
<h3>"Political Speaking"</h3>
<p>In March last year, China began investigating Micron. In the past five months, the United States announced that it took great restrictions to block Beijing's software for high -end chips, chip production equipment, and design semiconductor software.</p>
<p>Paultriolo, a Chinese technical expert from Olbati-Shiqiao Consulting, said: "This is obviously Beijing thinks Washington supports Micron and the United States semiconductor industry, and Teru said that Micron became a target of targeting The object is to make a political statement. He said that China ’s cyber security censorship of domestic enterprises such as taxis was concentrated in data, rather than expanding into the category of national security.</p>
<p>Washington has previously included Chinese chip manufacturers including Micron's competitors in Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The G7 summit statement states that it will "risk risks instead of decoupling." At the same time, Washington put pressure on the allies to unanimously restrict the export of chip equipment for China.</p>
<p>Gary NG, a senior economist, said: "The strong statement of the G7 may also add a fire."</p>
<h3>Without Taiwan's semiconductor production, what should I do in the world?</h3>
<h3>"Beijing intends to turn to Korean supplier"</h3>
<p>However, when Beijing implements such countermeasures, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact on the economy of the country.</p>
<p>Analysis believes that Micron, one of the largest storage chip manufacturers in the United States, can easily become targets, because its semiconductor can be replaced by South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung.</p>
<p>However, it is much more rare to restrict other American companies such as Intel or Qualcomm, because these technologies are used for consumer products such as smartphones and shipped overseas after manufacturing in China.</p>
<p>Zhuang Jiaying, the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg: "U.S. companies such as Micron are limited, this position may be a signal, that is, in confrontation with the United States, Beijing is willing to bear some pain. The cost. "</p>
<p>The Toby ZHU of Censtan Consulting told Agence France -Presse that the ban will particularly impact the companies that provide cloud services or data centers, because the hardware they use requires high -end storage chips. He said <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美半導體大戰封殺美光韓企得利/a-65705950">Micron's consumer products can "be replaced by South Korea or domestic storage chips. </a>Expert Teru also said that the abacus played by Beijing is to turn to South Korean suppliers.</p>
<p>However, last month, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北京恐禁美光芯片-媒體美籲韓勿填補缺口/a-65414199">White House required Korean chip manufacturers not to increase exports to China to fill the vacancy caused by the United States</a>Essence</p>
<p>At the request of Washington, the Netherlands and Japan have announced restrictions on chip exports.</p>
<p>The chief economist Gary Ng said: "China has always been very cautious and does not make excessive revenge ... Because Beijing cannot quickly expand its domestic capacity to make up for any lack."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) German Chancellor Savz will only stay in South Korea for a few hours on May 21. However, this visit and talks with South Korean President Yin Xiyue have contributed to a series of agreements. The agreement is about <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与韩国将签署军事机密协议/a-65690800">Germany sharing military intelligence and simplifying the national defense industry supply chain of the two countries</a>Essence</p>
<p>Before the bilateral summit, Shulzgang participated in the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Both summits are particularly concerned about the tensions of Ukraine's security crisis and the tight situation in Northeast Asia. China has once again become the most important topic.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that the defense cooperation between Shortz and Yin Xiyue is only the latest example of similar cooperation between countries. All these cooperations can be regarded as a counterattack on China's influence.</p>
<p>What he does in Beijing-from occupying the controversial islands in the South China Sea unilaterally and militaryization, to confrontation with Japan on the East China Sea Island, and conflict with India on border. A reason for the league and agreement.</p>
<p>In recent years, Germany has been strengthening the role of Indo -Pacific. In 2021, a German warship crossed the area and conducted a series of exercises with the navy of other countries. Recently, Germany also sent fighters to participate in joint exercises.</p>
<h3>The relationship between Korea and NATO will be further strengthened</h3>
<p>Before meeting with Yin Xiyue, Shawrtz visited the Non -Military Region (Banmen Store) of the South Korean border. On the boundary of many defense, Shulz said that Pyongyang continued to develop nuclear weapons and long -range missiles, showing that the situation in the Korean Peninsula was still dangerous, and North Korea was still "threat to peace and security in the region."</p>
<p>In the subsequent talks, the two leaders reached an agreement on sharing and protecting military secrets, and established a mechanism to make the military supply chain greater elastic.</p>
<p>Dan Pinkston, a professor of international relations at the Seoul Campus of the University of Troy, pointed out that the "Beijing's expansion policy" is one of the reasons for those countries that do not alliance in China to strengthen cooperation with each other.</p>
<p>"I predict that there will be more such cooperation," Pingkston told Germany. He said, "the South Korean army can foresee that a military exercise will be held with NATO and other countries with common concern. These exercises are important to ensure that the supply chain is guaranteed to ensure that the supply chain is guaranteed."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T-17-14-00Z/65704831_401.jpg" />In a exercise on September 12, 2017, the Korean Air Force F-15K fighter launched the "Taurus"(TAURUS)Remote open air missile</p>
<h3>Ukrainian war deeply shocked South Korea</h3>
<p>In addition to the German and Air Force and the South Korean army, Seoul is also exporting advanced weapon systems to Europe. Last year, South Korea and NATO member states Poland signed a large -scale national defense agreement with an estimated value of up to 15 billion euros ($ 16.2 billion), including the sale of nearly 1,000 K2 main battle tanks, 648 self -propelled howitzers and 48 FA050 fighters.</p>
<p>South Korea hopes that the establishment of closer alliances with European countries like Germany can enhance its deterrence to potential opponents in the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p>Former South Korean diplomats and senior intelligence officials Rah Jong-YIL said: "Obviously, South Korea is seeking closer and more contact with Western countries, and this is obviously attributed to the outbreak of the Ukraine War. South Korea is a big blow. "He said." In the area, China is of course the biggest concern, but we must also closely pay attention to North Korea and Russia. "</p>
<h3>China is also looking for allies</h3>
<p>While Seoul was looking for close allies in the West, China seemed to be on its own diplomatic offensive.</p>
<p>"In recent months, Beijing has been in contact with some countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, hoping to establish their own alliances. Therefore, both sides are establishing partnership and committed to improving their own interests," Luo Zhongyi said.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Hiroshima G7 Summit was held, Beijing held the summit with five Central Asian countries-Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tagikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in Xi'an. China has recently served as a peaceful mediation person in the Middle East and has been praised for promoting the hostility of Saudi Arabia and Iran for many years.</p>
<p>Of course, it will not ignore that China is trying to raise its very strong influence in Asia.</p>

<h4>China -Korea Relations: Do business first, then talk about strategic interests?</h4>
<h3>"Taiwan problem is also a global problem"</h3>
<p>South Korean President Yin Xiyue said in an interview with Reuters on April 19 that the Taiwan Strait situation said that South Korea and the international community stood together to oppose the current situation of the Taiwan Strait with force. He also said: "The issue of Taiwan is not only a problem between China and Taiwan, but also the same as the North Korean issue. It is a global issue." The next day the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the South Korean ambassador to China to propose a serious statement, saying that Yin Xiyue's remarks were "complete Unacceptable. " The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea also summoned the Chinese ambassador to Korea on the same day to protest against Chinese comments from South Korea ’s speech involving Taiwan. Relations between the two countries have once again covered the shadow. In the past 30 years, what kind of development has experienced China -South Korea relations?</p>

<p>On August 24, 1992, the People's Republic of China officially established a ambassador -level diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea, ending the long -term non -recognition and isolating history of the two countries. The picture shows the South Korean Foreign Minister Li Xiangyu (front left) and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen signed and exchanged the joint communiqué in Beijing. The day before, South Korea announced that it had broken diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, causing Taiwan to lose its last diplomatic relations in Asia.</p>

He met with Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Yang Shangkun, President of the State Council, and Li Peng, Prime Minister of the State Council. The two parties signed a series of cooperation agreements such as the China -Korea Trade Agreement and the China -Korea Investment Protection Agreement.</p>

<h3>Sad incident</h3>
<p>In view of the security threat of North Korea's ability to develop nuclear weapons to South Korea, in 2016, the South Korean government decided to deploy the US Sad anti -missile system (Thaad). Because its radar has the potential ability of China, it is considered by China to affect its land security. After opposing invalidation, Beijing has taken multiple countermeasures against South Korea, including the prohibited Korean media and artist performances, tourism blockade, etc. These measures also caused Sino -South Korean relations to cool down rapidly.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Because the land that deployed the Sad system was replaced by the Seoul government to South Korea's Lotte Group, the retail giant became the goal of China's official and civil retaliation. For a while, consumers resist Lotte, demonstration protests, and even suppliers to interrupt the supply. Dozens of Lotian supermarkets were "ordered to suspend business." In addition, sales of Korean brands such as Samsung Mobile, Qia Automobile also plummeted. Chinese travel agencies have removed from South Korea to make the South Korean tourism industry impact.</p>

<h3>"Three Never One Limited" consensus</h3>
<p>In November 2017, China and South Korea reached a consensus, and the Korean side stated that it would not consider the addition of the new Sad system; the necessary restrictions on the existing Sad system; Military alliances and unintentional damage to China 'security interests. After the then President Wen Zaiyin's visit to China in 2017, relations between the two countries began to ease.</p>

<h3>Opportunity or threat</h3>
<p>China is South Korea's largest trading partner, export market and import source country, and South Korea is China's third largest trading partner country. In South Korea's largest single -income source sources of semiconductor exports, more than 40 % of China exports. A questionnaire survey in South Korea's "Central Daily" in August 2022 showed that 19.3%of the respondents believed that the rise of China was a "opportunity", and 75.4%of the respondents believed that this was a "threat".

<h3>Where to go</h3>
<p>The current South Korean President Yin Xiyue (right) showed a more active route to the United States after taking office in May 2022, saying that it will accelerate the deployment and construction of the Sade system. South Korea officially joined the "Indo -Pacific Economic Framework" led by the United States in May 2022(IPEF)And in August, it was announced to join the United States, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan's "Chip Quartet Alliance". Its goals also include strengthening the supply chain, including export control of China.</p>

<h1>The 160th birthday of the Social Democratic Party -Is there a reason to celebrate?</h1>

<p>Description: The Social Democratic Party leads the German federal government, and the Social Democratic Party Schilde is the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is not ideal. Police investigations show that the support rate of the Social Democratic Party has declined, and its joint governance with the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party is not smooth.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) at the Social Democratic Party headquarters in Berlin, it is rare to celebrate. As a result, every Jiebao will be valued. "Today is a wonderful night for us. We are very proud of the Social Democratic Party, which Bhili Mei and Bai Mei Port," said the Social Democratic Party ’s General Secretary Kevinkühnert, and said after the Social Democratic Party won the Meizhou Parliament on May 14.</p>
<p>Andreas Bovenschulte, Mayor of the Social Democratic Party, even sang "Stand Byme" (standing beside me) at the end of the campaign, and Lars Klingbeil, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, who came from Berlin, used it. The guitar accompanied by the side, and called for voters to "stand beside the Social Democratic Party" by music. In the end, the Social Democratic Party received 29.8%of the votes in Bulangmei, which was the second secondary election results in more than 70 years.</p>

<h3><strong> The ruling party in the fall </strong></h3>
<p>The Social Democratic Party, located in Berlin Headquarters, wants to learn some experience from the success of Blackme. The General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, Konat, said that they will carefully study the gains of the victory. However, the successful cases of Bremei are the result of the Federal Democratic Party's dream.</p>
<p>The support rate of the CDU/Cocoons in polls exceeds 30%, while the Social Democratic Party's support rate hovers between 17%and 19%, and competes with the Green Party and the Green Party and the Right -wing Party Options Party (AFD). In the history of the federal government, there is no support for the party's party.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/奥拉夫肖尔茨被低估嘲笑的社民党救星/a-59327642">The reason why Scharsez and its party and the Social Democratic Party wins in the federal election in September 2021</a>It is just because the Candidate candidate of the CDU made too many mistakes and weak strength in the election?</p>
<h3><strong> Short high rise </strong></h3>
<p>Looking at the year of election and subsequent polls, you will find that the Social Democratic Party has made great progress before the Federal House election. From 16%in July 2021 to nearly 26%in September. This rise has continued until the spring of 2022, and then began to fall. A bitter fact: Politicians believe that a political party must get at least 20%of the votes in order to be called "Volkspartei".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-28T-21-12-00Z/58305145_401.jpg" />Arminlaschet, the candidate for the Prime Minister of the CDU, laughed while investigating the disaster when the Ahrtal was destroyed by the flood. At the same time, Federal President Steinmier was delivered. After the photo was exposed, Lasha's polls support rate dropped straight up</p>
<p>Has the "return of social democracy" celebrated by the Social Democratic Party has become history? The number of members of the Social Democratic Party has continued to decline earlier before the federal parliament election, and even the large cities that had a lot of support were defeated. Berlin is the latest example -the CIMC has taken over the city again 22 years after the Social Democratic Party was in power.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party's situation in eastern Germany looks really bad. In Saxony and Saxon-Anhart, the support rate of the Social Democratic Party in public opinion surveys is only a single digit.</p>
<h3><strong> When will you return to social issues? </strong></h3>
<p>In this sluggish atmosphere, the Social Democratic Party ushered in its 160th birthday. As the oldest political parties in Germany, the Social Democratic Party has celebrated its birthday for three consecutive days through speeches, forums, exhibitions, and awards ceremonies. This is a rare opportunity that can breathe and replenish energy, and it is also an opportunity to reveal the figure in the ruling league again.</p>
<p>Celebrate the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party in Berlin's headquarters and Willie Brand Building(Willy Brandt House)The theme is based on the theme of "progress needs to be imposed".</p>
<p>Social issues are the core competitiveness of the Social Democratic Party. But the facts are blurred and diluted by the Ukrainian war and its influence. The Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Party is mainly busy with foreign policy. The Minister of the Social Democratic Party is busy with immigration.</p>
<p>In view of the tightness of the inflation and the construction market, the main commitment of the Social Democratic Party during the campaign -built 400,000 houses every year -no mention of it.</p>

Directed by the Green Party, the elimination of oil and natural gas heating has been panicked since 2024, and many people have pushed many voters to the arms of the opposition party.</p>
<p>Due to inflation, the cost of living has risen significantly. For people without financial reserves, it is becoming more difficult to maintain their livelihood. At present, the Society's Democratic Party hopes to step on the brakes for the "Energy Law of Architecture". They said that although climate protection is important, it cannot be too heavy. Minister of Labor Hubertusheil said that the bill must be improved, and the solution must be "feasible at the technical level and acceptable to the social level."</p>

In 2019, the left -wing faction prevented the politics of Scharsez, who prevented politics that is even more inclined to the right of right -wing society to become a leader. But since Salz has served as the Prime Minister, the left -wing faction has been silent and obeyed the party discipline.</p>
<h3><strong> Personal charm becomes more and more important </strong></h3>
<p>Shawrtz has never been particularly popular in the Social Democratic Party, but as the Prime Minister, he has received the respect and attention he deserves. However, this is a kind and goodwill linking with achievement. Only when he can give the party's interests, the party will always support him. In this case, carefully studying the success of the Social Democratic Party may help. There, a social Democratic party won the trust of voters with a down -to -earth, approachable and popular image.</p>
<h3>Shawrtz's first year as German Prime Minister: What did he change?</h3>
<p>In the election, personal charm is becoming more and more important, and the elections in other state parliaments have also confirmed this in the past few years. However, Shelz is relatively lacking in this regard. He often gives people a kind of indifference, no emotion and difficulty. Therefore, from this point, it may be difficult to get successful experience from Bon Mei Mei.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to the natural index data released on May 19, from January 2022 to December, Chinese authors published a "share" of 19,373 papers in 82 high -quality journals, which exceeded the United States for the first time. Number one. The United States is 17610.</p>
<p>The natural index is compiled and published by the subordinate agency of the publishing agency "Spelinge-Nature Publishing Group", tracking scientific research papers published in 82 high-quality journals, and analyzing data such as the author's belonging. A country's share is based on the proportion of authors of the country in each paper published in the natural index journal. If an article is fully published by Chinese researchers, China's share is 1.</p>
<p>According to the natural index of 2022, in terms of physics, chemistry, earth, and environmental sciences, authors who belong to Chinese institutions are more than those in the United States. The only thing that is still in the United States is life science.</p>
<p>A report from the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy in Japan last year said that from 2018 to 2020, Chinese research accounted for the proportion of the first 1%papers with the largest number of references than US research. The report also found that China published an average of 407,181 scientific papers each year, leading 293,434 ahead of the United States.</p>
<p>The increase in references for Chinese research should be attributed to a large number of references to the COVID-19 genome sequencing. However, although China's scientific research share ranks more than the United States, the cooperation between Sino -US authors is the most in international cooperation. Many of the most cited papers in China have also been completed with international researchers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the natural index also shows that according to the total statistics of all articles from a certain country/region, the total number of American scientific papers in 2022 was nearly 25,200 in 2022, and China was more than 2,3500.</p>
<h3>Sino -US scientist cooperation becomes difficult</h3>
<p>The Guardian pointed out that with the deterioration of US -China relations, scientists in the two countries have become more difficult. From 2018 to 2022, the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/斯坦福大学177名学者联名要求美司法部停止执行中国行动计划/a-59168487">"China Action Plan", which was launched by the US Department of Justice to eradicate Chinese spies and theft of intellectual property and business secrets(China Initiative)导致100多名科学家失去工作</a>Essence Chinese universities also strictly review their cooperation with foreigners.</p>
<h3>Chinese researchers' big papers for fake attention attract attention</h3>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called on raising scientific research funds and investment. The academic community was pushed to the forefront of science and technology competition. However, Chinese researchers say they are under pressure to give priority to the quantity rather than quality. In order to increase the output, the dissertation was also faked and low -quality research occurred. In 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China banned universities and research institutions to make financial rewards to increase the number of published papers.</p>

<p>据科学网微信公众号2022年1月25日的一篇报道，毕克团队自2020年以来已经发现了16个"论文工厂"及其生产的2000多篇论文，绝大多数含有中国作者。毕克团队化名扮虎的成员告诉《中国科学报》，"国内的论文工厂100%是中国客户，国外的论文工厂有一部分也是中国客户，从全世界来看，最大的买家无疑来自中国。"</p>

<p>Biden and McCarthy</p>
<p><strong> After several weeks of fierce negotiations, the White House and Republican Party finally agreed to increase the upper limit of US Treasury bonds. People who are concerned about the US economic crisis worldwide can be relieved. However, this agreement still needs to be approved by Congress. </strong></p>
<p>President Joe Biden said the agreement was "compromise", and the Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the agreement "historically cut in expenditure."</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury has previously warned that without reaching an agreement, the United States will not be able to pay bills on June 5. If this happens, it will subvert the US economy and severely damage the global market.</p>

<p>With a $ 24 trillion US debt market, it is the world's largest debt market and the main source of financing for the US government. From mortgage interest rates to the world's most powerful US dollar currency, U.S. debt is indispensable for financial entries.</p>
<h3>Preliminary agreement reached</h3>
<p>The background of this negotiation is that the United States must borrow money to fund the government at the moment because expenditure exceeds taxes. However, Republicans have been seeking expenditures in the fields of education and other social welfare programs in exchange for the upper limit of Treasury bonds increased by 31.4 trillion US dollars. The law limits how much debt can accumulate the US government.</p>
<p>Republican senior officials said that unless the government reduces expenses in the next few years, they will not increase the upper limit of government bonds, and the Democratic Party has proposed to raise some taxes to respond.</p>
<p>The specific details of the new agreement have not been officially announced. However, according to the BBC understanding, non -national defense expenses will basically remain unchanged within two years. For example, the medical insurance plan "Medicaid" will not have a major budget increase or decrease. However, government plans to provide low -income or non -income citizen food purchase assistance are unclear.</p>

<p>Behind this crisis is a fundamental ideological difference between the two major political parties in the United States.</p>
<p>On Saturday (May 27th) local time on Saturday (May 27th), McCarthy said he and Biden had a phone call twice that day. He said: "After several weeks of negotiations, we reached an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do, but I believe this is a principle agreement that is valuable to the American people."</p>
<p>The problem of debt limit highlighted a fundamental difference between the two major major parties in the United States. The Republican Party is suspicious of government expenditure, because for them, increasing government bonds are a proof of government out of control.</p>
<p>McCarthy also said that it is planned to draft the bill on Sunday (28th) on Sunday (28th), and then vote on parliament on Wednesday. He said he would talk to Biden again later that day. Biden said in a statement: "This agreement represents a compromise, which means that not everyone can get what they want. This is the responsibility of government governance." He also said: "This agreement is right for this agreement. The American people are good news because it prevents the occurrence of catastrophic defaults, avoiding economic recession, severe damage to retirement accounts, and loss of millions of jobs. "</p>
<h3>What is the debt crisis?</h3>
<p>Facing the crisis, Biden and McCarthy held a budget negotiation last week. If the U.S. Congress cannot reach an agreement on raising the so -called debt upper limit, the United States may breach contracts on debt issues, causing global financial confusion.</p>
<p>So how does the United States fall into this situation?</p>
<p>The upper limit of debt, also known as debtlimit, is a law that limits the total amount of the US government's borrowing to pay for its expenses. This includes the cost of paying federal employees, military, social security and medical insurance (Medicare), as well as interest and tax refund of taxes and taxes.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress will vote or suspend debt upper limit every time, so as to further borrow.</p>
<p>The current upper limit is about $ 31.4 trillion. The limit was broken in January this year, but the U.S. Treasury Department adopted a "very means" to provide more cash to the government when determining countermeasures. Under normal circumstances, Congress is just a routine procedure according to financial needs. However, this time the two major parties of Congress seemed to be unable to agree.</p>
<p>US Finance Minister Ye Lun warned that if more money can be borrowed, the United States will not be able to meet all financial obligations before June 1.</p>
<h3>What are the consequences of default debt?</h3>
<p>There has never been a debt default in American history, so we cannot fully predict what consequences will be. But it is certain that this will cause major damage to the economy. Because the U.S. government will no longer pay the salary of federal and military personnel, and millions of social security checks that US retirees rely on will stop issuing. Companies and charity relying on government funds will also face danger.</p>
<p>In addition, if the US government stops paying debt interest, this will also cause the country to be in default.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-28T08-37-47.000Z/_129613770_whatsubject.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Some people urged Biden to quote the 14th amendment of the Constitution and bypass Congress.</p>
<p>Moody'sanalytics predicts that if the breach of contract occurs, in the case of long -term stalemate, the US stock price will fall by nearly 5 minutes, and the economy will shrink by more than 4%, resulting in loss of more than 7 million jobs. Essence</p>
<p>In the long run, if investors start to think that US debt has risks, they will ask the United States to pay higher borrowing interest. Due to the influence of government loan activities at the general level of interest rates, this impact will spread to the national economy, which will increase the cost of lending in houses or cars when buying houses or cars.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are still differences between Americans who can pay priority to paying interest to avoid debt defaults. However, in the case of retirees and others failed to get payment, if the government prioritizes the commitment to the US debt holder (including financial institutions, retirement funds, and foreign investors), this is considered to be difficult to politically. Sales for the options that Americans accept.</p>
<h3>President's use of the 14th amendment to the Constitution?</h3>
<p>In the absence of an agreement, someone had urged Biden to quote the 14th amendment to the Constitution before, bypassing Congress. The amendment stipulates: "The validity of the public debt of the United States of America ... cannot be questioned."</p>
<p>This clause was passed after the American civil war, which aims to ensure that at that time, the southern slave state in the United States paid the war debt accumulated in the northern state, and ensured that the government did not need to pay compensation to the slave holders and others in the south.</p>
<p>Biden previously said that this clause was considering using this clause. However, many comments say that the use of this clause to challenge the upper limit of debt can almost cause a legal dispute. Moreover, this method is limited in the current crisis.</p>
<p>Ye Lun's previous speech faded down the possibility, and she said that any move trying to quote the clause will trigger a constitutional crisis.</p>
<h3>negotiation plan</h3>
<p>In April this year, the Republican Party proposed an agreement to suspend debt limit with a amount of $ 1.5 trillion. As exchanges, they will maintain the expenditure level of key American institutions in the next fiscal year as in 2022, and will be limited to 1 % per year in the next 10 years, which will save $ 4.8 trillion.</p>
<p>However, the Republican Party's proposal will abolish the key priority expenditures in the governance of the Biden government, such as student loans and electric vehicle tax incentives. The White House said that the Republican agreement forced "the burden of tax reduction of the most borne by the middle class and the labor -class family." They believe that the Republican agreement has no chance to be able to legislate.</p>
<h3>How to reach an agreement?</h3>
<p>Many analysts predict that "short -term extension" allows Congress to have more time to negotiate to reach an agreement. In 2011, the last time the United States was considered to face the risk of serious breach of contract, the negotiations had been dragged until the last moment, and it was not until a few hours before the deadline that the compromise agreement was reached. The agreement at the time included cutting 900 billion US dollars in expenditure in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>However, even delay can produce negative consequences. In 2011, a similar ride caused US credit rating to reduce, and the stock market plummeted. It is estimated that the public will pay at least $ 1.3 billion in higher loan costs that year alone.</p>
<h3>The ideological differences behind the crisis</h3>
<p>In fact, behind this crisis highlighted a fundamental differences between the two major American parties.</p>
<p>The Republican Party is skeptical of the Democratic government's expenditure. For them, increasing government bonds are evidence of government out of control.</p>
<p>Although, for the Republican Party, it is relatively new to make a strategy of restricting debt limits, but many Republicans believe that this is necessary. Because they believe that the current debt processing methods in the United States will eventually lead to economic and social destruction.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party believes that the government's policy of raising debts is a positive means, which is a policy that improves Americans' lives and corrects historical errors. They believe that it is necessary to increase the upper limit of debt when necessary to maintain government operations.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Democrats, Treasury bonds only provide funds for the legislative plans that have been discussed and approved.</p>
<p>During the presidential period of Trump, the debate on the upper limit of debt has decreased. The US Congress raised the debt limit three times and did not conduct major debate. But after Biden took office, this problem has attracted attention.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) For North Koreans, the country's twists and turns northern borders are a rare channel for obtaining external information, and it is also the best choice for seeking escape.</p>
<p>However, at the same time that the new crown epidemic in 2020 swept the world, the North Korean regime led by Kim Jong -un has a large -scale project to block the large -scale border between the country and China and Russia, cutting off the smugglers and the [North North].(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/韩国梦破灭新年越境脱北者在韩离群索居/a-60326482)The channel.</p>
<p>According to a survey report released by Reuters, commercial satellite images show that the Pyongyang government has built or renovated the boundary fences, fences and posts with a total length of hundreds of kilometers in the epidemic for several years, so that it can strengthen the information and materials flowing into North Korea for information and supplies. Control to prevent the people from the country from running out.</p>
<p>Reuters and Middlebury Institute of International Studies Atmonterey (Middlebury Institute of International Studies Atmos) obtained the above conclusions by the oral analysis of satellite image analysis, as well as seven northern people, activists, and other insiders.</p>
<p>A Korean pastor, who once helped the Koreans escape, told Reuters: "The traditional North Korea-China route is basically broken, unless the situation has changed significantly."</p>

<p>According to official statistics from South Korea, only 67 people from North North in 2022 successfully entered South Korea, which was significantly reduced compared with the 1047 people in 2019. As China has strengthened border control, this number has actually declined before the outbreak. For those who are from the North, taking Tao China is their preferred path.</p>
<p>For the construction of a reinforcement border, the North Korean government and official media have rarely mentioned it, and the North Korean Embassy in London did not answer the inquiry call from Reuters reporters. However, in the speech of "defeating the new crown virus" last year, Kim Jong -un has instructed officials to "ensure the improvement of the comprehensive multiple blocking walls of the border, front lines and coastal areas and sea airspace.</p>
<h3>Cutting off the "Life Line"</h3>
<p>The School of Research, Reuters and Monterem University of Monte University, analyzed the northern North Korean border satellite image taken from different stages of Google EarthPro from 2019 to early 2023.</p>

Concrete walls and additional guards. Some other areas can also see some changes, but due to the limitations of images cannot make a conclusion judgment.</p>
<p>The researchers pointed out that most of these additional border protection facilities are located in the residential area that lacks natural barriers (such as high mountains). In addition, the border fences are also added near the flat farmland along the River River.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) American Deputy Trade Representative Sarai Biaqi(Plate H Hi -Haku)This Saturday said that the Bayeng government did not think that the US -China trade relations would make breakthroughs, but they would continue to have different levels of dialogue with China. She said: "We are evaluating from the perspective of analysis. We have not taken any breakthroughs in trade relations with China as a part of consideration. We do not assume that it will happen."</p>
<p>Bi Anqi, who is responsible for supervising the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR), said that USTR is continuing to study the opinions of the industry and stakeholders on tariffs and negotiate with the US Department of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance and other institutions to determine which category tariffs Strategic, what is economical and reasonable.</p>
<h3>Evaluation after 4 years of tariffs</h3>
<p>After investigation in accordance with the 301st Calculation of the 1974 Trade Law, it was found that after China stole the intellectual property rights in the United States and coerced American companies to transfer sensitive technologies to carry out business, former US President Trump in 2018 and 2019 was about the value of about the value at the time at the time was approximately value. Thousands of Chinese goods of $ 370 billion are levied on tariffs.</p>
<h3>Will Bayeng continue to trade in China?</h3>
<p>At present, the scope of tariffs on China includes 7.5 % tariffs on many consumer goods, and 25 % tariffs on vehicles, industrial components, semiconductors and other electronic products. The main categories of tariff exemption include mobile phones, laptops, and video game consoles.</p>

<h4>贸易战走过三年，该往何处去？</h4>
<h3>贸易逆差不减反增</h3>
<p>特朗普把减少对华贸易赤字作为其优先政策。根据与北京达成阶段性协议，中方承诺从美进口大豆等更多商品。然而统计数字显示，2020年中国对美贸易顺差扩大，达到3169亿美元，上升7.1%。与2017年的2658亿美元相比，更增加了14.9%。去年，遭新冠疫情重创的美国对产自中国的电子、医疗产品需求明显增加。</p>

<h3>就业岗位在哪里</h3>
<p>特朗普曾誓言要让制造业的就业岗位回归美国。但美国企业及其雇员也是关税等贸易制裁措施的受害者。经济资讯分析公司“牛津经济”(OxfordEconomics)的一项调查显示，贸易战导致美国丧失的就业岗位可能已达24.5万个。相反，如果逐步消除贸易壁垒，至2025年美国可能重新创造14.5万个就业机会。</p>

<h3>More and more Chinese companies on the blacklist</h3>
<p>In January 2021, the United States added nine companies including Xiaomi to the Ministry of Defense as a list of contact with the Chinese military and issued an investment ban. Earlier, the United States has joined 60 Chinese companies including SMIC and DJI to join the blacklist of trade, because these companies have the actions that "violate US national security or foreign policy interests".</p>

<h3>Huawei dispute</h3>
<p>In the US -China trade conflict, China Telecom giant Huawei has become one of the focus of controversy. In August 2018, Trump signed a bill to ban any US government departments from using products from Huawei and ZTE, including network equipment. Under the urging of the United States, many countries around the world have decided to exclude Huawei outside the construction of 5G networks. In May 2019, the US Department of Commerce included Huawei and 70 affiliated companies in the "entity list" to prohibit American companies from selling components from Huawei. Subsequently, Google began to restrict the use of Android systems and related applications in Huawei mobile phones. The Meng Wanzhou incident, which has continued to the end of 2018, is also considered a microcosm of the United States punishment to suppress Huawei.</p>

<h3>渔翁得利</h3>
<p>伴随着中国制造被征收高关税，美国一些进口商开始转战其他国家。越南和墨西哥成为其中的赢家。在中美贸易纠纷的两年中，越南对美出口增加了64亿美元。而在2017年至2019年间，墨西哥估计多向美国出口了47亿美元。台湾也进一步扩大了其对美国的出口量。此外中美贸易纠纷迫使很多中国制造商更快从中国迁出，将生产线迁往越南。</p>

<p>2022年12月16日，美国贸易代表办公室宣布对中国输出美国的352项产品的关税豁免将延长9个月。这个期限将于今年9月30日到期。华盛顿的一些贸易专家认为，这个日子可能是关税评估的一个决定性的时间点。</p>
<p>US Finance Minister Yellen believes that the cancellation of "non -strategic" tariffs can reduce the cost of specific commodities, but trade representative Dai Qi believes that these tariffs are "important leverage" to China.</p>
<p>Bianqi said that because inflation has been relieved, discussions related to tariffs have subsided.</p>
<h3>Meizhong for the first time in the first time in the cabinet -level meeting</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-28T23-28-42-00-00/000182696_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Last week, two things related to Chinese diplomacy received widespread attention from world public opinion.</p>
<p>First, there has been a new developments in China and Russia's energy cooperation: During the time of Russia's Prime Minister Michase's Beijing visit to China last week, China temporarily sheltered on the project work of Russia's "Siberian Power 2" pipeline that specializes in natural gas to China, let alone say It is ready to start construction. Secondly, China and the United States are trying to control each other's tensions, but they are only at this level; at the same time, the oppositional actions of the two sides have not stopped.</p>
<p>The above two things are the latest changes in China's diplomacy last week. The former marked China's energy strategy and subtle adjustments to Russian diplomacy. The latter means that China intends to adjust and ease the tension between China and the United States. Mainly depending on the United States.</p>
<p><strong> Not just to reduce the price </strong></p>
<p>International public opinion believes that China puts on the "Siberian Power 2" project in order to "delay for a long time that may allow China to have a lower price through the natural gas obtained by the pipeline." But this understanding may be too simple. You know, it has been communicated for this project for several years for this project. This project, when the Russian Prime Minister's visit to China, is completely considered by comprehensive factors. First of all, the Mongolian factors of the project and the motivation to change the energy pipeline route of Russia; ; Of course, it is also a factor, but obviously does not take the primary position.</p>
<p>First of all, unlike other Russia's pipelines that transport energy to China, the "Siberian Power 2" pipeline is not only a project between China and Russia. It starts from Russia's Alfa, and needs to cross Mongolia and enter China in Inner Mongolia south. Mongolia. In fact, the starting point of the pipeline Russia Altai and Xinjiang, China have a narrow border channel of dozens of kilometers. If the pipeline enters China from here, and then connects the "Western Qi East Instead" pipeline in Xinjiang, China Shunye.</p>
<p>According to industry sources, the author: This pipeline route also considers Xinjiang to enter China through Xinjiang. However, Putin finally changed his mind and changed to Mongolia from the starting point of Russia's Altai, and then entered the East and South China Inner Mongolia. Of course, Mongolia likes this pipeline. It can charge tolls and other service fees from it, and objectively, it has more tools to restrict other countries. To this end, Mongolia was sent to China 30,000 sheep in 2020. In the final analysis, it was to show China to let China agree to this pipeline through Mongolia. However, some elites in Mongolia were affected by the West, and China -Mongolia relations were very complicated because of historical reasons. On the contrary, Russia -Mongolia relations have always been good, which is not possible to be considered by Putin's consideration. Therefore, for China, the security of this energy pipeline that has shifted to China is uncertain, and diplomatic factors also exist.</p>
<p>When I was consulting this energy pipeline that year, I once made it clear that China should refuse the route to Mongolia to China, but insist on entering the country from the Altai to Xinjiang. Price can be accepted. At that time, the actual situation was that Russia's negotiation capabilities were very powerful in China -Russia's energy diplomacy and trade; not only that, even in the energy trade between China and the five Central Asian countries, Russia was also improving China's influence.</p>
<p>After the Russian and Ukraine War, all this has completely reversed, and China's adjustment of relevant policies is also natural.</p>
<p>Secondly, China, as a world -class energy consumption country, is implementing policies to avoid excessive relying on any supply country to supply energy to China. According to international media: China has only a slightly higher natural gas supply that rely on Russia. However, due to the "Siberian Power 2" agreement, coupled with the Russian natural gas supply planned through the existing pipeline, by the early 2030s, China's natural gas dependence on Russia will increase to about 20%. This proportion obviously means that it is too dependent on Russia's energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, China is currently actively developing other land energy pipelines to China. International media said: At the China-Central Asian Summit last week, Chinese leaders initiated to accelerate the construction of China-Central Asian natural gas pipelines. The fourth natural gas pipeline. Another data worthy of attention was: Last year, Turkmenistan exported about 35 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China through three channels, while Russia only transported 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China through the "Siberian power" pipeline.</p>
<p>In this way, China does not have the motivation to start the "Siberian Power 2".</p>
<p>Of course, the so -called "dragging for a long time may allow China to have a lower price" that can allow China to obtain through the pipeline ", but this is the safety of energy and energy pipelines, as well as complex China, Russia, Mongolia, and Mongolia. Compared with factors, it can be ignored. And it is understood that this project was originally planned to start at least one year later, so China is not in a hurry, and it may be possible to set aside.</p>
<p><strong> China and the United States try to control the tension relationship </strong></p>
<p>Another thing that triggered international attention last week was that China and the United States were trying to control and ease the tension between each other, but it was only limited to this level; at almost the same time period, one party's pressure on the other party's pressure on the other party No stop at all. This phenomenon has become the norm for a period of time, and it shows that Sino -US relations are difficult to stable.</p>
<p>Last week, the Minister of Commerce in the United States held a talks in Washington. According to the introduction of the Ministry of Commerce of the two countries, the content of the conversation is similar, and the text is almost the same. The Ministry of Commerce of China said: Wang Wentao met with Raymond during the meeting of the Minister of Trade in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Minister of Trade in the United States to express "key concerns" on the United States' economic and trade policy, semiconductor policy, export control, and foreign investment review. The U.S. Department of Commerce said that Raymondo expressed concerns about Beijing's recent action in American companies. The only difference is that China emphasizes that it is not specifically to talk to you, but to participate in a meeting, by the way.</p>
<p>The same is true for both parties to each other. China said: the two sides conducted a "frank, professional and constructive" opinion on bilateral trade relations; the United States also stated: "A frank and substantial discussion" shows that both China and the United States actively evaluated each other's talks.</p>
<p>All this can only show that both China and the United States are intending to control and ease the relationship between tensions, and the motivation of the United States is of course related to the possible debt defaults, which is directly and clear; China is also for the United States in the field of economic and trade in China and China. The problem came.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, almost in the same week, the two sides of the opponent's suppression of each other was almost simultaneously conducted: the United States exported a thorns to Taiwan, and may be sent to the island; China sanctioned the product of the United States Micron. In the same time period, the phenomenon of two parties at the same time, at the same time, is almost normal.</p>
<p>This normal nature illustrates the deep alertness of China and the United States for each other, as well as the unreliable unreliable relationship. The prospects of bilateral relations may be: to meet with trouble, and nothing to meet.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-29T-10-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Agence France -Presse reported that the North Korean economy with nuclear weapons is quite fragile. The Pyongyang government has taken priority to consider the military and nuclear military programs instead of fully satisfying the people's needs.</p>
<p>North Korea Central Communications (KCNA) reported that the upcoming meeting of the Central Committee of the Labor Party will evaluate the implementation of the national economic plan in the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>North Korea implemented a strict blockade in early 2020 to curb the spread of COVID-19 (2019 coronary virus disease), and it was not resumed until last year that some trade with China was restored.</p>
<p>The Labor Party held a high -level meeting in February this year to solve the shortage of food and agricultural problems.</p>
<p>In that meeting, North Korean leader Kim Jong -un asked officials to ensure that the food production goals were "be sure to achieve".</p>
<p>North Korea's cycle suffered famine, and a famine in the 1990s killed hundreds of thousands of people; some people even estimated that this famine had taken up millions of life.</p>
<p>Despite the difficult economic situation, North Korea has conducted a series of record weapon tests this year, including its first solid fuel ballistic missile, which is a major technological breakthrough.</p>

The European Union is currently trying to get rid of part of the economic dependence of China's Asian power.</p>
<p>The western economy is facing a dilemma: it is necessary to reduce the dependence on the supply chain of China, but also see the domestic cleaning technologies such as solar energy and automobile batteries -the industry is dominated by Chinese enterprises -increased demand. Although the United States is "decoupling" with China, Europe has become more cautious in this regard, because its economy is more dependent on Asia, and it has been due to Vladimir Putin(Vladimir Putin)入侵乌克兰后欧盟停止从俄罗斯进口能源和原材料而受到打击。</p>

<h3>印度人口超中国，它能成为一个全方位的超级大国吗</h3>
<ul>
<li>利卡多·森拉(Ricardo Senra)   * BBC记者</li>
</ul>
<p>2023年5月29日凌晨1点41分<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T01-41-16.000Z/_129872996_4ab0c664-8c66-477b-be67-196896e0703b.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>

<p>"The more people, the stronger the country. This is the idea of the 19th century."</p>
<p><strong> According to the United Nations data, India has just surpassed China and has become the country with the largest population in the world. Can it match this powerful neighbor -or even surpass it -becomes the world's superpower? </strong></p>
<p>In terms of economic scale, geopolitical influence and military strength, Beijing is still at ease, but experts believe that this pattern is changing.</p>
<p>Michael Spence, the Nobel Prize winner of Economics in 2001, believes that India's high light is coming.</p>
<p>The dean and professor of the Stanford University of Stanford said to BBC: "India will eventually match China. The Chinese economy will slow down, but India will not."</p>
<p>But India also faces challenges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65455645">India, which became the world's largest population, should be fortunate or anxious</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65332635">How many people are there in India? You may really don't know</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-63982176">India -China border conflict: a 60 -year war shadow</a>China is the second largest economy in the world. It is almost five times larger than India, and India is only fifth.</p>
<p>India's middle class is relatively small in scale. It is necessary to heavy investment education, enhance living standards, achieve gender equality and economic reforms to achieve the growth of the "Chinese -style" outbreak.</p>
<p>To be the world's superpower, it is not enough to rely on the population and economy alone, but it depends on geopolitics and military forces -India is still unable to reach these aspects.</p>
<p>Soft power will also play a key role. India's Bollywood's film industry has made efficiency in the world, and has broken a lot of records on Netflix (Nafei).</p>
<p>But on the other side, there is also the so -called Chinawood -the Chinese film industry is booming. In 2020, it replaced Hollywood for the first time in the world and appeared on the world's largest box office throne. In 2021, the defending of China was successful.</p>
<h3>'S economic momentum</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T01-41-16.000Z/_129872999_chinese_indias_population_predicted_to_take_over_china_v2_640-nc-2x.png" />At present, India is born 86,000 babies every day, and China is 49,400.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-64301818">Low birth rate</a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-64389487">China's population has begun to shrink</a>It is expected to fall below 1 billion at the end of this century.</p>
<p>The United Nations pointed out that India's population will continue to increase to 2064, from current 1.4 billion to 1.7 billion in 2064.</p>
<p>This will allow India to enjoy the "demographic dividend" -the economy has increased rapidly with the increase of labor age.</p>
<p>Professor Prof Markfrazier, director of the India China Institute (The New School) Director of India China Institute (The New School), said: How high the education is, how healthy, how strong the technical ability is, and how much their ability to contribute to the economy. "</p>
<p>[India has attracted major multinational companies such as Apple and Foxconn in recent months.(https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-63155797)However, the instability caused by its internal bureaucracy and policy towards the evening reform scared some international investors.</p>
<p>Professor Fraser added, "the more people, the stronger the country, the idea of the 19th century." Because there are other factors to consider it.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank data, only half of India's labor population (14 to 64 years old) is currently working or job hunting.</p>
<p>If you only look at women, the ratio has fallen to 25% -60%in China, and the EU is 52%.</p>
<p>After a series of reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, China's economic scale increased beyond all countries. However, the epidemic, population aging, and increasingly intense relationship with Western relations in the 2019 new coronal virus disease (COVID-19) are overwhelming, which is affecting the economic growth of this country.</p>
<p>The growth rate of GDP in India (GDP) has surpassed China. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast, this momentum will continue.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T01-41-16.000Z/_129873000_chinese_china_india_gdp_growth_2x_640_alt-nc.png" /><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-62834711">How many Russian oil did China and India buy? </a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-56168906">Border conflict is not hindered by the hot trade, China has once again become India's largest trading partner</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-61154116">Can India be a "world granary" for global food? </a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-56154263">"Vaccine Diplomacy" becomes the Western camp of the China -India New Power Field Considering</a>So, does the slowing economic growth mean that China will move towards marginalization?"China is more like the United States now, we have never had a growth rate of 8%, 9%, and 10%. They will rely on the improvement of productivity. I think they can do it because they have made huge investment in education, science and technology, ","</p>
<h3>China's military expansion</h3>
<p>China and India are both nuclear powers, which allows them to occupy strategic opportunities in international games.</p>
<p>According to Federation of American Scientists, Beijing's nuclear weapon library is 2.5 times that of New Delhi.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T01-41-16.000Z/_129877341_nuclear_warheads_by_countryv4_inf640-nc-2x-2x.png" /><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-62010317">Internal and external consideration of the Indian military reform and the impact on China</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-59743026">Can China be the winner in the new global arms competition</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-62756062">India's first domestic aircraft carrier officially served: ascended to the "Victor" to find out</a>China is nearly 600,000 more troops than India, and it focuses on the construction of the defense industry.</p>
<p>Professor Fraser said: "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-59545990">India relies heavily on Russia</a>The introduction of their technology and expertise, China has no doubt many scientific research and independently develop military infrastructure. "</p>
<p>China has obvious advantages in the field of defense army, and India tends to maintain good relationships with Europe and the United States, where there are most of the world's military forces.</p>
<p>Professor Fraser added: "India can become an important strategic partner in the Indo -Pacific region. The U.S. government is establishing a safe zone around China, including not only East Asia but also South Asia; not only the Western Pacific, but also the Indian Ocean."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T01-41-16.000Z/_129877342_china_india_armed_forces_640_2x640-nc.png" /></p>
<h3>choice of geopolitics</h3>
<p>India is the host of the G20 summit this year. When the leader of a country with 85%of the world's wealth is sitting on the negotiating table, India seems to have the opportunity to sell themselves.</p>
<p>Since Donaldtrump has been the President of the United States, the relationship between Beijing and the world's power has become increasingly deteriorating, but China is still a major economic partner of more than 120 countries from Russia to South Africa, from Saudi Arabia to the European Union.</p>
<p>Along with the "Belt and Road" project with a trillions of dollars in investment, China is even more popular in the political influence of overseas.</p>
<p>Although India is regarded as a key geopolitical partner by the West, Beijing holds one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which means that in this organization, almost all major decisions include veto, including veto Discretion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T01-41-16.000Z/_129877343_gettyimages-1152470025.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Modi (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) each face very different challenges.</p>
<p>In the past few decades, India and other emerging economies have been trying to change this situation, but no one has succeeded.</p>
<p>Professor Fraser said: "I will not seek the new permanent member of the Security Council. Even though we are very clear, it is unreasonable to continue to operate a global security order in a victory in a conflict ended in 1945. "</p>
<p>Professor Sip Pees also agreed.</p>
<p>"The right to vote no longer reflects the economic and influence, and it is far from reflecting. One day, or one day it is to reform these systems in the world, or these mechanisms are disconnected from the times, because there will be other replacements."</p>
<p>At present, the most important substitutes are the BRICS -a group composed of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa, which aims to compete with the Global North Economic and geopolitical influence.</p>
<h3>soft power</h3>

<p>多年来，英国的执政党保守党一直承诺限制移民，而“重新掌控”边境和移民这一誓言则是脱欧运动的核心内容。</p>
<p>然而  根据周四公布的国家统计数据，移民人数在2022年飙升——这一消息 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/world/europe/uk-migration.html"> 让保守党领导层有些尴尬</a>, Most of their voters -most support the Brexit -hope to see the decline in the number of immigrants.</p>
<p>New data shows that last year, the number of net immigrants in the UK -the population moved into the population to move out of the population -a record of 606,000 people. This increases by 24%over 2021, about twice the net immigrants in the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016.</p>
<p>Immigration is driven by complex domestic and global factors such as war, employment opportunities and politics. So, these numbers show what is going on in the UK?</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p><strong> Violence and oppression encouraged immigrants. </strong></p>
<p>From 2004 to 2017, about 600,000 people moved to the UK each year. By 2022, this number jumped to 1.163 million, a record high, and it is unlikely to be surpassed in a short time.</p>
<p>Last year, the number of people in Ukraine, who had been invaded by Russia (since the beginning of the February 2022, has moved to the UK by more than 120,000 Ukrainians), Afghanistan, and the increasingly oppressed citizen rights of citizens' rights in Taliban. Britain has humanitarian visa projects specifically targeted at these groups.</p>
<p>But these flows have shown signs of weakening. Some reasons for the surge in immigrants last year may be that these people have already immigrated to have long been immigrated, but delayed due to the new crown epidemic. During the epidemic, the number of immigrants decreased.</p>
<p>A few years ago, most British immigrants were still from EU countries. However, after the Brexit of the Brexit deprived of the right to settle in the EU citizens in the UK, this number decreased sharply. Last year, immigrants from the European Union accounted for less than 8%.</p>
<p>In recent years, the United Kingdom has increased, most of which have returned to China by EU citizens.</p>
<p><strong> Education and economy also played an important role. </strong></p>
<p>Although the current Conservative Government has long expressed opposition to a large number of immigrants, the British existence <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/braverman-ignores-the-main-cause-of-labour-migration-the-care-worker-crisis-kh6wrs9xc">serious labor shortage</a>，特别是在医疗保健、社会服务和农业领域，部分原因是英国脱欧。</p>
<p>广告</p>
<p>失业率低于4%，远低于疫情前的水平，许多职位空缺，所以无论政府立场如何，英国对寻找工作的移民仍然有吸引力。许多雇主希望政府发放更多的工作签证。</p>
<p>政府还指出，教育是推动移民的一个因素。越来越多居住在英国的外国研究生开始利用一项政策，为他们的受抚养家庭成员获得签证。</p>
<p>内政大臣苏拉·布雷弗曼 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/world/europe/uk-immigration-student-dependent-visas.html"> 最近表示 </a>Since 2019, the number of such visas has increased by 750%, reaching 136,000 copies last year. Most of them are from Nigeria and India.</p>
<p>The government said that it will increase the difficulty of obtaining a visa for family members, but immigration experts said that the impact of this change is limited, and universities oppose reducing the acceptance of foreign students. They say foreign students are beneficial to the economy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-29T01-50-03-08-00/25uk-migration-takeaways-03-lgbt-master1050.jpg" />In 2021, the arrested immigration in the British border forces was brought ashore by British border forces. Andrew testa for the new york times</p>
<p><strong> The entryrs who arrived in the Geothy Strait only account for a small part of the total number of immigrants. </strong></p>
<p>In recent years, Britain's political remarks on immigrants are mainly concentrated on those who cross the British Geely Strait by boat. Most of these people are refugees seeking asylum and have received high attention.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>However, the new immigration data reminds people in time that illegal immigrants involving the British Geely Strait only account for a small part of the new immigrants. Most people are legally entry.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2022/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2022">government statistics released this year</a>In 2022, only 45,755 people were found to cross the British Strait by boat. This is equivalent to 3.8%of the total number of Britain.</p>
<p>However, even when responding to the new immigrant statistics released on Thursday, in addition to expressed that it is necessary to slow down the overall immigration speed, the Ministry of the Interior still focuses on how to reduce the number of people entering the ship.</p>
<p>In the statement, the Ministry of the Interior stated: "We are still committed to reducing overall net immigration, at the same time, to prevent ships from controlling our boundaries, priority handling improper behavior, and preventing danger and illegal cross -border."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) After several weeks of difficult consultations and negotiations, US President Biden Biden and US House Speaker McCarthy reached an agreement on US debt limits last weekend. Bayeng told the media at the White House on Sunday (May 28), "This is a very important step forward." "It will no longer exist in the threat of catastrophic breach, which protects the historicity that we get difficult to get. "Economic recovery" and urged the two hospitals to pass the agreement.</p>
<p>Biden and McCarthy made a call on the 27th and finally reached an agreement. The content included: principle agreed to increase the limit of US debt for 2 years, but during this period of time, restrictions and reduced government's non -national defense expenditure, recovered new crown epidemic expenses wait.</p>
<p>After a 90 -minute call, McCarthy wrote in Twitter: "I just had a phone call with the president not long ago. After he wasted time and refused to negotiate for several months, we had reached a worthy of Principles. "In an interview with the media, McCarthy described that the bill" historically reduced expenses and major reforms, which would allow people to get rid of poverty, enter the labor market, and control the government's excessive expansion. "</p>
<p>Biden said in Twitter that the agreement represents some kind of compromise, "not everyone can get what they want," but he still keeps the key priority of the Democratic parties.</p>
<p>The temporary agreement reached by Biden and McCarthy is expected to be submitted to the House of Representatives as soon as the 31st.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国债务违约期限延长至6月5日/a-65752174)Before the successful breakthrough, it is expected to avoid <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国债务上限如何影响全球经济/a-65661380">US credit rating is downgraded, possible economic recession, and the employment loss of millions of people</a>Essence</p>
<p>In this regard, Biden and McCarthy are both optimistic and believe that they can obtain the full support of the gentle faction between the two parties. However, the agreement still triggers the attack on the hardliners Republican and the progressive Democrats.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has always strived to maintain the budget expenditure in 2024. At the same time, it is required to apply restrictions in 2025 to exchange for a 2 -year debt limit to avoid unstable political issues affect the 2024 presidential election. On the other hand, the Democrats insist on It should increase the upper limit of the US debt without any additional conditions.</p>
<h3>What is the upper limit of the US debt?</h3>
<p>The U.S. Congress introduced the debt limit system for the first time in 1917 to regulate the national debt amount that the US Finance could bear. This measure means that the government no longer needs Congress to approve the issuance of each debt.</p>
<p>The public debt bill was passed in 1939 and 1941. Over the past 70 years, the upper limit of debt has been increased by 78 times, including 2011, when the United States failed to reach an agreement on the new upper limit at that time, the S &amp; P lowered US sovereign credit rating and triggered an increase in loan costs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国去年持美债呈12年来最低/a-64745260">In January of this year, US debt has reached a debt upper limit of 31.4 trillion dollars</a>However, the US Treasury Department has taken very measure to allow it to continue to provide funds for government activities.</p>
<p>Although the US federal government has not yet defaulted to the U.S. federal government, if it does not increase the upper limit of the debt, it will exceed June 5th, the last period of the default. The salary, social security payment, and medical subsidies such as veterans such as veterans and disadvantaged Americans will also be put on hold.</p>

<h3>The response of the two parties to the compromise scheme</h3>
<p>Even if a tentative agreement is reached, the work of raising the debt limit is far from complete. Whether there are sufficient mild members to support the details of the bill, and suppress the opposition's right -wing right -wing Republicans and progressive Democrats have attracted much attention.</p>
<p>"I heard that the" Agreement "increased the debt limit of 4 trillion dollars." The Republican House member Bobgood said, "If this is true, you don't need to say more. Anyone who claims to be conservatives. Nothing cannot be defended by voting votes. "</p>
<p>Democratic members of the Democratic Party, Ji Meichu, said that she will pay attention to the details of the proposal and will increase the work requirements for the poor: "I think this is the worst part of their (Republican) proposal because this one is because this one is because this one is because this is the worst part of their (Republican Party), because this is because of this because of this It will cause pain to the poor. "</p>
<p>At the same time, the controversial Republican councilor Marjorie Taylorgreen claims that the agreement may recover $ 400 million from the "Global Health Fund" of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Green said that China, Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Ukraine may be affected.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan entered the historic election <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/土耳其总统大选第二轮投票将于两周后举行/a-65620135">the second round of voting phase</a>Later, he won the new 5 -year term. The leader who has been in power for 20 years in Turkey has defeated the opposition candidate Kemal KılıçdaroğLu in this election.</p>
<p>Ahmet Yine, head of the Turkish Election Commission (YSK), said on Sunday (May 28) that Erdogan received 52.14%of the votes and defeated his competitors Kiriqidalu.</p>
<p>Erdogan gave a speech shortly after his announcement, saying that voters had given him governance responsibility for the next five years. "The only winner today is Türkiye," Erdogan said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the opposition leader Kiriqidalu condemned this as "the most unfair election for many years", but promised to continue to "lead the struggle against the Erdogan regime". He did not clearly acknowledge the failure of the election Essence</p>

<h3>Call for unity</h3>
<p>In a speech on Sunday night, Erdogan called on the people to unite and vowed to leave all the disputes behind their heads, allowing the country to unite because of "national values and dreams".</p>
<p>Erdogan said that he won with a weak advantage in the campaign to "Democracy in Turkey" and the country's 85 million citizens. "Today, 85 million people in the entire country have no one lost," he said.</p>
<p>"We have no resentment, anger or frustration of anyone," AFP quoted him. However, Erdogan also announced that the "terrorist organization" was the loser of this voting.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that the country's serious high inflation is the most urgent problem at present, but it means that it is not difficult to solve. It promises that inflation will decline and vowed to establish a strong economy on the basis of stability and confidence.</p>
<p>Erdogan also promised to ensure that another 1 million Syrian returned to home, and they sought refuge in Turkey during the civil war.</p>

<h3>What do you mean by Turkey?</h3>
<p>Erdogan's recent victory has made him the longest rulers in Turkey, the first time for Turkey, the first President Mustafa Kemalaturk. This will revitalize his promotion of unconventional economy, domestic and foreign policies.</p>
<p>The leader of the Turkish conservative justice and Development Party (AKP) touted Islamic values and populist views. During his 20 years of rule, he encouraged Turkey's conservative citizens that they were marginalized under the rule of continuous secular rulers for a long time. For example, Erdogan vowed to write the right to wear Islamic headscarves into the constitution, and after the court's decision, he announced that the St. Sophia Cathedral of Istanbul was a mosque.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/土耳其點頭-芬蘭將加入北約/a-65189877">He has also challenged Western partners and NATO allies many times</a>The last one was to postpone Norway to join NATO and prevent Sweden from joining.</p>
<p>NATO allies such as the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, and VladimirPutin, President of Russia, congratulate Erdogan's victory. After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, the Turkish leader continued to maintain a relationship with Putin.</p>
<p>Erdogan's largest domestic challenge may be his non -orthodox economic policy. Despite the warning of analysts, the Turkish leader had vowed to persist in the end.</p>
<p>In 2021, Erdogan insisted on cutting interest rates at all costs, causing Turkish currency to plummet, while Turkey's inflation rate last year was as high as 85%.</p>
<p>In addition, earlier this year, a devastating earthquake occurred in the border areas of Turkey and Syria, and the rescue work was slow, which also caused strong criticism of the Erdogan government.</p>

<h1>"Battle of Inheritance" End: Why is the finale of the TV series so important</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-29T03-34-27-08-00/27rebeck-master1050.jpg" />"Battle of inheritance"(Succession)The ending is coming. So how will this painful masterpiece end?</p>
<p>Will they take the time fast, from "Six feet"(Six Feet Under)Stole inspiration in the legendary ending? Maybe let's take a look at the future of the handsome and anti -society who pushed up, and the future of the person who may become the president? Or cut the screen directly before someone assassinated KFC? (I belong to the "underworld family" really like the underworld(Thesopran)The kind of person. .</p>
<p>Maybe, but it's unlikely. These options don't feel right.</p>
<p>This is a predicament of a good ending: it must be unspeakable and very natural. And unfortunately, a bad ending can almost destroy an original brilliant artwork. "game of Thrones"(Game of Thrones)It is amazing, but there are too many mistakes in the last few episodes, which seriously weaken its glory. James returned to Cersei, and then the house collapsed. The admiration and loved Danilis fired crazy and burned the Junlin City? Bran gets the throne? We want a "Desperate Poison Division"(Breaking Bad)In that ending, a solemn "Amen". But "Game of Thrones" is more like a "ah?"</p>
<p>I often think about the ending because I have to have a ending. When I started writing the script, although I usually had a vague idea about the ending, I didn't want everything to be on the board. If you leave room for the development route of the story, then in writing, the ending will be presented by yourself -and usually, your mind keeps a secret issue that is unexpected and inevitable, and it will eventually appear. Some kind of perfect thing is like an angel that breaks through the ceiling. Or "I have always rely on the kindness of strangers." Or there is indeed a group of devil admirers living in Dako apartment in West West District, Manhattan. These are great endings.</p>
<p>The ending should be produced from everything before, but it is different from everything before. A great ending may be about changing. In the process, our core figures have escaped, or found true love, or discovered a deep truth and obtained the inner wisdom (just like in "Advertising Madman"(MadMen)Among them, this profound truth is about Coca -Cola). Or it may be about justice, the coming of justice is on those who deserve it, and destroy those who do not match. (See all superhero movies). On the contrary, justice has abandoned everyone. (See "Godfather".) A good ending may contain a soft and sad hope. (See Chekhov.) It can celebrate the combination of marriage that can restore the chaotic world and regain order. (See Shakespeare.) Or it can achieve a settlement with the concept of not being able to solve any problems. (Still Shakespeare.)</p>
<p>In the best case, a beautiful ending will raise everything that happened before to the realm of eternal wisdom: "So we continue to work hard, walk against the water, be pushed backwards, and be pushed into it," just like "great. Gatsby "(The Great Gatsby)Summary of the narration.</p>
<p>TV constitutes different challenges -not only because the audience will sit down and cook for a week (or longer) drama to think about how this might end. The production method of TV is different from other types of drama, so the ending is naturally different.</p>
<p>You start from the trial episode of a episode -it may have been on TV or never on -and then watch the first season little by little. At this point, the ending is still far away, and it is difficult to think about the ending. After all, if there is no audience, this play will be canceled anyway. So you are not trying to imagine the ending -you are trying to avoid the ending.</p>
<p>This is why the truly great ending is particularly rare on TV. The TV series does not exist for the ending; it is for the middle process. What they care about how long you can make this show broadcast. When you are successful, no one will rush to make an ending, which is why like "Jumpthe Shark" (meaning a good work began to gradually decrease quality. Essence The success of the TV comes from the middle process.</p>
<p>At the end of the second season of "Battle of Inheritance", KFC betrayed his father Logan in front of the world and threatened to overthrow the entire precarious system and let everyone suffer. Shins. When Logan witnessed the disaster, his faint smile was mysterious and glory and humanity. Did he secretly want KFC to take over power? Maybe that's it. It is undeniable that this is a great season. Loman then defeated KFC again in the third season. The show returned to the starting line. The form of a TV series has a natural cyclicity. This is why so many programs end the way that can only be called "collective hug". "Mary Taylor Moore"(Mary Tyler Moore)That's it; "Office"(The Office)That's it; "Song Fei Biography"(Seinfeld)This is the end of the prison.</p>
<p>I suspect that we will not get collective hugs from "Battle of Inheritance".</p>
<p>As far as the ending, "Battle of inheritance" is a special case, not only because the creator Jesest Amsterram not only chose how to end the drama, but also when he chose to end. (He said](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-end-of-succession-is-near)From the beginning, it "always existed" in his mind. ) For the Battle of inheritance, the ending has always been directly included in the title.</p>
<p>Do I have any bold predictions? I can tell you what kind of ending will not happen: Logan will not be resurrected. Children will not sell the company to the Chinese who have suddenly appeared and provide better offer. There will be no savings from the sky, and it will not be because no one knows how to land on the damn plane and add something inexplicably and end.</p>
<p>As for what will happen, I have confidence promises: The ending of "Battle of Inheritance" will complete this story without betraying the spirit of the former sentiment. Its creators have proved that they have this strength in these four seasons.</p>
<p>This is why I want to watch. I can't wait to know its ending.</p>

Speech content. In addition, the Internet Information Office announced that it has punished 930,000 self -media accounts in the past two months.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government departments have recently introduced a new political review standard after requiring civil servants to record their personal WeChat group accounts, including the employment of government civil servants to conduct stricter political review. According to netizens quoted the recent news of public education institutions, "New changes in political review in Guangdong civil servants" showed that one of the review links increased by the authorities to apply for civil servants was: mobile phones to check the objects of political review. The specific content is to install all social software, such as Douyin, WeChat, Weibo, Xiaohongshu and other social software.

Ensure that the candidates are "green online and healthy and socially, must be a firm political position and pure thinking."</p>

Recently, his flight attendant laughed at the passenger's English level incident again, which once again caught him into a vortex of public opinion, and was shadowed by the efforts of seeking rebuilding.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-29T05-32-07-08-00/00cathay-survival-01-ghkl-master1050.jpg" />There are few large airlines in the world, like Hong Kong's flag -carriers, Cathay Cathay Pacific, which have been severely hit by the epidemic, and fewer aircraft companies have made such great efforts like Cathay Pacific to restore. The company's business has been severely damaged due to the industry's most widespread flight ban and isolation requirements. The popularity of new crowns is not the beginning of Cathay Pacific trouble.</p>
<p>In 2019, Hong Kong is strenuous due to democracy.(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-arc.html)At that time, Cathay Pacific was involved in the dispute with Beijing. As thousands of demonstrators sit in the airport to protest at the airport, the flight cancellation or delay, the demonstrators also include Cathay Pacific employees. Chinese officials threatened the crew members who participated in the protests, and even those who only expressed support for protests flew to China.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific's internal turbulence has increased. The airline's chief executive and chairman of the board of directors resigned, and the new leaders began to combat employees to express any remarks or posts that might anger China on social media.</p>
<p>In 2020, Cathay Pacific closed the subsidiary Cathay Port Dragon Airlines due to the end of the epidemic. Cathay Pacific stored 70 aircraft in the desert of Alice Spring in Australia and fired 5,300 employees in Hong Kong. As Hong Kong extended the forced isolation time, some crew members had to enter the three to four weeks "<a href="https://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/offers/cathay-stories/closed-loop.html">closed loop</a>"The shift, to endure a weeks that cannot go home for a few weeks, this is a great blow to the morale of the employees.</p>
<p>Today, Cathay Pacific is still trying to recruit enough pilots, crew and other employees to compete with other airlines. The company's chief executive officer Lin Shaobo said in a video information sent to employees in January this year that its competitors "become more streamlined and healthier, and eager to snatch customers from us". He tried to let everyone "survive The plan to be united. It was not until March that Cathay Pacific's passenger capacity returned to 50%before the epidemic.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-29T05-32-07-08-00/00cathay-survival-master1050.jpg" />In 2020, aircraft of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Port Dragon were stored in the Asia -Pacific aircraft storage facilities in Alice Spring, Australia's northern leader. David Gray/Blowberg</p>
<p>But the problem still exists. Last week, Lin Shaobo told Cathay Pacific's employees in an internal memorandum that a crew of the crew laughed at a record of a passenger's English level on the Internet, and three employees were fired. Lin Shaobo said that these employees have "seriously damaged the image of Hong Kong and Cathay Pacific.</p>
<p>This incident reminds people that Cathay Pacific faces tricky tasks when dealing with China. China is an important market for the airline company, but after nearly three years of closure to Hong Kong and other parts of the world, the Chinese economy is still recovering. Before the outbreak, Cathay Pacific flew from Hong Kong to <a href="https://www.cathaypacific.com/content/dam/cx/about-us/investor-relations/interim-annual-reports/en/2022_cx_interim_report_en.pdf">119 places in 35 countries</a>And including 26 destinations in China. The flight time from various cities in China facilitates passengers to turn in Hong Kong at night, and arrives in the United States or Europe in the morning or early afternoon.</p>

<p>When the Omecko epidemic in January 2022, the Hong Kong government banned flights from flights from the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, when Cathay Pacific only played a 2%passenger capacity.</p>
<p>The airline stated in a statement that its goal was to restore 70%of passenger flight transportation capacity and 80 destinations by the end of 2023. There were 160 flights to 16 airports in mainland China every week.</p>
<p>Even after Hong Kong canceled the regulations related to the new crown and isolation, Beijing's firm impact on the previous British colony still threatened Hong Kong for decades as an attractive free business destination.</p>

<p>Just as Hong Kong is the portal of the world to China, Cathay Pacific is a pioneer connecting emerging Asian economies and New York, London and Paris. Founded in 1946, it is one of the most important brands in Hong Kong and is famous for time and quality services. <a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/media-centre/press-release/2022/pr_1619">Article 3 runway opened last year</a>In order to adapt to Beijing's nine cities in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong into a science and technology center called the Greater Bay Area.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific said that it is expected to fully recover next year. The company's most urgent challenge is to restore the number of pilots and crew and increase flight capacity.</p>

<p>In order to reduce costs, Cathay Pacific reduced the basic wages of pilots by about 40%, which angered many crew members. In January of this year, Cathay Pacific reduced the number of air passengers on each flight and shortened the recovery time between long -distance flights. To this end, Cathay Pacific Airlines Workers' Association launched a "work according to the chapters" activity: persuading air passengers to perform execution Tasks exceeding the scope of the company's standards. Officials of the Hong Kong Airport Administration said in May this year that they noticed that there was a tendency to reduce gliding among Pacific Airlines' pilots. This is because the company's new salary structure actually injured their enthusiasm for completing the flight in advance.</p>
<p>"They said that we have to have a tight life, but if you don't even have a company, it doesn't make much sense to save money," said Paul Weisrit, Chairman of the Hong Kong Airlines Association of the Flying Employee Association, said that he has been nearly 30 at Cathay Pacific. New Year pilot. "This is their current situation. The company is only half left."</p>
<p>advertiseBefore 2019, the airline had 3840 pilots. According to the Association of Airlines, 1,900 people have resigned since then. Captain, the highest number of pilots, has been reduced by half. Although Cathay Pacific re -hired dozens of pilots from the Cathay Port Dragon Department in 2021 and 2022, many people had to reduce their salary and surrender when they were hired. The lack of flight during the epidemic, dragging down the training process required by the first co -pilot and the second co -pilot to become the captain. Many senior pilots instructor and flight simulator instructor resigned.</p>
<p>Despite the difficult situation, some industry analysts will be optimistic about Cathay Pacific's recovery. The company reported the first annual profit since 2019. The company's flight rate is about 90%, which is better than the situation before the epidemic, and high fares help increase income. During the epidemic, the business of freight flights maintains the operation of the airline.</p>

<p>But for Cathay Pacific, no market is more important than China, and at the same time may bring so much trouble.</p>
<p>Recent troubles originated from a complaint from a passenger flying from Chengdu, Southwest City, China on May 21st. The passenger uploaded a paragraph <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/6274c7cc000000002102aee6/646b3f1500000000130129a7">Recording</a>Among them, you can hear the flight attendant laughed at a passenger in the kitchen, which seems to be "carpet" when the latter wants to blast. "If you don't say‘ blankets ’in English, you do n’t have a blanket," a flight attendant said in the recording.</p>
<p>This recording has caused heated discussions on Chinese social media. People have posted one after another, talking about the past that they think that Cathay Pacific's flight attendants have left the mainland passengers. The official media Xinhua News Agency criticized the airline's "arrogance" and "poor service" and lack of sincerity. The title of a social editorial reads "Old faults, old problems, and Cathay Pacific not far."</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao also joined the ranks of condemnation. "The words and deeds of the air waiters involved hurt the feelings of Hong Kong and the mainland compatriots, and destroyed Hong Kong's consistent respect, polite culture and values," he wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>Cathay Pacific apologized on Weibo on Tuesday and stated that he would conduct an investigation. As of Wednesday, three flight attendants were fired.</p>
<p>"We must respond quickly and take action, which is necessary to protect the interests of companies and even all employees," Lin Shaobo wrote in the internal memo of employees issued to employees on Thursday.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Japanese Defense Provincial province set its ballistic missile defense system on Monday (May 29) and warned that if any flying object threatens Japanese territory, it will shoot down. South Korea held a national security conference urgently and warned that if North Korea insisted on launch, it would pay the corresponding price.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that this is the first time that the Japanese Ministry of Defense has responded to North Korea's space launching operations since 2016. A spokesman for a defensive province said that Japan expects that this time, like 2016, the Rockets carrying satellites in North Korea will fly over the Southwest Island chain in Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Japanese Broadcasting Association (NHK) and other Japanese media first pointed out that North Korea informed the Japan Maritime Security Agency that he would launch satellites between May 31 and June 11. The Reuters and Associated Press subsequently reported that Japan had confirmed the matter and said that the scope of influence included the waters in the waters of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the eastern part of Luzon Island, Philippines; the Japanese government had warned nearby ships.</p>
<p>Matsuno Kazaki Matsuna Kazakhstan, the official room of the Japanese cabinet, said at a press conference: "The government realized that the satellite may cross our territory."</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Prime Minister's Office, although North Korea is called "satellite", it is likely to include ballistic missiles during the launch. The Associated Press pointed out that launching satellites to space will use long -range missile technology banned by the United Nations Security Council. Matsno Kodi said that North Korea's move will violate UN resolutions and pose a threat to peace and security in Japan and regions.</p>
<p>The Japanese Prime Minister Kishida has ordered relevant units to collect and analyze information, and at the same time cooperate with the United States and South Korea, and strongly urge North Korea to keep restraint and not fire missiles.</p>

<h3>What are the plans to do?</h3>
<p>In April, North Korean official media said that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/金正恩朝鲜即将发射首枚间谍卫星/a-65373347">the country's first reconnaissance satellite is ready</a>, Leader Kim Jong -un went to inspection in mid -May and approved the next launch plan. Analysts say that this satellite is a part of the North Korean monitoring plan, which also contains drone technology, which is to improve its ability to strike the target when the war starts one day.</p>
<p>In response to North Korea's satellite launch, Japan has already begun to prepare. In April of this year, Japan sent a destroyer to the East China Sea with a standard 3-air defense missile (Standard Missile-3, SM-3), and the missile has the ability to hit the target of space; The deployment of the Patriot 3 air defense missile (PAC-3) in Okinawa can strike the goal closer to the ground.</p>
<p>Last week, South Korea launched the first commercial satellite to space, which may help South Korea to launch its first military satellite on track and create more powerful missiles. The Associated Press said that some experts believe that Kim Jong -un will hope to make the reconnaissance satellite go to space earlier than South Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea launched the satellite orbit on the Earth in 2012 and 2016; although the country showed the ability to launch satellites, the actual function of its satellites caused the outside world to question because the previous satellites failed to transmit images to come back; from the recent official media, the recent media media recently; recently, official media have recently been returned; Judging from the published images, its equipment also looks too small and rough, and may not support high -resolution satellite images.</p>
<p>In recent months, North Korea has frequently <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不滿美韓軍演-朝鮮證實核空爆試驗/a-65130515">Test weapons</a>And test missile, which contains <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/朝鮮證實試射新型導彈-專家未來或繼續試射/a-65298758">new -type solid -state fuel intercontinental ballistic missile</a>Essence Last week, after South Korea and the United States held a joint real -active military exercise near the North Korean border, the Korean official media warned the Central Society (KCNA) warned on Monday that the "concept of the war of aggression" in South Korea and the United States will face the consequences: "They are in (North Korea) troops Making such a reckless behavior and dangerous war game under the eyelids, we want to ask them if they can cope with the consequences of this. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T06-20-00Z/65651395_401.jpg" />North Korean official media released a video on May 17, showing that North Korean leader Kim Jong -un inspected the country's first reconnaissance satellite.</p>

<p>"The Yangtze River Daily" is the official media of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. This debt collection list is published in the 10th edition of the newspaper in the 10th edition of the newspaper.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国地方政府陷入债务危机/a-63331534)Essence</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) on Italy <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/義大利傳將與中國談判退出一帶一路/a-65598090">Considering the abandonment of participating in the "Belt and Road" initiative in China</a>, Italian Prime Minister Giorgiameloni said in an interview on Sunday (May 27) that Italian may still establish a good relationship with China even if he withdrew from the agreement.</p>
<p>In 2019, Italy signed the "Belt and Road" agreement with China, which caused a rebound from the United States and the European Union at that time. The agreement will expire in March 2024. If the signing parties have not raised objections 3 months in advance, they will be automatically renewed for 5 years.</p>
<p>Meloni was interviewed by the Italian media "IlMessaggero" on the 27th that the government's government was conducting an evaluation of "very detailed and involving many interests", so it is predictable whether the renewal will be too early.</p>
<p>Meloni pointed out that although Italy is the only rich and democratic country in the "Belt and Road" memorandum of the "Belt and Road" memo, it is not the only Western country with China's economic and trade. She said that this shows that Italy is likely to establish a good relationship with Beijing in important areas, but it may not be included in the overall strategic plan.</p>
<p>Politico, a US political online media, said that this was the strongest speech on the project so far.</p>
<p>Before winning the election in September last year and the prime minister, Melonini made it clear to Reuters that she did not agree with Italy's signing in 2019 and said she had no intention of supporting China to expand to Italy or Europe. Bloomberg also reported in April that Melonini plans to announce its position on the "Belt and Road" at the Hiroshima Summit of the G7, but there are still differences in opinions within the United government.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美中關係低谷逢春拜登很快解凍/a-65693328">Seven Kingdoms Group (G7) leaders Hiroshima emphasized that "risk" to China must be "de -risk"</a>A week later, Melonney made this remark, which caused the outside world to pay attention to the future trends of Italy.</p>

<h3>The "Chinese Dream" in Italy is shattered?</h3>
<p>In 2019, then Italian Chancellor Giuseppe Conte signed the "Belt and Road" agreement, hoping that China would boost the downturn's economy to Italy.</p>
<p>But to this day, several traffic infrastructure projects proposed by Italy in this agreement are not progressing. A number of statistics from various countries also show that China has noticed various investment in Italy. It has dropped sharply within one year after signing the agreement. In the European countries that failed to obtain any economic feedback, they did not want to sign a contract with China, but they received better benefits.</p>
<p>Faced with the questioning of Italy, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded on the 10th that since the signing of the initiative, the two countries have achieved "rich fruit results" in the fields of economic and trade, industrial manufacturing, and clean energy. The potential of cooperation along the way, and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields.</p>
<p>However, the Financial Times reported on the 11th that ENRICOBORGHI, a member of the Italia Viva and a member of the Congress, said that in the past 5 years, the Italian awareness of the risk of this agreement has increased significantly, almost all of them Political parties "abandon China that can solve the Italian (economic) problem."</p>
<p>Reuters report earlier this month that a Italian high -level government official said that the country was extremely unlikely to renew the agreement; the former Italian Ambassador to NATO Ambassador Stefano Stefanini also stated that in <a href="">US -China relations nervous</a>In the occasion, Italy cannot continue to participate in the "Belt and Road" cooperation as an American allies, and must try to negotiate with China that is not destructive.</p>
<p>Bloomberg also quoted anonymous insider in April, saying that Italy intends to abandon China's "Belt and Road" initiative and change cooperation with Taiwan to strengthen semiconductor production and exports.</p>
<h3>Italian considers low -key exit from the Belt and Road Initiative</h3>
<h3>China's influence penetrates into Italian companies?</h3>
<p>Reuters reported on the 25th that Italy was reviewing the shareholders update case of the country's tire manufacturer "Pirelli", considering whether to allow China's "Sinochem" as the largest investor in "Pirelli", to this. The company assigned more shareholders. The report pointed out that the direction of the matter may become the vane of the Italian right -wing government's attitude towards China.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that the new shareholder agreement that Pirelli took effect earlier this month will allow 9 of Sinochem Group, which owns 37%of the company's shares of the company. ) Camfin, its Italian Holdings Company, will leave three members -before, Camfin can decide the places of the board of directors, which is 4 members. This new agreement will last for 3 years.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter told Reuters that if the agreement between Sinochem and Camfin has not changed within 3 years, Sinochem will be able to add more members of the Chinese background in the Pirelli board, which may affect the company's appointment of the future CEO.</p>
<p>The voting rights of Sinochem Group in Pirelli Board have been frozen, waiting for the Italian government to evaluate. Sources said Rome is expected to make a decision by the end of June.</p>
<p>It is reported that the government of Western countries such as Italy is increasingly worried about China's growing influence.</p>

<p>North Korea notified Japan on Monday that it plans to launch a satellite in the next few days, which may be to send Pyongyang's first military spy satellite into the track.</p>

<p>The Japanese Prime Minister's Office posted on Twitter that "we strongly urge North Korea not to launch," and added that it will "cooperate with related countries such as the United States and South Korea".</p>
<p>To launch satellites to space, North Korea will have to use the UN Security Council to decide the long -range missile technology, and the global observation satellites launched by North Korea have been regarded as a disguised missile test.</p>
<p>Matsuna Kazaki Matsuna, the official house of Japanese cabinet, said that the launch will violate the UN resolutions and "threatens peace and security in Japan, the region and the international community."</p>

Earlier this month, North Korean leader Kim Jong -un inspected a military satellite facility and approved a "Future Action Plan". This launch will use the United Nations.

<p>Analysts said that this spy satellite is part of North Korea with nuclear weapons promoting surveillance technology (including drones) and raising its efforts to crack down on the target.</p>
<p>The Korean media had previously criticized the plans to launch real -time data in South Korea, the United States and Japan to share the launch of Pyongyang missiles, saying that the three sides are discussing "sinister measures" for strengthening military cooperation.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reported that Bayeng told the media in the White House that after talking with McCarthy again that afternoon, he reached a bipolar discount agreement to avoid US debt defaults.</p>
<p>"I think this is a very important step forward. This agreement eliminates the threat of catastrophic breach of contract and protects the historic economic recovery that is hard to come."</p>
<p>Biden urged the two houses of Congress to pass the legislation. Both Biden and McCarthy have to persuade their party colleagues to support their finalized agreements.</p>
<p>McCarthy expressed optimism about the prospects of the agreement by the agreement, but he also acknowledged that the agreement "cannot satisfy everyone."</p>
<p>Although Biden and McCarthy have reached an agreement, time is still waiting. Minister of Finance Yellen warned last Friday that the government's borrowing limit must be extended before June 5 to avoid debt defaults.</p>
<p>Bayon praised McCarthy to keep his promise in the negotiations, but he didn't know if McCarthy had enough votes to pass this agreement in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But Biden said: "I expect McCarthy (enough votes), otherwise he will not reach this agreement with me."</p>
<p>Bayeng canceled Papua New Guinea and Australia earlier this month. After attending the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7) summit in Hiroshima, Japan, he returned to Washington to resolve the US debt default crisis.</p>

<p>Returning Turkish President Erdogan promised to unite all disputes and unite the nation with national values and dreams. But he immediately criticized the opposition party, accusing the opponent of Kellechidalolu and terrorists without providing evidence.</p>
<p>According to the voting results of 99.43%of the ticket, Erdogan's presidential election on Sunday (May 28) <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230529-1399145">52.14%of the votes in the second round of voting</a>, Kellechidalolo Luku, a candidate for the "National Alliance" of the opposition camp, received 47.86%of the votes.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that 69 -year -old Erdogan said to the upper level of a bus at a bus at Istanbul, "The only winner today is Turkey. I thank every people and give us the responsibility of governing the country for five years."</p>
<p>Erdogan said that inflation is the most urgent problem in Turkey, but as the policy rate drops from 19%to 8.5%two years ago, inflation will decrease. "We plan to build Turkey as an economy focusing on investment and employment, and have a financial management team with an international reputation."</p>
<p>Erdogan also said that under his governance, the co -chairman of the Kurdish People's Democratic Party, Selahattindemirtas, could not be released. Demil Tash was listed by Erdogan as a "terrorist".</p>
<p>He also said that the opposition party is a minority group (LGBT).</p>

<h3>How to stimulate India's dowry needs</h3>

<p>Although paying and accepting dowry have been illegal in India since 1961, it is still prevalent.</p>
<p><strong> A new study found that with the improvement of the educational level and work opportunities in India in the past few decades, the popularity of dowry has increased. </strong></p>
<p>In South Asia, paying and accepting dowry is a tradition with hundreds of years of history. The bride's parents will give cash, clothes and jewelry to the groom's house. Although this approach has been illegal in India since 1961, it is still prevalent and makes women vulnerable to domestic violence or even death.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Weaver of the University of Southern California and Gauravchiplunkar, the University of Virginia, studied more than 74,000 marriages in India from 1930 to 1999 to study the evolution of dowry.</p>
<p>They calculate the "net dowry", that is, the value and gift value of cash and gifts given to the groom or their families with the value of cash and gifts given to the bride's house to the groom's house. This is an expert group investigation conducted by families with the largest 17 people in India. Researchers are based on data from the "Indian Rural Economic and Population Survey".</p>
<p>The marriage of most Indians is still arranged, and almost all women are married when they are almost 30 years old. Before 1999, about 90%of marriage involved dowry. The total dowry payment between 1950 and 1999 was nearly $ 250 billion.</p>
<p>In an interview with the BBC, Waver said that the study found that, especially from the 1940s to the 1980s, economic growth continued and promoted the practice of paying dowry. He said: "During this time, more and more men received education and found better quality work, which led to an increase in dowry."</p>

<h3>Indian marriage</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In India, almost all marriage is a monogamy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only less than 1%of people divorce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents play an important role in choosing the bride/groom. From 1960 to 2005, more than 90%of the marriage was chosen by their parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 90%of the couple live with the husband's house after marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 85%of women marry people outside their village</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>78.3%of the marriage is in the same area</p>
</li>
</ul>

The changes in the quality of the groom are related to their education and income improvement. (The low participation of women in Indian labor means that men have more and better jobs.)</p>
<p>In other words, "high -quality grooms" -This has been educated and has a better job -requires higher dowry. Studies have found that with the increase in the number of grooms that have been educated in the marriage market, the "dowry premium" obtained by the groom, which has been educated, will decrease.</p>
<p>"Powerful economic factors make the dowry permanently. In terms of bride, families who refuse to pay dowry for their daughters can only choose the groom with a lower quality. The groom has a strong economic motivation to accept the dowry, especially if their family must be for their families, their families must be for their families. His daughter paid the dowry, or wanted to recover the investment in the education of the groom, "Waver and Qipuraka wrote.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T08-59-26.000Z/_129839679_gettyimages-1241895165-594x594.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>A mural of Angera, India, wrote that dowry is an insult to women.</p>
<p>Is the dowry unique to India? Another paper published by the University of British Columbia's Siwananderson believes that unlike India, in many society including Europe, dowry payment has declined as wealth grows. Anderson said that in Society, based on surnames in India, the increase in wealth has also led to an increase in dowry.</p>
<p>Waver and Qipuraka said their research found that there was almost no evidence about the tradition of the rise of dowry customs.</p>
<p>One theory believes that the dowry is implemented in the family of high surnames. As the low surnames follow these practices to improve these practices to improve their social liquidity, the dowry has also spread. This new study shows that this is unclear, because the custom of dowry has almost begun at the same time in the high surnames and low surnames.</p>
<p>In addition, some experts believe that the desire of low -surnamed women to marry a high -surnamed man has promoted the change of dowry. Waver said that this view is "incorrect" because "too little marriage on the surname of surnames" —ly 94%of Indians married in their large -scale groups in their research marriage.</p>
<p>As more and more women receive education, what will happen to the dowry?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T08-59-26.000Z/_119157085_gettyimages-1199898742-170667a.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Indian dowry gifts include cash and physical objects.</p>
<p>Over the past two or three decades, Indian women have been significantly improved, surpassing men. Waver said that this may lead to a reduction in the practice of dowry, but there is no data that supports this phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, the study did find evidence that the more women who were educated in a region, "the amount of dowry would decrease."Obviously, promoting women's education and increasing their labor force can help solve the scourge of dowry.</p>

<h1>Use AI to create political illustrations in the United States in 2024, hidden concerns</h1>
<p>Publisher: 法新社</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Washington, 28th) A fake photo arrested by Zhang Trump; a description of Biden Ruojie in the future will be a dark anti -utopian film; a deep pseudo -recording of the two scolding each other. Observer said that the rapid development of AI technology may accelerate the dissemination of unrealistic information in the US political election.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-29T09-02-10-00-00/000000.png" />Advanced tools driven by artificial intelligence (AI) lead to increasingly difficult to distinguish between true and false, and the 2024 presidential election is expected to be the first election in the United States to see large -scale use of this technology.</p>
<p>This science and technology price is low, easy to achieve, and the rapid development speed is far over regulatory response. Both parties in the United States may control this technology to expand contact with voters. Essence</p>
<p>However, technical experts warned that many truths that have been investigated in the U.S. political climate and the defeat of Trump's 2020 election are still questioned by voters, and those who are interested may use AI to spread the chaotic seeds.</p>
<p>What makes people think is that existing examples show that the 2024 election will encounter the dilemma of rumors before the election: March, the fake photos of Trump were forcibly taken away by the New York police on the Internet.</p>
<p>Last month, after Biden announced the re -election, the Republican National Committee (RNC) almost released a film made by AI, describing Bayeng if he was elected, the United States would have a future of anti -utopia. This film shows a realistic image of photos, showing that there are panic in Wall Street, Chinese criminals, border officials who are completely unable to keep immigration, and soldiers who take over the crime of crimes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Tiktok, a short film, was rumored to be a wonderful and beautiful but completely forged Bayeon and Trump AI recording file. Among them, the two people who were expected to be re -confronted in the 2024 election were opposite and humiliated with each other.</p>
<p>Joerospars, the founder of the left -leaning political consulting company "Blue State", told AFP: "The influence of AI will reflect the values of AI users, and those who have poor hearts will have new tools to push up Hate and suspicion, or use counterfeit pictures, sounds or videos to deceive the media and the public. "</p>
<p>He added: "Blind these actions requires media, technology companies, and voters to maintain their own vigilance."</p>
<p>● Make good use of AI experts: can become a weapon for voters</p>
<p>However, Junction AI CEO Vance Reavie believes that AI's progress will become a revolutionary weapon for voters.</p>
<p>He told AFP: "A large part of the population does not vote at all, or vote for one without one by one." He believes, "With AI, we will be able to understand which issues that these potential voters care about. The reason, then master the way to let them participate and find a policy that inspires them. "</p>
<p>● Replacement of manpower AI cost low speed and fast speed</p>
<p>In the past, the staff of the campaign team had to take a few hours to write a speech, prepare the main points of conversation, push a post, and prepare questionnaires, but AI can complete the same work as long as it takes a short time.</p>
<p>Liwei said: "The creative content is time -consuming and money consumes money. Imagine that it can do 10 times the work without increasing the manpower."</p>
<p>He said, "But many of the content created will be fake ... Make the channel content overflowing, it is easy and easy, but it is difficult to make the general public distinguish between true and false."</p>
<p>Under the premise of a large number of American people who have no trust in the media, the ability of Americans will also be challenged on the ability to achieve consistency on objective truths.</p>
<p>The University of California, Hanyfarid, Professor of the School of Information of the University of California, told AFAT that "what is concerned about is that when manipulating the media becomes easy, negating the facts, there is not that. Difficulty. "</p>
<p>"For example, if a presidential candidate has made a statement that is not decent or in the law, he/she can claim that the record is fake. This situation is particularly dangerous."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) The Italian fire department said that the water of the Greater Canal of the Venice Grand Canal suddenly became fluorescent green on Sunday (May 28). According to the department, the regional environmental protection agency ARPAV collected samples of color -changing water with the help of the fire department. Experts at the agency are currently investigating the reasons for changes in color.</p>
<p>The Ansha News Agency in Italy said that the Ministry of the Interior in Venice represented Dibari(Michele di Bari)Emergency meetings have been held to seek a strategy of response.</p>
<p>According to Ansha Society, according to the preliminary investigation by ARPAV and police, the changes in these colors are caused by a dye that is commonly used to track water.</p>

Hair dye .org/mandarin/column/labor communication/good place -05292023092313.html/@@ stream</a>After the May 1st Labor Day holiday this year, the workers of Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. returned to the factory on the first day of work, and was informed by the factory. <a href="https://maps.clb.org.hk/?i18n_language=zh_CN&amp;map=1&amp;startDate=2023-05&amp;endDate=2023-05&amp;eventId=2023050515393622063&amp;addressId=350500&amp;address=%E6%B3%89%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82">Enterprise Close</a>Essence The factory also violated the law that the workers must sign a voluntary resignation letter before they issued the salary of March that had been arrears.</p>
<p>Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager. Some workers sent a confrontation scene in Douyin <a href="https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA1p7MwZLcIxN-nQUiu8yogLIDKf2PS7Cxw7e6pYJABIY?modal_id=7228898852244376847&amp;relation=0&amp;vid=7228898852244376847">Video</a>Essence</p>
<p>Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.</p>
<p>Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to Wuli Industrial Zone was also the same. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?</p>
<p>It should be asked why!</p>
<p>Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?</p>
<p>As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. <a href="http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm">Company Branch Committee</a>". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.</p>
<p>In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?</p>
<p>With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.</p>
<p>It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor <a href="https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html">Xi Jinping once scolded</a>Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".</p>
<p>What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?</p>
<p>On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.</p>
<p>However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.</p>
<p>According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.</p>
<p>So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?</p>
<p>According to the report of China Industry.com, the union of various districts and counties in Quanzhou respects the first spirit of the grassroots and innovates independently through self -selected actions. The goal is to refine a batch of good experience and good practices that can be replicated and promoted. The Jinjiang Trade also creates a 2.0 version mechanism according to the actual needs of employees.Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[<a href="http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html">Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality</a>"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.</p>
<p>In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".</p>
<p>In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.</p>
<p>The good situation of enterprises ".</p>
<p>The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".</p>
<p>For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.</p>
<p>The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.</p>

The chairman of the committee, Ahmed Jena, said in a TV speech later on Sunday that Erdogan led his challenger and opposition leader Kellyd Kilidaragro with an advantage of 2.2 million votes. He said that more than 99%of the voting boxes have been calculated, and the remaining votes will not change the election results.</p>
<p>Erdogan is likely to interpret his victory as the recognition of his political heritage, including seeking a more positive role in global affairs as a member of NATO, and consolidating the power in his own hands in China.</p>
<p>Erdogan made a speech to his supporters on a white bus near his home in Istanbul. He tried to the crowd, sang a song and thanked his supporters.</p>
<p>"We will be together until (enter) the grave," he said.</p>
<p>After Erdogan was the first time in Turkey in 2003, he led Turkey to achieve huge economic growth, which caused tremendous changes in the country's cities, and millions of Turkish people got rid of poverty. Internationally, he is known as a new model of Islamic democratic people who are close to business and hopes to establish a firm contact with the West.</p>
<p>But in the past ten years, his criticism at home and abroad has continued. He faced a large -scale protest against his governing style in 2013, and then became the president in 2014, and survived the attempted coup in 2016. In the process, he seized the opportunity to crowd out his opponents and obtain more power, and was blamed by a political opposition, saying that he was putting the country into authoritarianism.</p>
<p>For Western powers, Erdogan's victory means that it still needs to start a tricky relationship with a complex partner in the next five years.</p>
<p>Although the United States and other NATO allies praised Erdogan for condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he sought a closer relationship with Russian President Putin and said that Putin was "my friend", which disappointed the United States and NATO.</p>

<p>He is unlikely to change the route after winning the re -election, especially because Turkey is seriously dependent on Russia's tourism and energy imports, and Russia is building the first nuclear power plant in Turkey along the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T09-40-29-04-00/000000.png" /> 1989年6月4日凌晨聚焦在天安门广场的学生六四档案图  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-05292023093015.html/@@stream">Audio-1-Link：https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-05292023093015.html/@@stream</a>In a few days, it is the 34th anniversary of the "June 4th". Maybe someone will ask: 34 years ago, why is it still annual commemorative? Is such a commemoration meaningful? Why can't I let go of history and go forward? These issues are raised because it involves the meaning of the "June 4th" commemorative problem.</p>
<p>Why do we commemorate June 4th year? Because the 89th Democratic Games and June 4th suppression occurred in 1989, it was the most important period of history in China and a turning point in the development of Chinese society in 50 years. If you don't understand this history, it is impossible to have a correct understanding of today's China. The 1989 Democratic movement proves that the Chinese people also have the dream of democracy and willing to pay for it. The suppression of June 4th proves that the Communist Party of China is essentially a political party that rely on violence to maintain rule. Essence</p>
<p>Why do we commemorate June 4th year? Because in 1989, whether it was a student, a citizen or a worker, the whole China glowed with courage, enthusiasm and ideal. A great nation will not just know only to know how to eat, make money, and enjoy, courage, enthusiasm, and ideals. It is a valuable spiritual wealth of a nation. The annual commemorative activities are to preserve this spiritual wealth for our nation.</p>
<p>Why do we commemorate June 4th year? Because in the suppression of the Communist Party of China in 1989, no less than 2,000 students and people lost their lives. At least tens of thousands of people were injured in bloody operations. More people in the country were in prison because of participating in the democratic movement. Or forced to exile overseas. All these victims paid the price for the future of the nation. From a basic moral perspective, they should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>Why do we commemorate June 4th year? Because we want to fight for the right to the people. For more than thirty years, the Chinese authorities have tried to disappear this period of history with everything, which leads to what happened in China. Instead, many Chinese people do not know. This absurd situation is not only basically the basis of the people. The deprivation of rights is a humiliation of the people. Restoring and maintaining historical memory is the basic dignity of the people.</p>
<p>Why do we commemorate June 4th year? Because "June 4th" is a historical event, it is still a sensitive issue in China. In this sense, the "June 4th" has not passed, and as an incident, it has not ended. More importantly, the various contests of the "June 4th" issue have huge political energy itself. At the moment of China's transformation in the future, such political energy will definitely play a role. For such a future possibility, we must cherish and maintain this political energy today.</p>
<p>Why do we commemorate June 4th year? There is also a simpler reason, that is, we do not have any forgotten reasons. As long as there is no case in a day, China cannot talk about any justice. Those who die are still unjustly souls, and China is still not qualified to be considered a civilized country. Without any reason to stand, "We should not commemorate the June 4th year", then the June 4th year of the year is the matter.</p>
<p>In short, as the parties of the "June 4th", witnesses and survivors, we commemorate the "June 4th" every year, not only for our own youthful memory, but also for the country and nation in China; For today and the future. This is the meaning of the "June 4th" memorial. These meanings are so important that any Chinese are obliged to lift candlelight at this moment at this moment, mourn the dead, and remember the history.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-29T09-50-37-00-00/000155006_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>E -commerce service supplier Baozun E -commerce Co., Ltd.(BZUN.US;9991.HK)The latest financial report provides a strong evidence that shows an increasingly common theme in China, that is, cautious consumers are avoiding large expenditures. During the first quarter of the financial report season, we often see this theme in the automotive and real estate industry, which are the most expensive large items for ordinary consumers.</p>
<p>Now, Baozun's financial report shows that this trend also extends down to household appliances and electronic products along the "food chain". In contrast, cheaper products such as fast consumer goods and personal care products are recently popular, indicating that people are still willing to spend money on these cheaper daily products.</p>
<p>At the same time, Baozun announced a new international expansion strategy, trying to sell its popular tools to e -commerce merchants outside China. This seems to be built in the company earlier this year's acquisition of clothing retailers GAP(GPS.US)On the basis of the store in Greater China, this move makes Baozun serve from the software as the software(SaaS)Suppliers' old banks, transformed into comprehensive suppliers of such services, and retail brand operators.</p>
<p>The strategy is to achieve diversified development. To a certain extent, it makes sense, because brands such as Gap can become the main new customers of e -commerce services at the core of Baozun. Also in terms of diversification, the company has released an inspiring progress report that shows that it is steadily reducing to Alibaba(Baby.us; 9988.hk)The latter is one of its largest shareholders, and through the online mall Tmall, it has become its main source of business.</p>
<p>We will review these points in detail later. However, after the report was released, the decrease in consumer confidence and the large expenditure caused by it seemed to have the greatest impact on investors' ideas. After the report was released on Thursday, the stocks of Baozun's listing in New York fell 10%, but the next day recovered some of the declines.</p>
<p>The stock has fallen by 27%this year, and has fallen by more than half from the high position in February. At that time, Chinese stocks listed overseas rose sharply. Even so, according to the prediction of its profitability this year, the stock earnings of the stock is 37 times, and the valuation is still quite high. This number is lower than Shopify(SHOP.US)185 times, but higher than Saifu Shi(CRM.US)32 times.</p>
<p>More importantly, its major shareholders include at least the three major institutions of JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Schroder, and their shareholding ratio is 5%or more. Therefore, although Baozun E -commerce is currently in a difficult situation in China, it is clear that investors have not given up.</p>
<p>The revenue of Baozun E -commerce in the first quarter was not particularly encouraging, and it decreased by 4.9%year -on -year to 1.89 billion yuan. If the GAP Greater China has contributed 189 million yuan from February, its quarterly revenue will decrease by 14%. Nevertheless, compared with 20%of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, this is still a sign of improvement. At that time, due to strict epidemic prevention measures, consumption mood was quite low, and epidemic prevention measures were not canceled until early December.</p>
<p><strong> Weak electronic product demand </strong></p>
<p>Baozun e -commerce divides the income into two categories: one is the original e -commerce service income, and the other is new product sales revenue. Among these two businesses, the core e -commerce services accounting for about two -thirds of their revenue are actually relatively good this quarter. This category fell 6%to 1.22 billion yuan, mainly due to the disposal of a loss -making subsidiary during this period. If this impact is excluded, the income from the service is almost the same.</p>
<p>The biggest decline comes from product sales revenue. If it does not include the sales of GAP stores that start contributing to revenue in February, the take -off and landing range is about 30%. The worst performance of product sales is electronic products, which plunged 67%year -on -year to 43.6 million yuan. The sales of small appliances also plummeted by 36%to 225 million yuan because consumers' willingness to buy such products declined.</p>
<p>In contrast, the sales of fast consumer goods in this quarter increased by 25%, and the sales of beauty cosmetics also increased by 6%.</p>
<p>The company stated at the financial report call that the consumption trends in April and May have improved, but no details are provided.</p>
<p>The profits of Baozun E -commerce are not optimistic. It reports operational losses, and it also records losses under non -recognized accounting standards that excludes employee stock compensation. On this basis, the company reported that non -public accounting standards lost 13.1 million yuan, while net profit was 1.2 million yuan in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at GAP's Greater China business.(280 million yuan)This relatively cheaper price acquired the business. Due to the fierce competition and weak expenditures during the epidemic, the chain store has been struggling. When the acquisition is completed, its number of stores has been reduced to 118, which is about half of the total number of chain stores in March 2021.</p>
<p>The senior management of Baozun E -commerce revealed that they plan to slowly expand the chain store again, with the goal of opening 10 stores this year. They also said that the chain store "greatly reduced operational losses in the first quarter", but did not provide details of when it started to make profit.</p>
<p>In the end, let's briefly talk about a minority equity of Baozun E -commerce acquired the lifestyle brand asialtd. And opened an online store in Singapore. This brand does not seem to be very big, and it doesn't seem to be a big move to open a store in Singapore. But both of them show that Baozun e -commerce wants to go out of China, and Southeast Asia is the first step it takes in this direction.</p>
<p>"This is an important step to push our long -tested technology to the global market," said Qiu Wenbin, chairman of the board of directors at the call. "Our technology is an important basic part of our growing business in the e -commerce market that is growing in Southeast Asia."</p>
<p>All in all, Baozun e -commerce seems to be moving in a positive direction, although someone may question whether it is wise to acquire the GAP brand that is in trouble in China. Its biggest challenge is to withstand the test of China's economic downturn. Investors will pay close attention to whether the consumption expenditure will improve in the next few quarters.</p>

<p>In 2021, the anti -government protests broke out in the Solomon Islands.

<p>Description: Zhong Nanshan estimates that the peak of this round of epidemic can reach up to 65 million people infected per week, but the authorities have not taken strict prevention and control measures again.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-29T10-00-19-08-00/27china-covid-01-glkh-master1050.jpg" />In December last year, under the pressure of surging infection in the new crown virus and the increasingly rising anger of the public, China suddenly abandoned the severe "new crown and clear zero" policy. Half a year later, the new crown virus infection rose again, but this time, as the government concentrated its energy to revive economic growth, China seemed to decide to continue normal life.</p>
<p>Although other countries have long been accustomed to doing so, this is still a change for China. Until the end of last year, in order to eliminate the infection, sometimes it was only small cluster infection, and the Chinese leadership still sealed the entire community and some areas of the city, and even the entire city.</p>
<p>According to a report issued by the China Health Department, since April this year, the new crown virus <a href="https://archive.ph/fnMxt">increasing infection cases</a>, Especially the infection cases that are spreading the new Asian branch worldwide. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20201230/china-coronavirus/">Zhong Nanshan</a>It was the earliest well -known doctor who publicized the new crown virus in early 2020 that the new crown virus was easy to spread in the crowd. He estimated on Monday that by the end of June, the peak of the new crown virus infection in China can reach up to 65 million cases per week. (It is higher than his estimation of 40 million examples per week at the end of May. China will no longer release officially estimated the number of national infection cases.)</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-23/china-estimates-covid-surge-is-infecting-37-million-people-a-day">estimation cited by Bloomberg News</a>In contrast, after the "New Crown Crown Zero" control measures were canceled in December last year, the number of people infected with the new crowns in China had reached 37 million per day during the peak of the epidemic.</p>

<p>Although as Zhong Nanshan acknowledged, the increase in the rising cases of infection is full of uncertainty, but the possibility of rebounding in the epidemic always exists, and many Chinese seem to be ready to live in the context of the new crown epidemic, and even prepare to accept the new crown. Sometimes death.</p>
<p>"People are accustomed to infection, and I feel that this is the normal state of the post -epidemic era," Lin Zi, who worked in a technology company in Beijing and was 36 years old, said in a telephone interview. Chinese leader Xi Jinping often wears medical masks when meeting with people indoors. But Lin Zi first said that he and his family were no longer wearing masks in most public places, as do many Chinese people.</p>
<p>"Many of my friends are Yangyang last year, and this year, I was again," Lin Zi said first. "I personally calmly treat the virus and epidemic."</p>

<p>Officials from all over China seem to be trying to make the public prepare for rising infection rates, instead of taking strict prevention and control measures. At the end of last year, the public had lost patience to strict prevention and control practices. Since the abolition of strict restrictions on domestic travel, the government has shifted to restore economic growth and creating employment opportunities. [About 20%unemployment rate] among urban young people <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230522/china-youth-unemployment/">about 20%of the unemployment rate</a>It seems to be politically urgent than rising infections in new coronal virus.</p>
<p>"Most people have infected the virus in the previous wave of epidemic, and the severity of the infection is not great," at the University of Chicago University of Political Science <a href="https://daliyang.org/">Yang Dali</a>He said that he is about to complete a book about China's epidemic.</p>
<p>He added that China has now treated the new crown virus as a "class B infectious disease", not the most urgent category. Although officials are still monitoring the recent cases, "it has also repeatedly stated that this wave of infection is that this wave of infection of infection The symptoms are relatively mild, and strive to reassure the public.

<p>Although Beijing’s health officials <a href="https://archive.ph/YBTW5">recommend wearing masks on bus and subway</a>, But not forced. Many passengers still do not wear masks, especially young people. Although increasing infection cases may put pressure on hospitals in the near future, many people seem to be more willing to rest at home after infection, instead of going to a hot kidnight to see a doctor.</p>
<p>"Even if my son won the new crown, it was okay to stay in the same room with him. I don't mind," Lin Zi, who was engaged in technical work, said first.</p>
<p>For many young people, the infection of the new crown may mean about a week of fever and other symptoms. In recent weeks, people have described their symptoms on social media, and they usually use a kind of sharp sourness to listen to life.</p>
<p>What is even more worrying is the elderly. Many of them have not been infected with the new crown virus, and may not have vaccinated vaccines throughout the process. Director of the Infectious Disease Center of Shanghai Huashan Hospital <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20210312/china-covid19-zhang-wenhong/">Dr. Zhang Wenhong</a>It is one of the most important voices in China on the problem of the new crown virus. In an interview with Chinese media recently, he said that as many as 75%of those who were infected with viruses in this round of epidemic Infect.</p>

Although increasing infection cases may put pressure on hospitals in the near future, many people seem to be more willing to stay at home after infection. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>Nevertheless, according to China Business News "<a href="https://archive.ph/tzfKr#selection-799.24-799.42">First Finance</a>"It is reported that Zhang Wenhong said that the new crown virus rolling the soil" should not have a huge impact on our overall economic life, and we should not take an over -taking measure. "</p>
<p>Professor of the University of Hong Kong <a href="https://www.sbms.hku.hk/staff/dong-yan-jin">Jin Dongyan</a>After tracking China's response to the new crown virus, he agreed that Zhang Wenhong's statement was that many of the infected people in this wave of epidemic are likely to be older or bad. They were protected in the "tsunami" of the epidemic at the end of last year. No contact with the virus.</p>
<p>advertiseJin Dongyan said that China should increase the vaccination rate, especially among the elderly; upgrade the domestic vaccine to better resist new mutant plants; allow the introduction of foreign -developed vaccines; A cheaper antiviral drug.</p>
<p>"Most people have realized from their own experience that the new crown virus is not a monster, and it is not so terrible, which is actually a good thing," he said. "But the new crown virus has passed, and the saying that it will never come back is wrong, so you should tell the public clearly."</p>

"Then a president appeared to make them feel recognized by their value, emphasizing their sense of belonging to Turkey. The most important thing is that he can touch their emotions and touch their hearts. Very very successful. "</p>
<p>At the same time, Erdogan has a powerful organizational structure in Germany. "The conservative circle organized well in Germany."

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) In the French Open Women's Single Single Championship on May 28, Belarusian Arynasabalenka defeated Ukraine player Martakostyuk with a score of 6 to 3 and 6-2. However, after the game, Kostek did not shook hands with his opponent Sabaronca according to the convention of the game, which caused a booing of the audience.</p>
<p>In fact, Costek had stated before the game that because Moscow invaded Ukraine, she would not shook hands with Russian and Belarus players. For the booing from the auditorium, Kostek said, "I'm trying to forget it." The audience's behavior was completely unexpected for her. She also said that she would have such a reaction without expected, "but I want to see what people will react ten years after the end of the war."</p>
<h3><strong> Don't handshake, take photos </strong></h3>
<p>For a few months, Kostek has been criticizing Russian and Belarus players and their negative actions for the war. This is why she decided to refuse to conduct voluntary handshake with the players of the two countries. She did not have Sabaron this time. The card takes photos before the game. As early as March, after winning the first game in the World Women's Professional Tennis Association (WTA) event in Texas, Kostek has not shook hands with her then Russian opponent Gracheva.

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/巴黎奥运会缺席者应该是乌克兰还是俄罗斯/a-65636280">20 -year -old Kostek explained and defended his position</a>She pointed out that I do n’t understand why Sabareka could not make a clear commitment to oppose Russian invasion: "She can send a message, people like her have been to many places, there is a large team behind her, she has so many media in the media. The platform can pass information. "</p>
<p>When talking about Kiev's attack by 54 Russian drones earlier, she said, "I didn't look at my mobile phone that night. Later, I found out that something happened. War has become part of my life and it is difficult to describe. It is difficult to describe it. It is difficult to describe it. It is difficult to describe it. I try to block it. "</p>
<h3><strong> Sabaronka: If you can wish to end the war </strong></h3>
<p>The Belarusian player Sabarren tried to adopt a neutral role on this issue. She said, "She (Costek) should not leave the stadium like this (in the boo)." Sabaronka also said: "I can understand that she does not shake hands with us, I know this is not for me." She added: "If I can end the war, I will do this."</p>
<p>Sabaronka also said: "Whether it is Russia or Belarusian athletes, no one supports war. We all want to stop it, but this is not what we can control."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T10-29-00Z/65759050_401.jpg" />Sabaronka is facing criticism from Ukraine opponents</p>
<h3><strong> Russian player Castekina's position is clear </strong></h3>
<p>However, Costek did not accept this statement of Sabaronka. She believed that there were still some athletes who were brave, and cited Dariakasatkina as an example. The Russian player recently talked about war publicly and bravely.</p>
<p>In the Madrid Open in early May of this year, Lesiaatsurenko, Ukraine, did not shots after the match with Casakina, and Casakina said: "The Ukraine has reason to not shake hands with us." In fact, Zulunko and Casakina did not completely stop communication. The two waved their hands after the incident. Casakina said, "I'm glad."</p>
<p>Kostek, who mentioned this incident, emphasized: "Casakina is standing on the side of truth, love and kindness." She also pointed It is a very easy thing, but it has been unable to communicate normally due to the influence of the war.</p>

<p>What kind of changes have taken place in Turkey under Erdogan?</p>
<p>Despite the enthusiastic celebrations of supporters, in this tear country, the concept of unity seems to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>After the failure of the 2016 coup, Erdogan had abolished the position of the Prime Minister, and the power was highly concentrated.</p>
<p>Turkey's opposition can now only reorganize the fanfare in order to prepare for local elections in 2024.</p>

<h3>Strong man leader who has been in power for 20 years</h3>
<p>Erdogan, who was cold, was a giant in Turkish politics. It has been leading this country for 20 years. After Mustafa Kemalaturk, the founding father of the founding of modern republics, The most impact on this country.</p>
<p>Although he experienced a series of crises, he still won in the 2023 election and continued to power.</p>
<p>This is his most unstable status for many years, and his opponent believes that he may defeat him.</p>
<p>Critics have accused him of increasing the crisis of living costs in Turkey.</p>
<p>In addition, as a leading leader, he set a proud record in the modern development of Turkey, but in February, the earthquake that won 50,000 lives seemed to have a slow response.</p>
<p>After escaping in the coupon in 2016, he turned the president's position into a supreme administrative role of power and suppressed the opponent and the disgraceful.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2003, first as the Prime Minister, and then since 2014, he has been the president after direct election. Turkey under the leadership of Erdogan has continued to "show muscles" as a regional force, promoted Islamic cause, and quickly overwhelmed political opponents.</p>
<p>Although he was a head of NATO member states, he placed himself in a mediation person in the Russia and Ukraine War, and made Sweden wait for the affairs of joining the Western Defense Alliance. His tough diplomacy anger in Europe and a wider range.</p>
<p>Erdogan ordered his country to divide the polarization, but he was the general of Changsheng in the election. His supporters call him "leader".</p>
<h3>to the position of power</h3>
<p>Rejuepap Erdo was born on February 1954 on the black coast of the Turkey and was the son of a member of a coast defense. At the age of 13, his father decided to move to Istanbul, hoping that five children would have a better growth environment.</p>
<p>Young Erdogan has sold lemonade and sesame bags to earn extra money. He studied in the Islamic school and later obtained a management degree in Marmarauniversity in Istanbul -at the same time a professional football player.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Erdogan's supporters like his tough tone and the defense of Islamic's traditional value.</p>
<p>From the 1970s to the 1980s, he was active in the Islamic circle and joined the ISISist Welfare Party of Necmettinerbakan. As the party became more and more popular in the 1990s, Erdogan was selected as Mayor of Istanbul in 1994 and led the largest city in Turkey for four years.</p>
<p>However, his term stopped due to one thing -he was accused of publicizing reading ethnic poetry to incite hatred. Poetry included such sentences: "Mosque is our barracks, the dome is our helmet, the minaret is our our helmets, the spire is our our helmet, the minaret is our our helmets, the spire is our helmet, the minaret is our our helmet, the spire is our our helmet, and the spire is our. Burst, believers are our soldiers. "</p>
<p>After several months of imprisonment, he returned to politics. But his party has been banned for violating the harsh non -religious standards of the modern Turkish government.</p>
<p>In 2001, he founded a new party with ABDullahgul, an ally. In 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the majority of parliament, and Erdogan was also appointed Prime Minister in the next year. To this day, he is still the party chairman of AKP.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Since 2003, he has been the Prime Minister for three sessions, and has been in power during a period of stable economic growth, and has won praise from the international community as a reformer. During the period when Erdogan was given a large -scale infrastructure project as a period of modernization in Turkey, the scale of the middle class expanded, and millions of people got rid of poverty.</p>
<p>However, critics also warned that he was becoming more and more autocracy.</p>
<p>In 2013, the protesters took to the streets, partly because his government planned to convert the popular parks in the center of Istanbul, and it was also because the public wanted to challenge the more authoritarian rule. The Prime Minister's responsibility for the demonstrator is Diao Min, and the people of the neighborhood will knock on the pot at 9 o'clock every night to show resistance. The son of the three cabinet allies is also trapped in the charges of corruption.</p>
<p>The protest of The Gezi Park became a black and white point for his rule. For his critics, what he did is more like the monarch of the Ottoman Empire, not a democratic leader.</p>
<p>Erdogan also had evil with the Islamic teacher in the United States, Aya Fethullahgulen. Also contributed power. This evil caused a fierce response in the Turkish society.</p>
<h3>Muslim revival</h3>
<p>Ten years after governing, Erdogan's political party is also committed to lolling women wearing headscarves set up after the military coup in 1980. The ban was finalized, allowing women to join the police, military and judicial departments.</p>
<p>Critics pointed out that he dug Attuk's world walls. Although Erdogan himself is a believer, he has always denied that he wants to force the implementation of Islamic values, insisting that he supports the rights of Turks to openly express religious beliefs.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T10-37-40.000Z/_90422851_864e1d9b-a747-4cff-a694-0f947bda83d0.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Erdo's wife Emine often wore headscarves to attend public places.</p>
<p>However, he repeatedly supported adultery as a crime. As the father of the four children, he said that "no Muslim family" should consider breeding or family planning. "We will expand our descendants," he said in May 2016.</p>
<p>He praised his mother's identity, dispatched female doctrines, and said that men and women could not be treated equally.</p>
<p>Erdogan has long supported the Islamic cause -as we all know, he has a gesture of four fingers to Egypt's oppressed Muslim brothers.</p>
<p>In July 2020, under his auspices, Istanbul's historic Sofia Cathedral turned into a mosque, which angered many Christians. The cathedral built 1500 years ago was once turned into a mosque by the Ottoman Turks, but Atatk turned it into a museum -as a new secular national symbol.</p>
<p>A few hours after the start of the 2023 election, it was not a coincidence that the president was choosing to speak to the supporters during the late prayer.</p>
<h3>Strengthen control</h3>
<p>After being banned from continuing to run for the Prime Minister, he first hit the president in the first election in 2014. At that time, it was a symbolic position. He already has a plan for reform and establishing a new constitution to benefit all the Turks and also make their country among the top ten economies in the world.</p>
<p>But in the early days of the president, he faced his position twice. His political parties lost a majority of parliamentary seats in a voting in 2015. In 2016, Turkey witnessed the first violent coup at an attempt of decades ago.</p>
<p>The rebels almost caught the president of the vacation in the seaside resort at the time, but he was rescued by the plane. In the early morning of July 16th, he appeared at the Atattuck Airport at the Atuk Airport in Istanbul, greeted him the cheers of supporters. They blocked the progress of the coup with the coup, and nearly 300 civilians were killed.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>On July 16, 2016, Erdogan's supporters blocked a military coup in one night.</p>
<p>The president appeared in national television and rally with supporters in Istanbul, claiming that he was "general commander". However, the situation was also obviously nervous. He cried openly when he spoke at a close friend's funeral, and the latter was shot and killed by the rebels.</p>
<p>The incident was blamed on the "Grand Movement", causing about 150,000 civil servants to be fired, and more than 50,000 people were detained, including soldiers, journalists, lawyers, police officers, scholars and Kurdish politicians.</p>
<p>The suppression of critics has caused foreign vigilance, and it has also caused Turkey's relations with the European Union to be cold: Turkey has tried to join the European Union for many years without progress. The dispute over the influx of immigrants in Greece has also exacerbated hostility.</p>
<p>However, in the shiny palace of 1,000 rooms from Axara's view of Akara, President Erdogan's location seemed to be unprecedentedly stable.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-29T10-37-40.000Z/_90422853_e4ddf28d-b8ee-42b7-8b3b-b1980c1871c5.jpg" /></p>

<p>In Ankara, the luxury of Erdogan's official residence was luxurious and was shrouded in controversy.</p>
<p>He won in a referendum in 2017, which enabled the president to have comprehensive power, including the improvisation of the emergency state, and appointing senior officials and intervention legal systems.</p>
<p>One year later, he won in the first round of presidential elections.</p>
<p>His core votes come from the town and rural conservative areas of Anatolia. In 2019, his party defeated in three largest cities -Istanbul, the capital Akara, and Izmir.</p>
<p>In the Mayor Election of Istanbul, the political party lost to the Fortune of the Republican Party (CHP) Ekremimamoglu, the main opposition of the Republican Party (CHP), for the 1990s It was a bitter loss. He never accepted the result.</p>
<p>Before Ima Mogu was banned from participating in the May election, he was ahead of the president in polls. President and his allies are accused of using court to revoke the qualifications of the popular mayor.</p>

<p>Ima Mogru won the mayor of Istanbul in 2019. Of course, he was considered the main opposition.</p>
<p>Turkey's third largest party and the People's Democratic Party (HDP) of New Kurdish are also afraid that they were banned from voting by Parliament because they were accused of being associated with Kurdish forces, but it decided to run in different names.</p>
<p>Like the past Turkish leaders, Erdogan gave a strong suppression on the banned Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).</p>
<p>Although Turkey received more than 3.5 million refugees who had escaped from the Syrian civil war, Ankara also launched many operations on the Kurdish armed forces on the other side of the border, and crowded the Kurds in Turkey.</p>
<p>Erdogan has been closely related to Russian President Putin for a long time. He also tried to play an important mediation role in the Russian conflict.</p>
<p>Although he is the leader of NATO member states, he purchased Russia's anti -missile defense system and chose Russia to build the first nuclear reactor in Turkey.</p>
<p>Prior to the 2023 election, he tried to win the trust of nationalists and conservative voters by accusing Western needle to him.</p>
<p>"My country will shatter this conspiracy," he asserted and described it as an explosion point.</p>
<p>He visited the tomb of Adnan Mennders as the end of the 2023 campaign. This was the first prime minister in Turkey's democratic election and was executed after a military coup in 1961.</p>
<p>He wants people to know: "The era of coup and warlords is over."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T10-55-00-04-00/000000.png" />Li Zhiying, founder of Hong Kong One Media Li Zhiying (Middle) in December 2020, was arrested and entered the Data Map of the Settlement of the Press Press <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf-05292023104433.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/yatabaOdai/gangtai/GF-05292023104433 .html/@@ stream</a>Li Zhiying, the founder of Hong Kong One Media, involving a number of Hong Kong Edition National Security Law cases, was rejected by the application for termination of hearing. The Hong Kong High Court emphasized that choosing a barrister is not an absolute right. Even if there is no overseas lawyer's participation, Li Zhiying can still get a fair interrogation. Some observers condemn the decision of the Hong Kong High Court to violate the Basic Law and worry that Hong Kong's judicial system will gradually be aligned with mainland China.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/jw2-05192023103652.html"><strong> Li Zhiying's "Promoting Liberty Award" judicial review was rejected by the court </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/sc-05292023054105.html">On the eve of the 34th anniversary of June 4th, Peng Lifa, Li Zhiying and others were commended by the American and private groups</a></strong></p>
<p>In the face of the conspiracy and collusion of foreign forces, and the conspiracy issued a total of four charges of incitement publications, the case was tried in September, and three designated judges will be tried. He applied for a termination of hearing, questioning that the Chief Executive of Hong Kong chose to specify that the judge lacks transparency, making the court bias; and questioned the maintenance of the National Security Council and the person who represents the opinions of the Central Committee of China. Zhiying's orders ignored it, so that the separation of administrative and judiciary's authority to be separated from the constitutional protection system collapsed and disappeared.</p>
<p>Three designated judges in the Hong Kong High Court refuted on May 29 that the appointment of judicial officers by the judicial personnel recommended that the Chief Executive appointed the designated judge without absolute decision, and each judge must strictly adhere to the guidance of judicial vows and judges. The allocation of cases is also handled by judicial institutions.</p>
<p>The verdict said that the overall legislation of the National Security Law is to be consistent with the Basic Law and provide a full guarantee for the judicial independence of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It also said that there is no evidence to prove that the National Security Commission does not act sincerely. Local experienced legal team representatives were interrogated fairly, and the nature and severity of the crime finally rejected the application.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Li Zhiying case was approved by the High Court approved to hire Owen representatives. The National People's Congress of China and the Hong Kong Government also cooperated with the amendment, stipulating that overseas lawyers came to Hong Kong to participate in the Hong Kong version of the National Security Law case must be obtained first.</p>
<p>Li Zhiying had previously asked the court to order that the Chinese people's interpretation did not affect his employment of Owen, but judicial review was also rejected. The former assistant professor of the Department of Applied Social Sciences of the University of Science and Technology of Hong Kong, Zhong Jianhua did not rule out that Li Zhiying still filed a lawsuit based on legal justice.</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua: "The court's verdict is just self -round. I believe he (Li Zhiying) has done everything. No matter how slim, I hope to get a better result from the legal procedure. The process highlights the injustice of the current judicial process. "</p>
<p><strong> Analysis: The verdict of the High Court violates the "Basic Law" </strong></p>
<p>The Hong Kong High Court claims that the right to choose a barrister is not absolute. Zhong Jianhua believes that this obviously violates the "Basic Law".</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua said: "Whenever similar controversy occurs, the reasons for being carried out from Beijing or Hong Kong Government are always. Freedom of speech is not absolute. Expressing freedom of expression is not absolute, and the freedom to hire a barrier is not absolute. It is said that Hong Kong people have the right to choose their own legal representatives, and everything can be attached 'not absolute', which is completely unpredictable. 'Nothing is absolutely' is equivalent to everything. ","</p>
<p>Xu Zhifeng, a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, condemned the words of the Hong Kong High Court.</p>
<p>Xu Zhifeng: "Hong Kong has always pursued the British ordinary law, and even after the sovereignty returned to China. Hong Kong people have always been free to choose a defense lawyer. The same is true for you to find someone else. The next step in the regime may be the "official lawyer '."</p>
<p>Xu Zhifeng said that Hong Kong people generally lose confidence in Hong Kong's judicial system and believe that the court and the current regime are already a group. It is not surprising that the outside world has rejected Li Zhiying's application for Li Zhiying, which is very heavy for Hong Kong, which has always advertised judicial independence.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) New Development Bank said in a statement in the British "Financial Times" statement that it is indeed negotiating with Saudi Arabia. "In the Middle East, our bank attaches great importance to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>At present, the New Development Bank is preparing to formally evaluate its financing plan. As Russia launched a war invading Ukraine, these financing plans are being questioned, and analysts are worried that Russia, who holds 19%of the bank, will affect its financing capabilities. New Development Bank has been forced to put on hold on its US $ 1.7 billion in financial exposure in Russia, accounting for about 6.7%of its total assets, and stopped providing funds for new Russian projects to guarantee that it is adhering to the Western -led Moscow to Moscow. Sanctions.</p>
<p>The news that Saudi Arabia is expected to become a new shareholder of funds is obviously a good. Muso, Director of the Independent Evaluation Office of the New Development Bank(AshwaniMuthoo)In an interview with the media, the fundraising options "are the most important transactions", "Our trip is working hard to mobilize resources." Muto refused to comment on negotiations with Saudi Arabia, but in general, the bank board of directors hoped to study alternative tools and currencies. Come to introduce new resources.</p>
<p>The bank will hold a two -day annual meeting on May 30 and 31.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T11-19-00Z/65244218_401.jpg" />In March of this year, under the mediation of China, officials in Saudi Arabia and Iran announced in Beijing that they would restore bilateral diplomatic relations in Beijing.</p>
<h3><strong> BRICS defense sanctions? </strong></h3>
<p>New Development Bank was "[Five Kingdoms] in 2015(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/金砖国家能否打造新的世界秩序/a-65178619)"---- Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa-co-founded, so far provided about 33 billion US dollars of loans for about 100 projects in these five countries. At present, the bank has also absorbed the UAE, Egypt and Bangladesh as <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/伊朗和阿根廷申请加入金砖国家/a-62292801">New Member State</a>Essence</p>
<p>The Russian side regards the new Development Bank as a tool to alleviate the impact of Western sanctions. Russian Prime Minister Mishaskin(Michaelmishustine)When visiting China a few days ago, a major goal of the new Development Bank was to protect the group from "illegal sanctions from the Western camp".</p>
<p>As the world's most important crude oil exporter, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/批准对话伙伴地位-沙特向加入上合组织再迈一步/a-65182384">Saudi Arabia</a>Recently, I am also <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/沙特阿美宣布两项在华投资-总额超1000亿人民币/a-65151253">strive to seek strengthening relations with China</a>Essence At the end of last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised Saudi Arabia to praise the relationship between the two countries "to enter the new era"; in March of this year, under the mediation of China, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/沙特和伊朗外长在北京签署恢复邦交声明/a-65251448">Saudi Arabia and Iran officials announced the restoration of bilateral diplomatic relations in Beijing</a>Essence Now, institutions seeking to join the BRICS countries will further strengthen this link for Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>However, the new Development Bank cannot replace Western -led financial systems in the short term. The agency still depends on the US dollar financing method, so it has largely cooperated with financial sanctions against Russia. In May of this year, the international rating agency Fitch raised the bank's outlook from "negative" to "stable", and attributed it to the new development bank to take measures and reduce financial opening in Russia. Last summer, Fitch had lowered the bank's rating on the grounds that "Russia's reputation risk may hinder the new Development Bank's entry into the US dollar bond market".</p>

However, the bill does not include the big cut of government expenditures that the right -wing people want to get it, but the progressive Democrats will oppose it.</p>
<p>The Wall Street stock market closed last week. Under the strong debt agreement, all the three major indexes rose. The Asian stock market opened this week.</p>
<p>The closing of the Tokyo stock market rose by 1.0%, and the Shanghai stock market closed up 0.3%. Sydney, Taipei, Wellington, Bangkok, and Manila's stock markets also received red.</p>
<p>However, the Hong Kong stock market fell 1.0%, and Singapore and Jakarta stocks also closed down. The Seoul stock market rests on the market due to the Korean national holiday. (Translator: Zhang Zhengyu/Calculation: Chen Zhengyi)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-05-29T11-42-13-00-00/000180160_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett(Warren Buffett)The emergence of last month was welcomed, because his eyes were always good. Berkshire Hathaway Company(Berkshire Hathaway)Recently, it has increased its shares of five Japanese comprehensive trading companies, which is considered a voter to vote for a long -term sluggish corporate department in Japan.</p>
<p>Buffett began to buy the so -called "comprehensive commerce" 3 years ago(Inconsistency)In the shares, he believes that this investment is a company that is ignored under the current betting and will definitely make considerable profits in the future.</p>
<p>In the gap with some business leaders in the country, the famous investor took time to explain his thoughts in detail. He mentioned that he currently holds 7.4%of the 5 companies that he currently holds 7.4%of the shares: "I'm shocked. They are different, but at the same time they are exactly the same."</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe what Japanese trading companies look like. Each trading company is a corporate empire with footprints all over the world. The scope of business is puzzling. It spans a very different industry from clothing design, convenience store retail to construction industry.</p>
<p>However, these five companies have one thing in common that they are focusing on commodity transactions, which makes their cash flows very sensitive to the price of US dollar exchange rates and large commodities such as minerals, food and oil.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange income of the comprehensive commerce is supported by the large commodities from all over the world, which makes these trading groups different from those companies with income and costs to a greater extent. These trading companies have created a variety of profitable ways for Buffett's investment, even if they propagate their own plans -self -reshaping to adapt to a world without fossil fuel -not made progress as planned.</p>
<p>One of the most attractive facts is that Buffett purchases some of the company's stocks that are priced in US dollars, and at the same time, the long -term debt used for the yen pricing provides funds for their purchases.</p>
<p>If the yen depreciates, the value of the US dollar of the unrealized debt of the yen pricing debt will decline. At the same time, the share value of the comprehensive store calculated in the US dollar may not fall too much because they also have foreign exchange income. If the decline in debt value is greater than holding the shareholding, even if the basic business performance has not changed much, Buffett can make a profit.</p>
<p>Slighting yen is definitely not Buffett's intention. Of course, the borrowed money to buy stocks with a large amount of overseas income are not the most practical way to shorten the yen. Aside from this doubt, even if it is just to do a ideological experiment, you can see how attractive Buffett's transaction is theoretically to another type of investors.</p>
<p>The type of speculators who like to review history are watching various currency authorities in the developed world with increasingly skeptical eyes. The price of gold transactions is close to historical highs. Although the breakdown of the economic exchange system may not be the benchmark situation of anyone predicted, it is measured by historical experience, which is uneasy about possible.</p>

The Unified Group owed about 19 million yuan, and the Wuhan Industrial State -owned Investment Corporation owed about 15 million yuan.

<p>Gong and Jian, a person from China, accepted an interview with Radio Asian Radio in Liberty. Wuhan's finances were tight, and they could not be like central banknotes. "The debt of the debt of the debt and the black debt, the debt of the public department of the Wuhan Finance Bureau, as a bad ledger to wipe the necessary disclosure legal procedures. The announcement is not to urge, but to smooth the bad debts."</p>
<p>Gong Yujian mentioned that he had seen the financial bureau and the bank's public debt collection in the party newspaper. Wuhan's attention was to publicize debt collection between public sectors. A friend of a certain financial bureau revealed that some environmental protection director borrowed from the financial director to borrow the investment and development case, and he publicly posted the mess.</p>
<p>Netizens have hotly discussed: "This is a problem left over from history, public debt collection is a legal procedure", "no announcement cannot be verified to sell bad accounts", "local debt may be the biggest thunder in China this year", "Finally tore off the shame."</p>
<p>The "Lao Xu Shi Nu" Weibo posted that the first time I saw this trend to collect debts, the problem of local debt was very serious. Wuhan is still very rich. As a provincial capital city, it adopts this way of publicizing window paper to collect debts. I am afraid it has some symbolic significance?</p>

<p>Wu Jianzhong, Secretary -General of Taiwan Tao Lue Strategy, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia. It also pointed out that the Wuhan Finance Bureau packed the claims to Wuhan Yangtze River Asset Management Co., Ltd.. These accounts probably rotten, and the newspaper was basically shaken.</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong said: "I don't want to memorize the financial bureau, and the asset company is carried by the asset company. Dongfeng Automobile quickly clarified that he had nothing to do with himself. Why? Because they are all brothers with state -owned state -owned assets in Wuhan. The method of debt collection is just asking for a loneliness. "</p>
<p>The Wuhan Municipal Finance Bureau issued the "Announcement of the Authorization of the Treatment of the Borrowing of the Fiscal History" shows that all the fiscal history borrowings are commissioned to Wuhan Changjiang Assets Management Co., Ltd. for full disposal. Special authorization includes: litigation and arbitration, abandoning, changing, increasing litigation requests and arbitration The request, etc., shall be shared in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong mentioned that the Wuhan Finance Bureau wrote in a public reward order that within three months of providing clues such as the assets of debt units to pay, it seems attempt, but the truth will disappoint citizens. "They are all old debt, and most of them are state -owned asset companies, such as Chinese enterprises and central enterprises, and the general sense are all countries. The government owes the government.</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhong mentioned that the local governments became poorer after three years of the epidemic, and various debt collection phenomena appeared. One method is "borrowing new and old". To the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, lending 7.2 billion yuan. The other is to pack bad debt and sell the entire transfer to assets and debt management companies. If it is known as the four major national asset debt management companies, the debt will not be left.Gong and Jian also said, why are there so many "Lao Lai" in China? There are so many bad debts and bad debts of Bank of China? The loser is the majority of taxpayers. The common people spread a word: "I owe 10,000 yuan, you are a grandson, one million yuan owes others, it is the master, others ask you to pay back the money."</p>
<p>According to a comprehensive report, Wuhan City was affected by factors such as large -scale tax refunds and tax reductions and repeated epidemic last year. Wuhan's fiscal revenue was 15.5 billion yuan, a decrease of 4.7 %; the general public budget revenue in the first quarter of this year was about 508 100 million yuan, an annual decrease of 8.5 %. In addition, the revenue of local government funds, which mainly sells land, continues to be sluggish.</p>

<p>One thing to be sure is that even the century -old age, Kissinger still likes to share his views on various international issues with the world. <a href="https://www.zeit.de/2023/22/henry-kissinger-usa-china-russland">He recently accepted an interview with the German media "Die Zeit"</a>It talks about a series of popular topics such as the Russian and Ukraine War, Sino -US relations, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3><strong> Kissinger: I absolutely agree with Ukraine to join NATO </strong></h3>
<p>When the interview talked about what kind of person Putin and his strategic goal of attacking Ukraine, Kissinger stated that he and Putin were a working relationship. It is to maintain Russia's dignity. " He said he never talked to Putin after the start of the Russian and Ukraine War. "I think he (Putin) feels that he has not been treated seriously. Ukraine is a symbol of Russia's humiliation for him. When I first saw him many years ago -then he was the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Tell me that the disintegration of the Soviet Union is one of the biggest tragedies in world history. "</p>
<p>The former Secretary of State of the United States also said that he did not think that all responsibilities were on Putin, saying that the West invited Ukraine to join NATO's plan "unwise". It is written that Ukraine should not be the outpost of the West or Moscow, but should be a bridge between the two sides. "</p>
<p>At the same time, Kissinger also emphasized that Ukraine and the West resisted Russia's attacks and condemned the ruthless war. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格战争结束后乌克兰应加入北约/a-64434762">He is absolutely in favor of absorbing Ukraine after the war and joining NATO</a>Because there is no neutral region between NATO and Russia today. For the West, let Ukraine join NATO can ensure that new conflicts may occur after the war ... cannot be determined by Unilateral attacks from Ukraine or Russia. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T12-14-00Z/65731395_401.jpg" />The picture shows the US Secretary of State Kissinger at a press conference in November 1973. Kissinger has served as Secretary of State in the Nixon government and the Ford government</p>
<h3><strong> "Let Putin be tried? It's best not to" </strong></h3>
<p>When talking about Putin's nuclear warrior threat, Kissinger said that he believes that Putin will not use nuclear weapons for tactical purposes in Ukraine, unless "Russian territory or Crimea Peninsula) Cavaltopol is threatened ..." Essence He also said that if Putin uses nuclear weapons, Western countermeasures should be strong enough to indicate that nuclear weapons can never be a solution to political issues and avoid nuclear weapons from becoming conventional weapons.</p>
<p>When asked about the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court to Putin, Kissinger stated that it was not a good idea for Putin to be tried. It is more difficult to limit a war. " This former US Secretary of State emphasized that it was "not to defend the illegal and wrong behavior of Putin, but we must do our best to prevent the spread of the war, and we must ensure that for a period of time after the war, hostility will not continue to continue infinitely. Going down, Western political goals should be to rebuild the relationship between Europe and Russia after the war. "</p>
<h3><strong> There is no problem in the United States to abandon Europe's security </strong></h3>
<p>Kissinger subsequently talked about US politics and Trump. He said that Trump has a special ability that can attract a large number of minority groups in the United States. "No one has never been able to do this before. This is why Trump has a huge influence in the Republican Party."</p>
<p>The former Secretary of State of the United States also said that he did not think that if Trump was elected as the President of the United States again, the US's security in Ukraine and Europe could not be as good as the Biden government.</p>
<p>He said: "I don't want to talk about my preferences in German newspapers before the campaign. But if any Republican president -including Trump, I really try to abandon the role of the United States in defending European security. No one will tolerate it. ——The people like me will not, the former Republican government officials will not, and the Democratic Party foreign policy officials will not. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T12-14-00Z/65755255_401.jpg" />The picture shows Kissinger's visit to China in 1971 and talks with Zhou Enlai. This meeting paved the way for Nixon's visit to China in 1972</p>
<h3><strong> China -US military confrontation will be "terrible disaster" </strong> **</h3>
<p>Kissinger was interviewed on the office on the 33rd floor of Madison Avenue, New York. The Times Weekly pointed out that his office was hanging in the signature photos of Nixon and Ford, and Kissinger had served as Secretary of State for the two US presidents. A photo on the window sill was his first meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. The dialogue of the United States and China was regarded as a major political achievement of Kissinger.</p>
<p>The interview soon talked about China and China -US relations. "Times Weekly" said, "In our opinion, Sino -US relations have been the worst in the past 50 years," while Kissinger said that it seems that the Biden government is making efforts to re -contact China, and China seems to be in China, and China seems to be in China, and China seems to be in China. China seems to be in China. China seems to be I am also willing. He also said that he did not agree with Biden's description of the strategic competition between the United States and China as a conflict between democracy and autocracy.</p>
<p>Kissinger said that the Taiwan issue may lead to the "upgrade in a way that no one can control" in China and the United States, which exists. He said that if China and the United States have a military confrontation, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格中美冲突将堪比第一次世界大战/a-55649245">"It will be a terrible disaster, worse than the First World War"</a>Because both are high -tech powers and both have unlimited weapons, both sides must act with the most cautious attitude.</p>
<h3><strong> Is Bayeng and Xi Jinping have the great wisdom to solve the problem of confrontation between the United States and China? </strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to Sino -US relations, Kissinger also mentioned artificial intelligence, saying that the technology will have huge political influence. Countries with artificial intelligence technology need to evaluate the new situation.When the Time Weekly asked Kissinger, did he think that Biden and Xi Jinping had such wisdom? The former Secretary of State of the United States replied: "I have known Biden for more than forty years. Bayon's political future depends on whether he finds a solution when dealing with China, or at least work hard. Xi Jinping can do this to do this. One point. This does not mean that he will do this. But what must be done, because <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/基辛格警告中美冷战将带来世界末日般威胁/a-57397429">If the crisis continues to upgrade, we will eventually fall into the situation before the World War I, that is, some ridiculous events will inevitably lead to upgrade. "</a></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T12-14-00Z/65731403_401.jpg" />Kissinger said that he still works like before and works for 15 hours a day</p>
<h3><strong> "Yes, this world will be very turbulent" </strong></h3>
<p>Since then, Kissinger has also talked about his own new book on artificial intelligence, his family's experience in escaping from Germany to the United States under the Nazi rule, and his origin with German politics and public figures. He also responded to some accusations of his role in the dispute. He said, "It is simpler to accuse me of war criminals, and you can start arguing without dealing with substantial content. This is why I don't answer this question ... ... Is this allegations bothered me? Of course it bother me."</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, "Times Weekly" asked Jisingh: "When you look forward to the future, are you mainly concerned about worrying, or are you seeing more self -confidence and hope?"</p>
<p>He replied that he was optimistic about those questions that could be solved, "but these issues are very urgent. If we take the self -pity as the guiding principle of the policy, we will not be able to deal Smart continues to develop and develop into a machine with humans to change everything. In the enlightenment period, he had to face similar problems. After 300 years of Kant and Leibnitz, they developed their philosophy. For a century, I will work hard to find people like Kant and Leibniz. "</p>
<p>Kissinger said that he has not seen a role as Kant in the era of artificial intelligence. "The era before the Enlightenment is also a dark era, thinking about the 30 -year war. It is very turbulent. "</p>

<p>A new study by the Australian Antarctic Antarctic Excellence Center showed that due to global warming, since the 1990s, the deep ocean flow around the Antarctica has slowed down by 30%, which has led to a decrease in the global deep -sea oxygen content.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported that the new research was completed by the Australian Antarctic Science Center, Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization and other institutions.</p>
<p>Australian Antarctic Antarctic Excellence Center recently issued a bulletin saying that due to global warming, the melting of the Antarctic Ice Cry was melted, and the melting water reduced the seawater salinity near the South Pole. Deep ocean flow near the Antarctic. The effects of sea levels related to this and the decrease in the oxygen content of deep sea may continue in the next few centuries.</p>
<p>The bottom water of the Antarctica is a low -temperature and high -density underlying flowing water body under 3000 meters of water depth of the Antarctic waters. According to the communiqué, the bottom water of the Antarctica is an important part of the global current flow. It has participated in the transportation of heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients globally.</p>
<p>The thesis communication author, the Federal Australian Science and Industry Research Organization Environmental Department, said that scientists have had fewer observations about deep -sea. "We have developed a new method to simulate various observation results with realistic model simulation. In order to obtain a preliminary estimate of the changes in deep ocean flow near Antarctica in recent decades. "</p>
<p>Linko, researcher of the Australian Federal Federal Science and Industry Research Organization, said that people are familiar with the melting of Antarctic Ice Cards that will lead to rising sea planes. This new study also shows that the impact of the melting of the Antarctic Ice cover has been extended to the deep sea, which will affect marine chemical composition.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that under the influence of global warming in the Antarctic ice cover, the process of reduced salinity around Antarctica is expected to continue or even accelerate. Therefore, the slowdown in the deep ocean flow and the decrease in the decreased oxygen content of the deep sea will also continue, and this change has significantly changed the structure and chemical composition of the deep sea.</p>

A percentage point, the lowest value since 2018.</p>
<p>On the other hand, according to this survey, the support rate of the party's right to choose the party is 18 %, an increase of 1 percentage point over last week. According to reports, the support rate of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Prime Minister Shulz has decreased by 1 percentage point, currently 20 %. The support rate of the Alliance Party remains unchanged at 28 %. The support rate of the Liberal Democratic Party (FDP) increased by 1 percentage point to 9 %. The support rate of the left party has dropped by 1 percentage point, currently 4 %.</p>
<h3>The controversial heating method</h3>
<p>The Green Party Minister of Economic Minister Habeck plans to gradually replace the laws of harmful climate oil and natural gas heating, and even have different opinions in the joint government. The Liberal Democratic Party, one of the governing alliances, blocked the possibility of this Cabinet Act in the Federal House.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T12-28-00Z/65505071_401.jpg" />Federal Economic Minister of Economic Minister of Economy plans, starting in 2024, each newly installed heating system must use at least 65 % of renewable energy operation</p>
<p>Based on this plan, starting from 2024, each newly installed heating system must be operated with at least 65 % of renewable energy. The United Government decided that the bill will take effect on January 1, 2024, but it still seems to be full of unknown. Habeck believes that there is still room for operating space for the specific effective time of the bill. He recently announced the plan to make a few modifications for the draft.</p>
<p>According to INSA's polls, 57%of the respondents opposed the prohibition of oil and natural gas heating, 28%of the respondents supported, and 15%of the respondents did not express their opinions on this issue. 31 % of the respondents believe that the coalition government will end until the term of 2025, and 51 % of the interviewees believe that the Sels government will fall apart before this. Only 27 % are satisfied with the federal government's work.</p>
<p>Germany pointed out that public opinion surveys are usually full of uncertainty. The attractiveness of the party's voters or the decision of voters' voting decisions is becoming more and more short -term, making it difficult for poll agencies to weigh the data collected by weighing the data. Public opinion investigation only reflects public opinion during the investigation, not the prediction of the election results. The next federal election is scheduled to be in 2025.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-29T12-29-21-08-00/27dcdebt-takaways-wzqk-master1050.jpg" />President Bayeng and the Speaker of the House of Representatives McCarthy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/us/politics/debt-limit-deal.html">Agreement on Saturday</a>, Increase the debt limit, and implement new restrictions on federal expenditure. If it is approved by Congress, the agreement will end the party's deadlock and avoid a state default that may be very destructive.</p>
<p>The agreement will not only solve the fierce disputes on debt and expenditure problems that have troubled Washington for several weeks, but also make significant changes in the work requirements of environmental permission and social security network plan and the tax law enforcement of the IRS.</p>
<p>It is said that this is a principled agreement reached by Bayeon's Caewa in Washington in Washington. Before the final finalization, it still needs to be converted into a formal legislative language. The details of the agreement flowed out from Saturday night, and many problems were still unreasonable.</p>
<p>But according to preliminary information, the following are some of the main points.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p><strong> The upper limit of debt will be increased to 2025, after the next election. </strong></p>
<p>The federal government reached a debt limit of US $ 3.1.4 trillion in debt stipulated by the law in January, but the Ministry of Finance has been using various accounting techniques to avoid breaking the upper limit. Treasury Secretary Yelun said on Friday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/business/yellen-treasury-x-date-us-debt.html">By June 5th, her department will use these methods</a>At that time, the government will not be able to fulfill its obligations.</p>
<p>The agreement reached by Biden and McCarthy will increase the debt limit for two years, so that it will last until the 2024 election, so both parties do not have to deal with this problem again during the current term. Republicans were initially proposed for one year. Both sides hope to win the 2024 election and be in a stronger political status when they reach the upper limit.</p>
<p><strong> Domestic expenditure will be restricted, but it will not be as much as Republicans want. </strong></p>
<p>The Republicans of McCarthy insist that the upper limit of debt must be based on cutting expenditure. Therefore, in the agreement reached with Biden, the restrictions on certain projects will last two years, which is the same as the duration of the upper limit of debt. Republicans initially sought a 10 -year expenditure limit, but agreed to shorten the deadline.</p>
<p>The agreement will maintain the level of non -national defense in 2024 at the level of 2023 and increase it by 1%in 2025, which to a certain extent through re -distribution of other projects' funds. Other matters of the agreement also include that from Biden's previously obtained to help the U.S. Taxation Administration of US $ 80 billion in the US Taxation Agency to invest in the wealthy people's tax evasion behavior, to reduce about $ 10 billion in funds, and use this money to retain domestic projects that would have been cut.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The billions of dollars left by the new crown epidemic rescue plan passed shortly after Biden took office will be partially recovered. A analysis of the New York Times shows that if the upper limit is lifted after two years and the expected inflation rate will increase, then these restrictions will reduce the federal expenditure by about 650 billion US dollars in ten years -this is just the Republican party's initial seeking one reduction of cutting reduction Small parts.</p>
<p><strong> National defense, social security, medical insurance and veterans will not be affected. </strong></p>
<p>The agreement will protect welfare of military and social security and medical insurance from other government departments. It will also provide all funds for the medical care of veterans, including providing more services for those who are exposed to toxic incineration pits.</p>
<p>The agreement will effectively retain the many progress that the Bayeng government has won in many fields in the past two years, such as Titlei education funds provided for low -income students, children's conservation and development of the entire funding plan, cancer research, and other priority matters of the president Essence In the next decades, Biden's efforts to avoid US $ 400 billion of student loan debt will not be affected, although this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/us/politics/student-loan-supreme-court-biden.html">challenge in the Supreme Court</a>Essence However, the agreement will not include tax increases to the rich and enterprises in his initial budget proposal.</p>
<p><strong> Some people who accept government aid will face new work requirements. </strong></p>
<p>Government assistance recipients including food vouchers and poverty -stricken families will face new work requirements. One of them is that the agreement will limit the term of food vouchers who can obtain food vouchers under 54 years of age, although these restrictions will expire in 2030 unless the parliament is extended. The plan will also increase the opportunity to obtain food vouchers for veterans and homeless people.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p><strong> The approval procedures for large energy projects will be simplified. </strong></p>
<p>The environmental permission of large energy projects will be simplified. A single leading agency will formulate a single review document based on the public timetable. The agreement will implement these changes without restricting the overall scope of the current review procedure, no shortening of the time limit for litigation, and no obstacles to maintain, cancel the ban relief or other judicial remedy measures.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-29T13-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Agence France -Presse reported that a statement issued by the official Twitter account of the President stated that Muskini "had agreed to the 2023 Anti -homosexual Act" and the bill had been completed.</p>
<p>Uganda Parliament also announced through Twitter that Muzinini has agreed to the new bill approved earlier this month.</p>
<p>In fact, Muswinini called on parliament members to revise the bill, but the bill still retains most of the tough clauses that caused strong protests in Western countries.</p>
<p>According to the revised bill, it admits that he will not be convicted if he is homosexual, but "engaged in homosexual behavior" will be a crime that can be sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Although Musvini had suggested that members deleted the clauses that sentenced the "severe homosexual" torture, it was rejected by Congress, which means that the offender may be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The bill attracted condemnation from the United States, European Unions and International Human Rights, but enjoys extensive public support in Uganda.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The German "Business Daily" published by Dussertorf ** [以 "[<a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/homo-oeconomicus/gastkommentar-homo-oeconomicus-wir-muessen-mehr-unabhaengigkeit-von-china-wagen-/29171502.html">We must be brave to get rid of dependence on China</a>"As the title, I will publish the professor of the Financial Research Center of Frankfurt University(VolkerBrühl)Written customer reviews. The author pointed out that although the dependence between Europe and China is mutual, Beijing is trying to enhance the autonomy of economic technology, and Europe will fall into unilateral dependence on China in the near future.</p>
<p>Humanitarian assistance. "</p>
<p>"The West only significantly reduces the [economic dependence] to China <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/调查德国对华投资不造成依赖/a-65389145">economic dependence</a>At the time, we can effectively promote the reform of Beijing. For the automotive industry and machinery manufacturing industry, China is the world's largest sales market. Because of this, the EU, other high economic growth bodies such as India, Indonesia, South America, and Africa are important. "</p>
<p>"Germany was the leader of photovoltaic power generation technology. However, decision -making errors have led to China to become a science and technology champion and manufacturing leader in the field of solar power generation. Now, wind energy and green hydrogen energy are also facing the same risk. Let the relevant industries settle in Europe. In addition, Europe should also reduce its dependence on imported semiconductor products. "</p>
<p>The author also noticed that the investment conditions between Europe and China are not equal. The European Union urgently needs to amend the regulations to ensure that important technologies will not be transferred, and it is also ensured that the industrial chain is settled more in Europe. "Although there are many benefits of global industries, democratic countries should also have certain autonomy in important areas."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T13-43-00Z/65182161_401.jpg" />Since the European Union Commission chairman Feng Delin delivered a speech at the end of March in March, "risk" has become a hot word in the West when discussing the policy of China</p>
<p>The Hamburg Published <strong> "Mirror Weekly" </strong> "" "" "" "" "" "(https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/europas-umgang-mit-china-wenn-derisking-nach-hinten-losgeht-kolumne-a-8c754cc8-7c28-43ec-bec1-123160ec413e)"For the title, publishing comments pointed out that the European Union now wants to reduce its economic dependence on China, but blindly raising the proportion of localized production will cause greater risks.</p>
<p>The article noticed that since <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/冯德莱恩不希望与中国脱钩对俄立场决定中欧关系/a-65186120">the Chairman of the European Commission, Feng Delin, President Feng Delin delivered a speech that "not decoupled but out of danger" at the end of March</a>Since then, "risk" has become <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国国家安全顾问对华关系要去风险-而非脱钩/a-65462184">hot words in the West discussed the policy of China</a>Essence "This is a sentence that Feng Delin likes. 'Going risk' is not just to sound more '<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/研究与中国等重要经济体脱钩将严重打击德国经济/a-65519064">decoupling</a>'More gentle, it can also let people understand the need to understand: Bayeng and others interpreted it as a comprehensive isolation China, and many German corporate bosses who are unwilling to give up the rich Chinese business interpret it as <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国对华经济依赖持续加深-问题出在哪/a-65259582">business photos do it. </a>Essence The most important thing is: the EU's plan to reduce the economic dependence of emerging powers ---- whether it is to promote the production of local raw materials or the construction of the local photovoltaic industry ---- finally have a big title. "</p>
<p>The author pointed out vigilantly that many times, the risks that people think are actually not risks at all; sometimes, the risks cannot be ruled out at all, unless they pay a high cost of incomparable proportion. With the cautious vision of economics to examine the various "de -risk" suggestions proposed by the European Union recently, you will find that the risk caused by the "de -risk" measure itself may be greater than the original "risk". The analysis of the article pointed out that if Europe has pushed rare earth production in order to reduce its dependence on China's rare earth materials, or to force the localization of solar power boards, it will greatly increase the cost of economic operation.</p>
<p>"Moreover, trying to use trade barriers to reduce political risks. Such behavior itself constitutes risk. For example Asia, Africa, Latin America. In Europe, the steel industry and chemical industry in Europe are inseparable from a large amount of green hydrogen energy, but most of this energy source can only be produced overseas. "</p>
<p>"This means that the European Union will still import a lot in the future. In order to buy these imported materials, the EU can only make money through exported industrial products. A world that is fragmented by foreign trade due to geopolitics is not the green of the European Union. The need for transformation. The future green economy must be global. Without globalization, there is no green economy. "</p>
<p>"'Depending on Risk' is a beautiful vocabulary, but to raise it into a strategy, the West must first clarify where the Chinese risk is and which countermeasures are the most suitable. This problem is very complicated. The G7 held recently There is a result of the summit, anyway: Western countries agree that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国在哪方面依赖中国脱钩是否可行/a-65492863">'Decoming' is not the best option</a>Essence From this perspective, the proposal of the concept of "de -risk '" can also be regarded as a great progress.

Two of the sources revealed to Reuters that Tesla CEO Musk is expected to meet with senior Chinese officials and visit Tesla's factory in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is unknown who will meet with and what will be discussed. Because this is a private category, people familiar with the matter refused to disclose their names.</p>
<p>Tesla and the News Office of the State Council did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p>Reuters reported in March that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消息人士马斯克最快4月访华-寻求与李强见面/a-65197299">Musk plans to visit China</a>And seeking meeting with the Chinese State Council Prime Minister Li Qiang may be the earliest in April, depending on Li Qiang's schedule.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T13-47-00Z/65269178_401.jpg" />The Tesla Shanghai plant is the largest production base of this electric vehicle manufacturer</p>
<p>Tesla is currently facing many problems, including competition with Chinese auto manufacturers when the Chinese market is weak.</p>
<p>Tesla has not yet provided any latest information about the annual output of 450,000 vehicles in the Shanghai plant. Tesla has submitted an application to the local government and plans to increase the annual capacity of the Shanghai plant from 1.25 million to 1.75 million. In addition, the company also stated in April that it will produce a large -scale commercial energy storage battery (Megapack) in Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, the National Development and Reform Commission of China has been working hard to solve the problem of overcapacity in the automotive industry, and has always been cautious about approval of new capacity.</p>
<p>Musk said to the US CNBC TV station earlier this month: "Our ability to expand in China has been restricted." He added: "This is not a need for demand."</p>
<p>In the same interview, he also stated that the tension between the United States and China "should be a question that everyone should care about."</p>
<p>Tesla is building a factory in Mexico and is expected to produce a low -cost electric car based on its next -generation platform.</p>

It was discovered that Graham mentioned that "spending the most successful money" was to respond to the support of the United States for cooperation. The original dialogue is as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T13-51-46-04-00/000003.png" />"Russians will die", the following dialogue:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T13-51-46-04-00/000004.png" />Graham responded to the dispute with email Reuters on the 28th, saying that he mentioned to Zeroski that "Ukraine has accepted the US proverbs -either freedom or death. It is a good investment in the United States to help Ukraine from Russia's war criminals. "</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>We cannot prove what kind of motivation of the Sun's editing. However, after the spread and interpretation of the Russian satellite news agency, some netizens, and Chinese official media, Graham praised the United States to assist Ukraine's achievements and connects Russians who died in the Russian and Ukraine War, which may cause misunderstandings.</p>
<p>According to the full film, Graham expressed that "we have never spent such a successful spending money" in response to Zenoski thanked the United States for their assistance. As for the saying "Russians will die", it is to respond to the saying that Zeroski expressed that Ukraine would fight for freedom to the last moment, and the two were not related.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T14-01-00-04-00/000000.png" />Seven Standing Committee Age France-Pressence of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05292023135452.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/Mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx 052920235452.html/@stream</a>In this column's previous article, "Twenty is far from Xi Jinping's considering" successor "for ourselves," the analysis of Dr. Wu Guoguang's article "The Rise of Xi Jinping Youth Guard: Intergenerational Replacement of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China": The average age of the new Politburo members appointed by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was more than five years ago, ten years ago, or even twenty years ... This reflects Xi Jinping's deliberately promoting officials in his tenure and postponed the trend of promoting young officials.</p>
<p>Why is this? Logically explained the so -called "educated youth plot". Xi Jinping, who is "graduated from Liangjiahe University" as the glory of life, has always been in politics, and has always been an educated youth.</p>
<p>In late December 2020, the author published the "Great praise of the" uphill and down the countryside "campaign in this column? "And" Negotiation of the Mountains and Going to the Countryside is to Realize the Grand -generation CCP leaders led by Xi Jinping ". The article introduces the" Xi Jinping as the leader of the leader of the leader of the leader of the leader of the leader of the leader of the country called Wang Chengxin in 2015. "The biggest achievement", the article claims that if Chairman Mao did not let the city's knowledge youth go to the countryside to receive re -education, (Xi Jinping) The four of them will not be able to enter the Politburo of the Central Committee at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China to become the Standing Committee of the Politburo. The Standing Committee will be some other people, and the history of China will be rewritten.</p>
<p>Wang Chengxin's four "educated youths" of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Eighteenth Central Committee at the time refers to Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Zhang Dejiang, and Wang Qishan.</p>
<p>After the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 2017, the new seventh Politburo Standing Committee member of the new session of the Politburo was still born. Standing Committee member Wang Qishan is also the background of "educated youth" and "workers, peasants and soldiers".</p>
<p>It should be explained here. The author also published the two articles in the previous two articles at the end of 2020, and only a Shanghai elderly who was familiar with Wang Huning in the past recalled that Wang Huning was actually a "educated youth" that experienced the "Shangshan and Township" campaign. In the countryside, a serious illness was obtained within a few days, so he was allowed to "retreat".</p>
<p>The so -called "illness retreat" means "returning to the original city due to illness". The policy at that time clearly stipulated that some major diseases were reasons for the disease, such as tuberculosis, lung, cancer, hypertension, heart disease, pyelonephritis, severe gastric ulcer, gastric perforation, and so on. This was an important educated youth policy at that time, reflecting the humanitarian of the revolutionary revolution of his great leader Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wang Huning is actually the same as Xi Jinping, all of which are "educated youths" and "workers, peasants and soldiers" background.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, when the author was published as the previous article, the author once asserted that two years later, the Communist Party of China was 20 years later. Even if Wang Yang, born in 1955, could not stay in office. Xi Jinping, a representative of "workers, peasants and soldiers", will also be in power for a long time. Therefore, the official drum noise of the CCP ’s official policies on the“ upper mountain and going to the countryside ”will continue.</p>
<p>However, the author did not expect at the time that in the 20th Central Political Bureau Standing Committee, which was generated in October last year, the proportion of "educated youths" in the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 19th Central Committee accounted for a higher proportion. A "educated youth", they are: Xi Jinping, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi and Li Xi. In other words, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee was the "educated youth" background in the 6 50s of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in 1962. Four of them, Xi Jinping, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning and Cai Qi are all workers, peasants and soldiers. Of course, strictly speaking, Wang Huning is regarded as "ill educated youth."</p>
<p>In addition to Wang Huning, which was specially introduced earlier, Xi Jinping's Liangjiahe experience of Xi Jinping in the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee and Tsinghua ’s work, peasants and soldiers did not need to introduce it in detail.</p>
<p>However, as Mr. Song Yongyi, a Cultural Revolution expert quoted in the previous article in this column, said: What is Xi Jinping in the "Cultural Revolution"? Soon after the "Cultural Revolution", Xi Jinping got off his hometown. After he got out of his hometown, he became a rural branch secretary, and soon he was recommended to enter Tsinghua as "workers and peasants". After entering Tsinghua University, it was basically smooth. According to Xi Jinping's level, can you enter Tsinghua? The graduates of the first Bayi school of the "Cultural Revolution" rarely admitted to Tsinghua.</p>
<p>Zhao Leji, born in 1957, was originally a urban household registration in Xining, Qinghai. At the age of 17, he was transferred to the rural household registration of Gongba Brigade, Hedong Township, Guide County, Qinghai Province. The urban hukou of Xining City has become a correspondent of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>In mid -1977, Zhao Leji, as one of the last batch of workers, peasants and soldiers in mainland China, entered the philosophy of philosophy of Peking University. Three years later, he obtained a "university ordinary class" completion certificate.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Youxia, who was born in 1951, was left as a member of the Second Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Military Commission, the outside world felt interest in the "revolutionary friendship" between their parents. As everyone knows, Xi Jinping's political trust in Zhao Leji is also based on the relationship between his father and his parents.</p>
<p>At that time, the Shaanxi People's Education Press published a memoir of the old revolutionary memoirs titled "Looking back at Yan'an", "recorded the friendship between the author and Comrade Xi Zhongxun and the revolutionary deeds of Xi." . At that time, Zhao Ximin, president and editor -in -chief of Shaanxi People's Education Publishing House, was the father of Zhao Leji. He was greeted by Hu Hu Yaobang and returned to his hometown of Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Related memories articles introduced: President Zhao Ximin is also an old comrade. In the early days of New China, he worked at the Northwest People's Revolutionary University built by Xi Zhongxun. He was also the older even of Xi. "</p>
<p>Because it was the general secretary of the time, Hu Yaobang greeted himself, so the then Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee Liang Buting did not dare to neglect. He was a feast for Zhao Le Jimin's father, Zhao Ximin. Zhao Ximin's party and government members of Qinghai Province and Xining City, who were almost all present, "asked" to take care of the eldest son Zhao Leji who stayed in Qinghai voluntarily on the spot. Since then, Zhao Leji Guan Yuntong was the youngest governor of the country.</p>
<p>Two years ago, two years ago, I have published in this column "Xi Jinping has the most possibility of Zhao Leji with the town party plot, but also the friendship of his father" and "Zhao Leji Twenty to accompany Xi Jinping." Interested readers and listeners can refer to it.</p>
<p>After talking about Zhao Leji, Cai Qi, born in 1955. He was canceled in the urban household registration of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province in 1973, and became an educated youth of the Western Commune of Yongan County, Fujian Province. In 1975, while he entered Tsinghua University with Xi Jinping, Cai Qi also became a glorious student, peasant, and soldiers, and entered the Department of Political and Education of Fujian University. Three years later, he stayed as a staff member of the school party committee office.In the few years when Xi Jinping used the deputy secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and the full -time deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Cai Qi, one of the deputy directors of the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee, was clearly "served Comrade Kochi". Then, whether it is a prefecture -level party committee secretary or the recommendation of becoming a cross -provincial exchange cadre from the Central Organization Department, Xi Jinping is arranged and designed by Cai Qi. This is why Xi Jinping first thought of Tsai Qi to himself after the establishment of the National Security Council. reason.</p>
<p>Li Xi, born in 1956, was originally a native of Guan Town, two counties in Gansu Province, and his father was a cadre of the county party committee. In 1975, Li Xi's city hukou was canceled and became the educated youth of the Yunping Commune that belonged to the county. However, like Zhao Leji introduced earlier, Li Xi of that year was also arranged for "recruiting" by his father. Rural life only resumed urban hukou after less than one year, becoming a cadre of the two county literature and education bureaus. In 1978, he took the college entrance examination and was admitted to the Chinese Department of Gansu Normal University.</p>
<p>As for Li Qiang, the difference between the five former "going to the countryside" is that he was born in "back to the educated youth".</p>
<p>Only the Chinese talents who lived in that era were clear. The so -called "educated youth" of that year, that is, the so -called "knowledge youth" actually had two categories. The main category is that Xi Jinping was forced to relocate the city's hukou to the rural areas, "the educated youth", and the secondary category is the so -called "back home educated youth". After the education of middle school education, he returned to his hometown of "farming". The latter is also called "returning to the educated youth".</p>
<p>Like Li Qiang's "Return to Hometown Educated Youth", Huang Kunming, who has been re -elected as a member of the Politburo of the Politburo, and Liu Jinguo, the Secretary of the Central Secretary and the first deputy secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. Among them, Huang Kunming returned to the countryside for one year after graduating from junior high school and was recruited. After retiring the country, he returned to the countryside to continue his farming until he took the college entrance examination. Liu Jinguo was promoted to brigade cadres in less than a year after graduating from junior high school in the county middle school. At that time, the brigade cadres were "scored in work", and of course they were still rural hukou. However, after a long time, the cadres of the Liu Jinguo brigade were given a "recruitment" indicator by the commune where the hometown was located. From then on, the household registration was changed and "supplying food".</p>
<p>As for the degree, Liu Jinguo is not even a student, peasants, and soldiers. In his public resume, he only said that he "did not get out of production" at the provincial party school after he became a grass -roots cadre.</p>
<p>In other words, although Xi Jinping is one -third of the time when workers and farmers are students, they are political learning and participating in political movements. One -third of time is labor exercise. I still experienced a period of university, and it is also the campus life of Tsinghua University with a well -known Tsinghua University. And Liu Jinguo, the Standing Committee of the Politburo and the vice chairman of this year, or Han Zheng, has not experienced the half -day college campus life. Han Zheng's "college degree" and "graduate degree" were obtained through the so -called "on -the -job study". During the period of the governor of Fujian, Xi Jinping was awarded the same way to a lecture tape from the two "mentors" to him by listening to the two "mentors" to him.</p>
<p>In addition to the six "educated youths" of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, there are also two "returning educated youths" Huang Kun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Political Bureau of the Central Political Bureau and the Secretary of the Secretary Office of the Central Political Bureau that have been introduced by the way, Ming and Liu Jinguo did not count the military representatives who joined the army without graduating from the two middle schools. The 50s of the 20th Politburo members of the 20th Central Committee were almost all born in "educated youth".</p>
<p>Among them, the new Politburo member and secretary of the Secretariat, Shi Taifeng, born in 1956, was a hometown <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E8%A5%BF%E7%9C%81">Shanxi Province</a><a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A6%86%E7%A4%BE%E5%8E%BF">Yushe County</a>The urban household registration, in 1974, cut into the countryside in Dazhai Commune in the county, and successfully passed the college entrance examination in 1978.</p>
<p>The new member of the Politburo, Wang Yi, born in 1953, was originally the same as Xi Jinping, as Xi Jinping, and went to the countryside one year later than Xi Jinping. The factory that was recruited into the post and telecommunications department was re -obtained by the city's hukou. After restoring the college entrance examination, Wang Yi entered Beijing Erwa.</p>
<p>Li Hongzhong, who was already a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, was born in 1956. At the age of 19, he was canceled the city's residence and became an educated youth in front of the Yaoqian Commune in Sujiatun District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province. Like Li Keqiang's experience, he has joined the party and became a brigade cadre before participating in the college entrance examination.</p>
<p>The new member of the Politburo, He Lifeng, born in February 1955, was canceled the city residence at the age of 18 to <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A6%8F%E5%BB%BA%E7%9C%81">Fujian Province</a><a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B8%E5%AE%9A%E5%8C%BA_(%A%in%, p. A%brother,%, a%brother, a few%of%, small%.">Yongding County</a>)Lixin <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E9%9D%92%E5%B9%B4">educated youth</a>Start in line. In 1978, he was accepted by Xiamen University in the college entrance examination.</p>
<p>In summary, in the latest Central Political Bureau and its Standing Committee, which was generated in October last year, several old "educated youths" of the Politburo members were still obtained by their college entrance examinations and entered the full -time university after they entered the full -time university after their results were obtained. of. Among the 6 old "educated youths" of the 7 Standing Committee of the Politburo, 4 students of workers, peasants and soldiers accounted for 4.</p>
<p>More than 4 years ago, the author published the article "Baidu Encyclopedia to modify the" Council of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers "for Xi Jinping" in this column. However, even in the revised entries, the following section of derogation is still retained: the identity of "workers, peasants and soldiers", is still in the hearts of some people, leaving them to be unbearable. "<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BF%83%E7%BB%93/18659?fromModule=lemma_inlink">Heart knot</a>Essence The hat of the University of Gong, Peasant and soldiers still leaves a shadow in her heart. In the selection of cadres in that year, there are many places <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%90%E5%88%B6%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8/19125990?fromModule=lemma_inlink">restricted use</a>Provisions.</p>
<p>More than four years ago, I published in this column "Xi Jinping's Tsinghua Institute of Technology, Peasant, Peasant and soldiers represented by Deng Xiaoping was reprimanded as the product of" Tsinghua Elementary School "by Deng Xiaoping. When the personnel discussed the resumption of the college entrance examination, the person in charge of the party committee of Tsinghua University said anxiously that the cultural quality of the students in Tsinghua's students now is too poor. Many students only have the level of primary schools and have to tutor the middle school courses. Deng Xiaoping interjected: "Then it is simply called‘ Tsinghua Middle School ’,‘ Tsinghua Elementary School ’. What is the university?In fact, the content of the head of Tsinghua University reported to Deng Xiaoping at the time was not the most exaggerated. The most exaggerated is that the workers, peasants and soldiers who entered colleges and universities across the country with Xi Jinping had less than 20 % of high school culture. After entering the school, they used the "tuition culture class" as the main learning content. The "cultural courses" mentioned here refers to the basic Chinese and mathematical knowledge that normal college students must master. That is, in Tsinghua University where Xi Jinping is located, there was an old professor who had to give the workers, peasants and soldiers to the junior high school physics class that year. time.</p>
<p>It can be seen that strictly speaking, to be precise, Xi Jinping's real education of that year was the "Tsinghua Primary School" in Deng Xiaoping's mouth. At best, he graduated from "Tsinghua Middle School".(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

The invasion of Ukraine in Moscow caused the former Soviet Union to join the Republic of Central Asia. Because Ukraine was also the former Soviet Union's joining the Republic, the five Central Asia countries could inevitably feel cold lips, and Russia's political litigation in Central Asia became a hidden concern.</p>
<p>The Presidential Palace of Gilgis said today: "The second summit of the Central Asian leader and the EU Council President will be held on June 2 in Cholpon-ATa, Kyrgyz."</p>
<p>The spokesman for Michelle told AFP: "(Summit) the first focus is to deepen the relationship between Central Asia and the European Union."</p>
<p>Gilgis and Kazakh leaders said they would attend the summit. The leaders of Uzbek, Tajik, and Turkmen are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Michelle visited Kazakhstan last October and attended a similar summit.</p>
<p>The time of Michelle's visit coincided with the two weeks after the leaders of the five countries in Central Asia and China held unprecedented summit.</p>
<p>Beijing incorporates Central Asia into a large -scale economic and infrastructure plan "Belt and Road" initiative.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan, and US Secretary of State Antonyblinken also visited Central Asia in recent months.</p>
<p>Russia is still the power of Central Asia; China has gradually strengthened its local influence.</p>
<p>Turkey, the United States and the European Union are currently actively promoting relations with Central Asia; India and Iran have also strengthened their local diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The working group sent by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United Nations, arrived in Tokyo on Monday (May 29). It is expected that Japan will be reviewed before the discharge of diluted nuclear sewage. According to a statement issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency on May 26, the experts of the working group will review the wastewater treatment plan of the Fukushima nuclear power plant with international security standards to prevent humans and the environment threatened by harmful nuclear radiation substances.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic and Industry of Japan said that the group members include experts from 11 countries.

<p>Japanese officials said that these water will be processed to the level that can be legally released, and it will be diluted with a large amount of seawater. They added that these water will gradually be released through a submarine pipeline within decades, causing them to be harmless to humans and marine creatures.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-29T14-04-00Z/60770982_401.jpg" />The International Atomic Energy Agency Working Group also visited Japan last February to discuss the issue of wastewater with Japanese officials (information photos)</p>
<p>In 2022, the International Atomic Energy Agency had sent people many times to Japan for investigation. According to the institutional statement, there have been five reports related to the wastewater discharge plan, including "technology" and "supervision". Safety review work.</p>
<p>Next, after the Japanese nuclear regulatory agency conducts a safety inspection of newly built drainage facilities, and the International Atomic Energy Institution is expected to propose a final report at the end of June this year, Japan is expected to start the processing nuclear waste water in the sea within a few months.</p>
<h3>Oppose sound waves</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本拟排福岛核废水入海-渔民强烈反弹/a-57155816">However, the plan has been strongly opposed by Fishermen from Fukushima, and they are worried about potential health hazards and affected livelihood. </a>South Korea, China, and Pacific Island countries have all raised questioning of nuclear waste water that may affect health.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese authorities seek the help of international atomic energy agencies to ensure that its emissions process meets international security standards and expect to obtain understanding of other countries. The Japanese government has strengthened publicity activities at the Japanese media and food exhibitions to promote the security of Fukushima seafood products. At the same time, it provides regular briefings to foreign governments including members of the South Korea and Pacific Island Forum.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Chinese representative said at the World Health Conference (WHA) on May 27: It resolutely oppose Japan's unilateral decision to discharge Fukushima nuclear pollution water into the ocean. According to Chinese representatives, the coast of Fukushima has the strongest ocean flow in the world. After 10 years of nuclear pollution water, the radioactive nucleoin will spread to the global waters. Chinese representatives also emphasized that before negotiating with all parties, the Japanese party must not start nuclear pollution water to discharge the sea without authorization.</p>
<h3>500 wastewater of the Olympic pool</h3>
<p>At present, nearly 1.3 million tons of polluting water stored in the water tank of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is water used to cool the core of the reactor after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. The total amount is sufficient to fill the standard swimming pool of about 500 Olympic Games, and the annual maintenance cost will cost about 100 billion yen. Moreover, the current storage space is almost left. Japanese officials said that it is necessary to remove the water currently stored in the water tank to prevent unexpected leaks that may occur when another disaster occurred in the future.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</p>

<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly recovered. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."</p>

<p>The radiation test standards cited by the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation and the Tokyo government are stricter than other countries that are also discharged.

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns. He said that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation announced that the emission of polluting water was "unfortunate" for the fisheries that have just recovered in the region.</p>

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can." He said in an interview with Reuters and asked, "Why do you put water to the waters of Fukushima, why not put water to Tokyo or Osaka?" He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p>In the British and Hong Kong people, "Kongtinue", "HONGKONGERS in Britain (HKB), and" Yangcun 2.0 "team originally scheduled to be in the GUILDFORD BAPTISTCHURCH in the southern England on Monday (29th). The "Yangcun Defense War -Education Education Day Camp" was held. The organizer suddenly announced the cancellation of the lease by the venue two days before the event. Because it was unable to find a replacement venue in time, it was decided to cancel the event.</p>
<p>** The British Church emphasizes that groups are composed of different nationalities.</p>
<p>The organizer later explained that the Overseas Blessing Baptist Hall, which originally agreed to rent the venue, was canceled on the grounds that the new employees did not know the public holiday and the church were not open on the day. It is related to the nature of activity. The church stated in the letter that they did not realize that the event was related to the "Yangcun Day Camp" at the beginning. Based on the church group "composed of different nationalities", and learned the potential problems of "Yangcun picture book", anxiety would affect the group's impact on the group , Decided to cancel the scene.</p>
<p>Zheng Jialang, the founder and person in charge of Kongtinue, told this station that the original plan was to use the "Yangcun" story as the background to educate the social influence of children's injustice on personal life, emphasizing that activities meet the basic value of the UK; and the activities of the United Kingdom; and the basic value of the British; and The "Hong Kong Half -year Report" released by the British Foreign Minister also paid attention to the "Yangcun Case". The venue. So frankly, the church or different venues will really be affected by China. We are worried about the incident. "</p>
<p>He believes that this makes Hong Kong people unable to hold activities freely even if they arrive in the UK, calling on the British government to pay attention.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T14-25-00-04-00/000002.png" />Hong Kong people group posted an explanation for the British church to cancel the scene (screenshot of Facebook) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/al-05292023140315.html/capture.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T14-25-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Former Hong Kong Chief Executive Liang Zhenying has publicly attacked </strong></p>
<p>The Hong Kong Word Therapist Federation of Trade Unions published the "Yangcun Series" children's picture book with the background of the background of the central movement. Five members of the trade union were charged with "publishing, distribution, distribution, display or replication of incitement publications", and He was sentenced to 19 months. Later, the overseas "Yangcun 2.0" team re -uploaded the e -book of the "Yangcun Series" and made sound books. "Orthodox alarm" asked the British police to investigate.</p>
<p>Zheng Jialang believes that the venue of this event was canceled, and the attack with Liang Zhenying had an inevitable relationship: "Although he has stepped down as the Chief Executive, he still has another hat, which is the vice chairman of the Chinese CPPCC, so he is also a senior official of the Communist Party of China, that is, the senior management of the Communist Party of China, that is, the senior management of the Communist Party of China, that is, the Communist Party of China, that is, the senior management of the Communist Party of China.

<p><strong> Hong Kong people organize worrying that the British local machine constitutes a cross -border suppression of the CCP </strong></p>
<p>Zheng Wenjie, the founder of the British Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Association, emphasized that this time it was not a single incident. In the past, many Hong Kong people's groups repeatedly encountered walls when they were looking for event venues in the UK. The crafts are asked to be removed in the British market. The British institutions involved are not limited to churches, including schools, charitable organizations and government venues.</p>
<p>He did not think that the relevant British local institutions were sold by the Chinese Communist Party, but had misunderstandings about Hong Kong people's activities. They were worried that they would cause controversy and stimulate some people. He believes that it is necessary to make good views, so that the British government, local institutions, and the public understand that Hong Kong people also protect the British itself's freedom and democracy and the values of peace and common integration: "Britain is a free and democratic system, we can have different opinions This is common sense. Why do we suddenly regard it as a political position and avoid it? And this evasion attitude will only be used by the CCP's abroad or pro -government. , Causing hatred or inciting confrontation, the whole risk of the totalitarian dictatorship. "</p>
<p>According to this website, the Orthodox Baptist Church has provided venues in the past for non -governmental organization "Hong Kongwatch" to organize activities. Investigating the social network posts, the church has also held activities to support Ukraine and pray for Pakistan's political persecution, so it is not completely "avoiding politics." Is this church temporarily decided to cancel the "Yangcun" event venue. Does it receive a complaint from "different nationalities" or threatened? This station has understood that it has not been responded before the deadline.The three events organized the organization of the organizational organization on Sunday evening (28th). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=287010667219535&amp;set=a.184366940817242">Joint Statement</a>The review of human rights and civil education activities extended from Hong Kong to Britain, and I was shocked and regretted, and was worried about the local institutions of Britain or inadvertently "acquiescence and indulgence of cross -border suppression".

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-29T17-28-56-04-00/000000.png" />Global Television Networks of China Global Television Cyber Reuters Pictures of China Grand Promotional Mission</p>
<p>Recently, two polls about China, one is a survey by the University of Alberta, Canada. @CGTNOFFICICICIA has launched a vote on Twitter since May 26. It is a network poll on NATO to set up a contact office in Tokyo. The former is a polls in the controlled environment, and the latter is completely unprepared and the Chinese world "anti -thief" "concentration is made for polls. The result is completely dual days.</p>
<p><strong> One of the Chinese factors: The investigation agency and the recipient are not free status </strong></p>
<p>The public opinion survey of the University of Alberta, Canada collected 2,009 answers from all over China through telephone and the Internet. The interviewees were asked about them. the opinion of.</p>
<p>Among the countries around the world, Russia scores the highest score. It is not only the immigration destination of the respondents, but also the most trusted global partner. The average score is 5.4 points (7 points in the full score). , Canada, the European Union, India and the United Kingdom are 3.8 points. In terms of global influence, Russia only lags behind the United States and defeats all other countries, including the European Union. Interviewees said that Russia is the most important country to China. In handling the new crown epidemic, Russia's interviewees ranked first. one.</p>
<p>Wang Jia, the director of the Chinese Institute of Alberta at the University of Alberta, said that his personal point of view is deeply influenced by the national media. The obvious tilt of Russia shown by polls. Compared with Chinese citizens, it is easier to obtain visas to Russia, and weak rubles also provide strong purchasing power for those who hold RMB.</p>
<p>This result has continuous correlation with the Chinese officials in 2018, 2020, and 2021. Taking 2021 as an example, the China -Russia Friendship, Peace and Development Commission and China Central Radio and Television General Taichung Russia Toutiao Client and Beijing Yipai Data Co., Ltd. commissioned an international sample service agency to conduct investigation in October 2021. : More than 91%of Russian interviewees and more than 98%of Chinese interviewees are confident and expectations for further deepening Sino -Russian relations. 72.6%of Russian interviewees and 87%of Chinese interviewees believe that China and Russia should further strengthen comprehensive strategic collaboration. Interviers interviewees of the two countries generally agree with the cooperation between China and Russia to promote the world's polarization and the democratization of international relations, and 83.3%of Russia interviewees with Russia who are "Sino -Russian cooperation can jointly promote world peace and prosperity". 95.9%.</p>
<p>The survey also shows that for the issue of "some countries in the West interfered in the internal affairs of China and Russia and curb the revitalization of the development of the two countries", 90%of Russian respondents and 95%of Chinese interviewees believed that China and Russia should strengthen Collaborate, work together to resolutely defend their own interests. Most interviewees believe that the development of China and Russia will help promote the world's polarization process.</p>
<p>The survey is obviously far from the real situation. After the start of the Russia -Ukraine War in 2022, a large number of Chinese accounts were almost overwhelmed by Twitter and Facebook. Most Chinese intellectuals supported Ukraine and NATO. Among them, Russia's terms and criticisms were extremely hostile to Russia.</p>
<p><strong> "China -Russia Friendship" poll is the official leading </strong></p>
<p>The CCP has been established for more than a hundred years since 1921. It has gone through three states: Russia as a division, the enemy, and the friend of Russia. In the Mao era alone, I have experienced a fierce transformation of "Soviet Big Brother" into "Soviet Amendment-Soviet Social Imperialism". In the early 21st century-2010, I can barely enter the preheating stage of "friendly", but China The regret that the main theme of the propaganda was still in the dilemma of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the stage of praise for Putin slightly. Until 2012 Xi Jinping's head of the Communist Party of China proposed that China and Russia reshaped special partnerships and entered the strategic "back to the back" At the stage, the topic of "China -Russia Friendship" was officially appeared. After the Crimean crisis in 2014, Russia's double -headed eagle had to be friendly to China under the pressure and hostility of the West. China -Russia relations were regarded as the strategic "back" state of the current hope of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>The Sino -Russian relations polls have done a form of sampling surveys from the procedure. For example, the Sino -Russian relations poll in 2021 were the fourth quarter of the year in China and Russia (China: Beijing, Guangzhou, Harbin; Russia: Moscow: Moscow: Moscow: , St. Petersburg, New Siberia, Vladivostak, Harbarovsk, Irkutzk, Chita, and Blagowskosk), through online sampling surveys of ordinary people of the two countries to analyze Based on the data of the sample, the final investigation report is formed, but this survey from the sample extraction, the problem settings to the analysis. The process is strictly controlled. It reflects the public opinion, which reflects the public opinion that the official wants to see.</p>
<p>Investigations are not the same in areas (or network areas) controlled by the Chinese government, the results will be different. For example, on May 26th, China International TV News Network (@cgtnoffecial) launched a vote in Twitter to ask netizens if they supported NATO's plans to open a liaison office in Japan. "This news was confirmed by NATO and Japanese officials, which caused enthusiasm for the outside world to be enthusiastically. Discussion, China, Russia, North Korea and other countries have accused NATO offending the tentacles to Asia Pacific, threatening regional security. As of 5:17 pm on May 28th, the Eastern Time, the result was:</p>
<p>I Strongly Oppose (I strong opposition), 13.6%</p>
<p>I am in favor of this (I support), 86.4%</p>
<p>Message from the comment area is rich and ridiculed: "Where did the courage to ask foreigners?", "I not only support NATO to set up points in Japan, but also open a office in Taiwan." "Compared to Japan, Taiwan is an ideal place "," NATO should also be opened in Taiwan, killing you in China ". Some people say: How dare you dare to do this poll all the anti -thieves, and take their own humiliation. "</p>
<p>Shortly after I announced the above voting results on Twitter,@CGTNOFFECIAL has deleted the survey, and so far I have not seen the results of this poll on any media.</p>
<p><strong> What are the conclusions </strong>Second, the "Chinese factor" in all polls is more likely to become a propaganda material.</p>
<p>The so -called "Chinese factor" of the so -called polls refers to the various factors related to China, for example: one is a poll that investigates the target of the Chinese people in the Chinese native. For example This is this type of survey; one is a survey of China as the polls, and selects people from some countries in several continents to answer questions related to China. For the investigation of "the people's views on China", in 2016, Americans held a negative evaluation of 55%of China. This proportion in 2022 rose to 82%, which confirmed the changes in Sino -US relations from the side.</p>
<p>In short, the various data that appears in the form of polls is completely different from the reference value. The decisive factor depends on the whether the investigation agency and the investigator are under political control. This is the case controlled by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>A report of the United Nations pointed out that the scale and severity of severe grain unsafe problems in 18 hungry "hotspots" areas covering 18 countries in 22 countries are likely to further deteriorate.</p>
<p>The report on Monday (May 29), on Monday (May 29) of the Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations World Food Program entitled "Hunger: Food and Agriculture Organization and Grain Services Services Services' Severe Food Unsafe and Joint Early Warning". It may also be impacted by extreme climate events.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes that many hot areas are facing increasingly serious hunger crisis, mainly concentrated in Africa, the Middle East and America. Conflict, extreme climate and economic shocks have continued to cause more and more communities to fall into crisis.</p>
<p>McCain, executive officer of the United Nations World Grain Program, said that the number of hungry people and regions continued to increase, and the degree of hunger was more severe than ever. Action must be taken immediately, and inaction will bring catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>The report also warned that the El Nino phenomenon would cause major risks once it appeared. Meteorologists predict that the probability of 82%of the Elnino phenomenon before the middle of 2023. The expectations of the climate model will have a serious impact on several hotspots. For example, the rainfall in the Central America's arid corridor is lower than the average level; concerns about Sahele and Africa's horn areas have been deepened by the impact of extreme climate events.</p>
<p>Economic impact and stress factors have continued to cause severe hunger in almost all hot spots, reflecting the global trend since 2022. Compared with conflicts, economic risks have caused more countries and population to be hungry. The report states that these risks to a large extent with the socio -economic impact brought by the crown disease epidemic and <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/e-wu-zhan-zheng">Ukrainian War</a>The chain reaction is related.</p>
<p>The report predicts that global food prices may still be at a high level compared to historical standards in the next few months, and macroeconomic pressures in medium and low -income countries are difficult to alleviate. This means that the purchasing power has declined, and it will have a negative impact on the grain acquisition of many families in many hot areas in the coming months.</p>

As a result, the PopularParty, the largest conservative party, not only included the most votes in local elections, but also a lot of regional elections. Six areas that were originally governed by the Social Labor Party.</p>
<p>Pedro Sanchez made a TV speech today, saying that he had told the king of Felipevi, he made a decision to dissolve Congress and held a general election on July 23. He said, "In view of the results of yesterday's elections, I made this decision."</p>
<p>Sanjes also said: "As a government and social Labor Party leader, I have to take responsibility for the results of the election. I think it is necessary to respond to let the people's will determine our democratic authorization."</p>
<p>The date on which Sanjes proposed in advance will be that Spanish will take over the European Union (EU) rotating chairman country on July 1.</p>
<p>Sanjes, who came to power in 2018, faced several difficulties during this period, including voters' unsightly, high inflations of voters, and high inflation, and the purchasing power of the people in Spain, Europe's fourth -largest economy in Europe, continued to decline.</p>
<p>In addition, the Social Labor Party and the Tough Left Alliance Party "we can" have repeatedly occurred in crisis, and Sanjes has always been difficult to control relevant impacts.</p>
<p>The People's Party won more than 7 million votes in the Spanish municipal election yesterday, with a voting rate of 31.52%; the Social Labor Party only won nearly 6.3 million votes, with a voting rate of 28.11%.</p>
<p>However, the People's Party may not be in power with the support of the Right -Right Voice Party (VOX). The Folk Sound Party is currently the third largest party in the Spanish Parliament and the winner of the election yesterday. It hopes that in addition to the regional election, it can also become an indispensable partner for the People's Party in the national election.
