<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>When asked about Xi Jinping's response, Biden said, "He is listening and not argued. If everyone noticed, he did not attack Russia."</p>
<p>"So I think we can find a way to solve this problem."</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping held a two -day talks in March this year. The two sides showed each other's friendship and criticized the West at same time. However, there were no signs of diplomatic breakthroughs in Ukraine issues.</p>

<p>The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense said that from the development of air and maritime surveillance, the land -based missile system has been prepared. According to a press release of the Ministry of National Defense, the four Chinese aircraft-two SU-30 fighters, a BZK-005 reconnaissance aircraft, and a Y-8 anti-submarine fighter-cross the midline of the Taiwan Strait and enter the Southwest Air Defense identification zone in Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait midline was once regarded as the de facto line of the two sides, but China said it did not recognize the so -called midline.</p>
<p>China claims that Taiwan is part of its territory. If necessary, it can be annexed force, and the Air Force and the Navy are sent to perform so -called tasks around Taiwan almost every day to try to weaken Taiwan's defense capabilities and intimidate 23 million people in Taiwan.

<p>The civil defense unit of Peinpocha stated that the deceased includes men, women and children, aged 5 to 45. Three of them were rescued, namely a 65 -year -old woman and two teenagers; the authorities did not provide information about their current situation.</p>
<p>The authorities said that the building of this three -story building belongs to a large residential community and has been closed in 2010 due to the risk of collapse, but has been illegally occupied since then. In April of this year, Olinda, which is also located in Bonobo, also collapsed, and 6 people were killed.</p>
<p>The collapse of Brazilian buildings often occurs in poor communities in illegal buildings. In 2020, two illegal buildings in a poor community in Rio de Janeiro collapsed after a day of rain, causing 24 people to be killed. (Translator: Ji Jinling)</p>

Nitaniah led LIKUD and extremely right-handed party last year to form an alliance with the Ultra-Orthodox party. After the election, he returned to the pot and became the most right-wing government leader in Israeli history.</p>
<p>The Israeli parliament will vote on an important proposal of the Division on the 10th. Today's protest in Tel Aviv is the 27th of the government's announcement in January, and the media estimates that it will attract 150,000 people to participate.</p>
<p>The police did not disclose the number of people participating in the demonstration.</p>
<p>Historian, Yuval Noah Harari, said in the rally: "We must take action to protest what the Nitania government has done to our country and Israel's dream."</p>
<p>He said, "If the government of the Nitana Hu will not stop, they will soon know the consequences of the people's anger."</p>
<p>This judicial reform will give politicians higher than the court's power, and the government of the Nitaniah advocates that it is necessary to ensure better power balance.</p>
<p>Nitaniah announced at the end of March that the legislative procedure of "temporarily slowing down" was negotiated with the opposition, but after many negotiations failed, the government once again adopted the offensive.</p>
<p>The Israeli Congress is expected to read a proposal in a reform plan on the 10th. The purpose of this proposal is to restrict the judicial department's right to decide the government's "rationality".</p>
<p>One of the potential impacts will be a ministerial personnel case. For example, under the intervention of the Supreme Court this year, Nitana Hu Hu had to open Aryehderi, a member of the Cabinet of Crime, but Nitana Hu said at the time that he would find "all legal tools", In the future, Dai Rui's public office will be kept in the future.</p>
<p>The organizer has announced that there will be protests on the 11th.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) on Tuesday (July 4), <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/福岛废水排海iaea评估为安全-中国反对/a-66111067">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>(IAEA) finally approved a plan to arrange more than 1.2 million tons of Fukushima's first nuclear power plant in Tokyo, saying that its processing method was "consistent" in accordance with international security standards. International Atomic Energy Agency <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/路透社iaea总干事暗示福岛报告专家组内部存在意见分歧/a-66153690">Report Conclusion</a>It is believed that the "radioactive effects of emission water can be ignored."</p>
<p>The Japanese government and TEPCO, a nuclear power plant operator in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, welcomed the recognition of international atomic energy agencies.</p>
<p>Although most Japanese people seem to think that almost all radioactive substances in sewage have been cleared, it is the most suitable action plan to discharge it to the Pacific Ocean, but many people still expressed their objections, especially in Japan's neighbors.</p>
<p>The South Korean opposition party joint Democratic Party held a protest on Congress on Thursday (July 6), and plans to hold an assembly outside the parliament building on Saturday.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T07-21-00Z/64969608_401.png" />Japan's plan is to remove most of the radioactive nuclein in the sewage with ALPS (advanced liquid treatment system) and discharge it into the ocean after dilution.</p>
<h3>Opposition from China</h3>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, emphasized at a press conference on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国海关宣布禁止进口日本福岛等地食品/a-66142401">Beijing's opposition to the plan</a>It is said that "the nuclear pollution water generated by nuclear accidents is discharged to the sea, and this approach has no precedent since the use of nuclear energy in humans."</p>
<p>China has prohibited seafood from 10 counties (including Fukushima Prefecture and Capital Tokyo) from 47 counties in Japan since 2011, and prohibit all food and feed from 9 counties from 9 counties. Do radioactive testing.</p>
<p>He said: "What actions China will take in the next stage and how to take action depends on the progress of the Japanese emissions plan."</p>
<h3>environmentalist protest</h3>
<p>Environmental protection organizations also publicly opposed the plan. On Wednesday, the protesters in Seoul demanded that the international atomic energy agency withdraws from the report that supports the Japanese government plan, and the Green Peace Organization has accused Tokyo of violating the United Nations Convention on the Marine Law.</p>
<p>Hajimematsukubo, the secretary -general of the Tokyo Citizenship Information Center, also expressed concerns about the drainage plan, and said that there are many feasible alternative to the operator of the Fukushima damaged nuclear power plant (TEPCO) of Fukushima's damaged nuclear power plant (TEPCO) solution.</p>
<p>He told Germany: "We strongly oppose this decision and believe that the government has many better choices." He added: "There is no reason to build more water storage tanks at the scene, and we can also build an underground reservoir. You can also introduce a better processing system to remove more radioactive nucleo. "</p>
<p>"On the contrary, they chose the simplest and cheapest solutions." He said, "I think the plan has always been, because discharging water into the sea is always lower than other alternatives."</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly rose. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."</p>

<h3>Place of cooling water</h3>
<p>The damaged Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station scene at the scene of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is the focus of controversy. According to the authorities, these water storage tanks must be removed before rebuilding. These water is mainly used for cooling reactors after the disaster.</p>

<h3>cooling water is safe?</h3>
<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns. He said that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation announced that the emission of polluting water was "unfortunate" for the fisheries that have just recovered in the region.</p>

<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry with Tokyo Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can." He said in an interview with Reuters and asked, "Why do you put water in the waters of Fukushima, why not put water to Tokyo or Osaka?" He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<h3>International Atomic Energy Agency</h3>
<p>Matsuya said that the Japanese government is using the support expressed by international atomic agencies to promote drainage work, and it will almost be discharged before the end of summer, although there is no clear final retirement roadmap at the nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>"Tokyo Power has been saying that drainage is important for the entire retirement plan, but there is no detailed timetable for the power station to stabilize and retire. So why is it necessary to do this?" He asked.</p>
<p>Songjiu Bao also questioned the independence of the International atomic Energy Agency and pointed out that the agency was funded by nuclear power producers, and its main task was to promote the development of atomic energy. He added that in view of the failure of the Japanese nuclear development department, especially the failure of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, people must also question the accuracy of the information provided by the Tokyo Power and the Japanese government.</p>
<p>He said: "The government said that the ALPS (advanced liquid treatment system) is removing different radioactive nuclein from the water, diluted it, and discharged it into the ocean. But these water has not been independently tested, so how can we determine it?"</p>
<p>A report released by Tokyo Electric Power Corporation in early June shows that even after the ALPS system processing, more than 70%of the water to be discharged does not meet the legal standards of radiation purification. The company claims that the sewage will go through the purification process until the required standards to reduce people's concerns.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after 12 years after the nuclear disaster after the Soviet Chel Nobel accident, the Japanese people hope that sewage discharge can become a sign of the long -lasting retirement process of the nuclear power plant -it is expected that this retirement process will take at least 40 years And need to securely collect and remove nuclear fuel technology, and these technologies have not been developed.</p>
<h3>Opposition of locals</h3>
<p>Hiromi Murakami, a professor of politics at the Tokyo Campus of Tiantu University, said: "Locals and fishermen in northeast Japan have always opposed the plan because they expect this to seriously affect their business and lifestyle; The feeling of people is that they have the ability to deal with wastewater, and there are no better choices.</p>
<p>She pointed out that in order to gain public trust, Tokyo Power still has a lot of work to do. She said: "The close contact between Japanese politics and business circles will always be questioned, but this is what we are facing now. We can only expect that this is indeed the best action plan."</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>Hiroshima atomic bomb more than 500 times</h3>
<p>The Fukushima nuclear crisis caused by the "March 11" earthquake tsunami 6 years ago brought the biggest disaster to Japan, a country that had to rely on nuclear energy to enter the new century. The three reactor pile cores in the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station were melted, and the four reactors exploded. Before the tragedy, many people thought that such nuclear disasters would not happen in Japan. The radioactive substances emitted in the accident are 500 times more than similar substances released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb.</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>chronic death</h3>
<p>Disaster brings serious consequences. The tsunami itself caused nearly 19,000 people to be killed or disappeared. Due to radiation pollution due to nuclear leaks, more than 100,000 residents in the disaster area of Fukushima Nuclear Power Station were forced to leave their homes. As for the number of deaths in the Fukushima nuclear disaster, there are different claims. Some say 15 people, some say that the number of people is more, but because many cancer patients may die in the next few years, the number of victims will likely rise to rise. To thousands of.</p>

<h3>Silent for a minute</h3>
<p>On Saturday (March 11, 2017), the 6th anniversary of the outbreak of Fukushima Nuclear was coming. Tokyo in Japan and the Northeast of the accident will be held in a series of condolences. At 14:46 pm local time, many Japanese people will mourn for the dead for a minute of disaster 6 years ago.</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>Heavy home</h3>
<p>The Fukushima Nuclear accident led 160,000 people to be displaced by forced evacuation. Today, six years later, tens of thousands of people still live in temporary homes. A report released by the Green Peace Organization in February this year pointed out that although the radiation index of the "IITE) of the" Ghost Village "(IITE) near the Fukushima nuclear disaster still exceeds international standards, the residents of evacuated residents were still forced to return to their homes.#</p>
<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>Unbearable loss</h3>
<p>The disaster also brought huge economic losses. The Japanese government claims that the direct economic loss caused by Fukushima Nuclear is about 177 billion euros. The impact and losses caused by radiation on countries in the surrounding areas cannot be accurately estimated.</p>

<h3>Two major cores</h3>
<p>After human beings entered the era of atomic energy, two catastrophic nuclear accidents occurred. The most serious is the nuclear power plant accident that occurred in the former Soviet Union in 1986. The second is the nuclear disaster in Fukushima in Japan in 2011. Two The second is level seven and belongs to "catastrophic accidents".</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>radioactive garbage</h3>
<p>The Fukushima Nuclear Power Station operating Fang Tokyo Electric Power Company was severely criticized after the nuclear disaster in 2011 due to poor crisis treatment. The company is now accused of continuing to cover up the degree of nuclear disaster and has not led the truth to the public and the market. A temporary storage place in Fukushima is filled with plastic bags equipped with radioactive garbage. This is the testimony of the disaster six years ago. The operator Tokyo Electric Power Company later acknowledged that he did not fully prepare for natural disasters. In July 2012, the company was nationalized to avoid the threat of bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>to increase the risk of cancer?</h3>
<p>Doctors perform thyroid examinations on children. How long is the long -term risk of nuclear accidents on people's health? According to the predictions of the World Health Organization, the risk of cancer in polluting residents has only increased slightly. A international medical organization predicts that it is because radioactive substance leaks to the external environment, and an additional 80,000 cancer risk is increased.</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>Clean up and continue</h3>
<p>According to the estimation of Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, it takes at least 30 to 40 years to complete the safety of the nuclear power plant. The company's 1,200 employees and about 7,000 workers from Xie Capital Company cleaned the ruins of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station every day.</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>Disaster after nuclear difficulty</h3>
<p>In the nuclear accident area, hundreds of thousands of tons of water have been contaminated by nuclear radiation in the water storage tank. These sewage will be used for cooling after treatment. The problem is that groundwater emerges in the factory area every day, mixed with cooling sewage. The water storage tank collecting radiation sewage also constantly occurs: most of the water storage tanks are composed of steel plates, and cracks are often found. It is speculated that radiation sewage flows into the sewer and enters the sea. In August 2013, people learned that 300 tons of radiation sewage leaked and flowed into the sea in large quantities. This is the worst accident after the melting of the pile core.</p>

<h4>6 -year sacrifice</h4>
<h3>learn from mistakes?</h3>
<p>The Fukushima nuclear crisis caused by the "3.11" earthquake tsunami has changed the attitude of many countries in the world to the use of nuclear power. Like Germany, some countries have planned to withdraw from nuclear power, but at the same time, other countries are not moved by Japan's nuclear disasters and adhere to the development of nuclear power, including the United States, China, the United Kingdom and other countries. Shortly before the arrival of the Fukushima Nuclear Nuclear Difficulties this year, the Democratic Progressive Party of Japan passed the "Zero Nuclear Power Basic Act" preparing to submit to Congress.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66123913/62703272"> <img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T07-38-00Z/62703272_303.png" /></a>Is such a scene increasingly rare in China? Studies have shown that more and more people choose to postpone marriage.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese), for a 29 -year -old teacher in Shanxi Province, northern China, marriage is not the first choice.</p>
<p>Although her parents insisted on arranging a blind date for her in the past three years, Jingyi is still single, and she does not feel that she is urgent to find a marriage object.</p>
<p>She told Germany's voice: "Marriage is about freedom. Not everyone needs to get married as soon as possible."</p>
<p>It's not that Jingyi has this idea alone. According to a report released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in June, after the number of marriages in the country declined for 8 consecutive years, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/去年中国结婚登记人数创下37年来新低/a-65888380">the lowest level in 37 years</a>Essence Only 6.83 million newcomers were registered to get married last year.</p>
<p>According to the latest Chinese population census, the average age of first marriage in China in 2020 was 28.6 years, nearly four years older than 2010.</p>
<h3>Marriage de -institutionalization</h3>
<p>In China, more and more young people, especially post -90s and post -00 women, have become more and more indifferent to the society of early marriage. They have received more education and are more likely to be economical. Therefore, it is unlikely that marriage is regarded as a specification or a security model.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second and third -child policy implemented by China is not friendly to women, and China's labor legislation is not sound to protect the women's fertility power and the equal competitive power of the labor market. This is a huge opportunity cost for women.</p>
<p>In addition, in the current economic environment, the post -90s and 00s are facing "degree inflation". Sometimes they must accept some large -scale job opportunities, resulting in no enough income to support real estate purchase.</p>
<p>There are all factors that are no wonder that young people resist marriage. This may also be the first time in China to have a chance to institutionalize marriage. Marriage has become a bit institutional- "Everyone accepts marriage" has always been a normal existence. But now it is indeed a watershed that allows marriage to institutionalize.</p>
<h3>Why are Chinese women particularly resisting to get married?</h3>
<p>A woman with a pseudo -Christa said in an interview with Voice of Germany that "marriage is not necessary."</p>
<p>Krisa is 25 years old and serves as a project manager in a manufacturing company in China. She added: "I believe marriage will affect my personal achievements, especially my career."</p>
<p>Liu Ye, a senior lecturer in the Chinese Institute of London, told the Voice of Germany that gender inequality is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese workplace, including discriminatory gender quotas and females according to the possibility of pregnancy and maternity demand for maternity and leave. Candidates conduct a screening and evaluation.</p>
<p>This has caused many young women to be forced to make choices between career and settlement.</p>
<p>Ye said: "The longer women receive education, the age of their marriage and childbirth will naturally be postponed."</p>
<h3>Anti -marriage is a silent revolution</h3>
<p>This is entirely possible to resist whether marriage will have an impact on Beijing's rule, Ye said that over time. Encouraging people to get married have actually surpassed the social issues itself, and become a political project with the purpose of maintaining and continuing the leading patriarchal society of men.</p>
<p>A patriarchal society not only controls its citizens, but also controls their life options and opportunities. So resisting marriage is almost like a silent revolution.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T07-38-00Z/63515858_401.png" />In 2023, China's youth unemployment rate(Age between 16 and 24 years old)A record of 20.8%.</p>
<h3>Chinese young people are facing economic pressure</h3>
<p>China's recent economic decline has also led young people to lack interest in marriage.</p>
<p>In 2023, China's youth unemployment rate(Age between 16 and 24 years old)A record of 20.8%.</p>
<p>A Chinese woman who was a shan Shan told Germany that it was difficult to make a living in the current employment market. The pressure to find a job made her have no energy to consider marriage.</p>
<p>Similarly, a software engineer who was a pseudonym XIAOGANG also told the Voice of Germany that the large -scale layoffs of the technology industry forced him to work often because he was worried about being fired. "When my friend invited me to go out with the girl, I didn't have any energy at all," he said.</p>
<h3>Ferry population problem</h3>
<p>As more and more young people are unwilling to get married, China's birth rate continues to decline.</p>
<p>According to the data of the Human Rights Observation Organization, China's total fertility rate dropped from 2.6 children in each female in the late 1980s to 1.15 children in 2021.</p>
<p>In addition, last year was the first time in China that has declined in population in the past 60 years.</p>
<p>TEXAS A &amp; M University Honorary Professor of Sociology, Dedeli Batonon(DudleyPoston)Said: "China is caught in a serious population crisis ... becoming an aging country with a population."</p>
<p>He added that the current age of China's population is 38 years old. Earlier this year, the United Nations predicts that India will surpass China and become the country with the largest population in the world. The average age of India is 28 years old.</p>
<p>In May this year, the China Family Planning Association launched a pilot project in more than 20 cities to provide housing, tax and education subsidies for families with two or more children.</p>
<p>However, the government's efforts were generally ridiculed on social media, and few young people thought that these projects could help them.</p>
<p>"I think this is ridiculous. Many young people like me are facing difficulties in finding a job. When a person can't take care of himself economically, what to set up a family?"</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T07-38-00Z/49578339_401.png" />Can China rely on international immigrants to increase their working age?</p>
<h3>Where is the way out?</h3>
<p>Person believes that the implementation of a three -child policy is not a solution to the problem, but to solve this problem through international immigrants. For decades, the United States and many European countries have relied on international immigrants to increase their labor age. China is rarely born in foreign residents. China has only about 1 million foreign residents, accounting for only about 0.1%of China's population.</p>
<p>In contrast, the United States is 15%and Germany is 19%. Even the proportion of foreign -born population in Japan and South Korea is higher, Japan is 2%and South Korea is 3%. China has done little in attracting foreign immigrants, and China must change its immigration policy.International immigrants may be the only way for China to solve serious population problems. The Chinese Communist Party may help real Bevoelkerungswachstum this goal by changing its concept of racial purity.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) International Commercial Consulting ALIXPARTNERS said on Wednesday (July 5) that due to the continuous increase in the leading position in the field of electric vehicles, Chinese domestic brands will occupy 50 auto sales of Chinese markets in 2023 in 2023. More than %, this will be the first time that domestic brands control China's largest car market in the world.</p>
<p>In the past 40 years, the Chinese market has been led by joint venture brands such as Volkswagen and Toyota. But competitive prices, faster model updates, and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/比亚迪欲在德国市场加速扩张/a-65948560">BYD</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/蔚来扩展欧洲业务-匈牙利工厂9月投入运营/a-62674025">Weilai</a>The rise of domestic electric vehicle manufacturers such as cars and Xiaopeng Automobile has changed the status quo of the Chinese automobile market. In the first quarter of this year, China surpassed Japan and became the world's largest car exporter.</p>
<p>Ai Rui Po Company predicts that China's total car sales this year will increase by 3%to 24.9 million vehicles, and they will return to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专题报道新冠疫情与疫苗/t-55795902">Xinyegang Epidemic</a>Previous sales level. The company is expected to increase the annual sales of Chinese cars to 30.6 million units by 2030. By then, more than half of the cars sold in China will be electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The consulting company said that from 2016 to 2022, China's "new energy vehicle" market, including plug -in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles, benefited from the government equivalent to $ 57 billion subsidies.</p>
<p>Ai Ruibao said that the US government provided a subsidy of $ 12 billion in the industry at the same time.</p>

<h3>Shanghai has become a city of electric</h3>
<p>Stephen Dyer, the director of Asian Automobile Consultation, said that this competitiveness will cause Chinese auto manufacturers to have a disruptive impact like Tesla in the next few years.</p>
<p>Dell said at a press conference: "If foreign brands want to survive in China, or to face the disruptive effects of these brands in the country's market, it is best to learn from the newly established electric vehicle startups in China."</p>
<p>Dell also predicts that by 2030, the annual sales of Chinese brands in overseas markets will increase to 9 million units, which will make the global share of Chinese brands reaching 30%, of which 15%in the European market share and 19%in South America. Southeast Asia and South Asia are also 19%.</p>
<p>The Chinese market is also facing huge overcapacity, and Dell predicts that there will be a wave of integration. He said that by 2030, only 25 to 30 of the existing 167 new energy vehicle brands can survive. He said more than two -thirds of the brands did not have any sales performance last year.</p>
<p>"Even if you have first -class operating capabilities, the annual output requires up to 400,000 vehicles to achieve a profit and loss balance," he said.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Whether it is about <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯入侵乌克兰/t-60868685">Ukrainian War</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专题报道新型冠状病毒/t-52123766">coronavirus </a>It is still the issue of gender equality. In recent years, there have been more and more fake news circulating on the Internet, especially when it involves emotional and controversial topics. Sometimes it is difficult to discern. At other times, facts and false news are actually easy to identify.</p>
<p>Each person is different. Some Internet users are always easier to believe in fake news and fake news. In this Voice of Germany, we will explore the reasons.</p>
<h3>Cognitive bias makes us believe in deception</h3>
<p>A frequent term is "Cognitive Bias". It describes the errors that exist in our human thinking that are difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>When we believe in fake news, our existing views and pre -formed world views play an important role in it. Sometimes it also calls it "partisanship" (party prejudice/favoritism) or "ConfirmationBias" (party prejudice/partiality) in some professional articles. Confirmation bias).</p>
<p>Cognitive psychologist Stephanlewandowsky is the author of the famous professional literature in this field. He explained: "If I hear something that is consistent with my own political perspective, I want to hear it. When I am, I will believe it more. "We always have prejudice. For example, if a person thinks that Germany accepts too many refugees, then he is more inclined to believe in news reports that believe in the community overweight or hold a negative attitude towards this group.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T07-59-00Z/62021343_401.png" />Like sharing without verification -common behavior on the Internet</p>
<p>We also have another important "cognitive deviation" to often believe in our intuition prematurely. We are unwilling to check again before internalization, comments, and reposting, as if checking the facts again is redundant and annoying. Many users are just reading the title of the article, not the actual content.</p>
<p>The Science Post and the National Public Radio (NPR) tested this by publishing misleading title. After clicking the link, the reader will find that this is actually just a joke experiment, but most people do not even open the link.</p>
<h3>Negative information can trigger us</h3>
<p>"From the Effect" (or "Follow -up effect" BandwagoneFFECT) will also mislead us: people are usually guided by others, rather than form opinions by themselves. As far as fake news is concerned, this means that we are more likely to believe in information that many others believe.</p>
<p>When a social media post is shared and likes a lot, we tend to believe in the so -called "group wisdom". The problem is that others also think so when they like to share, and as mentioned earlier, most of them shared and liked without specific understanding of the content.</p>
<p>Our memory is not much helpful for the correct remembers to see or read. This is the so -called "Persistence OFINACCURACY". We often don't remember the authenticity of something. A very common phenomenon is that people still claim that a false information is true -even if it has been corrected by factual verification, it has been corrected as false.</p>
<p>In addition to these deviations, the reason why fake news spread is so successful because we are more unconscious, we will let emotions lead ourselves. Levadovski said that false news is six times faster than the transmission of real information. This is due to emotions. "We know that people have a strong response to the information that causes negative emotions (such as anger)." Most likely to be spread quickly.</p>
<h3>The authenticity of information is second, and the most important thing can be used by yourself</h3>
<p>The University of Verzburg conducted a study last year, which made 600 participants evaluate the authenticity of different statements. The study found that the dark personality traits and the so -called "post -truth epistemology" made us more vulnerable to false news.</p>
<p>The chief author and psychologist Jan PhilipprudLoff explained in an interview with the Voice of Germany: "In order to understand the viewers' views on knowledge and facts, we asked them the following questions. : When you encounter information, do you believe in your intuition? How important do you think of evidence? Do you believe in the fact that there is an independent fact? "</p>
<p>The evaluation results show that the more those who believe in their own intuition and the more people who do not believe in the facts, the more difficult it is to distinguish the authenticity of information.</p>
<p>"Then we also studied the 'Dark Personality' factors', which is the core of all dark personality traits, such as narcissistic or mental abnormalities," Rudlov said. "The reason why it is called‘ dark ’is because these personality traits are related to the behavior that our society is not recognized.”</p>
<p>For those who have strong dark personality traits, their own interests are the most important. Everything else, including things that may be facts in some cases, are secondary.</p>
<p>"Then the question is not whether the information is true, but whether the information is beneficial to them, can be used by them, or become a reason for a certain behavior." Rudlov said that the dark personality traits and the knowledge of things are not knowledgeable for things. Proper cognition is often coexisted, and it is usually appeared at a very young age.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T07-59-00Z/59580538_401.png" />What is driven by us on the Internet is the desire for social interaction</p>
<h3>The desire for attention and recognition</h3>
<p>Joewalther, a researcher at the University of California California, pointed out another important factor in promoting fake news communication. He believes that the news of likes, comments and reposting is fundamentally a social interaction: "People are active on social networks to have a sense of participation to gain attention and recognition."</p>
<p>Walter said: "For example, I can repost a news for you: Studies have found that it is easier for small people to believe fake news than big people. I do this is not because I believe this is true, but because I think you I will like and be happy, I have sent you such an interesting and crazy story. "</p>
<p>This example also clearly shows that sometimes online users share fake news is not because they believe it. On the contrary, they just want to funny themselves or entertain others. Even they will share forward because they don't believe it is true.</p>
<h3>Looking to the future: What can we do?The question is: how do we improve the ability to identify fake news? The first step should be that we can be aware that we are easily affected by manipulation and subjective consciousness. Rudlov advocates impart more meta -knowledge about facts and science from students.</h3>
<p>"In science, we can only find a consensus, that is, find some common opinions among as many experts as possible. Once new information is added, things that are considered facts or consensus will change." Rudelov said.</p>
<p>This is very complicated, and some people think that the facts seem to be arbitrarily set by "elite". Just like during the new crown, it was said that children were unlikely to spread the new crown virus, and then suddenly changed the saying.</p>
<p>Another method is the so -called "Prebunking". By providing information about false and error messages in advance, users can improve their cognition and alertness before encountering this information. For example, before the election, many false news is expected to manipulate voters, and publicity activities can be considered in advance.</p>

<p>Description: The latest research found that the crisis caused by climate change has exacerbated the problem of domestic violence. The increase in domestic violence in South Asian countries has a correlation with more and more high -temperature days in the area. This problem is especially serious in India.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66124993/65380522"> <img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T08-05-00Z/65380522_303.png" /></a>It is expected that South Asia will experience more extreme high -temperature weather in the next decades.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) last week, a study published in the magazine of the American Medical Society (Jamapsychiatry) showed that the increase in domestic violence in women was related to the increase in temperature in South Asia, and India may face the largest <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/触目惊心全球五万女性死于家暴/a-49513735">Domestic violence</a>Growth.</p>
<p>The study investigated the correlation between the "environmental temperature" and "incidence of intimate partners" in India, Nepal, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Researchers tracked women over 19,4800 ages between 15 and 49 to study the incidence of intimate partner violence, including physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse.</p>
<p>Overall, the study found that every time the average annual temperature increases 1 degree Celsius, the violence of intimate partners will increase by 4.5%.</p>
<p>Although the study shows that the increase in high temperature and violence is positively related to all income groups, the largest increase is low -income families and rural families.</p>
<h3>India is a high incidence of domestic violence</h3>
<p>Among the three countries surveyed, India shows the greatest increase in abuse related to rising temperature. Studies have found that in India, every time the temperature rises 1 degree Celsius, physical violence for women will increase by 8%, and sexual violence will increase by 7.3%.</p>
<p>The study pointed out: "In the case of unlimited carbon emissions, it is expected that by 2090, the incidence of intimacy in India's close partners has increased the highest, reaching 23.5%, Nepal increased by 14.8%, and Pakistan is 5.9%."</p>
<p>In India, unprecedented high -temperature heat waves are becoming the norm every year. In May this year, the hot weather swept most of the country's regions, with a temperature of 45 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>The IPE-GLOBAL climate change and sustainable development department of the International Development Organization, Abinashmohanty, told Germany: "Extreme climate is becoming more and more severe, destroying people's lives and livelihoods. The poverty and vulnerable community has greatly influenced, and has promoted gender violence against girls and women.</p>
<p>Climate scientists believe that South Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world.</p>
<p>The academic group "world weather attribution" of extreme high -temperature weather sources(World Weather Attribution)A recent study found that climate change has increased the possibility of hot waves in South Asia.</p>
<p>Mohanti said that the social welfare plan formulated in response to climate change should consider the correlation between extreme high temperature and gender violence.</p>
<p>"Although the limitation of empirical evidence and data still have blind spots in the impact of quantitative climate change and gender violence, for fragile countries such as India, ensuring that climate action plans can integrate and integrate each other, in order to deal with these challenges. "Mo Hami said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T08-05-00Z/65987345_401.png" />"Women in low -income families and communities bear the burden of taking care of their families. When economic recession and employment opportunities are reduced, they are more vulnerable because they have to bear violence from their male partners."</p>
<h3>Connect extreme high temperature with family violence</h3>
<p>Social organizations also recognize that the crisis caused by climate change has exacerbated the problem of domestic violence.</p>
<p>"Judging from the experience of women and girls in the immigration community in northern India, immigration migration caused by climate change will only exacerbate gender violence," Sonar Kaper, the founder of the Indian Foundation Protsahan, who is committed to ending gender violence, (Sonal Kapoor) told Germany.</p>
<p>"The fragility caused by climate is not just a problem that urban residents need more air conditioners. It also means that the entire community is not repeated due to excessive affected natural disasters. Said.</p>
<p>Studies have found that extreme high temperatures will also reduce the working hours of daily salary workers, thereby reducing income, and forcing family members to spend more time staying at home. In this regard, it has increased the burden on women's housework, and it also makes men who feel that they cannot support their families to have nervousness and anger.</p>
<p>"Women in low -income families and communities bear the burden of taking care of their families. When economic recession and employment opportunities are reduced, they are more vulnerable because they must also bear violence from their male partners." Kalpanaviswanath told Germany.</p>
<p>Research from the American Medical Association also found that the economic pressure brought about by the decline in agricultural production and labor efficiency, as well as the worsening living environment caused by the damage caused by extreme weather, may also exacerbate domestic violence.</p>
<p>"Any form of pressure will cause family violence. Due to the lowest air conditioning rate of South Asia, the pressure brought by high temperature will lead to more domestic violence. I believe that climate crisis will lead to more family discord and social disputes." The international environment, environment, and social environment, and the international environment, and Chandrabhushan, CEO of Sustainable Development and Technical Forum, told Germany.</p>

Nils Naumann became the first mayor of Germany's options. Just a week ago, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国极右翼选项党首次赢得区议会选举/a-66033353">Optional Party candidate Saisman</a>(RobertSselmann) Sonneberg was elected county magistrate in the former East Germany area.</p>
<p>This seems to reflect the consistency of the results of the German polls. Some polls show that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国向右转选项党与社民党的支持率齐平/a-65809300">The right -wing populist party has 20%of German voters' support rate, which is comparable to that of Prime Minister Shulz where the Social Party is located</a>Essence</p>
<p>But what is the reason? Experts have different opinions. Some people believe that this is related to the new internal conflict of the Government, which is jointly governed by the German three parties, especially in terms of climate protection and heating equipment replacement policies that aim to transform renewable energy. Ursulamünch, the dean of the Political Education School of Political Education in Bavaria, said: "The policy of the governing alliance makes the people feel disturbed. I think, coupled with those who are generally dissatisfied with politics, they are now more encouraged by the option party."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T08-12-00Z/66027871_401.png" />(In the picture) Saisman, elected as the county head of Sonbeg</p>
<h3>Investigation and research confirmed that populism looked up</h3>
<p>A simple but disturbing explanation in a study published by the University of Lepzig last week: Many German voters, especially in the Dedong region, have racist tendencies. Another survey released on June 29 was also vigilant. The study shows that the populist line of the option party is increasingly supported by the middle class of the people. The research on the Sinus Institute of Social Research shows that 56%of the respondents in favor of populist claims, which is 43%two years ago.</p>
<p>SILKEBORGSTEDT, director of the Sinus Institute, said to Germany: "What we currently observe is that some young and modern middle class who have been educated have also showed a good impression on the option party. It is not clear whether this is because other parties have not been able to provide a good policy plan, or they consciously make such a choice. "German Chancellor Salz insisted that the rise of the option party cannot be attributed to the existence of the Social Democratic Party in the Social Party of China question. However, the best challenge should be the CIMC. Although the party is also leading in polls, the internal disputes of the joint government have not made the party profitable.</p>
<p>The President of the CDU Melz vowed to minimize the voters of the support option party in 2019. Now he has to keep a distance from this statement. Recently, after the option party won twice, he said last week that the main opponent of the CDU was still the Green Party -although 6 of the 16 federal state governments in Germany were jointly governed by the CDU and the Green Party.</p>
<p>Expert Mingxi is not sure whether to attack the Green Party is a good strategy for the CDU. But she said that other political parties should not be silent for specific issues such as immigrants. "I think these political parties should try to compete with the Optional Party in terms of policy, rather than retreat, and then say that this is a very right -wing party. We don't want to stick to it."</p>

<h3>How to face the Option Party?</h3>
<p>In Germany, many conservative politicians have different opinions on the party's opinions on what route response. Some people try to avoid emotional words and present themselves as responsible political parties. The conservatives of southern Bavaria and some of the "Liberal Vodes" with populist tendencies have chosen another strategy.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Hubertaiwanger, chairman of the little partner "Liberal Vodor Party" jointly governed with the Kyoto Federation, said, said, " Most of the time to regain democracy is here. "</p>
<p>This reminiscent of the words of the party's statement that caused him to resign. But Ewan said that he was defending the middle school of democracy: "If it wasn't for me, the polarization here would be more serious." He pointed out that the support rate of the Bavarian options for the party polls is only 10%, which is the average level of Germany, which is the average level of Germany, which is the average level of Germany. Half.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-09T08-12-00Z/65158964_401.png" />The chairman of the CDU Melz is often criticized because he has some remarks and populism.</p>
<h3>'S threat to democracy?</h3>
<p>For many people, a particularly worrying thing is that although the option party publicly published racist remarks, it still receives the support of so many German voters. The party is also regarded as a threat to the German Constitution order. The German Federal Constitution Protection Agency is responsible for monitoring extremists, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/联邦宪法保护局加强对选项党青年组织的监控/a-65450508">Constitution Protection Bureau sets part of the option party as a right -wing extremist</a>The option party is determined as "suspicious situation" as a whole.</p>
<p>At a press conference not long ago, Thomashaldenwang, director of the Constitution Protection Bureau, hinted that the Germans should think twice before voting to the option party. Expert Mingxi criticized that this is not the task of the Constitution Protection. "In the eyes of the option party voters, such a position has caused the Constitution Protection Bureau to lose its authority, especially in the Didong region. They will say that we have had enough intercourse with Starci (East German Secret Police) in the past. Tell us what is right and what is wrong. "</p>
<p>Bergs of the Sinus Institute believes that traditional German political parties do not need to be panicked due to the current polls. "Some are the right -wing extremists, but some voters responded by the current atmosphere." She believes that this atmosphere may change before the Federal Parliament election in 2025.</p>

<p>A random shooting occurred on Saturday (July 8) in New York, USA. A man shot four people in half an hour, causing a 87 -year -old man to be killed and the three were injured.</p>
<p>According to the US Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), according to the New York City Police Department's report, a random shooting on Saturday occurred on the streets of Brooklyn and Queen's district, and the gunman was arrested two hours after the first shooting.</p>
<p>The first shooting occurred at 11:10 a.m. on Saturday, local time (at 11:10 pm Saturday time on Singapore time). The gunner rode an electric scooter to approach the victim and shot it. The victim was sent to the hospital for treatment and was not in danger of life.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Washington will provide a bundle bomb to Ukraine, which is part of a $ 800 million military assistance plan to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion. In a statement issued to reporters this Friday (July 7), US Secretary of State Brillin said that the weapons and equipment in this new assistance plan "[<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国防长乌克兰有足够的反攻能力/a-65942860">combat power to strengthen Ukraine</a>It is important to help them regain Ukrainian sovereignty and protect their compatriots. "</p>
<p>At the same time, German Foreign Foreign Minister Annalenabaerbock has rejected suggestions for providing such weapons to Ukraine. Belbak said in Vienna that the German government will adhere to the Oslo Convention. Another ally in the United States Spain said it did not support the United States to provide cluster bombs to Ukraine. Non -NATO decision. Spain believes that such weapons should not be used even under "legal defense". British Prime Minister Rishisunak also said that he would not support the use of cluster bombs, emphasizing that Britain is one of the countries that signed the Oslo Convention. He said that Britain will continue to use other weapons (including heavy combat tanks): "Continue to support Ukraine's illegal and unprecedented aggression against Russia."</p>
<h3>American factory overtime to produce ammunition for Ukraine</h3>
<p>The Oslo Convention is considered a milestone to restrict the controversial cluster bomb. The convention took effect in 2010. So far, 110 countries have signed, and there are 13 countries to be approved. The signing country promises not to produce, store and use such weapons. However, none of the major powers including Russia, the United States, China, and India have not signed the convention.

Each small bomb is also known as the child bomb. According to the International Red Cross, they can be launched through aircraft, artillery and missiles. In addition to the initial damage caused by ammunition during the impact, the explosive dumb bomb rate of the bundle bomb is also very high, as high as 40%in some recent conflicts. This is also one of the reasons why the bundle bomb is controversial. This means that thousands of smaller unblied bombs are still residual, and it may continue to cause casualties after decades.</p>
<p>People who oppose the use of cluster bombs believe that this weapon has caused "huge damage" to civilians, and "can still hurt civilians for decades after the conflict." The effects of them are similar to mines, and sometimes they are unable to live in a certain area. For example, after the end of the war, some parts of Laos still cannot live.</p>
<p>According to the Human Rights Observation Organization, the Russian army "widely used cluster bombs in Ukraine, leading to many civilian casualties." The international non -governmental organization stated that the Ukrainian army has also used these weapons, leading to "multiple civilians' death and severe injuries."</p>
<p>Some military experts believe that cluster bombs can help Ukraine make progress in a counterattack against the Russian troops stationed in trenches. Russia criticized the US decision, arguing that it increased the possibility of nuclear war. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zaharava said on Saturday (July 8) that the decision of the United States was another "blatant display" of its anti -Russian route, which aims to extend Ukraine's conflict to the maximum. She also pointed out that the decision in the United States is a "desperate move."</p>

<p><strong> This Thursday (July 6), US Finance Minister Yellen arrived in China and left this Sunday (9th). This is the first visit to China after she became a financial minister. </strong></p>
<p>During the four -day visit, Yellen met with female economists from Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang to China, and talked about the problems such as "decoupling", regulatory control, and climate cooperation. In the agenda.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the overall public opinion, although the US Secretary of State Brillin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping when visiting China, Yellen's visit to China was longer and more abundant. "War" is related to the role of "decoupling".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-66118150">"Good Police" Yellen can revise US -China relations? </a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-66118850">Can China restrict export semiconductor raw materials "to teeth with teeth" can shake the global supply chain</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66117744">From the "decoupling" to "risk" the strategic shift of the US and Europe policies or consensus consensus? </a></p>
<h3>who met</h3>
<p>Yellen's itinerary was dense on Friday. He met with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, former Vice Premier Liu He, and Yi Gang, President of the People's Bank of China, and Pan Gongsheng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the People's Bank of China.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Li Qiang met Yellen.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Yellen met with the retired former deputy prime minister Liu He. The latter has led the Chinese negotiating team in the US -China -China trade war and signed the first phase of trade agreement with the White House with Trump.</p>
<p>Last month, Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" quoted five sources that Liu He still participated in the internal meeting of the Chinese government's economic affairs after unloading all his positions and had a high influence. China will cooperate with the United States in some areas, and other areas have to fight back, and Liu He's knowledge reserves and experience are extremely valuable for Beijing.</p>
<p>He Lifeng, the deputy prime minister of China, who met with the main meeting on Saturday, entered the ranks of members of the Politburo on the "20th National Congress" of the Communist Party of China. At the age of 68, he became the deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission of China in 2014. Essence</p>
<p>At the non -official level, Yellen discussed with many executives at the Huamei Enterprise on Friday, including Boeing, Bank of America, and agricultural giant Cargill. It is correct to try to reduce the effort to rely on China's supply chain.</p>
<p>At noon on Saturday, Yellen, who was born in the college, lunch with six Chinese female economists. The attendees include Golden Carrier. Scholars. Her father, Jin Liqun, used to be the deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance of the Ministry of Finance and the current president of the AIIB.</p>
<h3>The contact of stagnation</h3>
<p>Sino -US relations began to be in a trough by the Trump era. After Bayeng came to power, it was slowly repaired. Until August last year, NancyPelosi visited Taiwan in August last year. channel. By November last year, after meeting with Xi Jinping, Biden opened the process of slow repair and planned to visit China at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>However, in February this year, the Chinese reconnaissance balloon incident caused the restoration process of Sino -US relations again. Until Brintken visited China last month.</p>
<p>However, Brinken had just left the front foot, and in a public event, Xi Jinping said that Xi Jinping was the "dictator", which caused the Chinese to oppose it. Yellen's visit to China is also considered an attempt to continue this repair process.</p>
<p>During the meeting, He Lifeng told Yellen that he regretted the "accident" of hurting Sino -US relations. These incidents caused "the consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries at a summit last year had some problems in implementation."</p>
<p>According to the official Chinese media Xinhua News Agency, He Lifeng and Yellen conducted an important consensus on implementing the first Bali meeting in China and the United States, and conducted a "in -depth, frank and pragmatic" exchanges on the situation of the two countries and the world's economic and financial situations and cooperation in the world. The talks are constructive.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the work of the two sides at this stage still returns to the results of the implementation of the worship of last November, rather than solve new problems.</p>

<p>Yellen's plane arrived in Beijing. The sky appeared in the sky.</p>
<h3>What did you talk about</h3>
<p>Although Yellen has a word of criticism of China, she overall continues her tone in the United States, that is, opposition to China and the United States "decoupling".</p>
<p>When Yellen flew to Beijing on Thursday, a rainbow appeared in the sky. It was discussed by Chinese public opinion as a good sign. In the meeting with Li Qiang the next day, the latter also mentioned this detail saying, "Why is it that this is not the case in China and the United States. It is not completely storm. After a round of storms, we will definitely see more rainbow ".</p>
<p>Yellen told Li Qiang that the United States seeks healthy, not the economic competition of "winners to eat", and hopes that there is a set of fair rules to benefit the two countries in the long run. At present, there are important international challenges, and China and the United States have the responsibility to cooperate and show leadership in their respective countries and the world.</p>
<p>At a press conference on Sunday, Yellen also expressed a similar point of view.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Yellen said that Washington does not seek decoupling with the Chinese economy, saying that it is "catastrophic for both countries and unstable to the world."</p>
<p>She also summarized that a total of 10 -hour bilateral talks with Chinese officials with Chinese officials were direct, substantial and effective, and said that it helped stable Sino -US relations. The purpose of this visit is to establish and deepen the connection with China's new economic team, reduce the risk of misunderstanding, and pave the way for cooperation in the fields of climate change and debt distress.</p>
<p>"Tapping" China has a lot of words, mainly involving three aspects:</p>
<p>Increasing China's "unfair economic behavior" and the coercive actions against American companies, we have put forward serious concerns;</p>
<p>The two sides discussed the issue of the Russian and Ukraine War. Yellen said that Chinese companies avoid providing material assistance to Russia or assisting them to avoid sanctions;</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>American Climate Special Environment John Kerry</p>
<h3>The most likely cooperation area</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, climate cooperation has become a key point for Yellen to visit China, not a matter of fortune.</p>
<p>In a Saturday's speech, she said that the two largest gases of greenhouse gas emissions in China and the United States to lead the climate actions and call on China to support the United States -led Green Climate Fund. The fund is established to help developing countries. Adapt to climate change and reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Although China and the United States have invested in new energy fields such as solar energy, carbon emissions in the two countries have risen last year.</p>
<p>However, China and the United States are not frank in climatic cooperation. The crux is that China insists that it is still a developing country, so it should be paid by the United States and Europe to pay energy transformation, because Europe and the United States have created most of the carbon emissions in history.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that when Biden Climate Special Envoy, Kerry said in Yellen that he would go to China next week to restart the global warming negotiations between the two countries.</p>

<h3>Nothing to talk about?</h3>
<p>Yellen's long -term care of tariffs did not occur in public issues.</p>
<p>During the Trump era, most of the products between China and the United States have implemented high tariffs and have not been removed in the Bayeng era.</p>
<p>Within the U.S. government, the support of the abolition of tariffs on China is the Minister of Finance Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Raymond. They agree with the abolition of tariffs to resist inflation.</p>
<p>The opponents are mainly US trade representative Dai Qi. They are unwilling to abandon the important chips of the United States to China, and hope to continue to use tariffs to reshape China's economic behavior, formulate a more strategic China trade strategy to protect the United States Employment.</p>
<p>In May last year, US Treasury Secretary Yellen confirmed in a public speech that she was calling to cancel part of the tariffs on Biden because some tariffs were "not strategic" and hurt American consumers and enterprises. She said, "In my opinion, some of these measures seem to cause greater harm to consumers and enterprises, and they are not strategic in solving our actual problems with China."</p>

<p>After the start of the trade war, the export volume of American soybeans fell sharply, and the price fell to the lowest point in 10 years, which caused huge losses to farmers in the central and western regions.</p>
<p>Yellen emphasized at a press conference that no visit can solve the challenges between China and the United States overnight. Public opinion generally believes that Yellen's visit to China mainly establishes a tough, effective communication channel with China's new economic team, and paving the way for Cry's climate negotiations, rather than solving specific problems such as trade.</p>

<p>U.S. Financial Minister Yellen publicly stated publicly before the end of this Sunday's four -day trip that she had a 10 -hour meeting with senior Chinese officials in recent days. There are still differences in many issues in China, but I believe that this trip will promote the relationship between the two countries "more stable".</p>
<p>Yelun reiterated at a press conference held at the US Embassy in China on Sunday that "there are major differences in the United States and China", Washington was worried about the Chinese "unfair economic behavior" and recent punitive actions against US companies. Yellen said: "But President Biden and I do not look at the relationship between the United States and China from the framework of the conflict between the big powers. We believe that the world is big enough to make us prosper and develop."</p>
<p>Reuters reported that since the situation of the Taiwan Strait, the export ban in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. advanced technology export ban, and the official national security issues led by China's official industrial policies, Washington has been working hard to repair the relationship between the two largest economies of the world. U.S. Secretary of State Brillings visited Beijing last month and became the first visit to senior US diplomats during the term of President Biden, and American climate special envoy Kerry is expected to visit China this month.</p>
<p>At the same time, whether Yellen's trip can pave the way for Biden's meeting with Xi Jinping has also become a topic of attention from the outside world. It is expected that the 20 -way Group Summit held in New Delhi, India in September this year, and the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization Meeting held in San Francisco in November may provide opportunities for the "worship".</p>
<p>Yellen said at a press conference on Sunday that the trip aims to establish and deepen the connection with China's new economic team, reduce misunderstandings, and pave the way for climate change and debt distress.</p>
<p>Senior officials of the US Treasury Ministry of Finance told the media after Yellen ended in Beijing that this trip is as expected that it does not bring specific policy breakthroughs, but it is "very successful" in "re -establishing contacts" and building US -China relations. Essence</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The New York Times published an article "The Brothers of Xi Jinping and Putin may have seen the top". The author Ryan Hass believes that the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格纳兵变给习近平敲响了警钟/a-66033766">after the Wagner incident, Xi Jinping's bet on Putin seems to be so stable that it is not so secure. </a>Essence Xi Jinping could not completely abandon Putin. He has invested too much in this relationship, and Russia is still useful to China. But they have caused so much worried brotherhood in the West.</p>
<p>The author pointed out that although there have been signs for a long time, Chinese leadership has not fully supported Putin's war, but at the beginning of the conflict, China hopes that it can take the United States from Asia, and China has been seeking to expand the impact in Asia in Asia force. However, this has not become a reality. On the contrary, since the beginning of the Ukraine, the United States and its Asian allies have established a stronger military existence around China, and now they are more united in restricting China's key technologies. Putin is alone.</p>
<p>But China is now aware that Ukraine's long -term war may further threaten Russia's partner country and damage China's own foreign policy agenda. China has a reason to go further in the vague expression of the war principles before, and uses its unique influence on Russia to urge the realization of the armistice.</p>
<p>The author said that Russia's issue has also made Xi Jinping's plans on the Taiwan issue. The Ukrainian war shows two things: it is not possible to win the battle by relying on military forces; but not winning the battle may lead to the challenge of the power of the leadership. Faced with these situations, through the increasingly fighting moves, the Taiwan Strait War may be disastrous for Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Taiwan's "report" published an article "Wang Yi does not know, European and American people can't distinguish between China, Japan and South Korea", author Li Yizhong pointed out that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in the Qingdao will be in the "2023 China -Korea Cooperation International Forum".

The evaluations of these three countries have their own opinions. Even under the face of China's oppression of Taiwan in recent years, Europeans and Americans have gradually clarified the differences between Chinese and Taiwanese. China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are not as Wang Yi said, because the complexion and similar skin tone, which causes the European and American to confuse.</p>
<p>For example, this year, the latest survey of "Americans" of "Americans' favorability for China" was released at the beginning of this year.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/从数据看发展美国公众眼里中国形象的变迁/a-65972594)As a result, the reputation of the Chinese people in the United States fell to a new low in 1979 (China -US establishment diplomatic relations), with a favorability of only 15%. And since 2018, a total of 38 percentage points have been reduced. More than 80%of Americans have negative views on China. 45%of the statement is "very negative" and 39%is "negative". At the same time, Americans's favorability of Taiwan reached a high, reaching 77%. Since 1996 (the first Taiwan Strait crisis), the maximum value of the values of the values. Zhong and Taiwan are not just like people, but they are almost the same in language, but their evaluations in Americans are completely different.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the "YOUGOV rating" in 2020, "Which countries do Americans like the most?" Investigation, East Asia, at that time, Americans had a positive perception of Japan 58%, 48%of the positive perception of South Korea, and positive possession of China to China. The perception is only 18%, which is similar to the level of Russia (19%) and North Korea (12%). In this survey, not only did Wang Yi say that "European and American people can't tell China, Japan and South Korea", but also are really regarded as a hung up with China. In fact, Russia and North Korea.</p>
<p>The author said that many Chinese people immigrate to the United States, and they never want to dye their hair yellow or have a tip nose to become Americans. They hope that after arriving in the United States, they can use the US educational resources, legal guarantees, and social systems With more dignified and human life, they do not have to "become Americans" at all, and they can get human rights, freedom and peace that they do not have in China.</p>

<h3><strong> Will the CCP's army attack Taiwan? </strong></h3>
<p>Taiwan's "Wind Media" published an article "The Communist Party of China" punish the Vietnam War "-The future possible use of the military model for Taiwan", the author Li Zhiyao pointed out that the Chinese Communist regime has always had a strong national consciousness. The Battle of the Korean War and the Treasure Island in 1969 confronted the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively; the Battle of Dachen Island in early 1955 was followed by the signing of the military -defense treaty in Taiwan and the United States (December 1954). ; In February 1979, the "punishment of the Vietnam" was followed by the signing of the military alliance Treaty (at the end of 1978) in Vietnam and the Soviet Union, showing that the CCP's attitude towards territorial sovereign disputes was irrational and unpredictable-at the expense of the military greatly greatly rushed The risk of risks is desperate.The author believes that the CCP knows that if the balance of power balances changes in decisiveness, the strange attack is the main option. The large -scale strange attack has always been the usual combat method of the Communist Army in the early days of the war, such as the Korean War in 1950, the 1962 Sino -China -India War, and the Sino -China -India War in 1962. This was the case in 1979. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国将领习近平尚未决定2027年前武统台湾/a-66090328">If the CCP is determined to move against Taiwan</a>It is likely that it will suddenly launch a strange attack to improve the successful calculation of the military committed.</p>

<p>Children's suicide is a hearty topic. A few years ago, a school I had attended by a child in my child committed suicide under the age of 12. When the child talked to me, it was raining outside. He said, "Mom, you see, the sky is crying!"</p>
<p>Some scholars have studied the "China Health and Health Statistical Yearbook" data pointed out that China's suicide mortality rate in China from 2010 to 2021 decreased significantly, but the suicide mortality rate of children and adolescents from 5 to 14 years old continued to rise. From 2017 to 2021 The death rate of suicide rates of aged and young people 15 to 24 years old is also rising.</p>
<p>In Singapore, where I live now, the phenomenon of suicide in children and adolescents has also attracted much attention. On July 1 this year, Samaaritans Offsingapore issued a statement saying that there were 476 suicide deaths in 2022, of which 125 were 10 to 29 years old. The first cause of death.</p>
<p>In this school, how much pressure is the children be beginning with grades as the core life? Not long ago, a friend of my friend had just taken the college entrance examination and traveling to Singapore during the holidays. Speaking of the pressure of learning, he said that at their school, sometimes only a month or half a month.</p>
<p>I used to think that the high school I had been in myself was "the most abnormal". At that time, the early self -study starting from 7 o'clock, the late self -study ended at 10 o'clock in the evening, and the afternoon of the high three week can only take half a day on Sunday afternoon. Who knows that after decades of education, there is no "most abnormal", only "more abnormal". At that time, we could go home for dinner and a simple break at noon. There were 40 minutes of a long break during the afternoon class, and at least an hour before the evening self -study had dinner. Today's children, especially those who have boarding schools, have almost been squeezed out. It is said that some schools have not even had a half -day break. In this case, I feel that everything seems to be saying "Why not eat meat?" Fortunately, the situation in elementary and junior high school is much better than high school, and the younger students, the more time the time that can be freely controlled.</p>
<p>But if we do not want children's mental state to continue to deteriorate, and the topic of children's suicide is often mentioned, we really need to do something. If you cannot change the status quo in a short time, at least you must work hard to give children sufficient attention in the children's emotions and social aspects, and try to give children the time and space for children to develop emotional health and free socialization.</p>
<p><strong> Give children "emotional permits" </strong> **</p>
<p>First of all, we need to pay more attention to the emotional world of children. We understand what happened in the world through news reports, and emotions are like people's inner news reports, and people understand what happens to themselves and others through emotions. However, many adults, when the children expressed some emotions that are considered negative, always said, "Now the suffering of eating in the student days is not bitter at all." After all, life is the most difficult. Our emotions of children consistently ignore and deny that children are unwilling to continue to express.</p>
<p>Professor of the Children's Research Center of the United States, Blanks, said in his book "Learn Emotional Management with Children" (English original name: Permission Tofeel), saying that we need to figure out what happened in the heart through emotions to make wisdom in order to make wisdom decision. Therefore, the first thing we need to learn is "emotional permission". We must give ourselves and children "emotional permission", do not always suppress the feelings of ourselves and children, but be brave to admit and accept it. He said that people may mistakenly think that "emotional permission" is just like trash, vertical, yelling, and impulsive performance, as if it was impossible to control themselves. This vent is often destructive and has no positive significance for our emotional health. The "emotional permit" he said is not unilateral, but more like a cooperation, and there must be a return like a tennis. One person should respond to one person, and one person says that one person listens to it. The people who listen should maintain an open mind and be patient and empathetic. "Through discourse, body language, facial expressions, and eye communication, we will send information to the response to hearing the content: I will be with you here; I will not point you to you; I want to know you, help you help you "I don't know how many parents or educators can do it? The book "Accompanied by Children to Learn Emotional Management" summarizes the results of the 25 years of emotional education research. The book also introduces how to learn emotional management skills through "Ruler skills", which is worth reading.</p>
<p>When we learn how to accept emotions and help children regulate our emotions, children will also be more willing to seek help from adults, especially when they feel the pressure and face collapse. But the status quo is that when some children express their emotions, they have repeatedly ate "closed doors", and their emotions are always denied. Then they will be more and more alienated with adults who can help. Staff of Singapore's psychological counseling institutions once said that parents and adolescents must accept psychological counseling. However, some children and adolescents seeking help are unwilling to let parents know that this is a dilemma, making the counselor feel helpless. This also allows people to know from one aspect, how important parents' support is for children.</p>
<p>In fact, whether it is parents or educators, adults have the responsibility to take the initiative to establish a connection with the children, and take the initiative to communicate, discover, understand, and support. I remember when my first series of "Children's Mind Healthy Growth Picture Book" was published last year, I once wrote an article "Why do I write a story for children". The connection (ConneCtedWithchildren), I want to let the children know through my book that their feelings and ideas can be understood, accepted and respected. "This year I published 4 other children's books through Singapore Lingzi Media again this year. Completed this series. These books are suitable for children and parents from the low grades of kindergartens to primary schools. I hope that adults can take the initiative to understand, accept, and respect the children from their childhood, so that they have psychological toughness in the process of growing up, so as not to easily lose their trust in people and the world, so as to go On the road.</p>
<p>In each guide, I will tell the children that taking the book home to read with my parents. I very much hope that parents can experience and understand their children's emotions and inner worlds by reading children's books with their children. I also hope that these books will be helpful to establish mutual understanding and trust between children and adults. For example, "The Most Well Superman Dad" will reveal that dad can also provide "mental nutrition" for children!The mother in "Family Music Immigration" gave appropriate guidance after discovering the child's emotional changes. "One Day of the Kingdom" inspired children to look at learning and exams from a new perspective. "One Day of the Disappearing Mobile" allows us to enjoy the beauty of family relationships together.</p>
<p><strong> Social is the "just need" of growth </strong>When people talk about "social" from the perspective of education, they always like to say that social ability is a kind of competitiveness needed in the future, but it is less to understand the importance of social networking from a mental health perspective. Some institutions have released data that during the past epidemic, people have greatly reduced social, anxiety and depression. In terms of our life experience, this is also the case. When a friend can tell our troubles, we will realize that "the joy is doubled, and the trouble is halved once it is shared." This is the most direct feeling of people.</p>
<p>For children, social networking is not only very important for maintaining mental health, but also the necessary nutrients in their growth process. In the process of the socialization of a child, we often need to get response and confirmation from their peers, and often need to interact with their peers to establish self -perception. The support of peers is very important for the healthy growth of a child. In their peers, they learned to trust and be trusted. In playing, they exchanged their trust in each other.</p>
<p>Children's own emphasis on social networking sometimes exceeds the imagination of adults. Some children will be emotional because of a small out of their peers. Sometimes, we will see some children who are relatively weak in all aspects. In order to be able to get the opportunity to play games with their peers, we will be a "victim" in collective games and play a game role that everyone is unwilling to act. There are also some children, seemingly naughty, but the exceptional actions are often to win the attention of their peers. When dealing with bullying incidents, some schools will establish a support network for the bullies, including friends among their peers. This approach is more professional because the logic behind it is that they attach great importance to the social socialization and are in line with psychological science. My children's book "Why don't they listen to me" and "Family Music Immigration" actually pay attention to social social issues. The book "Why don't they listen to me" won the book award for readers of the Singapore Popular Book Company last year, which reflects that Singapore's parents have paid attention to their children's emotions and social topics.</p>
<p>Some children often ask, why do we go to school now? Modern technology and the Internet are so developed, and there is a blessing of artificial intelligence. What knowledge you want to learn, you don't have to rely on schools to do it. But why do we still need a school? I think the answer lies in people, the mutual learning between people, the connection between people, and the interaction between people. Some countries have legal "school at home", but their parents will arrange sufficient social time and occasions for them. After all, simply learning knowledge does not really grow up. I used to "Where is the bottom line of children's diligence? "One article said that diligent learning should be, but there must be a bottom line, and the free and full social interaction is one of the bottom lines.</p>
<p>"The study of social and emotional management skills can help students learn how to control emotions, care for others, make responsible decisions, establish good interpersonal relationships, and effectively cope with challenges in life." This is the " Period and citizen education "Course description. In this paragraph, I often review before entering some school lectures. Although we cannot talk directly, we should pay attention to the concept of children's mental health should be buried in the hearts of children. Speaking of the suicide of children and adolescents, some are impulsive, and some are the long -term accumulation of anxiety and depression. Although the reason for suicide is often complicated, it is not no trace. I think if we can do more adults and actively establish and communicate with children, the phenomenon of suicide of children should be reduced accordingly!</p>

<p>From the perspective of Jiang Xing, general manager of Zhongan Insurance, AIGC's application in the insurance industry has its natural advantages: "Due to its particularity in the financial insurance industry, it has high value, high -gain and high -rich data. Settlement, I believe I should be able to become a natural soil for the development of AIGC applications. "In addition to the accumulation of massive data, Wei Chenyang, deputy dean of the Institute of Finance and Technology of Tsinghua University and director of the China Insurance and Pension Research Center, believes that the rich scene is also the AIGC in the insurance industry in the insurance industry One of the advantages of landing, "from product to marketing, to obtaining customers, to policies and insurance policies, each scene has the empowerment space of artificial intelligence." Obviously, AIGC will bring new imagination to these scenarios.</p>
<p>"AIGC can understand what insurance is doing through ChatGPT, which eliminates our insurance company's knowledge asymmetry in this regard." In this regard, Ye Junfeng, head of Taipingjin Insurance Technology Laboratory, believes AIGC means huge changes to the insurance industry, and changes in the insurance sales model will follow. This is a challenge and opportunity for the insurance industry.</p>
<p>However, for the specific application of AIGC in the insurance business scenario, there are three practical problems in the industry: Can AIGC bring business incremental value? Is the risk brought by AIGC controllable? How does AIGC combine with existing business processes? Shi Xingtian, the person in charge of Zhongan Insurance Data Science Application Center, said that at this stage, it is necessary to systematically think about how to transform the existing business system process and give full play to the ability of AIGC to bring incremental value through changes in human -machine interaction and content production.</p>
<p>However, Shi Xingtian also believes that in terms of the model's ability to see the existing AIGC, its logical reasoning ability is actually lacking, and it is not satisfactory in accuracy. "For some scenarios that are very high in industry applications or are very high in reasoning, we should let it avoid this instead of allowing AIGC to directly participate in very accurate and highly required decisions."</p>
<p>For the financial insurance industry, in addition to the lack of logical reasoning and accuracy, practitioners' concerns about AIGC compliance and security are higher.</p>
<p>Zhang Chao, the person in charge of the Life Life Information Technology Department, believes that each financial practitioner should consider in advance that while technology is valuable, what are the risks that need to be avoided. How to protect user data privacy, as well as the desensitization and authorization of data, etc. These are the worries of employees in compliance.</p>
<p>The establishment of a security guarantee mechanism based on data security and technical security is a solution proposed by Cui Feiting, the head of the volcanic engine insurance industry solution. Based on the analysis of user sensitivity, ensure that sensitive data will not be put into use; second, we need to choose some security mutual trust solutions to achieve data isolation and network isolation to ensure the data security and data security and model user data security and model user The privacy of the model. On the basis of doing a good job of avoiding risks, AIGC can better and more safe in the insurance industry.</p>

<p>When it comes to Sino -European relations, the first country in most people's minds is usually France or Germany, or Britain and Italy. Few people think of the Nordic countries, and few people think of Sweden directly. Sino -Swiss relations seem to be an extremely rare topic. If we look back at history, we will find that Sweden in 1950 was the second Western country that established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China after the United Kingdom, 14 years earlier than France, which has established diplomatic relations with China in 1964.</p>
<p>Many people may strange the Swedes in that environment at that time to break through various ideological constraints and build diplomatic relations with China? In fact, a large part of the reason is that the essence of Swedish culture is actually the pragmatism of the merchants. This kind of recreational pragmatism can be traced back to the Hansha Alliance with the Rubak as the core of northern Germany in the 12th century. The strong business culture is inherently born to be a supporter of trade liberalism.</p>
<p>However, the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War can be said to reverse the cognitive foundation of Sweden and the Nordic countries for international relations. Although the prevention of Russia has always been there, a series of war behaviors that Russia will adopt still make them feel a strong sense of survival crisis. This has also promoted Sweden and Finland to eventually choose to join NATO after more than 70 years. At the same time, Sweden's perspective has also changed a lot.</p>
<p>In this context, the Xinfu team was fortunate to be at the European visits this year and the European Parliament Member of the European Parliament from Sweden(Jörgen Warborn)A in -depth exchanges and media interviews were conducted, looking forward to understanding China -Swiss and China -Europe relations through more thoroughly. Demonstrate Vorbine comes from the Central Rights of the European People's Party. He was a Swedish entrepreneur before he was elected. Since the 2019 election, he has been a member of the European Parliament. In the parliament, he served as deputy association of the European People's Party in the International Trade Commission, and was once rated as the most supporting politicians in the European Parliament by the media.</p>
<p>Interview text:</p>
<p><strong> Song Xin </strong>: Good morning, Mr. Walbin, a member of the European Parliament. Thank you very much for taking the time. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the geopolitical transformation in the past three years on behalf of the "Financial Times" Chinese website today, so as to have its impact on China -EU relations. I also want to ask your views on global economic challenges, and how should Europe be dealt with in the long run?</p>
<p><strong> Jonorgen Walbin </strong>: Very magnificent, very interesting question.</p>
<p><strong> Song Xin </strong>: How do you view the great transformation of global geopolitics in the past three years? How do you understand the long -term impact of these changes on Sino -European relations?</p>
<p><strong> Jonorgen Volbon </strong>: From a European perspective, we have faced huge challenges in the past decade or even twenty years. Because we have been surpassed by other economic powers, especially China. China has always maintained amazing growth, and it has performed very well from an economic perspective. But not only China, many Asian countries have also developed a lot. When I look at the statistical data and try to understand why this is the case, what is happening, and what are the financial changes? I saw that Asia has achieved a large extent, but it is not only Asia, because even the United States is growing, it is surpassing Europe. Our history is similar to the United States, but it is different from Chinese history. Therefore, my understanding of economic development is that European performance is actually worse than other parts of the world, and we must change this. I think we have Swedes. This is very good. I am a Swedish member and now I am the chairman of the EU Council by Sweden. One of the main concerns of Sweden's main concern is competitive. We need to make the European Union re -competitive so that we can achieve growth. In the final analysis, growth means prosperity.</p>
<p><strong> Song Xin </strong>: Thank you very much. Now that you are now mentioning Sweden as the EU Chairman. Do you have any expectations? How can we improve the competitiveness of European companies worldwide?</p>
<p><strong> Jonorgen Volban </strong>: The term of the chairman of the EU Council is 6 months. Because we have been in competitiveness in the past 20 years, I think Sweden cannot solve this problem within 6 months. But it is very good to be promoted on the agenda. I hope that from the perspective of Europe, our future discussions on competitiveness are much more than in the past. You may also know that the Swedes are famous for advocating free trade. We want to see rules -based global trade, which is one of my thoughts of challenges in today's world. In my opinion, as the Swedes, we can contribute to the EU, and even some regions of the world return to the right track, so that our final trade exchanges will increase rather than decrease. Unfortunately, I saw that we were a little wrong in international trade.</p>
<p><strong> Song Xin </strong>: How do you understand the economic crisis or potential crisis facing the recent global or EU level? Because now some banks are facing bankruptcy -do you think it can be resolved in the near future?</p>
<p><strong> Jonorgen Volbern </strong>: Since the Russian and Ukraine War, we have suffered a long period of economic problems in Europe, and we have seen the crisis of life costs. Inflation is soaring. In particular, we have seen that Europe's energy prices are very high. Speaking of the "Reduction of Aflation", this is a challenge to us in the United States. People are very worried about how this will affect European companies, because their growth in the United States will exceed the growth of EU or EU member states, which will affect European employment and prosperity. These are the problems we are working hard. I hope we can solve it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the United States is obviously different from European companies. If we do have a good dispute solution in the WTO, I think we should use it. Unfortunately, the dispute solution system has no effect. Therefore, we must find other methods to overcome this problem. Negotiations with the United States are ongoing, and I hope it will not end with subsidy competition. Because I think this is not a good policy, this is when politicians choose winners and losers. And our politicians are particularly not good at this kind of business decision, which should be determined by the market. I also want to criticize China, because China is also providing subsidies for their companies, especially state -owned enterprises. From the perspective of Europe, it is also a problem we face.</p>
<p><strong> Song Xin </strong>: Thank you very much for your analysis. The last question: There are still many Chinese companies willing to invest in Europe or want to expand their business in Europe. Do you have any suggestions?<strong> Song Xin </strong>: Thank you for your analysis, which is very valuable for Chinese and global readers.</p>
<p><strong> Jonorgen Volban </strong>: Thank you.</p>

<p>July 9th is the eighth anniversary of the "709 Capture Incident" for the Chinese authorities to protect lawyers and human rights defenders. The Chinese folk rights organization "Livelihood Observation" issued a statement on the same day, condemning the incident to be supported by the CCP's senior management, and exposed the authoritarian nature of the authorities to host the rule of law.</p>
<p>The statement pointed out that although the "709 arrest" was directly the head of the public security department, Fu Zhenghua and Sun Lijun, the two people were made and launch for their personal political purposes, but such a large arrest was obviously supported by the Communist Party of China. The approval of the Secretary of the Political and Legal Committee Meng Jianzhu and the then Minister of Public Security Guo Shengzhang was difficult to implement. The "709" lawyer and citizens have made arduous and effective struggle for several months of imprisonment, the surveillance and isolatedness of the surveillance and residence of the designated place, and won the respect of all walks of life at home and abroad. But at the same time, the "709 Incident" is the same as the June 4th slaughter, becoming a lingering nightmare and long -term negative assets of the authorities.</p>
<p>As the direct difficulty of the 709 arrest, Wu Yan and Hu Shigen were finally released from prison. However, the 709 -Mongolian lawyer Xie Yang was a second time, and lawyer Yu Wensheng, who played an important role in the 709 major arrest and rescue, was arrested again. Lawyer Li Yuhan was dragged for a long time.</p>
<p>The statement emphasized that the "709 arrest" fully exposed the essence of the Chinese Communist Party's hostile to the rule of law and hatred of lawyers, and also directly challenged the European and American constitutional government and the democratic world. It is also the crowd of lawyers and citizens who pursue the status of citizens' subjects as the Red Guards. The private world of the party and state on the government's private world is a stubborn resistance to the real people's supremacy, and it is the crushing of the people's willingness to the people's willingness to the people.</p>
<p>Minsheng observation pointed out that the 709 cases and the "eight -nine" tide reflected the contest between China's emerging democratic forces and the stubborn communist autocracy. The CCP authorities use the so -called Chinese characteristics to resist constitutional government and democracy, the purpose is just to defend the world of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>According to Reuters reported on July 9, the Republican candidate of the Presidential Election in the United States and Governor of Florida in the 2024 presidential election said that if he won the election, he would take measures to cancel China's permanent normal trade relationship.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, De Santis said, "I agree with this. I think we may need Congress (support), but I will take administrative actions as appropriate to promote our development in this direction."</p>
<p>It is reported that the status of permanent normal trade relations is a legal guide for free trade with foreign countries. When the U.S. Senate is preparing to join the World Trade Organization in 2000, it votes to vote to give China the status. Therefore, any change steps also need to be approved by Congress.</p>
<p>Over the years, due to the situation of the Taiwan Strait, the export of advanced technology in the United States, the official industrial policy led by China, the origin of human rights issues, the origin of the new crown epidemic, and a series of issues involving national security, US -China relations have been nervous. U.S. Financial Minister Yelun said on Sunday that her meeting with senior Chinese officials in recent days was "direct" and "effective". Her four -day trip to Beijing would help stabilize the relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>US Treasury Minister Yellen said that the inflation rate in the United States is still high. Although the slowdown in economic growth is appropriate and normal, it still cannot completely rule out the possibility of the United States or face economic recession.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Yellen had previously interviewed the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) that the risk of economic recession in the United States "does not exist at all." The interview record will be broadcast on Sunday (July 9) CBS's "Facethe National" program.</p>
<p>Yellen said: "We have a healthy economy and a great labor market. Although Americans are worried about the high inflation rate, the inflation problem will eventually decline over time. I hope and believe that in the healthy labor market In the context, there will be a way to reduce inflation. The data I see shows that we are walking on this road. "</p>
<p>The inflation rate in the United States in June may continue to decline, but a key indicator of potential price pressure is still running at an unreasonable speed, making the Fed's tendency to restore interest rates in July.</p>
<p>The US government's recent report predicts that the consumer price index (CPI) will increase by 3.1%year -on -year, which is the lowest annual rate since March 2021. However, if unstable energy and food costs can be removed, the core CPI will rise by 5%year -on -year. Although this will be the smallest annual increase since the end of 2021, according to different inflation indicators, it is still more than twice the Fed's goal.</p>
<p>Yellen is launching a four -day visit to China in Beijing. With the continued heating up in US -China relations, it has achieved the goal of deepening communication between the two countries and striving to establish a "stable and constructive relationship".</p>
<p>Yellen told CBS that although the Biden government is considering strengthening control over overseas investment, the goals of these controls are "very narrow" and will not have a significant impact on China's bilateral investment.</p>

<p>Description: With the end of the US Treasury Secretary Yellen's visit to China, US -China relations have also officially restored official exchanges.
