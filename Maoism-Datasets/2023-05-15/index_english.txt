 Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong returned to Seoul on May 7 to hold a head talks with South Korean President Yin Xiyue
(Voice of Germany Chinese) Essence With the increasingly concerned about provocative military activities on North Korea and China's influence, the two leaders tried to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea.
During the summit, Yin Xiyue said that the efforts to deepen the bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea should not be hindered by the historical disputes that have not yet been resolved. As the first Japanese leader who visited Seoul for more than five years, Kishida Wenxiong said that since Yin Xiyue visited Tokyo in March, the relationship between these two Asian countries has been developing "vibrant".
Both leaders promised to promote cooperation and coordination, and urged officials of both parties to formulate specific steps to improve each other's security and economic cooperation. The meeting was less than two weeks after the Seventh -way Group summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Kishida Wenxiong has invited Yin Xiyue to the summit. Two leaders are expected to hold a third -side meeting with US President Biden Biden during the Seventh National Group's meeting.
Some analysts say that the trip to Seoul, Kishida, reflects that Japan and South Korea want to reconcile bilateral issues and maintain harmonious relationships. Yin Xiyue visited Tokyo in March and was widely considered a diplomatic breakthrough. Eleanorhughes, a very resident researcher in the think tank in Chicago, said: "In this regard, aspect, Tian Wenxiong decided to invite Yin Xiyue to attend the G7 summit of the Hiroshima, which successfully opened the door for the two countries to obtain policy in deepening security and economic relations."
Combined concerns about regional security 
During the Sunday meeting, Kishida Wenxiong and Yin Xiyue acknowledged that Japan and South Korea jointly responded to the rising security threats of the region due to the repeated missile tests and the promotion of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Although the two leaders did not mention China directly, some experts believed that Beijing's continuous expansion in the region was also an important factor in deepening bilateral relations in Tokyo and Seoul.
"Japan understands that the wider challenge of the region is the rise of China, and how this will cause destructive power to the economy, diplomacy, and security." Stephennagy, a professor at the Department of Political and International Studies of the Japan International Christian University, said, "" " Tokyo, of course, I hope to cooperate with South Korea to ensure that the region remains stable and prosperous. "
Although Japan has been increasing the challenges brought about by China's rise, South Korea has adopted a more tough speech to describe China's impact on aggressive expansion in the region. In an interview with Reuters last month, Yin Xiyue said that the intensification of tensions around Taiwan was caused by trying to change the status quo with force, and he tried to oppose it.
Yin Xiyue's remarks were strongly protested by Beijing. The deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Sun Weidong, qualitated the speech of the President of South Korea as "wrong" and "completely unacceptable".
Professor Najib told Germany that the Yin Xiyue government made it clear in most communication that they believe that China's current development direction is not necessarily positive for the region and South Korea. "Therefore, Seoul needs to cooperate with Japan and the United States and other like -minded countries to make South Korea better respond to future challenges related to China's rise." He explained.
Although some people are worried that due to the greater economic impact of China on South Korea, South Korea is still relatively weak on the China issue, but some experts believe that because China and North Korea seem to be unlikely to change their actions in the region, Seoul and Tokyo The relationship between the between will continue to deepen.
East Asian affairs expert at the University of Foreign Languages, Joelatkinson, said: "The actions of China and North Korea are the key factor to promote South Korea and Japan." He also believes that because Beijing and Pyongyang stubbornly insist on himself. Line ", the relationship between Seoul and Tokyo will continue to heat up.
resistance from domestic politics from Korea 
Although experts generally believe that the second summit of the two leaders shows that it will further strengthen the bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea, some people expressed doubts about the long -term prospects of this relationship, and they are worried that Yin Xiyue lacks public support. Progress caused obstacles.
As an expert in East Asian affairs, Atkinson, a Korean University of Foreign Languages, said: "Yin Xiyue is easily described as a pro -Japanese faction by the opposition party.
 In August 2019, a large number of South Korean people held protest demonstrations in front of the Japanese Embassy in Korea, asking Japanese officials to formally apologize to Japanese workers in Japan during World War II.
According to him, this visit may give Yin Xiyue's critics more pragmatic, and it may also show him to Korean voters that the two countries are developing in a way that is conducive to South Korea. Atkinson told Germany: "In the long run, whether the summit will strengthen the relationship between the two countries depends on the response of the Korean public."
On the other hand, Japan is still cautious about advancing relations with South Korea. In 2018, Yin Xiyue's former Wen Zaiyin ruling, the South Korean court ruled that the two Japanese companies had compensated some of the former Korean employees on the forced labor during World War II, causing disputes between the two countries.
"(Tokyo) I hope that Yin Xiyue's government will be successful, but they are worried that he may not be re -elected." Najib of Japan International Christian University said, "Therefore, Japan is very cautious in how to deepen the relationship with South Korea. Consolidate the stable factors. "
Because Tokyo had 35 years of colonial occupation on the Korean Peninsula in 1945, the relationship between Japan and South Korea has long been in disputes. The atrocities made by the Japanese militarium government, including sexual slavery and forced labor, made reconciliation very difficult. Although Yin Xiyue tried to establish a closer relationship with Japan on the basis of joint focus on the security challenges caused by North Korea and China, he faced continuous criticism because he made concessions to Tokyo.
Li Zaiming, the leader of the co -Democratic Party of South Korea, said: "The normalization of relations between South Korea and Japan is necessary. I agree with this, but it cannot be at the expense of our national interests, national dignity, history, and justice." His presidential election in 2022 was elected Zhong Yi's weak disadvantage lost to Yin Xiyue.
The United States is the " bonding agent " of the United States in the United States " 
Although Tokyo and Seoul are facing some challenges in promoting bilateral relations, experts said that the United States plays an important role in helping the two countries to promote bilateral relations. Professor Atkinson said: "The White House's approach is to encourage speech and inspire the progress of the reputation with the close relationship with the US President."
Atkinson told Germany that the most valuable support that the United States can provide is military deterrence because North Korea and China are unwilling to fight against the United States. He said: "The cooperation between South Korea and Japan shows that they are more willing to support each other in the crisis, and the United States rewards Seoul by agreeing with more risks."#

Selling weapons to Taiwan 
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it is the main military supporter of Taiwan. For decades, Washington has sold "defensive" weapons to Taiwan based on the "Relations with Taiwan". After August last August, after the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States House, Plogsi visited Taiwan, the Chinese PLA launched the largest real -scale military exercise in the surrounding waters around Taiwan for decades. Then in September, the Bayeng government announced the 6th degree of Taiwan military sales case worth 1.16 billion US dollars. The US Ginseng Institute also passed the "National Defense Authorization Act" at the end of last year. The law plans to send US government officials to Taiwan to strengthen the bilateral cooperation of the United States and Taiwan.
Professor Najib of Japan's International Christian University added that in addition to the United States, other like -minded democratic countries also believe that the relationship between South Korea and Japan needs to surpass historical disputes and should try more cooperation. He said: "The United States is the adhesive to maintain dialogue between the two countries, but the governments of many other countries are also working hard to encourage the cooperation between the two countries."
Due to a similar vision for maintaining the rules -based order in the Indo -Pacific region, Najib believes that South Korea and Japan can cooperate with his like -minded countries to create a wider range of political economy in the Indo -Pacific region. These efforts can be implemented through multilateral cooperation such as "small bilateral cooperation" between four to five countries or multilateral cooperation like Yintai's economic framework.
"Rather than saying that China is the center of the economy in the region, we can see that more regional cooperation is becoming the center of the economy of Southeast and South Asia." He told Germany and added that when China loses the asymmetric economic advantages, South Korea and Japan and other countries will be more capable of balanced China ’s scale and military challenges in the Indo -Pacific region.

Some public opinion believes that after a large number of social elites in China, after experiencing the three -year epidemic control measure, trying to immigrate overseas intended to establish a new life model, it is also one of the reasons for the reduction of the northern, upper, wide, and deep population.
Wu Qiang said: "After the epidemic, everyone discussed that the phenomenon of China's middle class 'moist' has a direct relationship with the reduction of the population of these four major cities."
"Phoenix flew away, now recruit some birds in"
At present, the Shanghai Municipal Government has recruited master's degree from Peking University, Tsinghua University and other provinces and municipalities, and promised to provide household registration for these talents.
In this regard, Guo Zhisen, a scholar who had just returned from Shanghai to Japan from Shanghai, said in an interview with this station that he saw several friends in Shanghai very depressed, and wanted to go abroad: "All live in the country are very depressed, they live very stressful , Shanghai also to add people to make up for the position. The north, Shang, Guang, and deep personnel have lost too much. Their government is not a bird to change the birds. The Phoenix flew away, and now some birds come in. "
Guo Zhisen said that the economic environment and development speed of first -tier cities in China can no longer return.
Shanghai recruit high -quality students from all over the country to save real estate 
Regarding the Shanghai Government's invitation to a master's degree in universities in various places, Gorina, graduates of Shanghai Fudan University, told this station that in the past, Beijing and Shanghai households were very attractive to young people, but it was not what it used to be. She said that the Shanghai government hopes that high -end talents will settle in Shanghai to buy a house: "In April, the transaction price of second -hand housing in Shanghai fell by about 40%in the second and March. To be able to settle in Shanghai, you must buy a house. Because the previous few times, the house prices in Shanghai were speculated because of similar policies. "
 Dozens of masters of universities across the country have settled in the local area. (Network picture/ancient pavilion provided) Wu Qiang believes that in the process of economic globalization, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen's economy has achieved rapid development and has become the most attractive city in China, but the advantages of the above cities no longer exist. He said: "The decrease in the population of four large cities is actually showing the decoupling of China and globalization. This kind of gradually driving away from the decline of Chinese cities, especially Shenzhen, which has attracted a lot in the process of China's reform and opening up. The population of young people and elite has attracted capital. Now it means that big cities in China have fallen into death, and China and globalization have begun. "

 According to the Thai Election Commission, among the 52 million qualified voters in the country, the voting rate of this election was 75.2%, a record high.
The final victory and defeat have not been revealed 
However, Reuters reported that no political party is currently expected to directly form a new government, because the Thai military has revised the parliamentary system after the Thai military launched a coup in 2014, which has benefited it to the military government.
According to the new system of Thailand's election, the new Prime Minister voted from the 250s of the House of Communist Party of China and the 500 CCP of the House of Communist Party of China to win the voting of more than half of the parliament members, that is, 376 votes.

Reuters reported earlier that Beidong Tower said that he was happy for the APIC, but it was too early to discuss alliances. "The voice of the people is the most important."
 In this election, the two main pro -military party led by the Thai Prime Minister Ba Yu won only 76 seats, reflecting the general dissatisfaction with the government.
Thai politics will start a new bureau 
The result of this election was a heavy blow for the military government. The current Prime Minister of Thailand launched a coup in 2014 in 2014, which has been in power for 9 years. He has emphasized the government's continuity in the campaign and warned that the government's alien motion may lead to more conflicts.
Before the election, the outside world predicts that the military and political power will be defeated, Bayu will step down, and believes that the Thai party is the most winning face, because since each election since 2001, it has won the most votes for the Thai party, including two overwhelming properties, including two overwhelming properties. Victory.
Although in the 4th government governed by the Thai party, However, the party is still very popular in the working class. They advocate restoration of cheap medical care, small loans, and generous agricultural subsidies, hoping to re -control power with overwhelming advantages.

 On the spring and summer of 1989, students from colleges and universities in Beijing gathered in Tiananmen Square to fight for democracy, and thousands of students launched a hunger strike. Agencence France -Presse "Many people's June 4th" and "One person's June 4th" 
On the 6425th anniversary, the poet Meng Lang edited and published a "Choice of the June Fourth Poems", which included a hundred poetry of poets in the Chinese circle to commemorate the June 4th poetry. In the preface of the book, Meng Lang explained the original intention of the selection of the collection of poems: as a huge historical existence, it was also a huge spiritual existence. The absence of the poet, the absence of the poet, and the absence of poetic justice are shocking and regrettable. " This collection of poems is to fill this regret.
There are many thrilling poems in this concentration of noisy poems. For example, the poet Mars wrote: "In the legend, the ashes were flushed away in the sewer/as to whether anyone entered the sewer/can they leave alive? This is another problem ... ... The sewer is our total/despair. And hope, the entrance and exit of the world. "Indeed, China is a sewer, from the tank man to Cao Shunshi, from Liu Xiaobo to Peng Lifa, all disappeared into the sewer. Then, the sewage sewage is discharged to the world. People in the Western world think that as long as 1.4 billion Chinese people are satisfied with entertaining themselves in the watery sewer that smelly, they do not have to control them. However, the "yellow scourge" never retreats to the country. After thirty years of slaughter, the scene of the massacre was repeated on the streets of Hong Kong. Then, artificial viruses from China harmed the world, but China taught the world to "copy homework" to it all over the world. The followers are that WeChat, Douyin, and Pinduoduo instantly capture the United States and Western countries. These new inventions with Chinese characteristics have extremely evil charm, which is more harmful than traditional drugs. All of this, the scourge is in June 4th and the indifference to the June 4th. For those who do not look at the mastery and cover their ears and steal the bells, the clock will ring every inch of land on the music you think.
A Salvado writer used three V Spanish words to describe Salvador: VioLenta, VIL, and Vacía. Salvador's exile writer Moya once quoted the words of the dead poet Rog Dalton. "We are not born from a seed, or a egg, but a pustules." It will be said that we are also the product of the massacre. "In the context of China, this sentence can be replaced: who is not the product of the June 4th slaughter? Like me, like Wang Yi, Su Xiaohe is also the "late person of June 4th". It's not because of cowardice, but because of age. We are just a few years younger than the child of Tiananmen's mother. Otherwise, it may be us who died on the streets of Beijing, and our mother will become the mother of Tiananmen innocently. Wang Yi in prison said: "The reason why I can become an intellectual is because I am the son of June 4th. Someone said how old you are. One of the minors. At the beginning, you murdered, can't you avoid high school students like me? "This is also Su Xiaohe's vast mind -how to commemorate June 4th?
Salvador's poet Dalton had been killed before the civil war, but he recorded the 1932 Holocaust in a poem entitled "Us" -a cruel suppression of the death of 30,000 uprising farmers and was in Repeated in the poems over and over again, "We are all descendants of 1932" -This metaphor is like Su Xiaohe, I and Wang Yi, who often described themselves as the "son of eight or nine". China is not better than Salvador's civilization and modernity. Like Salvador, "violence has always been the most commonly used method for people to solve differences and become part of social culture." As a result, death has become the only way to get rid of slavery or abandon the sin. Su Xiaohe wrote: "Death must be early/only people who die in advance/hope to become angels ./ I envy those classmates who are pressed by the tank/ Their sin is over before the body. "This is the biggest sadness of all sadness. Only this kind of sorrow can be written as a sorrow. As a result, Su Xiaohe wrote a person's sorrow alone, just as Gao Xingjian wrote his own "Lingshan" alone.
Will the sister -in -law be afraid of poetry? 
After the slaughter, what is possible to write a poem? This is a problem in Germany and China. When I thought that German politicians who were completely liquidated to the Nazi sin ran to the Nazi upgraded version of the Beijing pilgrimage, when the slave workers who used the Nazi concentration camp to make a fortune of the German industrial giants continued to use Chinese slave workers to make greater wealth today. There is no poetic in this world.
Asnano said that after Osvex, he wrote poetry is brutal. One of its examples: Hitler likes to listen to Beethoven's ninth symphony. Amo wrote in the study of Beethoven: "Hitler and the ninth symphony: let's hug, hundreds of millions of people." Of course, there is a even more shocking example: in the Hollys Memorial Hall of the Lauphon Monastery, there is a line of text next to the Tyedling Poetry Collection. The Eastern Battlefield encourages the "patriotic passion" of German soldiers.
However, Adono's "culture and barbaric dialectics" did not be established. Beethoven is not guilty, and Hollylin is not guilty; music is innocent and poetry is not guilty. German scholar Walter Yanas said intriguingly: "When there is no Oschidine, Kafka is already in Oschidin." The poetic doctor ruled the barbaric, as Emirih said in the "Celan Biography": "After the massacre, only the fabric weaving from this is only derived from the text structure of this" foundation "can ; Everything is based on mourning, based on the source of tears, this is the prerequisite for literary creation after 1945. "In the pages of the" Qi "book published in 1967, Celan wrote down A paragraph: "Do not write poetry after Oswelin (Abado): What do you think of" Poetry "here?"Facts are better than arguments. Celan wrote poems worthy of Auschwitz's disaster, such as the "Death Fuge". In the "Negative Dialectics" published in 1966, Perhaps because of Celan, Adono amended his previous saying: "People who have suffered a day after day have the right to express their rights, like a torture People have the right to scream. Therefore, you ca n’t write poems after the Oschovin concentration camp, which may be wrong. "
After Auschwitz, he still needs to write poems; after Tiananmen slaughter, he still needs to write poems. In the sense of "Poetry is a challenge to the sister -in -law", Su Xiaohe's poetry is like a dagger and a shot, cutting the tyrant's paintings, the grand leader, helmsman, mentor, core -Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, All beasts are restored to devour all things and even eat people. The image of "eating people" in Lu Xun's novels frequently appeared in Su Xiaohe's verse- "Your hunger is deep, but your teeth are stuffed with your baby's body. Eat time/eat people, eat grass and trees, eat stars, and/how many years you can eat yourself. "Beast eats yourself, it is the fate of the beast: Mao Zedong just died and became a" counter -revolutionary family ". Xi Jinping Since childhood, he has been marked with the "counter -revolutionary family". "How many lives do you have to kill alone will be called a hero with history ... ... Many years later, I saw him become a killer/before people thought that he was a scholar ./ Many years later I was revived The door saw him selling a baby/then in the wooden land, and saw him killing the boy again./Later, I went to Xuanwumen and saw the corner of his mouth. After all, it is the scholar. "Not only is the historian taught by Jiang Qing on Monday, but also the golden signboard of Wang Huning, Wang Huning, the" Three Generations of the National Division "-s at the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, he is the only professor of political science.
Only the things written under the drive of anger are worth retaining 
Different from the previous lyrical "Xiao Ya Ge", "Tiananmen Lye" is not a collection of poems that can bring a pleasant reading -just as the sorrow in the Old Testament, and the sorrow is originally a painful style. If you do n’t have a strong heart, you dare not open this collection of poems.
Reading Su Xiaohe's sorrow is like reading Moya's novels full of violence. Political and social violence exists in the air where the two writers themselves have to breathe, constitute an indispensable part of their personal experience, and they must face the daily reality and the existence of difficult existence. In Moya, characters often suffer from severe persecution delusion. They always suspect that they have been monitored and tracked. On another occasion, he explained his language style like this: "I live in a violent reality, a rough and ugly reality, where the crime is regarded as the highest value, and the whole society is dominated by the worst nature of human beings. ... I need to find a style of writing that can pass on such a realistic writing. Yes, I cannot adopt it. For example, Gentler's exaggerated style, or the Baroque style, tells how a person's head is connected to the head. There are several types of bullets, because it is in reality: bang, bang, bang, that's it. "In October 2018, in an interview with the editor -in -chief of the" Love Hehua Literature "magazine, Moya also pointed out: "Violence is part of the tendency of people's innate, and civilization is a process that controls it and finds it another export. I come from a place where violence still needs to be tamed by civilization. The killing behavior of one of the most serious manifestations is endless, and it is not uncommon. As a fictional literature creator ... Describing violence itself is never my purpose. I am interested in digging people's hearts and observing human enthusiasm for violence for violence. How is it rising a little bit? "
Similarly, Su Xiaohe also comes from a place where violence and trampling civilization unscrupulously. Even the highest rulers were victims of prisons, but after they took power, they desperately stamped the prison, and even turned every city, every community, and each high -rise building into prison. After the Tiananmen slaughter, the people were scared, domesticated, and voluntarily slavery. The principle that people followed was not what Kafka said "holding up means everything", but what Yu Hua and Mo Yan said. Do everything. " Angry became a scarce quality. Mother Teresa's famous saying "love until injury" may be modified to "anger until injury". I read anger in Su Xiaohe's poem- "I walked from the world to the world with my heart/my heart full of inexplicable anger." No need to suppress or cover up the anger, as Moa said The written things are worth retaining; once the tenderness emerges, you will no longer be yourself. "The poet was angry and sorrowful.
Gun, bullets, tanks, fire, knife, blood, blood, incurable disease, grave, ash, virus, death, ghost, cell, Tiananmen, blood bubbles full of blood, corrupt bodies ... When Lye ", readers will continue to encounter these words, as if they are hit by a wave of thunder and lightning. "When people walk through the flowers full of flowers/you will not know, a red rose under/last year's death is rotten in the soil this year." "She first planted a few carnations in the wooden land/ /Then I walked towards the sound of gunfire ./ Every time Aunt Ding did this/she could hear the sound of gunfire ./ I just thought it was an illusion/later after investigation and analysis/proved that the gunfire was ringing. "" I prayed The dead teenager must be resurrected/his body will not die/he will become a mirror of this country. "In China, there is no need to go to the cinema to watch horror movies. The reality is a horror movie one after another. Su Xiaohe is a poet and a photographer. He faithfully recorded the terrorist incidents from the square to the countryside. The iron chain woman who was imprisoned as a slave and a maternal machine had a grass -snake gray line between tragedy and tragedy. If you do not explore the source, you may be reduced to the protagonist of the next tragedy.
Like a baby, crying while crying, he shouted his father’s name 
However, the only angry poetry is not a good poem. In addition to anger, compassion, comfort and hope.
The two cities of Soma and Gomorra were deeply criminal. People complained that God would destroy them. Abraham pleaded with God, "Will you forgive that city for the fifty -righteous people?" After getting God's promise, he had to go into a bargain and continue to bargain from God. Forty -five, twenty, and even ten, in the end God promised: "For the sake of those ten people, I will not destroy that city."We are not the murderers on the square, nor are we murdering orders, wearing white gloves, and spitting along the place. However, as a Christian, Su Xiaohe understood that we were part of the heinous sin of China after June 4th, and we were not outside of these sins. We need memory and confession. Although God's grace is given in vain, how can the door open if you don't knock on the door? Su Xiaohe is writing poems and knocking on the door.
The poetry after Tiananmen Massacre does not require cheap lyric, no illusory justice, but the tears and sorrows of sorrows and sorrows flowing into the river. In this poem concentration, the soul song, pigeon, spring, flowers, rain, olive trees, starry sky, angels, mothers, friends, babies, girls, salt, children's songs, hometown ... High frequency appears- "Pigeons flying at low altitude, ants swimming in dust/they comfort each other, like a long -lasting scenery." "We go together, take the desolate road/strive to arrive early, the next ferry. "" Let me love you, I love the world for many years,//then people have a lot of people, all over the earth./A face, like rain flowing in the sky,/every drop of rain, all have their own own own. Meaning. "," Go back, don't look back, don't look back/like a baby crying, calling his father's name while crying. "" Like a lamb to eat olive branches, and then encounter the wolf group/when you stop, the sufferings in this life will be It's over. "These verses, washed the lead, faced the sky, did not show off any skills and words, but just to accept God's light humility, it was enough to soothe people. Mountain darkly, vista. The apes on both sides of the strait couldn't cry, and the light boat had exceeded the mountains. Without God's intervention, China would not be able to get rid of the historical cycle of "ghost push", and the Chinese could not end their life's suffering.
I am not a poet, but I know that the poet is like a doctor; I do n’t write poems, but I know that good poems are like medicine. When Manema talked with Sol Bely, a close friend of decades like a day, the latter defined "in writing, my job is myself", he pursued "Kafka said "The big and clear answer" - "In writing, all these are about what is true and what you can believe, what you can believe, and what you can't believe, all become real, and then you have it, and then you have it. The volunteer is bright and the ground is found out for them. "Looking forward to Su Xiaohe to continue writing, because it must be an eulogy after the sorrow.

 For a few weeks, policy makers, bankers and White House have been warned that the United States is on the verge of debt defaults. Debtition may cause serious consequences, including the decline of the economy and triggering global financial risks.
The Congressional Budget Office predicts on the 12th that if Congress cannot reaching an agreement on raising the upper limit of government expenditure and Biden, the United States may default on debt by June 15.
Wally Adeyemo, deputy minister of Finance, said, "We shouldn't go to such fields in the" State of theunion "of" CNN "talk show" State of THEUNION "today.
He reiterated the government's position and called on members to end the deadlock to raise the US debt to raise debt.
He said: "If Congress cannot increase the upper limit of debt bonds before reversing debts, we will fall into a recession, which will be a big disaster."
"The United States has never reversed debt, and it is not enough now."
Biden and Republican leaders have been extended to the new round of debt -raising the upper limit of debt bonds from all walks of life to this week.
Ediemo admits that the "constructive" staff level negotiation is underway, but it does not agree that the Republican party says that Biden does not want to control the federal budget.
He said: "The president has drawn a 10 -year plan to delete the $ 3 trillion deficit." This refers to worshiping the proposed budget announced in March.
He said that Congress leader should try to finalize the fiscal policy agreement. "But at the same time as the dialogue, there is no reason not to increase the upper limit of debt bonds and avoid the country's debt. The debt reverse may cause serious recession and lead to millions of people unemployment." (Translator: Zheng Shiyun/Calculate: Chen Zhengyi)

 Chinese Ambassador to France, Lusha Ye Reuters picture After Emperor Xi, the diplomacy of the Communist Party of China showed the aggressive provocative style, and the popular movie "War Wolf" just reflected this style. Therefore, the international community called the CCP's diplomacy " "" ".
The very hot diplomat, Lu Shaye, was even more popular, adding a strong stroke to the Fortune Wolf Diplomacy. When talking about Crimea's belonging, Lu said: "From the perspective of international law, it can even be said that those former Soviet countries have no effective international law status because there is no international agreement to determine their status as a sovereign state." Minghuo's arbitrarily denied the sovereignty of the former Soviet franchisees such as Ukraine and rectified Russia's aggression. It is even more domineering than Russian diplomats. Ambassador Lu's name Sakano and "Sakano" are highly homophonic, and the foreign diplomacy may become popular words.
Some commentators believe that the remarks of Lu and other fighting wolf diplomats have damaged the interests of the CCP country, which should be played by them. In fact, at the beginning of the Xi, he positioned himself as a great rejuvenation, and he must also build a "community of human destiny". It is necessary to promote the "dare to bright sword" of a tough country. He said to foreign reporters: "Some foreigners who have been full of doing things are pointed at our affairs. China does not output the revolution, and the two will not output hunger and poverty. "This is the remarks template of the wolf diplomat. Therefore, Wang Yi, who has a distinctive posture, was promoted from the Foreign Minister to the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, and was promoted to a member of the Politburo at the age of 69 to become a member of the Politburo and ranked among the highest power institutions. Qin Gang, who is also counted as a war -fighting wolf, has been improved. From the deputy ministerial level, the deputy ministerial level, the current State Councilor and Foreign Minister, have become the youngest vice -national leaders of the Chinese Communist Party today. Besides, after Lushaya's remarks in Senegal in Senegal, in 2009, they were promoted to African Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the entrance to the stage, the deputy mayor in Wuhan increased the experience and qualifications in 2015 and 2016. He is the director of the Policy Research Bureau of the Central Foreign Affairs Leading Group of the Central Foreign Affairs Work Leading Group. Lu's remarks were strongly condemned by the international community, and 80 members of the European Parliament issued an open letter, calling on the French government to list Lusha as a "unpopular figure" and expel the country. But the official statement of the Chinese Communist Party is still a circle with a circle.
Xi Emperor continued to be the dream of the Chinese Empire who was over the world, and the dream built a community of human destiny, so his wolf diplomatic or wild diplomacy would not converge.
Recently, the CCP diplomats in Canada have collected Canadian lawmakers and family members of the family, which has been exposed, which has triggered strong anti -China emotions in Canada. Not long ago, the diplomats in the UK beating the Hong Kong people, and so on. This series of incidents show that the war wolf is not limited to the label gun, but the country is stretched out of his teeth to bite. Battle wolf's teeth grinned the world to alert the world!Make the world abandon!
The Emperor Xi will be the enemy of the world regardless of the trend of history. It is inevitable to drag China into the abyss with the wolf that follows the wolf. It is impossible for the Chinese people to suffer and pay a heavy price for this.

 Buying a house Real Estate is one of the important part of the "American Dream" in many people's hearts
(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In the past few days, major American Chinese information websites have reportedly reported that "Louisiana prohibits Chinese people from buying rental houses", and Chinese students who stay in the United States to find a work forum "one acre and three points" There are related posts, and the WeChat groups of hundreds of Chinese people where the reporters are located also discussed this matter with a warm discussion. Some people replied that "I didn't expect renting a house." New Century China Election Act.
However, most of these information that reposted and shared between the Chinese communities were not very comprehensive, and it lacked some key modifications and supplements after the bill was proposed. For example, the HB537 Act of Louisiana, the latest version of the bill of bills, only retains hostile countries that are hostile to the United States -including China (including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela -Buy The restrictions on leasing or acquisition of land have been canceled the restrictions on "individuals who have hostile countries that are hostile to the United States". This means that even if the bill is approved, the Chinese government will be restricted, Chinese companies or other entities, not individuals. The bill has not yet become a law, but a hearing was held by the state House of Representatives on May 15th. After the hearing, it still needs to be approved by voting and the governor to become a law.
Texas and other states have not yet been completed 
"These self -media know nothing about legislative procedures." Ms. Qin, who lives in Austin, Texas, is very disappointed with these self -media and bloggers who have not been truthfully reported. The opposition between Chinese and Americans is also opposed by Chinese people and Chinese people in China, and the opposition between Chinese people living in the United States "Blue State and" Red State ". She believes that these self -media rumors are not conducive to the real organization of the Chinese to protest these bills. "For example, some bills have not passed yet, but have completed a certain process. Since the media said 'passed', those who read the article will feel that the bill has become a foregone conclusion. Then go to fight. "Ms. Qin said that if these self -media really want to speak for the Chinese in the United States," that should call on the Chinese to participate in political issues, even if they call local members of the local members. "
Mr. Zheng, who lives in Dallas, has begun to protest the SB147 bill in Texas in the process of legislation since January. In the original version of the SB147 Act, it limits the purchase of land for Chinese citizens, but so far, the US green card holder has been exempted from outside, and it has also allowed Chinese citizens to buy houses used for self -occupation. He believes that this concession is related to many Chinese people's persistent protests. He didn't care much about local politics before he started forming a group with the Chinese who had the same ideas. He told reporters that there are lawyers in the group and real estate developers related to interests, but most people are "Xiaobai" that do not know much about American politics. Know. The organization in the group is relatively loose. Some people have spent a lot of time to call and write publicity copywriting, but many people are not willing to invest too much time and money. Even many people are targeting other political issues on other political issues. There are also differences in their views. But everyone still has the idea of seeking common ground while shelving differences, and they can make a force. "We have a parade. After finding a phone call on the Internet, we will call to protest, or drive the hearing scene after the time when the bill of hearing is found." Although the current bill no longer affects his and his family in the United States in the United States , But he decided to continue to protest. "Because after more and more bills, discrimination against the Chinese will become more and more common. People will discriminate against you if you look at your appearance, and you will not know that you are a American citizen, the US green card, or only a US visa. "
Florida Act Passing the Chinese to continue fighting 
Other similar bills in the legislative procedures include the HB379 Act of Alabama, and the Florida Act SB264 has been signed by the governor De Santis as a law and is formally implemented on July 1 this year. The countries that are restricted in the bill include China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and Syria, but only Chinese citizens are restricted to buying land and houses in the whole state of Florida. However, there are also exceptions. The green card holder is not affected. Chinese people with US visas (except for tourism visas) can buy real estate less than two hectares for living.
 Governor of Florida Desantis has signed a limitation of a Chinese house buying bill (information picture)
The bill passed through the overwhelming inheritance rate of 95:17 in the Florida Senate. The supported members believed that the bill protected US national security. The Chinese Rights Protection Organization "Chineseamerican Legal Defenseall" stated that it would immediately start legal procedures in order to overthrow the discriminatory bill. The organization wrote in its WeChat public account article: "We expected to go to the Florida court about a week to prosecute the case and submit to the court to prevent the law from taking effect." After the WeChat ban was released, the "US WeChat User Federation", which was established by five Chinese lawyers, including Zhu Keliang, Cao Ying, Yuan Gang, Ni Fei, and Wu Shengyang. They sued President Trump and asked the court Essence On March 3 this year, the organization published on the official website of "the presence of a donation proposal to overthrow the preparation of Chinese people from purchasing the real estate bill". Now Georgia's bill has no longer continued to advance, and Texas' bill has not yet become a law. As of the evening of May 14th, the organization raised more than 110,000 US dollars on the GofundMe of the crowdfunding platform.
However, the Chinese group's position on this issue is not "iron plate". In the American Chinese community, there are many influential self -media "Mo Shang America" and wrote: "The bill does not affect Chinese residents who have legal visas living in the United States to buy their own housing." The blogger believes that the bill "focuses on restricting many countries that are hostile to the United States to buy land in the United States." He also believes that the WeChat article does not explain that the bill is not clear about Chinese residents or Chinese citizens who have legal status in the United States. The article stated that what Chinese in the United States should do not propagate how the United States excludes Chinese, but "to urge the Chinese to supervise their government to improve Sino -US relations, and remove it from the list of 7 countries as soon as possible."

The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.

 At the end of 2021, four national referendums in Taiwan were held. Zhang Zhewei, a member of the DPP legislators Su Qiaohui, went to the market to preach to publicize the policy direction of the ruling team to the public. (The photo is provided by Zhang Zhewei)
(Voice of Germany Chinese) "The ideal state is that Taiwan can only discuss the left and right under Taiwan, instead of discussing China and Taiwan under Taiwan." Imagination of future election campaigns: One day, the election can return to the pure left and right factions, not the choice between Taiwan and China.
He said, "If our candidates are like this, they will always talk about China, and there is no way to return to discussions that only exist in Taiwan ... You will always be as long as you just play the opposite card, and no one will be discussing ( What is really good to Taiwan). "
In an interview with DW, You Shanmin said that he did not talk about the most "dreamy" part of "The Candidate", which may make some people feel that this play has less flavor. However, in this way, the drama can show "the image of normal topic discussion", which also allows Taiwan's political workers to struggle and choose from the role of the play in the election campaign to resonate and heal themselves.
For the audience on the other side of the Strait, the workplace reality that interacts with the boss in the drama of "The Candidates" may be able to suffer, but the daily practice of Taiwan's election campaigns and democracy may be unimaginable. You Shan Min described that for China, it can be said to be "overhead and fantasy."
Although there is only the word in the play, I do not talk about independence, Essence Many Chinese people managed to turn over the wall to chase dramas. Some Weibo users lamented that the drama on both sides of the strait "completely out of the feeling of different ways to do nothing."
Some Chinese netizens expressed their envy: "Envy the kind of prosperous and noisy passion, envy that there are waves to create, there are" things "to do, envy them, at least the possibility of stepping up and changing changes." Another netizen suffered deeply. The feminine power in the play is impacted, but in contrast to "Utopia in the TV series" and "the reality that cannot be changed", this drama "seeing people's bloody and so on."
 You Shanmin, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party New Media Center, stood in front of the Party's Central Party Department.
Taiwan Political Affairs in Reality 
If you jump out of the parallel time and space of the drama, the DPP Central Party Department who actually enters Taipei City will find many overlap. There are quite a lot of young party workers like You Shanmin in their 20s to 30 years old; the decoration on each person's table is not much different from the general workplace office workers, but the rainbow flags inserted next to the seats, as well as encouraging voting slogans hanging on the wall. Understand the beliefs and value of political workers.
Between the office on the 8th floor and the 10th floor, You Shanmin stepped on sports shoes and stepped down familiarly. In him, you can feel the restrained characteristics of political staff, low -key, not publicity, and he would rather be hidden behind the curtain. In the office here, the real -world "waves" set up a drama boom and grasped a wave of waves.
In early May, the DPP presidential candidate Lai Qingde took a "stills" here, and You Shanmin, who was holding a camera, rarely showed up in front of the camera with other party workers. He said that this is almost the political propaganda of "Belle", which not only shows the development of the party's support for Taiwanese dramas, but also highlights the young image, and creates a symbol of unity of candidates standing with the party workers.
However, it is not that the DPP has set up this wave of trends. On social media, the Kuomintang played a wave of "scammer" offensive, criticizing the DPP's vacant commitment to crack down on fraud, and failed to solve practical problems.
How to fight? Staff: as a candidate ammunition store 
With the upsurge of the show, right Obviously it is not a major influencing factor, but through the "Cultural and Promotion and War" outside the play, the people of Taiwan have a glimpse of how the election campaign played.
In Taiwan, the practice of democratic politics not only rely on the election campaign, but also to communicate with the public every day by political workers. From the online cultural propaganda and discussion of offensive and defense, to the voters' services at the grassroots level, there are many different "battlefields" in politics, and the staff have their own "battle positions" to make the waves higher than a party or candidate, the better.
You Shanmin with the background of food science, received in 2014 [] Inspired and started to care about politics, to Later, he chose to participate in political work. At the beginning, he joined the DPP Youth Department, and later served as a assistant to local lawmakers. He described his "battle position" in this way: "I'm here to be your (candidate) ammunition library, then you just go to shoot. But I will not be the person who shoots."
In the same era, it is not only You Shanmin who has become a political staff member. From the end of 2018 to 2019, Taiwan has experienced the volatile of the election, witnessed Essence At the time , Trigger a new wave of doubts about the Chinese United Front. On the occasion of this, Hong Kong's "anti -delivery of China" movement was surging; seeing the Hong Kong police strongly suppressed the Hong Kong democratic school, 。

Zhang Zhewei, director of the news department of the Democratic Progressive Party legislator Su Qiaohui, told DW that he was still serving as a soldier in early 2019 and felt a strong sense of "crisis survival."
May that year, On the eve, Su Zhenchang, then president of the executive president, called on the legislators of the same party to take care of the pressure and voted a key vote at the "historic moment". Call by that remark, Zhang Zhewei said: "If it is part of this system, it can make this country and society have more vision, or to continue doing things for the party and government with the concept of progressive ... … No matter what you do, I am willing to do it. "
Just like Cai Yi'an in the play of "Candidates", Zhang Zhewei is also born in the social department. He cares about social issues and has longing for changing society. After retiring, he participated in the election campaign of legislators and assisted Social movement Lai Pinyu for the election. He used the "salesman" to compare his role at that time. He wanted to stand on the road, run the night market, sweep the streets and worship the streets, and sell the "candidate" product.
"How do you sell this product and let the voters pay for it, relying on the content of this product, such as the voter service, such as the place you fight for the construction, such as the results you ask for politics in Congress." Zhang Zhewei said The legislators of the legislators are also sales products, but the characters seem to change from business to marketing advertisements.
In the past few years in the political circle, he has not had no self -doubt. As presented by the drama, "you may do well, but voters don't have to vote for you. This is democratic politics." Zhang Zhewei said that a "tough" political worker cannot lack clear goals. Otherwise, "it will soon be affected, and I feel that" the Internet voice now does not pay attention to these "... In the end, I gradually lost, forgetting what I might actually do at the beginning."

"Creator" embarked on the cusp 
It was the embrace of what he wanted to change that prompted the DPP Taipei City Councilor Wu Peiyi from his past staff to choose to stand up in the local election. Now he also hopes to further invest in the Congress legislator election. She said that when working at the Central Party Department, it was highly divided, but it was like "one person prepared a small party department."The service department was originally a coffee shop. Several staff members sat at the table at the door, staring at the computer screen, talking on the phone; the other staff stood by the bar, showing the promotional graphics and text for members. Wu Peiyi accepted DW interviews in the small room behind. Talking about the original intention of politics, she said: "I hope Taiwan can be like a special country, so I don’t need to be more special As a result, for example, our young people may have a lot of opportunities to communicate with international organizations. "
 DPP Taipei City Councilor Wu Peiyi accepted DW visits at his service office on May 10.
Wu Peiyi said that the politics is not just for the election. "Do you want to experience the pleasure of election, or do you like victory, or start the second day of the election, those things make you really feel enthusiastic?" She said, , But the core of political work is actually to face various interest groups daily.
Wu Peiyi also pointed out that the DPP is now 40 to 60 years old. There are a group of party workers called the "staff generation". After ten years of hidden scenes, these people usually do not appear in the public view. Fighting hard, relying on firm beliefs.
In fact, the Democratic Progressive Party's "staff generation" has many accumulated energy, and they all walk to the scene with the posture of the waves, such as the current legislators Wu Siyao, Zheng Yunpeng and others; Political figures. The Taiwan media "New News" and "Wind Media" had statistics in 2020. Among the current legislators, more than half of the Democratic Progressive Party members have relevant experience, but less than 20 % of the Kuomintang legislators have worked as assistants or staff members.
Among the younger generations, many people have embarked on such a path of participation in politics. Wu Peiyi, 36, pointed out that the DPP's system is more conducive to young people to participate in politics. For example, when she was running for members in 2018, she was weighted by young people under 35 years old in the party nomination stage.
Xie Keyang, a 30 -year -old Kuomintang, also had staff experience. He had been an assistant to the former legislator Wu Zhiyang of the Kuomintang in the past. He is also the sister -in -law of Xie Longjie, a former Tainan City Councilor of the Kuomintang. During the election, he was supported by former Kaohsiung Mayor South Korea Yu and others, but was not elected in the end. In an interview with DW, Xie Keyang said that the Kuomintang's system is indeed not conducive to young people, because the current members have prioritized guarantee that "it is equivalent to fighting each other to fight each other." Whether it can stand out within the party can only be based on the ability.
Korea Yu: "Democratic freedom is not a flood beast" 
The power of change 
Lai Yuyi, who currently serves as a specialist in Taiwan in the Taiwan Office in the Taiwan Office in Freudei Reniman, Germany. Qiu Xianzhi, who had been in Hsinchu City for the "Power of Times" in Hsinchu City during college.
When she was interviewed by DW, she remembered the burden of being physically and mentally related to studying and full -time work at the time. At that time, she swept the streets and ran the market from morning and night, and had to return to school to class, and sometimes she had to meet in the office late at night. "I later my body was broken, I lost 7 kilograms, and then kept my hair, because the pressure was too great at that time ... plus the election selection lost, so you will be a little traumatic."
Perhaps as the line says in the drama of "candidate": "Elections really hurt my life." Facing the labor conditions with long working hours and low salary, it is a test of the physical strength and spirit of young political staff in Taiwan. Essence But even if I chose other career paths later, memories of fighting alongside comrades in the past will not be so easy to disappear.
The 318 Sunflower Movement in 2014 prompted many young people in Taiwan to enter politics. Lai Yuyu said that she and a few friends she met at the time had a KTV party on March 18 this year. "The people in that space are very similar to" Candidate "... We were also a large box at that time. A group of people sang and drink over there, and some people were talking about some garbage. You know, only we are like us. Strange young people will order the old Taiwanese song at KTV, during the party outside the party ... "
The power of "change" has made many young people in Taiwan willing to stay in the political circle. Zhang Zhewei, a member of the DPP legislator Su Qiaohui, said: "When you jumped down and found that a little change, you will keep doing it all the time."
Can the democratic appearance of Taiwan presented in "Candidates" also bring ideological impact on the other side of the Strait? You Shanmin of the DPP New Media Center said that he would want to say to the Chinese people, "You can see (this play), that's your blessing; you want to be the people in such an environment, then you may be You have to make a little sacrifice. "

The His Holiness Dalai Lama has been bullied shortly long ago. I have a conversation with a Tibetan scholar in Europe, which happened naturally. On April 22, my time here was at night, but it was not late at night. From time to time, a car suddenly increased the cars under the tall floor. For me, this time is my working time. Recently, the Mate tea in Argentina I like to drink has the magical effect of refreshing. The friend's side is day or afternoon. I didn't ask this, but he sent a photo of his environment: Under the clear blue air, there are several pedestrians on the streets of the gravel shop. Green plants and flower pots, he may be sitting in a quiet open -air cafe.
Unexpectedly, we can talk so much. Although influenced by the network speed is too card, our special conversation method, that is, the voice message is not you one sentence, but you a large paragraph of me, as if each spoken style monologue, but the pause is too much too much, but it is too pause to be too paused too much. It is beneficial to each other's thinking and inspiration for a long time. With his consent, I will sort the dialogue and publish it. Here is referred to as his friends.
I first received a picture sent by him. The picture wrote a paragraph in English, Tibetan, and Chinese. Here I am an excerpt from the Chinese part:
If we translate Tibetan words "JIP" ("suction" and "suck") into English, according to a new Tibetan British dictionary, it has at least nine different meanings, none of them and no one or one or one or one or one or one or one or one or it. Sex is related. In Tibet, the word only means to extract something from another thing, such as inhalation, milk absorption (just like a child suck milk from his mother) or pull it out of something. Suffering is caused by the movement of lips, such as "sucking" the child's mouth and tongue. For another example, "mouth" or "hand" and other words, "sucking" itself has never been sexually sex until they are used in sexual behavior. Sexualization of "suction" is a contemporary development, which is the impact of the Tibetans by European and American people through pornography and the normalization of oral sex. 
The following is a conversation with this Tibetan scholar friend--
Friend: I saw your article and wrote well. (He refers to the long text that I wrote from April 16th to 19th, "" Some people throw up the mud, just plant the golden lotus ": this Internet violence for the Dalai Lama for His Holiness ...", published in Recent Free Asia Special Review Column)
Me: Did you write the text on this picture you posted?
Friends: I wrote it, all of which I wrote.
Me: In fact, for our Tibetans, we all know what's going on. His emperors who are compassionate and joking are like grandpa treating children. But the external response is the misunderstanding and solution caused by a cultural differences. What kind of sex is it, it is too ridiculous.
Friend: Yeah, this involves what Tibetans think of sex. Of course, how to treat sex, almost all Tibetans in all parts of Tibetan, that is, the mouth and tongue are not a symbol of sex. This is one aspect; second, the relationship between sex and space, when the Tibetans are expressing sex, is it It may be carried out in public spaces or on the occasion of relatives and friends.
And kissing such actions is very common in some places in Tibetan areas. For example, the shepherds in Guoluo are used to kissing to say hello, just like the French people, kissing their cheeks when they met. These pastoral areas still have this habit of kissing kissing, maybe Lhasa will not kiss, but this is not important.
 Pictures sent by Tibetan scholars and friends. It is important that Tibetans do not take their mouths and tongue as a sexual expression tool. This is very clear from the perspective of anthropology. There is no word of oral sex in the vocabulary of Tibetan. It is interesting to do a study of cultural anthropology. Let's emphasize that Tibetans, no matter which area, did not take their mouths and tongue as a representative of sex. Tibetans don't think of this issue. In the minds of the Tibetan people, the mouth and tongue have nothing to do with sex, so I think the main problem is here.
And in the customs of Tibetans, when expressing love and sex, it is impossible to do it in front of the elders and relatives and friends, nor will it be done on big occasions. Don't say that kissing in front of your parents will not even pull your hands. Of course, not only Tibetans, like Mongolians and Han people, that is to say, Orientals generally do not express this way. Recently, such a thing happened in Switzerland: a Tibetan girl, she grew up in European culture. Her boyfriend was Switzerland. Then in Switzerland, the two loved each other. If you do this in the family, you may not be able to accept it, so there is a quarrel in a girl's family. Parents think that the girl is not ashamed. This is a cultural conflict, even in the family.
And the Dalai Lama, I will not watch yellow videos or the like in my life. I have never received such education from Westerners. It is related to sex.
This is actually very interesting, and it can be seen that the cultural differences between Tibetans and Westerners have emerged. As far as Westerners are concerned, they are not acceptable to their culture. And their criticism of the Dalai Lama this time is typical Orientalism. EdwardWadie Said has a word: Orientalist Gaze(Oriental gaze)That is to say, this is their opinion, it has nothing to do with us, it is their inner projection. They see their mouths as related to sex, this is their understanding. Of course, there are also many examples of sexual harassment of certain clergy in Catholicism. There is some kind of pervert, Sexualizationof Children(Children are sexually sex)Essence
After the Dalai Lama's behavior was interpreted by the outside world, I would like to ask: Isn't the Western world advocating multiculturalism? But this is not reflected, but typical orientalism and racism. Of course, it will feel uncomfortable and painful for the Tibetans, and there will be protests, but this is not a bad thing but a good thing, because the Dalai Lama did not do anything wrong.
There are many scholars studying Tibetan studies around me. They are very embarrassed now because their understanding is wrong!They will find that their understanding of Tibet is actually not enough. They do not understand or understand the culture of Tibet. So some people are embarrassed now, because their initial view of this incident is wrong. But for me, this is a good opportunity. I can study the colonialism, imperialism, power, cultural orientalism, etc. reflected in this matter, so I'm not sad, it's not sad at all. I am not sad. I am not sad. I am not sad. I am not sad. I think this is a good thing.Me: Yes, this incident is a case worth analyzing and commenting for researchers and writers like us. Of course, it is very painful. Because so many people misunderstood the His Holiness Dalai Lama, this is angry and sad, and I cried many times. But now understanding this incident is unusual. You are talking about one aspect, that is, the West's oriental view of Tibet, which is too typical. The West used their own standards and perspectives to look at Tibetan culture, which is the orientalism criticized by Siye.
And the article I wrote is written for the powerful demonization in the Chinese world, especially for the Chinese who are brainwashed by political power. This is more complicated. Conspiracy. Many people are full of malicious thoughts. The most interesting one is the attack of many so -called liberal party Dalai Lama. I refer to those so -called anti -thieves outside China. Those who attacked the Dalai Lama are exactly the same. They are like discussing it. Of course, I believe they may not discuss it, but they are so consistent. Why is this? In fact, many Chinese and many Chinese intellectuals see Tibet and Tibetans are also Oriental. They have always been orientalism. The kind of demons are very skilled in their play, so that their uninvited slander is actually systemic, common, and ingrained.
 On February 28, the Dalai Lama interacted with a little Indian boy. (The picture is taken from the Dalai Lama Hiroshi office) The behavior of His Holiness Dalai Lama, for our Tibetans, we all know what is going on, because this is our culture. Although the customs of all regions in Tibet are slightly different, we all know how it is Rebate is not what they think at all. For example, if you say it, or it is related to the tradition of my mother's guardian, or it is related to the tradition of my father's Kang District, it is normal to the kind expression between my parents. (Touching the amount), oh festival (kissing) is normal. It has nothing to do with sex.
And the mouth, there is such a statement, the mouth is used for chanting, how can you do those things? Just like in the past two days, I said that I wanted to put the signature of Garva Rinpoche on my body. I said that I hadn't tattooed it before, but now I want to put the autograph pattern of Garva Rinpoche on my body. After I said on the Internet, some Tibetans said that they had to tattoo, but some people asked me, saying that I was married. Is it not good to do such things like to do with his wife? I said it should be fine, but if you feel care, you think about it yourself. In fact, Tibetans are very concerned about this aspect. Due to religious reasons, faith, customs, etc., there are actually many boundaries. It's not that there is no boundaries, not that.
All the Dalai Lama who has paid all the life of sentient beings throughout his life cannot be so stigmatized that the vulgar generations who are self -righteous. It must be not allowed. However, we cannot simply say that it is not allowed to be stigmatized, but we need to speak more powerful sounds. This requires calm research, analysis and comments. We can analyze the perspective of various cultures. The perspective of mainstream culture, strong culture, and disadvantaged culture. The perspective of orientalism in the West. The position of Chinese cultural imperialism, and they tried to make great efforts to His Holiness Dalai Lama and Tibetan culture because of attempting to cover up the oppression. In addition, there are some Indian media reactions. Originally, Indian culture has a particularly close connection with Tibetan culture, and the Dalai Lama has lived in India for so many years. It should be said that the Indians have a lot of understanding of the His Holiness and have a minimum understanding of Tibetan culture. What about the reaction? Will there be a religious rejection? There are many religions in India, does it implies the rejection of Tibetan Buddhism?
In these relationships, Tibetans are the weak of the weak. Because Tibetan culture is a disadvantaged culture and non -mainstream culture in the face of the West; in the face of China, because of power, the Tibetan culture is a weak culture, and it is a oppressed culture; In India, Tibetans were weak, because they were in a state of exile, and the state under the fence, which is the state of refugees. His Holiness Dalai Lama is extremely precious for us. The existence of the bodhisattva, but the so -called Internet celebrities in India can be vilified. On the other hand, it can be seen that the Tibetans as refugees today Dilemma.
Then we are Tibetan. A reporter from the Tibetan Ministry of VOA filmed the video. They were completely improper and did not feel that there were any abnormalities, so they would calmly put them on YouTube and Facebook. Of course, we didn't feel anything abnormal when we saw it. I have read it at the time. I think it is normal. I still envy the Indian child. I think he is blessed and gets the care of Garva Rinpoche. So why do we Tibetan consciousness be dismembered by the outside world? Why does the Tibetan media of the American Voice of the United States set off such a big wave of consciousness? Today, this online world that can be unscrupulous for traffic and eyeballs will magnify all kinds of intentional or unintentional distortion, so that it spreads like a virus. (Serial)

 The picture shows the monitoring camera installed on the lamp pillars in Tiananmen Square in Beijing Associated Press picture Recently, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China approved the new version of the Anti -Spy Law in accordance with the requirements of Zhongnanhai. On the eve of the new law, the Communist Party of China has begun to strengthen monitoring of foreign companies and foreign personnel in China. After the Communist Party of China promulgated the Anti -Spy Law in 2014 (referred to as the old version in this article), it continued to arrest foreigners in China for no reason. Recently, the pro -Chinese relatives who have been released to Japan, the left -winged Japanese Socialist Party cadre, Suzuki, have long been responsible for Japan -China exchanges. They have lived in Beijing and worked as a guest professor in many universities in Beijing. He was arrested with a cadre of the group and was arrested. As a result, Suzuki was accused of serving a spy for six years. China now promulgated the new version of the Anti -Spy Law, what is its purpose? This article analyzes this problem.
1. Information and intelligence: Different interpretation of Chinese and English 
Since the second half of the last century, the information society has long been a general vocabulary. The so -called information society refers to the diversification of modern state information communication pipelines, and no longer simply rely on internal documents, cardboard media and television to achieve information circulation; and social media brought by the Internet dominate daily life, cloud computing instead of file storage, etc. Waiting for a new method to make personal activities and business operations a new height.
Information is so important that almost no one can adapt to a life without information. However, few people have thought that the word information can be sinned in China, that is, "spy crime". Because the Chinese Communist Party deliberately confused the two concepts of information with intelligence, and infinitely expand the scope of intelligence in intelligence, so that any information can be interpreted by the CCP as intelligence, and "thorny intelligence" has become the CCP's "spy crime crime" "" ". In this way, the information of public circulation and information that requires confidentiality has no boundaries in China; however, there is a strict difference between Chinese information and English information.
Universities in various countries have the Department of Information Science, as are China, and their English is informationScience; how can it understand this department as a "Department of Intelligence"? Of course, if anyone understands it, college students in science and engineering will laugh, because the knowledge they learn does have nothing to do with "intelligence science". In China, only the institutions of the Ministry of National Security and the Intelligence College of the PLA taught intelligence, which is to cultivate the CCP spy. The English words of information are Intelligence (the English of anti-spy is countr-intelligence), which refers to the content collected by the intelligence agency. In a democratic country, all those who can spread freely are information (information); and public information collecting or dissemination of public information belongs to freedom of speech and freedom of news, and it is completely non -sinus with spy.
However, in China, which has neither freedom of speech and free press, the public information that spreads public or is not included in the scope of confidentiality, but may be convicted as "leak information". What follows is the crime of "spy" behind. Going to the door. Taking economic information as an example, in addition to disclosed various economic data on the press conference and website, it also uses internal reports to publish economic data to government departments. Among them The "Statistics Report" is for high -level reference; at the same time, there are internal reports marked at the "confidential" level. In this type of report, Chinese official media often publicly cited. However, if individuals have not yet cited the official media, they can quote the data in their own speech or article, which will become "leak" and may be investigated. In other words, the same data, official media citations are publicity, and personal citation is "leak".
Two, the new version, the old version of the "Anti -Spy Law" is different? 
Although the media of various countries have reported the new version of the CCP's "Anti -Spy Law", most of them are analyzed based on their own understanding, but there are no international media compared with the "Anti -Spy Law" of the new and old version of the new and old. content? This is very important. Only by analyzing these details can we know what is the true intention of the CCP's new version of the "Anti -Spy Law"? The author compared the provisions of the old version of the "Anti -Spy Law" and the new version of the Anti -Spy Law, and discovered the three characteristics of the new version of the Anti -Spy Law.
First, the new version of the Anti -Spy Law has greatly expanded the scope of national security. The national security that the old version of the Anti -Spy Law is more concerned is mainly the leak of military intelligence. The new version of the "Anti -Spy Law" uses a new concept, called the "overall national security outlook", which lists other information other than military as information related to national security. The so -called "overall national security concept" was proposed by Xi Jinping, including political security, economic security, military security, cultural security, and social security. According to such a extensive range, there is almost nothing that is not national security; even information on cultural and social levels, as long as any point is passed overseas, and the CCP believes that it is not good for themselves, they can use anti -spy law to spread information to the information transmission of information. Patients to rule national security to govern crimes.
Second, the new version of the "Anti -Spy Law" has carefully stipulated the scope of the spy behavior. Any overseas institutions or individuals may be accused of spy activities by the CCP. Although Article 27 of the Old Edition "Anti -Spy Law" refers to spy behavior, it is very simple. In a word, "If foreign institutions or individuals implement spy behaviors, they must be held accountable." The Ministry of Security explained that there is no specific legal basis; the old version of the "Anti -Spy Law" definition of spy activities has not explained one word.
The new version of the Anti -Spy Law turned the old version of this sentence into seven sentences, divided into seven secondary clauses; two of them were some of the old version, and five new sentences were added. Among the newly added secondary clauses, including participating or depending on the tasks of spy organizations or accepting spy organizations, they were entrusted by overseas individuals to obtain the so -called intelligence of the CCP, and the Internet that was considered invasion of China abroad was spy behavior. However, any overseas institution is a spy organization in the eyes of the Communist Party of China. What kind of personal commission is regarded as a spy mission. The new version of the Anti -Spy Law is still not mentioned, leaving the interpretation right to the CCP's Ministry of National Security. Therefore, the Ministry of National Security has unlimited interpretation rights. Who do it want to catch, what crimes do it use for conviction, whether there is evidence, and whether foreign embassies in China have no right to question.
Third, the new version of the Anti -Spy Law announced that the Ministry of National Security can delineate the "security control area", and in the end, those places are "security control areas" and confidential. Foreigners travel to a place, and the CCP can immediately catch people because it illegally enters the "security control area" and endangers national security. Three, the CCP ’s big anti -spy **
The Old CCP's "Anti -Spy Law" was 40, while the new version of the Anti -Spy Law became 71, an increase of more than 40 %. Because the Anti -Spy Law is largely targeted at foreigners, this new version of the Anti -Spy Law immediately attracted the attention of countries around the world.
Will people from all over China be under pressure from this new version of the Anti -Spy Law? Overseas Chinese go to China, whether it is a permanent residence in foreign countries or foreign citizenship abroad, and becomes a foreign Chinese. Do they need to worry about the danger that this new version of the Anti -Spy Law may bring?
Under the rule of law of democratic countries, the judicial system must follow the "innocent presumption", and the behavior that has not been proven by evidence cannot be guilty; and in the Communist countries, the authorities pursue the "guilty presumption". Then collect the evidence. If the evidence is insufficient, then threatens the seductive and allows the convicted person to cooperate with him to plead guilty, or a secret trial, and the outside world will not let the outside world understand the reliability of evidence.
Nowadays, foreign companies in China are very stressful. The daily operations of foreign companies need to master the information of China's market and economic policy changes, and shareholders of foreign companies will require foreign companies to hire third parties to evaluate the operating conditions and business directions of foreign companies. Such a third -party survey of foreign companies involves many aspects such as the merger of enterprises, financial management and supply chain stability. Therefore, many world -renowned consulting companies worldwide have carried out business in China. However, in the name of national security, the CCP has strengthened the monitoring of foreign consulting companies, which to a large extent to panic foreign companies. Because they maintain the information collection and consulting services needed normally in China, they suddenly become the key supervisory objects of the CCP.
Foreign reporters are even more unlucky. In the process of interviewing the news, any news they heard may be identified by the CCP as endangering national security. Therefore, the new version of the "Anti -Spy Law" let us see that the CCP is strengthening hostility to neighboring countries and the United States, and at the same time, it is highly sensitive to its isolation situation. Its new version of the "Anti -Spy Law" is actually worried that the CCP is worried that the regime will be in the government in the past. Under international pressure, it may become an increasingly unstable reaction.
The Chinese Communist Party uses the new version of the Anti -Spy Law to strengthen the comprehensive supervision of foreigners in China. It has two purposes. This can be described in two sentences: First, "seal foreign eyes", so that foreign countries can not understand China. The real situation that happened made foreign countries think that China is still strong and prosperous. Second, "handcuffs on foreigners' hands" made foreigners in China dare not reveal the truth of China to Western countries in China.
Four, Taiwanese are not "family" 
China has implemented this new version of the "Anti -Spy Law". What are the cautious aspects of Taiwanese especially? The so -called national security of the Communist Party of China is completely different from the national security of all democratic countries in the world. The national security of the Communist Party of China includes cultural and social levels. Chatting on social media, the CCP will think that some of the content endangers the CCP's national security.
For Taiwanese, the Chinese Communist Party's national security has another special aspect: if Taiwanese go to China, they talk about Taiwan issues on social media. It is "promoting Taiwan independence", which is a national security that endangers China. It may be guilty of the CCP's guilty of the CCP's new version of the "Anti -Spy Law".
The current national security of the Communist Party of China is simply a bullying that most citizens of the Republic of China. According to the Chinese Communist Party, the Republic of China did not exist in 1949. Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. It was previously entangled by the "Kuomintang Reaction Group". Now it is a elected politician to engage in "Taiwan independence." The CCP suppress Taiwan, and the most commonly used statement is Taiwan independence. The two words of Taiwan independence will continue to be refurbished and defined in the mouth of the Communist Party of China. At present, it is not the meaning of the early years. At present, the existence of the Republic of China, the foreign exchanges of the Republic of China, and the people of the Taiwanese hope to maintain the current situation of cross -strait relations. In the eyes of the Communist Party of China, they are regarded as "adhere to Taiwan independence". Essence Taiwan has said that the opposition party said that it is necessary to "one China and each table" (its meaning is that cross -strait belongs to the same China, but the "one China" is said to be the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan's expression is the Republic of China). However, the Chinese Communist Party does not recognize the Republic of China at all. For the CCP, the "one of the Chinese China" also belongs to the "Taiwan independence".
Taiwanese have gone to China, and have been very popular in the past few decades. But when the transit has moved, the CCP has changed, and it is no longer polite to Taiwan, but it has become a tiger. Now, if the Taiwanese go to China to travel freely and want to see the scenery of Xinjiang and Tibet, it may be regarded by the CCP as harmful to its national security and "incompetence."
Some people may think that I acknowledge the unity of the Communist Party of China, and I do not support Taiwan independence. Since China talks about "a family on both sides of the strait", even if I am the "self" of the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP's new version of the anti -spy "anti -spy spy "Fa" can not be used on my head. In fact, when the Chinese Communist Party arrested Taiwanese, Taiwanese would not treat Taiwanese as "themselves". Recently, the editor -in -chief of Taiwan's Eight Banner Culture "Fucha" (Li Yanhe) was arrested in Shanghai, and Yang Zhiyuan was arrested in Shenzhen for more than a year, and Li Mingzhe, who has been detained by the Communist Party of China for five years and recently returned to Taiwan, is Taiwan. Cases arrested by the Communist Party of China.
Moreover, the Ministry of National Security of the Communist Party of China not only arranges a line person in China's party and government agencies, universities, and large enterprises to monitor its "own people", but also threatens those who are born in China and immigrate overseas, asking them Overseas as the Ministry of National Security as a line. Therefore, Taiwanese are of course "outsiders" than these monitored CCP's "own people"; and the "cross -strait family" united front propaganda is simply "Meng Khan medicine" in the eyes of the Ministry of National Security. In the eyes of the Ministry of National Security of the Communist Party of China, not only the Chinese in China are not reliable, but overseas Chinese can not even believe that even cadres at all levels of the Communist Party of China need to be monitored, and Taiwanese are regarded as foreigners.
The autocratic country is the enemy of the whole people and the world as the enemy. The Taiwanese must have a high degree of wishes to the CCP, and they must not think that the CCP must be rewarded with goodwill, and there is no such possibility at all. Tourists who go abroad to China should be careful, and Taiwanese businessmen in China should pay special attention. Obviously, the busy business atmosphere of the CCP government's local governments that Taiwanese businessmen had experienced that year was gone. This has nothing to do with which political party is in Taiwan; the fundamental reason for the situation of Taiwanese businessmen in China is the fundamental reason is that the CCP finds the way.
After the CCP's strength increases, its long -hiding international ambitions can't be suppressed. It has been expanding the army for more than two decades; now it feels that the timing is mature. It wants to change the international order of the Indo -Pacific region, so that the CCP can dominate this area and become the world hegemony. In this background, Taiwanese businessmen should be very careful not to fall into the CCP's "anti -spy" trap and become a victim of the CCP suppressing Taiwan.

 Medvedev, then Russian Prime Minister in 2015, attended a meeting with Li Hui. Reuters information picture
On Monday, the Chinese government Eurasian affairs Li Hui specially visited five countries including Ukraine and Russia to mediate the conflict of Ukraine. The US media "Wall Street Journal" issued on the 15th, arguing that China will face the outside world's doubts about the close relationship between China and Russia and the question of respecting the sovereignty of other countries in China.
The article pointed out that in the outbreak of Ukraine's conflict for more than a year, it has caused more than 300,000 people to be injured, but China has not recognized Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and usually avoids the conflict called war. China also criticized the behavior of the United States and its allies to provide weapons to Ukraine, and echoed many of the official positions of Russia.
The remarks on which the Chinese ambassador to France, Lushayo, published by the former Soviet Union's national status at the end of April, further weakened China's ability to promote the agreement in accordance with Ukraine's acceptable conditions. Last weekend, Ukraine President Zelezki also doubted the role of mediation in the role of mediation in the role of the mediation.
In February of this year, China proposed a large framework for potential peace roadmaps, but lacks details and includes some typical positions in Russia. Among them, the first is "respecting the sovereignty of all countries." However, the Beijing side did not describe the existence of Russia in the Wudong region and Crimea as the occupation, but accused NATO forcing Russia to take action.
Just a few days after the International Criminal Court issued a arrest order against Putin for war, Xi Jinping flew to Moscow to meet with Russian President Putin and praised the latter's strong leadership.
It is reported that another widespread questioning of Western countries on the role of Chinese players is that China and Russia are also increasingly intervening in other countries' affairs and threatening countries that challenge the interests of Chinese. Western countries led by the United States are becoming more and more vigilant about China ’s current status quo to break the international status. To a certain extent, China is trying to use close relationships with Russia to break the international status.
The report also pointed out that many neighboring countries in China have increasingly believed that China uses the growing economic and political forces to destroy the sovereignty of these countries. This also adds difficulty to China ’s efforts to promote the peace of Ukraine. This includes the expansion of military facilities on artificial islands in controversial areas in the South China Sea to try to promote its sovereignty claims. At the same time, Chinese official media has also placed sovereignty issues at the center of competition between China and the United States.

Flying over the Russian airspace dispute to suppress the recovery of Europe and the United States to and from China route

Description: At present, the number of flights to and from China in Europe and the United States has not recovered before the epidemic. Some of the reasons are that some Western airlines are dissatisfied with "unfair competition": due to the continued use of Russian airspace, the flight time of Chinese flights is much shorter than its Western competitors. Several of the United States' largest airlines hope that the government will solve the problem.

 After the invasion of Ukraine in Russia, Europe, the United States and Russia closed the airspace, which has continued to this day. Chinese airlines are allowed to continue to use Russian airspace
(Voice of Germany Chinese) If you take Hansha Airlines from Beijing directly to Frankfurt today, you will take 12 hours and 50 minutes; but if you are riding on Air China ’s flights, you only take 10 hours and 30 minutes. It takes more than 11 hours to fly from Frankfurt to Beijing, and it takes only 9 hours and 20 minutes by Air China. The reason for this flight time gap is that Chinese airlines are allowed to continue to use Russian airspace without bypassing.
This situation is called "the new conflict about how China integrates into international aviation transportation is burning", saying that because there is no participation in the Western sanctions against Russia, Chinese airlines fly to North America and Europe can continue to fly over Russia. This has given the Chinese airline company a great competitive advantage compared to Western airlines -shorter flight time and lower fuel costs.
US Airlines hopes that China will also stop flying over Russia 
The largest airlines in the United States are under pressure to put pressure on Washington, hoping to prohibit Chinese flights from using Russian airspace when they go to the United States and leave the United States.
At present, the number of flights between China and the United States is far from returning to the level before the epidemic. In 2019, the direct flight between China and the United States reached an average of 340 times a week, and now there are only more than 20. And this is the early May of the Bayeng government allowed to increase Chinese flights to 12 per week (previously 8).
Bloomberg quoted people familiar with the matter and said that there were fewer flights during the new crown epidemic period, not because they expected weak demand, but because of controversy against Russian airspace.
According to Reuters, in February this year, the two US senators issued a letter urging the Biden government to prevent Chinese airlines and other non -US airlines flying over Russia on routes involving the United States because this made these non -United States non -United States. The airline has an advantage in fuel consumption and flight time.
The United States Airlines praised the letter of the two senators, saying that this reflects the industry's long -term concern for the Russian issue that has faced the disadvantages of US airlines.
Robertisom, CEO of the United States, recently said that he hopes to resolve this controversy in diplomacy. He told CNBC TV on April 27 that "it is not an unfair competitive environment", saying that before truly solving this problem, this will hinder increasing the work of flights.
If Russia closed the lead ... 
"The possibility of China agreed to abandon the use of Russian airspace is zero" 
This dispute happened in In the context of the big background, the hope that the problem was solved by fast diplomacy was covered with a shadow. Bloomberg reported that Chinese airlines did not have any motivation to accompany the United States and make compromises.
The CEO of the CEO of the United States Politics and Financial Risk Consulting CEO of China Strategies Group said that China agrees to give up the possibility of giving up the use of Russian airspace "zero". He also said that this is not the top priority in Washington. The Biden government "has more important things to discuss with China."
At present, more than 30 countries including the United States are restricted to use the Russian airspace, while China, India and other countries have not been limited.
People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that American airlines have not sought the same sanctions against airlines located in India and the Middle East. These airlines are also using Russia's airspace. Some reasons are partly because the governments of these countries have not given up with the United States during the epidemic period. Aviation Treaty. Prior to the new crown epidemic, flights between China and the United States were supervised by the aviation service treaties signed by the two countries. However, after China's unilateral restrictions on US airline services in 2020, the US Department of Transport took over the management of Chinese airlines' entry flights.
 Hansha Airlines (pictured) is currently detouring to Beijing and Shanghai. It does not seem to oppose the increase in China -Germany's round -trip flights.
The number of Chinese flights is expected to recover in this winter 
The "South German will" reports that how this issue develops next is very important for all relevant parties. By 2030, China's domestic flight market is expected to be larger than the United States. For Airbus and Boeing, China is a market full of opportunities. European airports, tourism authorities, and businesses are also eager to return to Europe again. Under normal circumstances, China is also a favorable business for various airlines.
The report also pointed out that the number of Sino -German flights is expected to recover in this winter. Before the epidemic, Chinese airlines were allowed to operate 150 flights to the United States every week, 120 flights to France, and 55 flights to Germany. At present, Chinese airlines have 17 flights to Germany every week, 30 flights will be available in summer, and 55 flights will be available in the upcoming winter. "(Germany) Hansha Airlines has not publicly risen the number of flights, although Han Sa also has to detour when flying to Beijing and Shanghai."

 The Spring prediction results of the European Executive Committee are optimistic than the report released at the end of last year. However, although inflation has declined from a record high, it is still "tricky than expected."
The executive committee raised its economic growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 1.1%.
EU Economic Executive Committee Paolo Gentiloni said in a statement: "The current European economic situation is better than our prediction last fall."
"Thanks to our efforts to strengthen energy security, the extraordinary toughness of the labor market, and the relief of the supply of supply, we can avoid the decline in winter. It is expected that this year and next year will grow moderately."

 (Voice of Germany) "" It is wrong to take away, it is not wrong. "German Foreign Minister Berbak returned the first batch of 20 precious Benin bronze cultural relics to Nigeria last December. In 125 years, about 1,100 plunder in the palace of the former Benin Kingdom was scattered in 20 Museum in Germany. Most of these cultural relics were sold after the British colonists were sold after Benin, which is now Nigeria today. Its material is copper, ivory, etc.
But now there is a problem: Will the Nigerian people have the opportunity to visit these copper wares returning to their homeland in a museum in the future?
Nigerian President to the Benin Royal Heirs 
The reason is that many African and international media reports that Nigeria's upcoming President Bukhari President Bukhari has put these [] on March 23(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国计划归还被掠夺贝宁青铜器/a-57063663)Transfer to the former Benin royal heirs, Obaewuare II.
The President of Nigerian President said that Oba Evar II was the legal owner of these cultural relics and the inheritor of the traditional culture of Benin Kingdom. President of Nigeria said that as for how Eval II handles these cultural relics, it is the latter's decision.
This has caused a lot of problems. Because Eval II can collect cultural relics in its residence or other locations. These cultural relics may also be exhibited in a private palace museum. So, will he publicize these cultural relics to the Nigerian public? Or would it even sell it as a private property to collectors?
 Eval II
Criticism: Returning too much "drops with heart" 
Swiss scholar, Brigitta Hauser-Schäublin, raised sharp questions in the Frankfurt Report: Is this the meaning of returning cultural relics? She criticized the agreement between the German government and Nigeria, "the wording is too light".
This has also become a topic of debate of the German Federal Parliament. In the Wild Party Options Party and Alliance Party (CDU, Cinnamon, Capital, Capital), the unconditional return of Benin Bronze made by the German government to Nigeria's decision. Dorotheebär, a politician of Kimin, said that if the world cultural heritage disappears in "private property", the effort to return cultural relics is a failure. She said that returning cultural relics is right, but should not be "at a cost." Bell believes that Germany is also responsible for these cultural relics. Helgelindh, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party's Cultural Policy Policy, one of the ruling parties, emphasized that the return of cultural relics that returned the plunder can no longer be provided with attached conditions.
Who has the right to decide the whereabouts of the cultural relics? 
Dr. Oluwatoyin Sogbesan, a scholar in Nigeria's archeology, culture, and museum scholar, criticized: "This is a new colonialism. Do you decide the whereabouts of the cultural relics?" For those, because these cultural relics have belonged to the Benin kingdom no longer exist. The founding of Nigeria is the product of colonialism. The country consists of 250 ethnic groups. The Eduo group represented by the Oba royal family is the legal heirs of cultural relics.
Molemomoiloa, the founder of "Open RESTITUTION AFRICA", believes that the African museum industry is transforming a thinking on the ownership of cultural relics. She pointed out that the descendants of William II had a request to return to real estate and art not long ago.
 In December last year, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Culture (first from left) and Foreign Minister (second from left), who returned Binnin Bronze Inspection in December
Bingin Copper Ware 
Cologne Lounstrauch-Joest-Museum, the Cologne Schutra, said, "This is no longer our business." She believes that the return of cultural relics has produced positive positives. The effect, for example, under the framework of a cooperative project, a staff member of her museum will soon go to Lagos to communicate with the peers there, including the repair of copper, to the renovation of the copper ware.
Snow also frankly said that only three of the 92 Benin cultural relics of the museum were exhibited in public, and the rest were in "sleeping state". It is precisely the debate of this cultural relics that prompted the museum to numbers all Benin cultural relics.
The German government: The meaning of returning cultural relics is unchanged 
The German government insists that The meaning of itself is not doubtful. A spokesman for the Ministry of Culture stated that it would work with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to clarify what the measures taken by Nigerian President Bukhari, who are about to leave. A spokesman for the Minister of Culture, the Minister of Culture, said that after the new Nigerian government came to power, Germany would immediately talk to him.
 Part of the first batch of Benin copper wares returned by Germany
"Benin Kingdom has participated in slavery" to return the cultural relics and has always been controversial 
Germany's "Benin Bronze" has also been accompanied by controversy from the beginning. Deguang reporter reported from the United States that the "Return Cultural Relics Research Group" in New York(Restitution Study Group)It is a non -governmental organization founded by the descendants of the slave of West African. They said that the Kingdom of Benin had participated in cross -Atlantic slave trade in 300 years. The person in charge of the organization, Deadriafarmer-Paellmann, said that European slave merchants use a copper currency to sell transactions with Benin, and these copper currencies are cast into "Benin copper copper "Device". According to her, the Benin bronze in the 16th to 19th century was actually made of "blood with blood". She therefore called for only cultural relics from the 12-15 centuries, instead of returning the cultural relics of the 16th to 19th centuries, otherwise it would be a wrong signal issued by slave trade.
In addition, Famo Perman also said that these bronze wares are a ritual for employment to sacrifice. This ceremony stopped after the action of British colonists in 1897. She also pointed out that the incidents of Copper disappearance in Nigeria were constantly disappearing, and it was estimated that 150 copper wares were missing at the Benin National Museum alone. Therefore, all countries should first ask the whereabouts of Nigeria's missing cultural relics before returning cultural relics.

 In a shopping mall in Shanghai, a lady walked through the OPPO logo Reuters picture Recently, OPPO of China's mobile phone brand OPPO announced the dissolution of its Zheku Technology (ZEKU) business and terminate its own research chip. Thousands of high -tech employees in the company may be unemployed. Some experts pointed out that self -developed chips are very difficult, but whether Zheku really accepts or renames US sanctions is yet to be observed.
is difficult to make core!OPPO announced the termination of chip research and development The well -known Chinese mobile phone OPPO factory issued a statement on May 12 stating that in the face of uncertainty of the global economy and mobile phone market, after careful consideration, the company decided to terminate the Zheku business.
The company's 3,000 employees may not have warning without warning, and even half of the interview learned that the business closed. Another news revealed that OPPO's year -end bonus is generally discounted this year, and employees have even launched rights protection operations.
Mr. Wang, a retired teacher of Guangzhou University, accepted an interview with Liberty Asia, saying that after the central government stopped subsidizing the financial subsidy of the chip industry, these companies felt unable to be able to stop research and development, and it was estimated that the government's financial losses were tens of billions of yuan.
** The central government stopped the loss of the chip subsidy government to invest in OPPO.
Mr. Wang said: "OPPO overnight chip research and development institutions have locked the door, thousands of people are laid off, and tens of billions of yuan has been smashed in. In fact, they can't make high -end chips. Will you also give it money to smash the chip? Now it is the central government, smashing (money), they dig at the ground, dig out (money). Finally, ask the Hong Kong government to dig at high -end talents. Digging high -end talents? "
 OPPO mobile phone (Reuters) Mr. Wang mentioned that many chip companies lost the central government's financial subsidies not long ago, causing the company to fail. In fact, these companies are unable to develop high -end chips: "It is purely a clever name, deceive financial support, and finally these money falls to personal pockets."
Lin Zongnan, a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Taiwan University, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia that "OPPO is too negligible for the complexity of the semiconductor industry. The Chinese government's budget is not so abundant, and it cannot be affected by the subsidies of large coins in the past and the world's high -tech prosperity. OPPO In order to break the tail, take Zheku Technology. "
Lin Zongnan said that OPPO's establishment of Zheku Technology was mainly the so -called 2025 plan that the government had a large amount of funding support. It hired more than 3,000 IC related engineers. It is expected that related application processors will be launched this year.
According to a comprehensive media report, OPPO develops a high -performance processor by replicating the Huawei "Hisilicon" model. In 2019, it established a self -developed chip subsidiary and announced that it invested 50 billion yuan in RMB RMB 3 years. In the early days of the company, Intel's R & D team in mobile phone base frequency chips, then recruited senior personnel such as chip companies such as Qualcomm and Ziguang Zhanrui. The commander of the operation disbanded four years later.
OPPO to solicit high -tech talents for self -developed chips 
Zheku mainly includes three chip centers of NPU, baseband, and WiFi Bluetooth. In 2021 and 2022, OPPO released the first and second self -developed chips, named Mariana X, Mariana Y, each with a special NPU chip and Bluetooth audio SOC chip.
Taiwan's scientific and technological columnist Lin Xiumin mentioned in an interview with Radio Free Asia. Among the top ten mobile phone brands in China, except for Apple and Samsung in South Korea, the other eight major brands are almost all Chinese mobile phones, such as Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, etc. Chinese companies hope that self -developed chips can narrow the gap and master their own technology. Now mobile phones can be taken, listening to music, etc., the more complex functions of mobile phone chips, the greater the cost.
 Chinese mobile phone manufacturer OPPO is located in Shenzhen Office Building (Agence France -Presse) [] Zheku's annual salary cost burns more than 1.5 billion **
Some Chinese media reports that the annual salary of chip design engineers is about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Zheku Technology Eighth has become a doctoral degree in famous schools at home and abroad. 80 % of engineers have more than 5 years of chip research experience. The company's annual salary cost is 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion yuan. Except for Shanghai headquarters, Beijing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Japan and the United States have design branches. OPPO evaluates that high costs are not as good as purchasing chips for external.
Lin Xiumin mentioned that China's mobile phone business situation is indeed not good. Samsung and Micron lost money in the fourth quarter of last year. The semiconductor chip terminal market also lost money.
Lin Xiumin said: "Affected by the influence of influence and war, the commercial consumption power is very weak. If OPPO continues to smash a lot of money, the industry will lose money. The foundry of the wafer is almost looking for TSMC. The cost is very high. The industry is no longer making money, and it is unsuccessful in business. "
Lin Xiumin analyzed that in addition to the large investment amount, the United States has become more and more stricter for Chinese semiconductor control measures. ZTE, Huawei, and Yangtze River storage have been included in the US control list. Whether the chip developed by OPPO is also risky by the US sanctions or falling into the US control list, it is worrying.
Expert: Really disbanded? Renamed to avoid US surveillance? 
Lin Xiumin used the metaphor of the Chinese cottage machine: "Is there a skepticism, is OPPO's possibility of turning into a dark? Knowing that the United States is watching very tightly, in order to avoid US surveillance? To observe one after another, does OPPO really dissolve people? Or is it just in it? Avoid US surveillance? "
In the first quarter of 2023, China's smartphone market shipments were about 65 million units, a year -on -year decrease of 11.8%; this year's shipments per quarter decreased by 10%year -on -year. Consumers gradually think that mobile phones do not need to be replaced frequently, and whether Xiaomi and vivo can still adhere to self -developed chips are also questionable.

Recent There are really this "Tsinghua Research". After investigation, the basis of the so -called "Tsinghua Research" is actually a few words written on the letter paper with the head of Tsinghua University, and there is no evidence to confirm the existence of this study. But in China's current political situation, discussing this issue is quite interesting. This article wants to discuss this thing that has been existed in China for a long time, but it is difficult to pick.
The group who knows half of the world does not really exist. 
Xiao Haitang said that things were commented like this: "Tsinghua University has a research results showing that men are over -concerned about the international situation, military, finance, and social justice content, which can easily lead to poverty. There is indeed this situation in life: Some people who are not rich in life It is often keen to talk about the major events of the world and pay attention to international relations. "
The comment takes a middle -aged person who has made a living old neighbor as an old neighbor as an example. "" He has nothing to do in his life and does not want to do something. He will make some money. Tell your neighbors about your views on something that happened in the world. "
The conclusion is: "However, there should be no causal relationship between poverty and concern about the international situation." Middle -aged neighbors are actually not poverty in the international situation, but that they do not work hard to do things. Because they have nothing to do, they naturally have excess energy, and they have "idle" to care about international events.
Little Haitang's words are very poke, but they have not finished the problem yet: That is, this kind of concern has rarely constructive opinions on the discussion of the international situation, because the source of information is single, not China news network, or it is, or it is The biased information on overseas Chinese online, even Chinese who have never lived in the United States to teach Chinese people who have lived in the United States for many years. It is common.
However, the quality of speech and the right to speak is not the same thing after all, even if it is the A Q of the 1911 period, the Liberal Party regards the Liberal Party as the "Persimmon Party", and there is also the right to revolution. To put it bluntly, the emergence of such people has a lot to do with the national conditions of China. Speaking of this problem, then talk about the other two related issues.
The Chinese Communist Party requires youth to care about politics is the tradition of party culture 
I just saw the news that netizens reposted this news, and I instinctively did not believe it: All left organizations and political parties in the world, of course, including the Communist Party of China, almost from the date of birth, I have seized the two key points. One is the ideological work of teenagers, and the future success hopes to entrust the future of the younger generation (the Chinese Communist Party is commonly known as "starting from the baby"), and the second is the public opinion position. Tsinghua's survey has always been served for national political goals. How can there be such an investigation? Not to mention that this kind of investigation of a penny is not available, and those who can become the principal of Tsinghua will not let the school on the school try to offend the two officials.
The Chinese care about state affairs, as well as Confucian cultural traditions. The Confucian culture and the responsibility of the responsibility of the people have always encouraged people to care about national affairs. This tradition has not changed until the Mao era. At the moment of life and death in the country, even those who are not literate will say "the world is rising and the husband is responsible". The famous generation is a model of inspirational of Chinese scholars. In 1934, the film "Tao Li Jie" came out, and the song "Graduation Song" swept China. By 1935, the famous 13th and nine campaigns, this popular "Graduation Song" became the "war song" of the CCP's underground party mobilizing students; during the comprehensive anti -Japanese war, "Graduation Song" was a very loved by the big anti -Japanese youth behind the big rear. The song of the era also derived the "variants" of the anti -Japanese war propaganda. The CCP's ancestor Mao Zedong is good at encouraging young people to participate in various movements. She contains the famous "young man is vigorous, as if the sun in the morning at eight or nine o'clock, hopes to pin on you", and has been selected as before the Cultural Revolution Primary School. textbook. On August 10, 1966, Mao spoke to the red guards connected in series at the CPC Central Committee's reception station. It has always been fighting for the next generation as a lifelong mission with the Kuomintang, the US imperialism, and revisionism. Since Mao, the Chinese Communist Party's calendar Deng (Hu Zhao), Jiang, and Hu Chuan have attached importance to the intake and control of young people, but there are short -term variations in the Jiang Zemin era.
In the mid -1990s, Jiang Zemin launched Chinese "milk nipple music" 
Beginning in the mid -1990s, China had a short period of time "watching the whole people", and a generation of urban youths who were entertaining to death. All kinds of urban newspapers that satisfied the urban petty trend and guided them into modern life sprung up. This state is exactly the theory of "milk nipple music" in 1995 and echo the theory of "milk nipple music" in 1995.
The synthesis of "tittytainment" is synthesized by "titty" and "Entertainment" (entertainment). It is said that this was proposed at the "Globalization" conference at the Fermont Hotel in San Francisco in 1995. This meeting brings together 500 political elites in the world. Participants include the British Prime Minister Sachel, the founder of the US President Bush, CNN, Hewlett -Packard, Microsoft, etc. The theme of the meeting is to discuss the positive and negative impact of globalization, how Guide humans to the 21st century. These elites from the top of the society believe that with the rapid development of the world, social wealth will accelerate to 20%of the rich people. The remaining 80%of the people's wealth will shrink seriously, and the remaining 80%will become Loser. The times are left, and briefly, globalization will lead to the arrival of a "20:80 society".
The phenomenon of "20 to 80" appears, which is not enough to worry about the elites of the meeting. What really worried them is: If the 80%of them were angry and lost in frustration and loss, what should I do if I want to create a 20%of the people?
At this time, the geopolitical master of the United States and the designer of the Eurasian University strategy, Bu -Rejunsky, appeared. With his cold and realistic consideration, he made the following statements: Due to the continuous rise in productivity, most of the world in the world There will be no need to actively participate in the production of products and services. In order to comfort these "abandoned" people and avoid class conflicts, one of the methods is to create "nipples" and feed them with "nipples" -to make people intoxicating heritage entertainment and sensory stimulating products (such as the Internet, the Internet, the Internet, TV and games) fill people's lives, divert their attention and dissatisfaction, and immerse them in various "happiness", unknowingly lose their thinking ability, and unintentionally challenge the existing ruling class.Besides the domestic environment of China in the 1990s. In 1989, the "June 4th" Tiananmen slaughter harmed the CCP's international image. Of course, the senior officials of the Communist Party of China would also think about it. The result was that this was caused by the excessive concern of Chinese youths in the 1989th generation. Related to the Book of the Future. In the 1980s, there was a new enlightenment movement. Many of the series of western academic culture were the main carrier. One of the sets of "Towards the Future" series had a great impact on college students. Many of the editors of this set of books were elites in Chinese politics, culture, and academic circles in the 1990s to 2010. This set of books stopped publishing after June 4th. All kinds of urban newspapers and fashion magazines that satisfied the subtraction of urban middle -class were born. Internal speech, learn from the June 4th lesson, to guide Chinese youths to care about non -political and entertainment topics, and pursue materialistic enjoyment at the material level -this should be regarded as the Chinese version of "naked nipple music".
The two editions of the "nipple music" in the United States and China appeared similarly. It was impossible to verify whether Jiang Zemin was inspired by the Bu -Trezel, or "the heroes saw the same." But the Global Network on August 30, 2018 was the "terrible" nipple music "trap was set by the United States for China? "In the article, only the word" contributing "Jiang Zemin's" credit "of developing a generation of entertainment to dead Chinese youths was charged 100 % of the United States. Later, Jiang's theory was not born of the youth group, and was liked to be happy with Hu Jintao. After General Secretary Hu, he proposed that "comprehensively promotes the ideological and political education of college students and promotes the comprehensive development of college students in various aspects." The main focus of Chinese public opinion is Oppose youth decadent and entertain. After taking over, Xi Jinping explicitly stated: "Basic education is the cause of Lide Shushu people. It is necessary to clearly strengthen ideological and political education, moral education, and education of socialist core values ...", this is further more than Hu Jintao. A "basic education" stage.
In summary, my conclusion is: 1. The CCP will never give up the ideological (brainwashing) education of the young generation. Even Jiang Zemin's Chinese version of "milk nipple music" is a soft orientation of controlling young people's thoughts; 2. The CCP filtering information and controlling the ideological education of the school has cultivated three types of young mainstream people: the pink thought group, in the unemployment and poverty Political enthusiasts and extreme political opponents in the state. Of course, there will be a few rational thinkers, but the most optimistic estimation is about 5%.

 At that time, more than 700,000 Palestinians were driven away, and they were displaced since then
(Voice of Germany) on May 15th is the "Disaster Day" of the Palestinian people. Let's review history, look at the cause and consequences of this "disaster", and the solution to the current solution.
" Disaster Day " What does it mean? 
Arabic "Nakba" means disaster or scourge. In the Baza conflict, the "Nakba" or "Al-Nakba" refers to the Palestinian displaced before and after the war in 1948.
It is said that in the current Israeli and Palestinian territory, about 700,000 people were either escaped from their homes or they were forced to be displaced. "Nakba" also means a heavy problem: Many Palestinian refugees in exile are still in a state of no nationality.
"Disaster Day" The origin of ** 
May 15, 1948 was the beginning of Ah Is in the war. Since then, the Palestinian people will take this day as their discharge anniversary, and many people will go to the streets to participate in protests. The protesters held the Palestinian national flag, took their previous residence keys, or held banners with key symbols. These keys represent their hope of returning home and their right to return home. In the past, some protests have evolved into violent conflicts. Israel has accused Organizations such as the EU and other countries as terrorist organizations using this day to promote terrorist activities.
The word "Nakba Day" was created by the then Palestinian leader Arafat in 1998. He set this day as the official anniversary of the Palestinian lost his home.
 During the Israeli Independence War in 1948, the Arabs fled to the home
Why did the Palestinian escape from home? 
For hundreds of years in modern times, Palestine, a regional Palestinian, was part of the Ottoman Turkish Empire, and was occupied by Britain until the end of the First World War. In 1920, the International Alliance commissioned Britain to jurisdiction over the Palestine region. At this time, the anti -Jewie of Europe has intensified, and more and more Jews have moved from all over the world. For these Jews, it was the home of their ancestors and their "promise". They believe that the Jews have settled here since ancient times, although sometimes the population is not large.
After the Jews experienced the Nazi German massacre, the UN General Assembly passed the Palestinian divisional resolution in November 1947. The resolution proposed to establish two temporary countries, one was a Jewish country and the other was the Arab country. The Arab League refused to accept the plan. The Jewish organization in the Palestinian region accepted the resolution and announced the establishment of the Israeli country on May 14, 1948.
As a response to the Israeli State, the Arab League consisting of five countries launched a war, but was eventually defeated by Israel in 1949. Before the war, there were 200,000 to 300,000 Barstinians who left or were forced to leave their homes. During the war, this number increased by 300,000 to 400,000. The displaced Palestinians have a total of about 700,000.
The war destroyed more than 400 Arab villages. Although both parties in the war have made human rights violations, the Deliaxin Village Holocaust that occurred before the war (April 9, 19948) became the most painful memory of the Palestinians. In this massacre, at least 100 Arab villagers were killed, including women and children. The massacre of the Deliaxin Village made many Palestinians feel fear and prompted them to escape from their homes.
At the end of the war, Israel occupied about 40%of the land designated to the Palestinian in the United Nations division decision in 1947.
 The first war ended in 1949, and Israel won
Millions of non -national refugees ** 
Most Palestinians eventually became non -national refugees in the Arab country, and only a few people moved abroad.
To this day, there are still only a small part of the Palestinians who apply or obtain citizenship in other countries. At present, there are about 6.2 million Barstinians in the Middle East, most of which have been in a state of no nationality, from the first generation of the post -war to the third or fourth generation.
Palestinian refugees live? 
According to the UN Palestinian refugee relief and UNRWA, most Palestinians in the region still live in refugee camps. Over time, these refugee camps have developed into refugee towns. They are mainly stationed in the Garha Strip, the west bank of the Jordan River, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and East Jerusalem.
It is estimated that international Palestinians have increased to approximately 6 million to 7 million. If this number is accurate, the total number of Palestinians is close to 13 million. However, no global institutional investigation statistics have scattered Palestinians, so there is no accurate data.
 The Palestinian's refugee camp has gradually become a "refugee city" in the past 75 years
What is the Palestinian's " return right " ? 
According to the UN General Assembly 1948 resolutions, as well as resolutions No. 3236 of 1974 and the 1951 "Refugee Status", Palestinian, a Palestinian refugee, enjoys "return rights".
However, Israel refused to acknowledge the Palestinian's "return right", claiming that it would mean that Israel was the end of the Jewish country. Israel has denied responsibility for the Palestinian's displacement, and pointed out that from 1948 to 1972, about 800,000 Jews were expelled or had to escape from Arab countries such as Morocco, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen.
solution to the Palestinian issue 
In the past 75 years, there have been various solutions to the Palestinian issue. The most important of which are the "two countries solutions". In this scheme, the Israeli and future Palestinian State divided Jerusalem into two capitals. However, both sides have doubts about whether this plan is reality.
Critics pointed out that more and more Jewish settlements occupied by the Jordan River occupied by Israel have basically excluded the possibility of the unity of Palestinian territory.
Other suggestions also include that Israel admits that the Palestinian's refugee status and give certain compensation, but they must not return, or restore resettlement, or implement two passport systems in a country.
However, no practical solutions are now visible.
"Unprecedented Industry": Israel's past, present and future#####: Israeli resumed country 
Announcement 
On May 14, 1948, Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben Gurian(David BenGurion)The Declaration of Israel was read out in the Jewish National Parliament to declare the rest of the country. The "Declaration" wrote: "The Jews were loyal to their homeland, and they always hoped to return to their homeland, where they re -obtain political freedom, and never stopped praying for this."

brand -new banner 
In front of the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Israeli flag soon rose. For this ancient and young country, this is a diplomatic victory and a guarantee of security and freedom: the Jewish nation finally has an internationally recognized country.
* #####: Israeli resumed country
Dark Age 
Before Israel resumed, the Jews experienced a terrible massacre. During World War II, the Nazi regime killed about 6 million Jews. They used industrialized methods to systematically extinct European Jews. This picture was taken after the liberation of the Oswing concentration camp.

Pakistani conflict 
For the Palestinians who originally lived on this land, Israel's recovery was a downright disaster. About 700,000 Barstinians had to leave their homes to make a place for Jews. The Palestinian -Israeli conflict has also continued for seventy years, so far.

Modernization 
In 1950, the No. 2 highway of the vehicle connected Tel Aviv and Neitania. This highway symbolizes the vitality of the new country. The picture shows the then Prime Minister Mayu(GoldaMeir)主持通车典礼。梅厄规定以色列，坚定走经济及社会现代化之路。
Collective agriculture 
The meaning of "Kibbutz" in Hebrew is "collective agriculture". Most farmers were founded in the early days of the recovery. Many Jews with secular ideology or socialist positions practice their social philosophy here.

Six -Day War 
From the day of the resurrection of Israel, conflicts with neighbor Arabia have never been interrupted. The "Six -Day War" in 1967 was the highest peak of conflict. First of all, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, but the ultimate victims were Israel. In this war, Israel controlled the East Jerusalem and the west bank of the Jordan River, and became the fuse of subsequent conflicts and war.

never shaken 
The policy of building Jewish settlements in Israel has continuously intensified conflict with Palestine. Pakistan has accused Israel of trying to completely cut off the hope of the founding of Palestine by building a settlement. Although the United Nations has also condemned the policy of building a Jewish settlement, Israel's position on this issue has never been shaken.

Six -year conflict 
In the winter of 1987, the Palestinians launched a demonstration protest on the land occupied by Israel. The protests began in the city of Gaza, and soon spread to East Jerusalem and the west bank of the Jordan River. This conflict lasted for several years. It was not until 1993 that Baki and Israel stopped the conflict with the Oslo Agreement.

Heping not easy 
Under the mediation of US President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Robin and the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Arafat held peace talks. The two sides later reached the "Oslo Agreement", which was considered a milestone in the Palestinian and Palestinian peace process. However, two years later, Labin was assassinated by Israeli aggressives, resulting in the interruption of peace processes.

La Bin's death 
The death of Robin reflects the splitting of Israeli society. Gentle, secular and extreme, devout Jewish doctors are becoming more and more powerful. Laibin was assassinated by an extreme college student at a rally on November 4, 1995. The next day, the Prime Minister Perece presided over the cabinet meeting with a dignified expression. The empty chair on his side was originally a seat of Laibin.

High wall 
The policy of building a Jewish settlement in Israel has continued to be nervous. In 2002, Israel built a 107 -kilometer -long quarantine wall on the west bank of the Jordan. Although building a wall can prevent violence, it does not help eliminate conflicts of seventy years.
* #####: Israeli resumed country
German responsibility 
The Nazi slaughter of Jews still had a profound impact on the relationship between Germany and Israel to this day. In 2000, then the German Federal President Johneis Labor visited Israel and delivered a speech in Parliament. For the two countries, this is a major challenge, and it is also a sign of continuing reconciliation.

 Türkiye held the president and Congress election on the 14th
(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) Turkey held the president and Congress election on Sunday (May 14). On Monday statistics, whether it is Tayyiperdogan, the current President of Turkitus, or its most powerful competitors Kiricians Kemalkilicdaroglu has not won a complete victory through a 50%threshold. The Turkish presidential election will hold the second round of finals on May 28.
This voting is regarded as a major test of the current President Erdogan, and voters will also select 600 parliamentarians with a term of 5 years from 87 constituencies.
Reuters quoted Turkish state -owned media Anadoluagence that Erdogan is currently leading 49.5%of the votes, while Kiricidallutu follows 44.9%. However, the country's opposition claims that the data is falsely reported and deliberately rushed to Erdogan.
The report states that the two camps currently claim to be the lead. In the case of Turkey's "severe polarization", it is not advisable to make any conclusions.
Erdogan told its supporters earlier on the 15th that the votes of Turkish overseas citizens have not been counted. , But if you need to vote within two weeks, he will respect the country's decision.
Pre -election polls showed that the competition was very fierce, but Kiricidalulu, who led the opposition to the Sixth Party League, was slightly leading. The two polls on the 12th even showed that he crossed the threshold of 50%.
 About 61 million Turkish citizens have voting qualifications for this election
About 61 million Turkish citizens have voting qualifications, including nearly 5 million first voters. The voting stations from all over the country are open at 8 am local time and closed at 5 pm. According to laws, Turkish media prohibit reporting of votes from various places before 9 pm on the 14th.
Erdogan said earlier on a primary school in Istanbul in Skandan, Sunday, and said that after the voting at night, he hoped that the voting result was "for the future of our country and the democracy of Turkey. "". The last time Erdogan won 52.6%votes in the first round of presidential elections in 2018. The current public opinion survey shows that its support is hovering around 44-45%.
On the other hand, Kiric Darroglu told the media after voting the vote that he would be committed to restoring democracy. He said, "You will see that the spring of Heaven will be blessed. The spring of this country will come."
The opposition competitor is the chairman of the Republican Party (CHP), which was established by the founder of modern Turkey Mustafa Kemalaturk. Kiricidallu said that he and his six -party alliance plan to "realize the people's desire for democracy."
 Kirichidallu, one of the presidential candidates, said it will be committed to restoring democracy
What are the presidential candidates? 
The current president and 69 -year -old Erdogan is the founder and leader of the Rights and Development Party (AKP) of the Right -wing Party (AKP). He served as the mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998, and then promoted to the highest position of the country. From 2003 to 2014, he served as the Prime Minister, and then won the first direct election of Turkey as a president in August 2014.
His critics said that Erdogan made Turkey's long -term advocacy of evidence to get rid of religion to religious conservatives.
 The current President Erdogan said: I hope the results of the voting are "good for Turkey's democracy."
In order to compete with it, the six opposition parties in Turkish politics formed a united front to overthrow Erdogan's leader. Among them, Kiric Dalogulu became the presidential candidate launched by the Six Party Opposition Alliance. The 74 -year -old Kilic Darroglu has been the Chairman of the Republican Party since 2007. He and the opposition alliance hopes to revoke the constitutional provisions that Erdogan's previous amendments can be revised as much as possible.
Two politicians are running for the president, but one of them will temporarily withdrawn from the election on May 11th, which may be able to add some chances of winning for the opposition candidate Kiriqidalu. The last candidate was Sinanogan, but the opportunity to win the presidential election may be the most slim. He received the support of a small extreme nationalist party alliance.
Inflation, Türkiye is ushered in a general election 
How to view this election 
Turkey is in the economic collapse, and its currency Turkish lira plunged to the lowest point in history, while inflation was rampant. In February this year, the Erdogan government's treatment of the Great Earthquake also caused criticism and harmed his re -election prospect.
According to official data, more than 50,000 people were killed in Türkiye alone. However, many people have not been settled three months after the earthquake, and many regions have not restored basic livelihood supply such as hydropower.
However, DW found that two cities in the "Earthquake Area" have a very different view on Sunday elections. Kahramanmaras, a city in southeast Turkey, is located in the earthquake in February. The region is considered to be the base of justice and the development of the party. Therefore It may weaken because of the earthquake.
The situation seems to be different in Hatiei, a city near the Syrian border. Many local people have criticized the government that they believe that other cities have received more assistance after the earthquake. So far, many residents of Hatiei still lack clean water, clothing and sanitary products.
Most Germans want Erdogan to step down 
A survey showed that two -thirds of the Germans were happy to see Erdogan's elimination after 20 years in power. The national study by the market survey agency YOUGOV asked: "This Sunday, Turkey will hold a presidential election. Do you want the current President Erdogan to be re -elected or was eliminated?" About 70%of the respondents believe that Erdogan should should He stepped down, and 10%believed that he should be re -elected, and another 20%said he did not know or did not give the answer.
 
Although Erdogan's supporters of Justice and the Development Party often caused controversy in Germany, the Turkish leader did have a strong support foundation in Germany.
Democratic "Last Opportunity" 
Michaelroth, chairman of the Federal House of Federal House of Federal House, pointed out that the election may be the "last opportunity" of the Turkish opposition to drive Erdogan's justice and the Development Party in a democratic way after 20 years.
Ross told the media that the "German Editorial Department Network" may be free, although the president and parliamentary elections may be free, they may not be fair, because Erdogan and its supporters are stepping up their control of media, election committees and judicial agencies. Rose also pointed out that at the same time, Russia seemed to be trying to publicize Turkish opposition through false information.

 (Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Mirror" weekly commented that Western countries seemed to be more and more united and tough on the position of Russia and China. The arrogance is insufficient. The comments entitled "To Tough, But Don't Pride" wrote:
"no doubt, Essence Although former German Prime Minister Merkel's careful diplomatic route for the two countries is good, it directly leads to our embarrassing situation. In view of this, it is necessary to change the strategy.
But what the representatives of the Western world should not ignore are that there are also many people who think they are arrogant. This includes not only the people of Russia and China, the allies of China and Russia, but also the number of people who hold this view among the Western people. It is believed that the pride of Western attitude has become a worldwide inherent concept.
Of course, people who can also think that this view is some people who cannot tolerate reasonable criticism. But why can't the West take this accusation seriously? Why not discuss it carefully? After all, it is not difficult to find Western arrogant examples.
There have been examples a few days ago: German Finance Minister Lindona said in an interview with the Pioneer that the West must assume the mission of spreading civilization in China '. This sounds like a colonial person's self -righteous meaning. The impression on the other party should be tried to avoid it. After all, Western countries like Germany have colonial history. "
Comments pointed out that Westerners certainly have the right to be proud and confident for their democracy and the rule of law, but they should not contain arrogance and self -confidence should not evolve into high. Comments:
"In countries like Germany, the establishment of a system of democracy and the rule of law is not because of the ingenuity of the Germans, but after a dictatorship of an autocracy, they have learned to master it."
Last week, Capital magazine commented and disappointed the federal government's decision. This comment writes:
"From now on, the so -called Hamburg Port Syndrome will frequently occur. From China, Federal Germany is an important card in its strategic chain. Beijing believes that once Germany falls, it will trigger the Domino effect of other countries in other countries. The United States will fail to cut off the connection between China and the West through chips and other measures. The Communist Party of China also knows how to control Germany: that is, through economic coercion. In view of this, the German government's decision -making decision on Hamburg Port is issued in the error time. Error signal.
 Last week, the German government approved the plan to invest Chinese capital to invest in Hamburg Port.
Western countries have only expressed their indignation of human rights trampled on human rights, but in the past two years, China has realized that the Western position on China is undergoing turns. The Russian invasion of Urotic War brought the considerations of geopolitical politics to European political thinking, and also attracted great attention to Europe's economic dependence on China.
On a large political stage, China has not yet fully effective to implement Xi Jinping's willingness. Because of this, the CCP will be more keen on small projects such as Hamburg Port. And we will only bring more stress on any bowing of coercion. "
Inding the content of other media, does not represent the position or view of the Voice of Germany. _ _ 吧 _

The Thai Democratic opposition party agreed to join the Thai party to join the governing alliance led by the advanced party.
Agence France -Presse reported that former Thai Prime Minister Daisin's daughter Peitan, which belongs to the Thai party on Monday (May 15), announced that he agreed to join the governing alliance led by another opposition party.
He has invited five opposition parties to include the establishment of a governing alliance for the Thai party. In Sunday's parliamentary elections, the advanced party has the highest votes.
The 43 -year -old Tower showed that he was ready to be the Prime Minister.
At a press conference, the Pagoda warned that if someone tried to interfere with the results of the Sunday's election, which led to the generation of a few governments, it would pay a heavy price for this.
The chairman of the Election Commission, Wen Baizong, said at a press conference on Monday that according to 99.18%of the computing votes, the Qianjin Party and the Thai Party won 112 seats in the 400 election seats of the next House of Faces, and in the 100 political party seats of the houses in the house, the Thai party The APPC and the Thai Party also won about two -thirds of the seats.
This means that these two democratic parties have far exceeded the simple majority of 250 seats in the house.
About 52.28 million voters voted for the number of houses in the house and party seats in the house. The 500 seats in Thailand include 400 constituency seats and 100 political party seats; there are 250 seats in the House of House, of which 244 are led by the military governance regiment, and 6 of the 6 seats are retained to military leaders.
Because 250 members of the House of House ofhere in Thailand are assigned by the military, even if the democratic parties have won most of the seats in the House of Commons, they may not be able to successfully win the prime minister after the election. The Prime Minister candidate must get more than half of the support votes in the upper and lower courtyards, that is, at least 376 votes to be elected to the Prime Minister.

Leaders of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, and Italy will fly to Hiroshima to discuss and discuss specific international issues. The outside world estimates that this summit will focus on discussing China's issue and issued a statement on response to China's "economic coercion" in response to China.
At the same time, the China-Central Asian Summit will also launch a two-day meeting in Xi'an this Thursday. According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the summit with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan to attend the summit. Except for President Turkmenistan, the remaining four presidents will have a state visit to China at the same time.
** Scholars: The two summits simultaneously show that the country and the land power state confront the state against the country.
According to the outside world, the China-Central Asian Summit was selected at the same time as the Seventh National Group Summit. What does it mean behind it? Professor Wang Weizheng, Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, Adelphiuniversity, told reporters in an interview that after the 911 incident in 2001, China and Central Asia have organized Shanghai International Organization to deal with the so -called terrorism. The spread of Xinjiang; and after Xi Jinping served as the President of China, the "Belt and Road" project has invested in a large number of Central Asia countries, which has given China and Central Asia more geographical political connection. In Central Asian countries, they also want to gain a more independent status between Russia and China.
Wang Weizheng said: "In addition to the historical background, the special selection is selected from May 18th (summit). Obviously, it is obvious that the sumal of the sumal meeting in the Hiroshima of Japan. , Ocean countries, another China and Central Asia, are mainly authoritarian countries and land power countries. From the map, there is a feeling of the confrontation between marine countries and land power countries. "
Wang Weizheng analyzed that for China, Beijing also wanted to take advantage of Russia to take care of its influence in Central Asia while Russia was overwhelmed: "China hopes to stabilize a site, this site is Eurasia. People who have studied geopolitics in the past It is said that who can control the Eurasian mainland can control the world. I think China is from this focus. On the other hand, China's economic development is quite rapid, and it is always concerned about energy security. Land, do not through the ocean, you can buy oil in the inland, and even have oil pipes. "
Scholars: Chinese foreign policy prompts South Korea to turn

On Monday, the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CENTER for Strategic and InternationalStudies) held a discussion on the reasons for the transformation of South Korea's policy on Chinese policy.
Ramon Pachecopardo, a part -time researcher at the think tank, pointed out that when Yin Xiyue visited the United States, the joint statement between Biden and Yin Xiyue talked about Taiwan, the South China Sea, and China about South Korea's economic stress. South Korea's defense, diplomacy, and economic policies have publicly expressed criticism. Interestingly, China has expressed dissatisfaction with South Korea in the past, but now China has a very public criticism of South Korea. The same is true of attitude .... What is more interesting is that South Korea will attack China's criticism instead of bowing heads or apologies. "
Victorcha, senior vice president of Asian Affairs of Strategy and International Research Center, also said that because South Korea believes that Taiwan's issue is an international issue, this is a great difference with the Beijing authorities that Taiwan's problem belongs to the internal affairs: "China believes that South Korea thinks of Taiwan to Taiwan to Taiwan The issue of the issue offended to China, but South Korea's position in this matter is firm. "
Scholars: Chinese invasion ambitions cause Korean public opinion to cause disgusting 
Pado said at the meeting that South Korea's attitude towards China is becoming more tough because China is increasingly threatened and aggressive in the Indo -Pacific region: "China has made some territorial sovereignty claims, but these territories have long been owned by South Korea for a long time. This makes people from all generations of South Korea have a negative view of China. This is important because public opinion will affect the foreign policy of democratic countries. ... And many Koreans are worried about Taiwan. They are worried about what happened in Hong Kong. They are worried about what happened in Hong Kong. There will be an encounter with Hong Kong in Taiwan, so the public's impression of China is even more negative. "Reporter: Tang Yuanyuan Responsible: He Ping.com Editor: Hong Wei

A spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior clarified that the questioned police station was "not a fixed place, but a mobile facility." Chinese citizens and non -Chinese citizens extended "official duties" on behalf of Beijing.
Germany is re -evaluating bilateral relations with China. Although China is still the biggest trading partner in Germany, people are increasingly worried that China will become strategic competitors.

The Yonhap News Agency reported that the South Korean Meteorological Agency held an expert meeting on Monday (May 15) and last Friday (12th) to discuss the recent earthquakes on the waters of the northeast of Donghai City, Jiangyuan Road.
Essence This is the largest magnitude of about 30 earthquakes recorded in this sea area from April 23, and it is also the strongest earthquake that has occurred in the Korean Peninsula and the surrounding waters this year.

 Ford's share in the Chinese market last year was 2.1 %. (Reuters)
Ford Motor (Ford Motor) (New York Stock Exchange code: f) 
According to local media reports such as the Economic Daily, Ford Motor Corporation has plans to lay off more than 1,300 people in China as the sales volume of the world's largest automotive market has continued to decline.
Ford's wholesale volume in China fell below 500,000 in 10 years last year, continuing a trend that it has begun since 2016. At that time, the American auto manufacturer shipped a total of 1.27 million vehicles with a market share of 4.6 %. However, as Chinese consumers have more and more accepted Tesla electric vehicles, and electric vehicles produced by local companies such as BYD (BYD), Ford's market share is defeated to 2.1 % last year.
Bloomberg quoted Ford spokesman: "Our cost is not competitive, so internally, and with our partners, we strive to reduce the cost of all fields. We can only win through the structural organization with excellence and response. It is necessary to build healthier and sustainable business in China. "
The spokesman also said: "China is still a very important market, and Ford will strive to develop our business here. We will continue to accelerate the transformation process in China. Our new local electric vehicle products are under development.
