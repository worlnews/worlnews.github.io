However, some critics believe that the British's move is too "mild", and it cannot prevent Hong Kong from retreat from the rule of law and the unfair trial that Li Zhiying is about to face.

According to Reuters on May 26, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently submitted to the parliament from July 1 to December 31, 2022, the "Sino -British Joint Statement" in Hong Kong. Guoan Law in the port area.

British Foreign Minister Claidley(James Cleverly, also translated: Qi Zhanming)In this report, he pointed out that he emphasized how the Hong Kong authorities used the National Security Law to suppress opponents at the United Nations hearing in February this year, and many of them were detained or forced to exile overseas. He called on the Beijing authorities to implement the suggestions made in a independent investigation report in July last year in a independent investigation report to cancel the "National Security Law" implemented in Hong Kong in Hong Kong in 2020.

Clever also stated in the preface that "we stand with our partners to condemn the continuous erosion of Hong Kong citizens and political rights, as well as the continuous erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy."

Yuan Gongyi, a well -known Hong Kong activist in Canada and the initiator of the "Hong Kong Parliament", said in an interview with this station that the British move was too "gentle". The government's pressure: "Britain should go to the United Nations and the Hague International Court to sue China to violate the" Sino -British Joint Statement ", but the United Kingdom dare not, and the United Kingdom dares not to sanction many officials in Hong Kong violate the Basic Law and the Sino -British Joint Statement."

He mentioned that even at the beginning of this month, Chinese vice chairman Han Zheng also invited Xi Jinping to attend the Coronation ceremony of the British king.

The British government pointed out in the above report that the law of law in Hong Kong has been eroded, including the transfer of "the power that once belonged to the judicial institution" to Hong Kong leaders who have been in Beijing, and those who face national security accusations cannot question the government's decision in court.

Cleverly mentioned that the Hong Kong media tycoon Li Zhiying, who will face the trial of Guoan in September this year, said that he had proposed to the Li Zhiying case to the Li Zhiying case this month.

Yang Jinxia, the convener of the New York Hong Kong people "NY4HK", told the station that the clause of the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District was blurred and the interpretation right was completely belonging to Beijing. Social stability. "

"Guoan Law has a great impact on Hong Kong, because this law has no procedures in the law, and many things are vague. It can be sued by what you do." She said, "Also There are conflicts with the human rights law in the world and the "UN Human Rights Charter". For many people, you do not know when the National Security Law is sentenced to being sentenced. "

Li Zhiying, 75, was the founder of the Hong Kong "Apple Daily". The newspaper was searched by the police in 2021 and then stopped.

This station previously reported that the Hong Kong court rejected Li Zhiying's judicial review application on hiring British lawyers to act as an agent of the British lawyer last week. According to the latest bill passed by the Hong Kong legislature, Hong Kong leaders have free tailoring to prevent foreign lawyers from acting as national security cases in Hong Kong. Pan Zhaochu, the chief judge who rejected Li Zhiying's review, stated in the judgment that the Hong Kong court has no judicial jurisdiction over the National Security Council, and the National Security Commission is not challenged by judicial review.

Yang Jinxia welcomes Western countries such as the United Kingdom to concern Hong Kong's democratic situation, but she does not have much hope for whether the trial of the upcoming Li Zhiying case can be fair.

"In Li Zhiying's case, some of the charges of some business, in the middle (whether) have evidence to sue him, all vague." She said: "Britain should speak more, and I am also glad that they finally speak. But will it affect Li Zhiying better when sentenced, I really have no confidence. "

At the same time, the Chinese government responded strongly to the British report. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference on the 26th that the British party "seriously violates the principles of international law and the basic principles of international relations." She said: "Britain has no sovereignty, governance, and supervision power to Hong Kong after the return. The Chinese government's legal basis for governing Hong Kong is the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law on Hong Kong, and it is by no means a" Sino -British Joint Statement "."

The Hong Kong government also stated to the British "Hong Kong Issue Half -year Report" "strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition." The government commissions released by the Hong Kong authorities on the 25th said that this report is a malicious slander and political attack on Hong Kong under the success of the successful practice of "one country, two systems". Hong Kong affairs that is purely in the Chinese internal affairs. "

A spokesman for the Hong Kong Government also emphasized that the National Security Law and the Basic Law such as the Hong Kong District and the Basic Law are applicable to the relevant regulations of Hong Kong, that is, the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the public, including freedom of speech and news. However, "related rights and freedom are not absolute." A spokesman also said, "The United Kingdom does not have a system of recognizing the overseas lawyer project in Hong Kong, let alone that overseas lawyers who are not qualified to be qualified to handle British security cases are allowed. Add the beak, which is a typical 'dual standard'. "

However, Yuan Gongyi believes that Li Zhiying, as a Hong Kong person holding a British passport, hired foreign lawyer agents in accordance with laws and regulations to avoid unsuccessful trials, which is exactly legitimate.

The outside world has noticed that since the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong in Beijing, the relationship between London and Beijing has been nervous, but Dominicjohnson (also translated: Zhuang Dunwen), the Minister of Commerce and Trade the Ministry of Commerce and Trade.

Ji Xinji, a scholar, wears thick glasses, and has a high degree of recognition. He took his mother tongue's German accent and talked about his wisdom, but his tone did not restrain frustration. Nevertheless, even the strictest critics have to be convinced of his talent.

Ji Xinji advocated real politics and defended power and national interests coldly. After he stepped down in 1977, he was basically outdated when he promoted moralism, but he could still be said to be still reputable.

"He was able to get away, I was confused about it."

Brock said that there will be an influential legal case of Timori. Ji Xinji will not only approve the invasion in this case, but also ensure that American weapons continue to flow to the Indonesian military.

Brock also proposed a recording that Ji Xinji told Nixon that the Air Force had ordered the Air Force to bomb the "any movement" in Cambodia. There is no differential bombing of civilians.

The veteran writer Christopher Hitchens appealed to the trial of Ji Xinchi because he acquiesced in Turkey in 1974 invasion of Sai Price.

Ji Xinji and Northern Vietnamese negotiated representative Le Ductho in 1973 became the Nobel Prize winner to recognize their contributions to the ceasefire in Vietnam. But Lede Shou refused to accept this peaceful award that caused controversy.

Zeng Shi Tan Ji Xinji's HOFSTRA University historian Carolyneisenberg said: "Ironically, he is famous for his creation of peace, but he has always caused war in war Upgrade, not only in Vietnam, but also in Cambodia and Laos. "

### Bayeng government out of the "oolong", and the US -China relations "recover" and then the shadow

** U.S. President Biden disclosed at the closing of the Seventh National Group Summit earlier that he lifted the sanctions against the Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu "in negotiations." He also said that the spy balloon incident that had occurred in February this year was quite stupid; and said that the relationship between the two countries was expected to "thaw." **

Biden's remarks have received widespread attention. However, just one day later, a US State Department spokesman made clarification saying that it would not cancel the sanctions against Li Shangfu **, and ** let the "heating back" be covered with thick fog.

On Monday (May 22), when asked if he was considering the dismissal of the sanctions against the Chinese defense ministers, the US State Council spokesman Matthew Miller said, "No, we don't."

Miller also said that Biden "clearly stated that we do not intend to lift any sanctions that he or more extensively imposed on him."

In recent years, the United States and China have risen sharply due to trade frictions, high -tech competition, and a series of issues such as Taiwan and South China Sea.

President Biden and President Xi Jinping ushered in some dawn in Bali last November for a relaxation relationship. However, the bilateral relations in February turned cold again, and entered the "dangerous thunder areas" worried by experts.

After the Spy -Balloon incident in February, the United States canceled the original trip to China by Secretary of State Brostess. But in recent months, many of the generals of Washington have expressed their willingness to talk to Beijing. Brinken said in early May that he hopes to visit China this year. In addition, US Treasury Secretary Janetyellen and US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo have also expressed many times that they hope to visit China in the near future.

But China seems to be cold. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said in a question about Yellen's visit to China on the 19th that "it maintains necessary communication between China and the United States", but did not respond to specific details.

According to the information released by the US Department of Defense, in February this year, China had rejected the request of US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the time to meet with Wei Feng and the time.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly reiterated that the United States cannot say that they have to communicate, while suppressing and curbing China while they have to communicate.

Bonnieglaser, the director of the Marshall Foundation of the United States (GMF), said that China had privately stated that Li Shangfu would not meet with Austin in Shangri -La in Singapore unless the United States was lifted sanctions.

Because Li Shangfu has only been appointed recently, if you do not meet this time, "it may mean that there will be no meeting between high -level national defense officials in a few years," Ge Laiyi said.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed "resolute opposition" to the maintenance of US sanctions on the United States. After Biden said that the termination of sanctions was being negotiated, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning said on the 22nd: "The United States should immediately revoke the sanctions and take practical actions to clear the obstacles, create an atmosphere, and create favorable conditions for dialogue communication."

Sun Yun, the director of the Chinese project (Stimsoncenter), said: "Since the United States wants to seek official military exchanges and dialogues with China, to relieve sanctions against the Chinese National Defense Minister is a necessary condition for restoring dialogue. Military exchanges, it seems inevitable to relieve sanctions. "

A spokesman for the US Department of Defense previously stated that the sanctions on Li Shangfu did not affect the meeting of the two countries' defense ministers, and said that the United States continued to seek communication with the Chinese military, "to ensure that competition would not evolve into a conflict."

Liu Yawei, director of the China Project of Carter Center in the United States, said that US -China relations have entered the "dangerous thunder areas". President Bayeng finally realized that the current zero -sum game between China and the United States is very dangerous for the peaceful coexistence of the two countries and the stability of the world.

He said that Biden was likely to use this opportunity to ease the relationship and get the opportunity to meet the sanctions against Li Shangfu in exchange for the opportunity of both military seniors.

"Biden and its Chinese team have always emphasized that no matter how fierce competition with China, it is necessary to maintain communication channels with the Chinese government leaders and decision -making teams." Liu Yawei said, "I want to be dismissed by the Chinese policy team. President Bayeng also felt that this was feasible for General Li Shangfu's sanctions. "

He also said: "Cancel or retain sanctions itself is actually not important to the United States."

Li Shangfu just took office in March this year. Before the new, he served as the deputy minister of the General Equipment Department of the PLA, deputy commander and chief of staff of the PLA Strategic Support Force, and Minister of Equipment Development of the Central Military Commission. According to reports, he tried to purchase the Soviet 35 fighter and S-400 air missiles from Russia in 2017 and 2018. At that time, the Trump government joined the special list of the Treasurer at the time, and banned American citizens from having business exchanges with them.Sharvin Wang Yi meeting: The highest level in the United States after the "Balloon Incident"

### Two dilemmas

For the United States, even if it has no practical significance to Li Shangfu's sanctions, it is also a problem to relieve sanctions.

Liu Yawei said that the clarification of a State Council spokesman showed that President Bayeng's Chinese policy team was inconsistent, and he was also divided into eagle and pigeons.

He explained that if the sanctions against General Li Shangfu were canceled, Congress's criticism would definitely be very severe. Secondly, the American Anti -China camp will also use this to make a big article, criticizing President Biden Bayeng's "sinister CCP is too soft -handed."

"The Bayeng government's" Outbestion "shows that even if he has the willingness to stabilize and improve US -China relations, it is actually very difficult to take out practical actions according to the requirements of China," Liu Yawei said.

"The thawing of Sino -US relations requires both parties to change their words and deeds and revise their internal and external policies. At present, no signs of starting the" head "on both sides can not be seen."

A total of 179 employees of four branches of its four branches have recently been taken away by the Anhui police. Three of them were approved for arrest. Yongxiong Group has previously complained. People familiar with the matter disclosed that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security supervised the case, and the Anhui police arrested people across provinces and detained in different places.

Hunan Yongxiong Asset Management Group, known as the "China's Largest Collection (Debt Reception) Company", released the "Complaint for All Employees" on Thursday, saying that the Anhui police arrested 179 employees across the provincial law enforcement. The funds were frozen, and it was difficult to operate. During the heyday of the group, there were more than 10,000 employees, and they also planned to go public in the United States. The founders said that the revenue target this year exceeded 1 billion yuan. However, employees' debt collection methods are controversial.

According to a retired police officer who is unwilling to disclose his name due to personal safety, Hunan told the station on Friday that the case may be a case of the supervision of the Ministry of Public Security, otherwise the Anhui police had no right to go to Hunan to take 179 people: "This case was taken over by the Anhui police to take over this case. , Instead of the Hunan Police, it shows that Yongxiong Company and Hunan officialdom and police have inextricable connections. The authorities handling cases in different places to eliminate interference. This is a case supervised by the Ministry of Public Security. "

Mr. Li Li, deputy director of the former police station in Hunan, said in an interview with this station that the debt collection of Yongxiong Company adopted the debt chase with a triad intimidation method, which has long aroused the attention of Beijing, but the Hunan police have been indifferent for a long time. He said, as the Chinese private economy fades out of the market, the business of these debt -chasing companies has shrunk, and there is no value in existence: "It (company) debt collection is a triad nature. If it is said to be bigger and stronger, The name, there is no official background behind it, it is impossible, it has been killed for a long time. Many years ago, there was a security company in Beijing that intercepting the petitioner named An Yuanding, which is also a triad. Cooperate with the government, when the government is inconvenient to come forward, it will come forward. "

** The arrested employees of the Ministry of Public Security involved in black and different places **

According to Red Star News, on May 25, the reporter called the Public Security Department of Anhui Province to ask about the details of the case of the Yongxiong Group. The relevant department replied: "The case is under investigation." Police investigating cases can exclude interference; exclude resistance; it is conducive to finding the facts.

The First Financial website reported that in 2023, Yongxiong Group will strive to achieve the annual task goals of the year in the year. However, in recent years, Yongxiong Group has been caught in the cusp of public opinion due to the collection incident. According to media statistics, as of May 22, Yongxiong Group's complaints on the black cat complaint platform reached 153. Among them, there were many complaints such as "SMS threats", "telephone bombing", "explosive address book", and "harassing others". There are even complaints about the situation where Yongxiong pretend to be public prosecutors.

Current affairs commentators Wang Zheng believes that the debt collection companies are similar to the results of the discipline execution judgment with the bailiffs. In the future, debt collection may be directly responsible for the court, which is also a considerable income for the government. He said to this station: "They (debt collection companies) touched the court's execution court system. This 'cake', the court will take it back. In the future, the debt dispute may be sued the court to the court and the court executes debt chase. Digital companies may cooperate with the court in the future. "

Yongxiong Group is known as the "largest domestic collection company". Its official website shows that the company was established in April 2014 and is headquartered in Changsha, Hunan. Branch covers more than 20 cities across the country. Management field. In 2019, Yongxiong Group submitted a listing application to the US Securities Regulatory Commission, and then withdrew the application.

At present, there are more than 3,000 collection companies in China, of which employees of Yongxiong Group have been reduced from 17,000 before the epidemic to about 3,000 people.

(Voice of Germany Chinese), Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao and US Minister of Commerce Ginaraimondo held a meeting in Washington on Thursday (May 25). The Ministry of Commerce China issued a statement saying that the two sides conducted a "frank, professional and constructive exchange" on the economic and trade issues of Sino -US economic and trade relations and common concern. China focuses on the expressed concerns of the US's economic and trade policies, semiconductor policies, export control, and foreign investment review.

The US Department of Commerce stated that when Raymondo met with Wang Wentao, he also expressed concern about a series of actions adopted by Chinese companies in China recently.

The meeting between Wang Wentao and Raymond is the first cabinet -level meeting held by Chinese and US officials in the U.S. capital since Bynden ruling. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that "the two parties agree to establish communication channels to maintain and strengthen exchanges on specific economic and trade concerns and cooperation matters."

According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, Wang Wentao has met with a number of American companies in Shanghai earlier this week, including Johnson & Johnson, 3M, Dow (DOW), Merck, Honeywell, Honeywell, and Honeywell. And told them: "China will continue to welcome US -funded enterprises to develop in China to achieve win -win."

Earlier this month, the US Minister of Commerce Raymond also met with a delegation of the American Chamber of Commerce in the People'sRepublic of China. People familiar with the matter revealed that during this period, she heard representatives of American companies' representatives [a series of raids, detention and investigation operations recently launched by Chinese companies](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國加強反間諜-諮詢公司涉危害國安遭查/a-65557271)Worries.

According to people familiar with the matter, Raymond Duo said that she will show to the Chinese side that the purpose of the US government policy is to reduce risks, not to decompose with China. Raymond Duo told the delegation that she intends to promote the development of economic relations in both sides under the conditions that both sides can accept, and look forward to visiting China later this year.

After the "spy balloon" incident earlier this year, Sino -US relations have continued to deteriorate, and the economic and trade relations between China and the United States have also had twists and turns. In China, in the recent risk of Guoan, [requiring key infrastructure operators to stop purchasing American semiconductor companies Micron (Micron) products](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國封殺美光-美反對無事實根據的限制/a-65693360)Essence Earlier, China conducted an assault inspection of many US consultants.

At the Seventh -way Group (G7) summit that ended a few days ago, the leaders of member states criticized China's "economic coercion", saying that they would be with the world's second largest economy ["de -risk", but emphasized that it was not "decoupled"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/g7联合公报政策方针不是为了伤害中国/a-65684805)Essence

### I expected to see Daiqi

Wang Wentao went to the United States to participate in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Minister of Trade, which was held on the 25th and 26th on the 25th and 26th. Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shu Tingting confirmed on the 25th that Wang Wentao would also meet with Katherinetai, a US trading representative during the APEC meeting.

Earlier this week, Daiqi once said to the South China Morning Post that he hoped to see Wang Wentao at the APEC conference. As of now, the Office of the US Trade Representative has not confirmed the meeting between Dai Qi and Wang Wentao. The White House spokesman Johnkirby said on the 24th that the discussion about the meeting with Daiqi continued.

Reuters reported that the two major US trade unions leaders said at the APEC Minister of Trade on the 25th that trade policies in the United States and China must achieve a fair balance between workers' needs and corporate profits. Shawnfain, chairman of the American Automobile Workers' Federation, said that they were not opposed to trade, but against unilateral trade, and pointed out that the trade between the United States and China was not balanced.

When discussing the role of workers in trade policies with Daiqi and Fien, the Secretary-General of the US Labor Federation Industrial Trade Union (AFL-CIO) FrederickRdmond toughly stated: "We do not expect Ambassador Daiqi to China The invasion of the invasion is a concession. "

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T01-55-00Z/62238357_401.jpg)Some US media analysis has been accused by mutual accusations since several months, and US -China relations are about to enter a new stage.

###?

Before the APEC Minister of Trade, the Wall Street Journal published a report and analysis. After several months of accusations, US -China relations are about to enter a new stage. The meeting between Wang Wentao and Raymond may determine whether the two major powers can restore the previous high -level exchanges of the "spy balloon" incident.

An anonymous U.S. official revealed to the newspaper that Beijing's recent tentative restoration of diplomatic relations with Washington was partly because Chinese leaders believed that they are currently in a more favorable position. Xi Jinping has successively received a number of European leaders, trying to split the Western alliance, and establishes a solid trade relationship with Brazilian President. The US official said, "They think we don't look good."

With Washington will still strive to rebuild basic communication channels. "

This is especially true for China, which has become a scientific power.

There are also reasons for the Chinese government in academic cooperation. It is much more difficult to carry out research in China than in the past, because China is more and more attached to ideology and national security, and it is considered as more and more sensitive. Academic freedom continues to decrease. Before the end of December last year, it implemented nearly three three execution. The "clear zero" policy brings a suffocating impact.

But we should not compete with China. If the United States cannot attract top international research talents, it will damage the prospects of scientific progress in the United States and ultimately damage the economic strength and national strength of the United States.

There is no doubt that the current situation is required to increase the transparency among scholars. Universities need to lead this change, and scholars will pay more attention to the impact of cooperating with foreign scientists.

### Japan to join the restricted chip equipment export camp in the United States to complete the surrounding of China?

The United States is rapidly increasing efforts to hinder China's progress in the semiconductor industry.

** This week, the Japanese government announced that the new regulations for restricting export semiconductor manufacturing equipment will officially take effect on July 23. In March, Japan has announced export control to 23 high -performance semiconductor manufacturing equipment. **

The new rules do not specify that it is targeted at China, but it is limited to 160 countries including China, but China accounts for about 30 % of its export scale of its semiconductor manufacturing equipment, accounting for the highest proportion.

23 export control equipment cover multiple links such as semiconductor cleaning, film formation, light carving, etching, detection, etc. The Ministry of Economics and Industry of Japan states that this move is mainly to prevent semiconductors from being used for military purposes to cope with the increasingly severe international security environment.

The Ministry of Commerce of China responded that this was an abuse of export control measures, a serious departure to free trade and international economic and trade rules, and China resolutely opposed it.

###  What does it mean

Since the Trump era, the United States has gradually embarked on chip (chip) in China, and then extended further to chip manufacturing equipment. As early as 2018, under the demands of the United States, the Netherlands had embarked on the most advanced extremely ultraviolet light carved machine produced by the ASML company in China.

American investors are also prohibited from holding or trading SMIC.

After Biden came to power, he sought to further exclude China in the global chip industry chain. A White House security adviser said that the reason for restricting chip exports in the past was "only for several generations than China", and now it is "we must do everything possible to maintain a big leading advantage."

Gregory C.Allen, a researcher at the US Strategy and International Research Center, believes that the specific strategy is reflected in four points, which is first forbidden to use high -end chips used in artificial intelligence and other industries. The development of chips; embargoing US -made semiconductor equipment, blocking the development of Chinese enterprises in the manufacturing of high -end chips; embargoing semiconductor equipment components, and blocking the development of Chinese enterprises in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

The first point has been realized. On October 7 last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce Industry and Security (BIS) announced new controls on chip exports. Among them, the logical chip production tools for selling 18 nanometer and below DRAM chips, 28th and above NAND flash memory chips, 14nm and below FinFET processing techniques will take effect immediately.

Subsequently, the embargo began to extend to manufacturing equipment and parts. Although the most advanced ultraviolet light carvings have been embarked on China, China can also import a wider range of deep ultraviolet light engraving machines, while only the Dutch Asmore and Japan from the Netherlands and Japan. Nikon.

At the China Import Expo held in Shanghai in 2021, a booth of a Japanese semiconductor company.

Reuters said that the United States adopted measures to ensure that companies can maintain their competitive advantages, and these measures need to be effective, which requires cooperation between two industry giants in Japan and the Netherlands.

In January of this year, the US President Biden met with the Prime Minister of the two countries, hoping to strengthen export control of advanced technical equipment together, and arranged the three -party talks to finalize the details. In March, the Netherlands and Japan announced their export control plans. This week, Japan announced a specific timetable.

"This will destroy the market expansion of the Japanese company. From the perspective of regulatory, it will definitely reduce their competitiveness," said Suzuki Takura, the Chinese economic investigation director of Dashangushe Maruka in Japan, said that there is a lack of a sufficient large chip market in Japan. These export restrictions will be a blow for Japanese chip equipment manufacturers.

At present, the scale of the Japanese chip manufacturing equipment industry is about $ 30 billion, of which 10 billion US dollars of orders come from China, ranking first in various markets.

### China's response

Under the above series of Chinese chips, China implemented its first counterattack -May 21, China announced that Micron's products "have more serious network security hazards", which has caused major security to China's "key information infrastructure supply chain supply chain Risk "affects national security. Institute of "key information infrastructure operators should stop purchasing Micron's products."

Micron is the largest storage chip manufacturer in the United States. It is widely used in electronic devices. The Chinese market accounts for about 10%of the company's total sales.

Xing Yuqing, a lifelong professor of economics at the University of Japan's National Policy Research University, said that Chinese companies obviously do not master the "blocking point" of the semiconductor industry and technology. Therefore, the United States cannot be implemented for the United States.

Xing Yuqing said, but the popular statement of China is to change technology in the market. Now the United States starts the embargo of semiconductor technology, which means that the two parties have ended the tacit understanding of market transformation. If you do n’t give technology, do n’t expect the market. This is a counterattack in China's use of market advantages. How the effect depends on how the United States has played.

Some experts believe that chips have become "current oil" and are vulnerable to geopolitics and triggered the global crisis.

However, from the perspective of Japan, China and the United States to tear their faces are also good. Just as China announced the supervision of Micron, Bloomberg quoted people familiar with the matter that Micron Technology would obtain about $ 1.5 billion from the Japanese government for local production of the next -generation storage chips in the local area, which is beneficial to enhance Japan's domestic semiconductor production. Chip production forms backup forces.In the long run, under a comprehensive export restriction, Chinese enterprises will be greatly affected. For example, EDA, an essential software for the design link -electronic design automation software. The three giants in this field are all American companies; in the core optical machine in the manufacturing link, China does not have independent manufacturing capabilities, and the main optical carciers are affected The United States ban restraint. If you get rid of the existing technological achievements, the capital and cycles are too large and too long from zero accumulation.

And these influences will continue to transmit along the chip to the lower reaches of the industry chain -the international competitiveness of mobile phone companies will decline, such as Huawei has to withdraw from the international mobile phone market; electric vehicles are becoming China's most potential pillar industry. The number of exports in April is It reached 91,000 units, an increase of 1028.5%year -on -year, while the average of about 3,000 chips is used for electric vehicles, which is more than twice as much as non -electric vehicles.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T02-44-53-08-00/ontech_chen-1-ztcf-jumbo.jpg)A few months ago, my colleagues [Kad Metz and Kevin Ross explained the internal principle of artificial intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbot.html)Including OPENAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Barde and Google's BARD and other chatbots. This time we brought a new mission: help you learn how to make full use of artificial intelligence.

People from all walks of life -students, programmers, artists and accountants -they are experimenting how to use artificial intelligence tools. Employers release recruitment information to find people who are good at using them. If you have not used artificial intelligence to simplify and improve your work and personal life, you will soon have the opportunity to do so.

As a personal science and technology columnist in Times, I will help you understand how to use these tools safely and responsiblely to improve many aspects of your life.

I will discuss two common practices in today's current affairs communication, which are useful in many cases.

Then, in the next few weeks, I will provide more specific suggestions on different aspects of life, including parenting and family life, work, arrangement of personal life, learning/education, creativity and shopping.

First list some common sense warnings:

• If you are worried about privacy, don't enter your personal details such as your name and work place. Technology companies say that your data is used to train their system, which means that others may see your information.

• [Do not share confidential data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-use-by-staff-after-leak)Essence Your employer may formulate specific guidelines or restrictions on using artificial intelligence, but in general, entering business secrets or sensitive information is a very bad idea.

• Phantom: Chat robots are called [Large Language Model] in a large language model](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html) (LLM)Based on technology, this technology has obtained a large number of digital text selected from the Internet. Many information on the Internet are wrong, and the chat robot may repeat these error information. They work hard to predict the law from a huge training data, but sometimes, [they may](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html)Corporation.

** Gold ** ** Reminder **

[Chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/chat), [ must](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx)[Bard](https://bard.google.com/)It is the most popular artificial intelligence chat robot. (Use ChatGPT to create an OpenAI account, and you need to subscribe to use the highest -level version. You must need Microsoft's EDGE network browser. Use Bard to need a Google account.)

Although they look simple and easy to use -enter the content in the box to get the answer!——In the wrong way, ask questions that will produce general, useless, and sometimes even completely wrong answers.

It turns out that input accurate words and expression to generate the most useful answers is a science. I call these gold tips.

Those who make full use of the chat robot have been using the following strategies:

** "Pretend you are." ** uses these magical words as the beginning of the prompts to imitate experts in the indicator robot. For example, enter "pretending to be SAT's tutor" or "pretending to be a private coach" to model people who guide robots around these professions.

These prompts provide additional background information for artificial intelligence generation response. Artificial intelligence does not actually understand what a counselor or private coach means. But this prompt is to call artificial intelligence to call specific statistical modes in its training data.

advertise

The result of lack of guidance is not helpful. If you just enter "What should I eat this week?" The chatbot will list a pan -balanced diet, such as eating fried chickens for dinner, and colorful vegetables (for me, it sounds very ribly).

** "Tell me what information you need." ** Get a more personalized result -for example, health advice for your specific body shape or physical condition -you can invite robots to ask you more information.

In the example of a private coach, the prompt can be: "Pretend you are my personal coach. I formulate a weekly exercise plan and diet plan for me. Tell me what information you need." Then, the robot may ask your age, Height, weight, taboo, and health goals, tailor -tailor -made diet and fitness plans for you.

If you do not get a good answer when you try it for the first time, don't give up immediately. A better approach is to say with the professor of Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania.(https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-boarding-your-ai-intern?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2): "When it makes mistakes, point out errors and ask it to do better." You may get better results with patience with tolerance.

** Keep your dialogue with the chat robot **

After the input prompts are ease, you can make your chat robot more helpful over time. The key here is to avoid searching your chat robot as a network, and start with a new instruction every time. Instead, retain multiple dialogue threads, and move to these threads over time to increase dialogue.

advertise

This strategy is the simplest when using ChatGPT. You must require you to reset your dialogue regularly, and in Bard, jumping between dialogue threads is not so easy.

Australian entrepreneur Natalie Josette provided consultation on how to use artificial intelligence. She regarded ChatGPT as a commercial coach and administrative assistant. For every role, she has a separate conversation.

On the business coach dialogue thread, she shared insights on her professional background, company goals and problems. On the executive assistant dialogue thread, she shared the schedule of information, such as the client she was going to meet.She shared an additional gold reminder and has used it to train her assistant to be more helpful: using the framework. She recently read a book about entrepreneurial "Stub". When she asked ChatGPT as a business coach to provide suggestions, she happily saw that it could integrate the principle of the book into the action plan of her expansion company.

The first batch of thorn -needle -needle air defense missiles had arrived in Taiwan and accepted by the military.

The U.S. government announced in 2019 that the FIM-92 Shoulder-shoulder sparning needle-aircraft aircraft-proof missiles were delayed so far. According to Taiwan media reports, some Boeing cargo machine arrived at Taoyuan Airport late at night on May 24th to carry a group of US-supporting Taiwan FIM-92 Shoulder-to-Type-type needle air defense missiles accepted by the Taiwan military. Taiwan ’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed low -key on the 25th.

These missiles are not projects purchased by Taiwan, but U.S. Defense Minister Lloyd Austin recently pointed out that the U.S. government uses the "Presidential Approval Right" plan to provide Taiwan with a $ 500 million military assistance.

** The United States uses the "Presidential Dial -up right" military aid in Taiwan **

Austin said on the 16th that "provides major additional security assistance to Taiwan." Li Shiqiang, the director of the Ministry of National Defense Regulations, said on the 25th that the assistance items were previously determined and they were all in stock, and it will begin recently.

The director of the Taiwan Institute of Defense and Safety, Shen Mingshu, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia on the 26th that "in order to respond to the threat of the Communist Party of China, some weapons ordered some weapons ordered by the United States have not yet been sent. Weighing Ukrainian demand and the most urgent project at the current national defense defense. "

Shen Mingshi said that the United States first looked for the inventory. In the early days of the United States, the US military aided Ukraine's benchmark missiles and thorn needle missiles played a lot of functions. Now Ukraine has obtained the Patriot missile system. Or it is not so urgent.

Researcher Jie Zhong, a researcher at the China Strategic Foresight Association in Taiwan, also pointed out that the Taiwan military has been fighting for the purchase of thorns for more than 20 years. The United States originally refused to sell. Assist Ukraine and NATO allies.

In response to the first batch of military aids in Taiwan at this time, Jiezhong's judgment is not an intelligence show that the war is about to start.

** US military assistance helps ** ** slow ** ** solve the "suspicion theory" in Taiwan

Jiezhong said: "The U.S. Indo -Pacific strategy hopes that countries around China and the United States to maintain close cooperation. If Taiwanese people cannot solve doubts about the United States due to the delay of military sales, they will worry about ensuring that Taiwan and the United States cooperate on major issues. I must hope that the U.S. administrative department will take some actions first, which must also be helpful for the DPP government's election and prestige. "

Jiezhong pointed out that the thorn -needle missile is a single -soldier shot, and the single soldier can operate. It is close and low at a close range. At the front line, if an enemy armed helicopter and fighter attack were encountered, it was impossible to get a dense and effective air defense cover. "

Jiezhong said: "US president should have a little advance in the order of weapons allocation in Taiwan, so you can first allocate some inventory in the status quo. To observe whether this is currently on this case, or in the future, or later China Is the status of the Republic of China ahead? "

Shen Ming's room mentioned that during the Cold War, the United States also took military assistance against Taiwan to provide weapons systems and ammunition to Taiwan. Taiwan did not need to pay. After the interruption of the United States, the Taiwan Relations Law. The military -sold weapons and ammunition in Taiwan for many years. The United States has not resumed diplomatic relations and has not signed any defense agreement. Last year, the United States passed a decision with the "National Defense Authorization Law" and passed the national defense budget. In the next five years, it will be US $ 2. billion a year, and a total of $ 10 billion in Taiwan for military aid for five years. Among them assistance. Therefore, there are the first batch of US $ 500 million military assistance this year, and it may assist the benchmark missiles and brackets in the future.

Shen Mingshi said that Lieutenant Lieutenant Liman visited Taiwan with the Czech National Defense University and exchanged with Taiwan National Defense University.

Shen Mingshi mentioned that the media recently reported that the United States has requested NATO to provide a data chain system to Taiwan. Obviously, Taiwan and NATO have not only military education exchanges, but also the exchanges of managing conditions. It can form a general connection during combat, and to some extent can be combined. Military cooperation in the United States, NATO and Taiwan is gradually strengthening and normal. "

Jiezhong believes that Taiwan should hope to observe the Russian and Ukraine War from the eyes of NATO, provide Taiwan's combat tactical training, and deepen each other's high -tech weapons technology and intelligence cooperation and exchanges.

Description: The Chinese talk show has recently caused heated discussions due to "excellent style and can win the battle". Some netizens joked that the Chinese speech review was too harsh. I wanted to do the talk show "either holding his mouth or opening your legs (moist to the free world)." How do the talk show actors look at the tightening of the review red line? What is the difference between the talk show on both sides of the strait? DW visited four talk show actors who performed on both sides of the strait, and asked them to shake the burden of "talk show in China".

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) Taiwan talk show actor East District, from 2018 to 2019, signed a contract with China's "Twist Comedy" and performed in Beijing. He is in the [House event](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被指冒犯解放军-脱口秀演员被警方立案调查/a-65638312)After the outbreak, logging in to WeChat, but found that the many talk shows he joined were taboo.

"There are so many talk show groups. No half of them discuss it." The 40 -year -old Eastern Demon told DW that his personal approach to the Chinese government was not surprising. What surprised him was that House performed in Beijing.

"This is the hidden rules of this circle. These (sensitive) things cannot be spoken." East District Germany said that when he was in China, he must be approved by the authorities and approved it. Involved in the military](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察两条感觉受到侮辱的野狗/a-65730016)It is impossible to pass at all, and actors and audiences who engage in the talk show at the "Beijing's foot" are the worst self -examination.

He said, "You see [Chi Zi even talked in North America (Qing Zero) would have an accident](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国脱口秀在美国那些在国内不能讲的段子/a-64722978)Then he talked in Beijing. North America is so far away!At the foot of Tianzi, it must be the most sensitive place. "" So I don't know why House dared to take off in Beijing, it is really very kind. "

Another talk show actor A with performance experience on both sides of the strait expresses different views on this. He said that after the outbreak of the incident, in fact, many people in China in China have issued a message in space such as WeChat friends circle. Among them, after the post with a large number of coffee positions, the entire little red book and Weibo number will be "disappeared." The relatively small one is relatively unscrupulous, "because I feel that the remarks are not in charge of him."

A further supplemented. For the sensitive issues that House touched this time, or the "special theme" such as the fishy color, there is a talk show actor in China. But he has a negative emotion. He doesn't like a arbiter hanging on his head. Everyone will think that we usually scold each other. I say you have no level. The judge (referring to the Chinese authorities) is another matter. "

Although the punishment of the Chinese talk show in the world did not agree with the incident, Chinese actors seemed not to be surprised by the "laughing fruit accident". A admits that in recent years, the talk show industry has risen too fast in China, and Xiaoguo Culture is one of the unique and most trendy companies.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/墙外文摘脱口秀风波中的国家暴力/a-65689399)"".

As an example, he has been attacked by the Chinese authorities as an example. If there is an industry developing rapidly in China, "the leading company in that industry must basically kneel on the ground to rest and bleed bleeding, bleed bleeding, bleed bleeding first "For 3 years", the talk show has been in China for several years, and has entered the dilemma of incurableness, and there are also stars and companies with high income. "Everyone knows that one day the competent authority will want to check this matter Today, if it is not because of House, it may be because of the next person. "House is just" just stepped on the high -voltage line ", which has become an example of the authorities to kill chickens and monkeys.

### Talking Show with Chinese Characteristics- —— "Hold your mouth" art

As for the so -called "high -voltage line", A told DW according to a "official regulations on his hand" that the Chinese authorities listed the sensitive subjects that the Chinese authorities could not touch the actors. Or religious hatred, discrimination "," not endangering social stability, public order and good customs ", etc., are mostly" classic contents "that have also been controlled by the government in the fields of the Internet and artificial intelligence in recent years. National unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, harm the national honor interests ".

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T05-40-00Z/64873348_401.jpg)The talk show is a fire in China this year. The picture shows a talk show performance held in the Chongqing Municipal Government in 2022

A 28 -year -old foreign actor B, who had taught an English talk show in Shanghai, told DW that about 7 or 8 years ago, when he started a talk show in China, he knew that he could not talk about the government and "3 T -Taiwan Taiwan, Tibet (TIBET), Tiananmen Square (Tiananamensquare) "and other sensitive themes, but now these red lines have" become too much, and their (Chinese authorities) are constantly growing as the list of themes of improper content ... as long as you touch you touch When these subjects, they can block you with this pretext. "

B explains that if you talk about open wheat (OpenMic, no matter ammunition or professional comedy actor can come to the stage to practice, it can be practiced without tickets), or the audience is not required Approved by the Cultural and Trade Bureau beforehand; but if a large -scale session of a business performance or more than 100 viewers, you need to submit the word -by -time draft of the paragraph about one month before the performance, as well as a reading video without emotion.

"If they (Cultural Tourism Bureau), if the human beings are enough, they will send someone to sit in the audience and confirm that you have no manuscript to the manuscript. If you leave the draft or say any offense (the government), It is a fine of at least 20,000 jumps. "East District said that sometimes these official personnel will also bring a video camera behind the auditorium and record the whole process.

Based on the information provided by several respondents, the time required for approval of various cities in China is different, and some even half a year. Therefore, many talk show actors performed nearly one year ago, as far as 3 years ago. Start repeatedly using the paragraph. In addition, the respondents said that the talk show industry has developed rapidly in China and has too many clubs in recent years. In fact, the competent authority is in power. After stepped down, it will also be reminded by the club's manager or peer.

East District Germany said that regardless of performance, whether ticket sales, and whether they need to be approved in advance, the actors will avoid talking about sensitive remarks: "As long as there is a audience is a small pink, he has opinions and actively report to the authorities. Except for your actor," The clubs, organizers, and venues will suffer. Therefore, there is a potential consensus of "do not do this kind of harmful things" and "strictly discipline yourself, self -rhythmia".
###  The talk show in the Ukrainian air defense cave

### Actor with red line dancing

East District Germany said that in the case of "the relevant authorities' policies, politics, and sensitive current affairs, it is definitely not impossible to touch", in fact, the subject matter of doing talk shows in China is very limited. "The subject of resonance", try to make rice without rice. East District said that Chinese comedians "still played flowers" in a limited range that made him admire: "They (Chinese actors) may be used to it, but we (Taiwanese actors) have become more free, so we are more free, so we are more free, so It's painful for me. "

Another actor C, who also talked about the English talk show in Shanghai, also said that China's remarks review had a huge impact on his performance, "because my own jokes are talking about politics, and it is hundreds of times serious." He said that even in Shanghai, the English talk show with relatively loose scale and non -ticket sales, the subject matter is also limited. His joke basically "except for politics is sex", so he performed his hands and feet in China: "I may have to review a lot of content, but I have a lot of Punchline (key laughter) are political content. I Remove it all, and its funny level is about 60%. "

C revealed that he had put a discussion of political performance on the Internet. He wanted to "walk on the edge, and he should not step on that line." Threat; House's accident made him who was no longer performed in China, and began to re -examine his paragraphs. Some of them "won't talk about it anymore."

B, who also did an English talk show in Shanghai, I deeply felt that he was a foreign actor, and had more constraints on the stage. B recalled that he felt the first time that the Cultural Tourism Bureau began to suppress the talk show. It was after the 2020 China's well -known talk show actor Kamin was sentenced. At that time, even though B's paragraphs revolved around his love for China and did not criticize the Chinese government, it was still suspended by many clubs. On the stage, holding a microphone to speak to a group of Chinese people, they will feel that I want to preach the thinking of the anti -Chinese Communist Party. "

The timing was advanced to 2021 and 2022. The restrictions on foreign actors were loosened. B can gradually return to the large stage. Essence He said that because the talk show originated from the form of the West, it was not treated by the Chinese authorities, and no one knew when the industry would be completely banned. The endless and tightened censorship of China has also made him very worried about the situation of the same industry that is still performing in the local area: "If you are a comedian, stand on the stage and want to talk about a talk show, spend a happy time, but there is one The fool sent by the Communist Party of China is on the stage, waiting to pick you up at any time, pull you down, how uncomfortable the next few months will it be, and you will never know that the next game will be triggered. What will it be (subject matter). "

"Every talk show actor knows not to mention Tian'anmen, don't mention Taiwan, but the subject matter that cannot be said can't be finished. What else can you write? What else can you make? As a comedian? Your first priority should be considered "Will this subject be funny?" Instead of "Will this subject send me into jail or destroy my career?" B said that China lacks "freedom of speech". It is no longer news. Now even "expressing freedom" is lost, the development prospect of China's talk show has made him very pessimistic.

C, which is known for his political stalks, also said that the talk show can still be rising in China as a "offensive art". It is because Chinese audiences "have this demand". It is about to be suppressed and make him feel that "the only thing that restricts China is China himself." C said that there are many Chinese people and there are many art workers. There are so many creativity, but "now it is not just that the official wants to review you, you are afraid of being reported, so you have to review yourself, but you have to review each other, just like the Cultural Revolution." There is no room for creativity and talk show. A few days after the accident occurred, China also temporarily canceled the performance of overseas artists. In C's opinion, this matter is a vane of the "cultural and entertainment industry". I am afraid that in the future, it will also lead to a broad cicada effect in the Chinese art and cultural circle.

### What does the talk show "open your legs" look like?

Four interviewees with experience in both sides of the strait said that the differences between cross -strait talk circles can be attributed to two major points -economic scale and subject matter.

East District Germany and two other actors who have received commercial performances in China said that China's market throughput and capital scale are large enough to support the entire peripheral drama industry such as the entire talk show and even improvisation drama in the past few years. In the past 10 years, the talk show club of major cities in China has sprung up like a long -after growth. Even if a large number of creators have rushed and invested in the talk show actor, the needs of the entire industry are still far greater than the supply. , "One month can also receive more than a dozen business performances." For many actors who do not want to become superstars or rich people, they can have a professor of full -time health and relatively high sense of society. enough.

In contrast, Taiwan's talk show industry is still developing. Except for 1 or two popular star actors, few actors who can use this as full -time. In the society, if the actor shows the identity of "part -time talk show practitioners", he may be appreciated by "this person is cool" because of "a special interest", but if the actor resign and devote himself to investing, he devotes himself to investing. Talk show creation often receives the concerns of "Does your life continue?".

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T05-40-00Z/64873304_401.jpg)Cross -strait talk show development scale and cultural environment are different (data photo)

In terms of subject matter, except for cultural differences that make some laughter unable to share them on both sides of the strait, all interviewees have stated that a major difference between talking about talk shows in China and Taiwan is "consideration behind the selection of materials."

Dong District Germany said, "Taiwan is really super free, you love to talk about everything." There will not be a sensitive red line to consider, but this does not mean that he can talk about a talk show in Taiwan. He said that comedians still have some extent pursuit of "audience fate" and "audience recognition". Therefore, when choosing materials, he will avoid "epidemic prevention policies" and "celebrity suicide". Or when screening the performance clip of accessing the Internet, discard some controversial and explosive topics, and leave the laughing point at the scene.

East District said that Taiwanese actors have such considerations, and may be regarded as a self -examination, but "Taiwan's self -examination mechanism is not in what topic cannot be said, but what will be overly political and unacceptable to the audience." American society is now prevalent for "canceling culture" (netizens do not meet the political correctness of their recognition because the public figures do not meet the correct politics that they recognize, but the Internet exiles that they resist it in the community). Essence But he also added that the consequences of actors have no self -censorship in China, which is definitely more serious than in Taiwan.In addition, two actors who have performed the English talk show in Shanghai have stated that their self -examination motivation in Taiwan has nothing to do with the audience. The only consideration is that "Can this joke make the audience laugh?" Essence They told DW separately that they often composed of audiences in Taiwan to adjust their paragraphs in mobility -if they are mainly "foreign audiences who speak English", they will use "dirty", more challenging language language , Even incorporate some laughter that ridiculed Taiwan; if the table is mostly about Taiwan and Asia's faces, they tend to take the "family love" route, and they will also expect that "if the audience may be offended in Taiwan." Overall, when performing in Taiwan, they are more like their paragraphs entering the free market as a commodity. All of them are considered "market value" and "paragraph effects" without thinking about sensitive red line factors.

C told DW that "laugh" is an instinct that breaks through all norms and established values. The talk show borrows "constantly offense" and leads to "laugh" comedy. It is the difference between it and other arts and entertainment forms. Rock or Punkle, it is a very rebellious thing, you can't shape a rock music under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. "

### Ukrainian war: Vagna said Bachmut will transfer to the Russian army

Yofgen Pricig talked with Wagner soldiers in Bachmomt.

** The head of the Russian Wagner's mercenary organization announced that his troops have begun to withdraw troops from Bachmart, Ukrainian city. **

Yevgeny Prigozhin said it would transfer the city control to the Russian army before June 1, but Kiev said it still controlled part of the city.

He said his troops were ready to return if the Russian regular army could not control the situation.

The battle for this city is the longest and bloody duration in this war.

Wagner's mercenaries led Russia's battle. Porigon said this week that 20,000 Russian soldiers died in Bachomut.

"We will withdraw from Bachmut today," Pricig said in a video released by Telegram.

BBC F facts (BBC Verify) positioning the video is shot near a pharmacy in eastern Bachmut.

Porigen announced the occupation of the city on Saturday, and in the video he told his men to leave ammunition for the Russian army. He also said that some Wagner soldiers will stay to assist the Russian army.

"When the army is in trouble, they will stand up," he said, and then warned the two soldiers not to "bully the army."

Wagner's boss has repeatedly criticized them for high -level military officials in Russia. Last month, he even threatened that if he did not provide them with urgently needed ammunition, he would let the army withdraw from the city.

Despite Wagner's claiming to surrender Bachmut, Ukraine did not admit that the city had fallen.

Hanna Maliar, deputy minister of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, said on Thursday that the Ukrainian army still controlled some parts of the Litak district in the south of the city.

"The enemy replaced the Wagner forces in the suburbs with the regular army. Inside the town, Wagner's troops still existed," she wrote on Telegram.

Analysts said that Bachomite has no strategic value for Moscow, but occupying it will be a symbolic victory that Russia has achieved the longest duration in the Ukrainian war to date.

The Russian and Ukraine War: a counterattack that may change the war

For a few months, Wagner's mercenaries have been working hard in this city, and their ruthless and expensive tactics -sending people seems to gradually weaken Kiev's resistance.

In the Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Perigo has become an important figure, and he leads a private army composed of mercenaries.

He recruited thousands of criminals to join his organization from the prison, no matter how serious their crimes are, as long as they agree to fight for Wagna in Ukraine.

Porigen said this week that about half of the 20,000 Wagner soldiers who died in Bachurut were prisoners.

Earlier this month, the United States said that more than 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed in the battle of Bachurut, and another 80,000 were injured. BBC cannot independently verify these data.

Ukraine did not announce the number of casualties in Bachmart, but also suffered major losses.

The occupation of Bachmut will make Russia closer to its goal to control the entire Donetsk area. In September last year, four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine were annexed by Russia after the referendum. The Donedsk area was one of them. Russia generally condemned the referendum as a scam.

But last summer, when Russia claimed to have a Severodonetsk (also translated Seviel Diertsk) and Lysychansk fiercely, Ukraine quickly recovered the blockbusters elsewhere elsewhere elsewhere territory.

Before the invasion, about 70,000 people lived in Bachmut, but only a few thousand people stayed in this destroyed city. The city once known for its salt ore, gypsum ore and large wineries.

Russia's plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Beros was launched on Thursday (May 25). The United States condemned the deployment plan, but it showed no intention to change the US strategic nuclear weapons, and did not see any signs of Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons.

Reuters reports that President of Berlos said in Moscow that tactical nuclear weapons have been transferred in accordance with the order signed by Russian President Putin, but the Kremlin has not confirmed the matter.

Lukashenko, who is holding talks with other Soviet leaders in Moscow, told the media that "nuclear weapons have begun to move." When asked if these weapons were already in Beros, he said, "Maybe. After I understand, tell you."

This is the first time that the Cremlin has deployed such weapons abroad since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.

When Putin was interviewed by National Television on March 25, [announced that it will deploy tactical nuclear weapons in the White Rose nuclear](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230326-1376404)Essence He pointed out that the United States and allies are fighting a continuously expanding agent war with Russia.

When the Russian Defense Minister, Shi Yagu met with the Minister of Defense of Berosk, saying that the West was "doing its best to extend and upgrade the conflict in Ukraine in Ukraine." He said: " War. "

US State Department spokesman Miller said that Russia's deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in White is "the latest example of Ukraine has been fully invaded for more than a year and Russia has irresponsible behavior."

Miller reiterated the warning of Washington that the use of chemistry, biological or nuclear weapons in the conflict will lead to "serious consequences", but he has no specific explanation.

Description: Some Chinese men were killed by street lights in Taiwan. The case was judged by the Taiwan court for national compensation, causing controversy. The Taiwan Executive Yuan was ordered on Thursday that the letters of "the people of the mainland are also the people of the Republic of China" have been out of date and should be suspended from now.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Taiwan Executive Yuan announced on Thursday (May 25) that the relevant letter of the so -called "people of mainland China is also the people of the Republic of China" should be stopped from now on. This means that Taiwan officially identified that the people of the Chinese mainland do not have the nationality of the Republic of China, not a national, and therefore do not enjoy or bear the rights and obligations of the Republic of China.

According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, the Executive Yuan wrote that the "Regulations of the People's Relations of Taiwan and the Mainland" (referred to as the "Cross -Strait Regulations") only defined the people of Taiwan and the people of China, but some agencies have used it to have used it to have used it. The letter of interpretation allows "the people of the Chinese mainland to belong to the nationals (or people) of the Republic of China", or the rights and obligations of the people of the Chinese mainland are equivalent to the nationals of the Republic of China.

According to the Taiwan Executive Yuan, Taiwan has experienced democratic transformation and changes in the constitution, and the political situation and the development of cross -strait relations have changed. Whether the relevant interpretation letter makes it appropriate and it is necessary to review it. According to the definition of the Nationality Law, the people of the Chinese mainland do not have the nationality of the Republic of China, not the nationals of the Republic of China, and naturally do not enjoy or bear the rights and obligations of the Republic of China. No longer help.

### 1992 Consensus 30 years 30 Taiwanese watch "unified" like this

###

In 2018, a Chinese man named Qian Qian went to Taiwan to go around the island, and he was shown in Kaohsiung. Family members of the Taiwan Court offered a lawsuit in the sea, and the Taiwan court finally sentenced to victory over the lawsuit. The Kaohsiung Municipal Government needed to compensate NT $ 4.63 million.

The decision of the Taiwan court at that time quoted a letter of interpretation of the Taiwan Ministry of Legal Affairs in 1993. The content of the letter mentioned that "the people of mainland China are also the people of the Republic of China."

At that time, Ning Xin, a judge of the Kaohsiung Court of Taiwan, said in an interview with the Central News Agency that he asked the competent authority and the MAC who had asked the State Council before the verdict. The people of the region do not have clearly stipulated that "but based on human rights protection and humanitarian concepts, the State Compensation Law should be applied."

However, the Taiwan MAC subsequently stated that "there is a misunderstanding", emphasizing that "the people of the Chinese mainland are the nationals of the Republic of China", and accused those who have the nationals of the Republic of China according to the "Constitution of the Republic of China". 》 And other stipulates that the nationals of the Republic of China refer to the "household registered citizen or no household registration citizen in Taiwan where the Republic of China nationality lives in Taiwan."

The national compensation incident subsequently caused controversy in public opinion in Taiwan. Taiwan's "Free Times" reported that Song Chengen, deputy chief executive of the Taiwan Constitutional Foundation, said in February that the national compensation should be applied to the "home" to ensure that the human rights of foreigners should find another mechanism. Song Chengen questioned that the Taiwanese government promised "Taiwan, Taiwan, Taiwan", but the court's decision said that "Taiwan is also Chinese in Taiwan." He said, [if the CCP's criminals](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美众议院兵棋推演台海冲突-结论必须全面武装台湾/a-65398180): "How do we say to the international ... isn't AIA who comes to assist in the defense to interfere with the Chinese civil war?"

Song Chengen believes that the root cause of the controversy lies in the Constitution of the Republic of China. Some public opinion in Taiwan believes that the judgment is unconstitutional and should be amended to the law; but some people believe that there is no conclusion on the opposite opinion.

### Taiwan Executive Dean: Avoid international misunderstandings

Chen Jianren, the president of Taiwan, was asked when he attended the event on the 26th. He said that the Executive Yuan issued a new order because the interpretation of the relevant authorities in the past was "unsuccessful" and did not conform to the current laws. In addition to trouble, avoid misunderstandings between Chinese and international. " As for whether the Cross -Strait Regulations will be further amended? He said that the MAC will examine the relevant content before making a decision.

According to the Lianhe Daily, Zheng Yunpeng, the legislator of the Taiwan DPP, said that the case of Chinese money men's country compensation is indeed the liability of the Kaohsiung Municipal Government. The judge believes that the people of the People's Republic of China belong to the people of the Republic of China. He pointed out, "In the future, there are similar citations and judgments in the future, that is, the personal ideological issue of the judge, that is, the wrong judgment must be accepted by the Chinese people."

Before the deadline, Chinese officials did not respond publicly on the Taiwan Executive Yuan's order.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T07-17-34-08-00/00cli-rice-top-qjzc-master1050.jpg)As the earth warmed, rice was troublesome, and threatened the food and livelihood of billions of people. Sometimes there is not enough rainfall when the seedlings need water, and sometimes the rice is kept above the water, but there are too much rainfall. The seawater was infused, and the crops were damaged by salt. The temperature rose at night, resulting in the decline in yield.

These dangers forced the world to start a new way to find this key crop. Rice farmers are changing the time of farming time. The seedlings are looking for seeds that can endure high temperature or high -salt soil. The ancient varieties with strong tolerance are re -used.

There are many places in the world that are facing this situation in many places in the world. Farmers intentionally let the rice fields dry up, thereby reducing methane. This is a powerful greenhouse gas generated in rice fields.

The climate crisis has a large blow to small farmers in small blocks, and there are hundreds of millions of farmers such as Asia. "They can only adapt," Fan Xintao, who is responsible for water conservancy irrigation in the province of Vietnam, said, "Otherwise, it cannot survive." Vietnam is one of the largest rice production countries in the world.

In China, research has found that extreme rainfall has led to a decline in rice output in the past 20 years. Because India was worried that the food was not enough to feed their own people, it restricted rice exports. In Pakistan, the heat and floods caused crowds to apologize, and in California, long -term droughts led to many fields of farming.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T07-17-34-08-00/00cli-rice-transport-qjpg-master1050.jpg)This is a hard work for the small farmers of Vietnam.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T07-17-34-08-00/00cli-rice-drying-jghp-master1050.jpg)Zai Megong Delta dry crops.

The challenges now are very different from 50 years ago. At that time, the world needed to greatly increase rice output to respond to famine. High -yield hybrid rice and the use of chemical fertilizers play a role. In the Mekong River Delta, farmers began to turn to three cooked production a year, providing food for millions of people in their country and even abroad.

Today, the system of intensive farming itself has also caused new problems around the world. The exhaustion of the soil water storage layer has caused increased fertilizer, reducing the diversity of rice varieties, and smoke produced by straw to cause air pollution. In addition to these, there is also climate change: the laws of light and rainfall of rice are disrupted.

The most worrying may be that because many of the most poor people in the world eat rice every day, the increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may lead to the lack of nutritional nutrition.

Rice is also facing another climatic issue. About 8%of global methane emissions from human activities come from rice planting. Compared with 35%of coal, petroleum, and natural gas emissions, it is a big witch. But fossil fuels can be replaced with other energy sources. Rice is not so easy. It is a staple food for about 3 billion people around the world. It is Indian fragrant rice, Vietnam river powder, West Africa Garov rice, and Keriolsh brocade -it is the source of traditional and nutrition.

"We are at a completely different moment," said Lewis Czezca, a professor of environmental health science at the University of Columbia. "This is a question of producing more products with fewer resources. How do you do this in a sustainable way? How do you do this in the case of continuous changes in the climate?"

** A dangerous balance: rice or shrimp? **

In 1975, in the face of post -war famine, Vietnam decided to plant more rice.

It achieved amazing success and eventually became the third largest exporter of the world after India and Thailand. The green Mekong Delta has become the country's most precious rice production area.

However, at the same time, the Mekong River was reshaped by human hands.

The Mekong River originated in southeastern China, winding through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia, during which many dams were blocked. Today, when it reaches Vietnam, there is almost no fresh water that can be rushed off the seawater infiltrated into the inland. The rising sea level brings more seawater. The irrigation canal becomes salty. As the temperature rises, this problem will only become worse.

"We now admit that the rapid rise in seawater is normal," said Mr. Fan, director of irrigation. "We must be prepared to cope." He said that in the past, the seawater invaded about 30 kilometers inland in the past, and now we can reach 70 kilometers inland.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T07-17-34-08-00/00cli-rice-warehouse-kbjc-master1050.jpg)Vietnam's rice export helped to support the world.

Climate change also brings other risks. You can no longer expect the monsoon season to be as before, starting from May. Therefore, [Researchers discovered](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/19/3196)In the drought year, farmers are now sowing rice 10 to 30 days earlier than usual. In the coastal areas, many people rotate between planting rice and shrimp -shrimp like a little salt water.

But this requires controlling greed, Deng Qingsheng, a 60 -year -old Daozhuang Province, said. Shrimp brought high profits, but also brought high risk. Diseases are easy to attack. Land becomes barren. He saw that other farmers also encountered this situation.

Therefore, on his 28,000 square meters of land, when there was fresh water in the canal, Deng Qingsheng planted rice. When the seawater infiltrated, he raised shrimp. Rice can purify water quality. Shrimp can nourish the soil. "Unlike only shrimp to make money," he said. "But it is safer."

Researchers in [the recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34411-5)The conclusion is concluded that in other places, farmers will have to change the schedule of planting rice and other major grains. Scientists are already trying to help them.

Many are ancient varieties that rarely grow now. But they have the genetic superpowers that Dr. Lawrence, a botanical chemist of Arkansas University, is working hard, especially the genes that allow rice to survive in a hot night. The hot night is one of the most serious harm of climate change. So far, she has found two such genes. They can be used to cultivate new hybrid varieties.

"I am convinced," she said. "After decades, farmers will need very different types of seeds."

** Shaishui rice fields? **

Rice is located in the center of American history. It makes the states along the southern coast of the United States, all of which benefit from the labor of African slaves. They bring generations of rice planting knowledge.

Today, the main rice planting area of this country is distributed on the hard sticky land near the Mississippi River and one of its tributaries. It looks different from the Mekong Delta. The fields here are flat like pancakes. The work is done by the machine. The farm area is large, sometimes more than 80 million square meters.

They are facing the harm of climate change. It's hotter at night. The rainfall is unstable. Such a large amount of intensive rice planting brings a problem: groundwater is at a low level of danger.

Benjamin Lamak, a professor of engineering from the University of Fayeteville Arkans, entered this field. Lamucks suggested that farmers in Arkansas should not be drowned in the paddy fields as before, but let the rice fields dry, and then water it, so repeat. Oh, will they let him measure the methane in their field?

The second generation of rice farmers Mark Isabel signed up.

On the edge of Isabel's field, a tall white device was erected, and the egret might mistake it to think of his cousin. This device measures the gas generated by bacteria in the paddy field. "This is like a alcohol test for the land," Dr. Lamuck said.

His experiments have been carried out for more than seven years. The conclusion is that farmers can [reduce 60%or more by drowning fields without continuous flooding fields.(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b05535)Rice methane emissions.

Russia shows that if Russia's grain and fertilizer export problems cannot be improved, the export initiative of the Black Sea Grain will not be extended.

Reuters reported that after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it affected Ukraine to export food and agricultural products through the Black Sea Port. Under the mediation of the United Nations and Turkey, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement in July last year and agreed to restore the food exported by the Black Sea Port. The agreement was valid for three months. After [Two Agree to Extend the Agreement](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230314-1372557)Essence

Russia said on Thursday (May 25) that if it cannot meet the requirements of Russia's grain and fertilizer exports, the validity period of the Black Sea Grain Export Agreement will be as good as July 17th. Will be extended again.

Russia also made the same request and threatening to terminate the black sea grain export agreement in March.(https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230517-1395685)Essence

Since March, Russia seems to have two preferential considerations. One is to re -start the Russian ammonia to the Port Port of Black Seabenni, Ukraine to export to the global market.

On May 19, 2023, Beijing Swordsman Culture Performance Place.

** "The talk show is like a" hemp medicine ". It is something that cannot be replaced." Iris said. **

At the age of 30, she lives in Shanghai and is an interior designer. Like other 25 million residents living in this city, she also experienced the 65 -day new crown city in 2022.

Iris is lucky, and Iris is lucky and not hungry. In addition to studying recipes, the online talk show became one of her few windows that connect the outside world.

"I can feel that everyone wants to talk about my feelings during the period of the city. What a good material, but everyone knows, this cannot be said." Essence In the current political environment, the theme of Chinese talk shows has been reviewed by normalization.

"But as long as there is a trace of opportunity to express, they are still willing to say that this is the most moving." Although it is a bit like "dancing with shackles", IRIS is still trying to find the same frequency as themselves.

"Residents of Building 99, queuing upstairs as nucleic acids!" Every morning, Iris is awakened by the shout of the volunteer treble speaker. Then she played the athlete's entry -style song, and she knew that her "anesthetic" was over Essence

Time returns to the summer of 2019, Iris will watch offline performances of talk show when you are free. For the performance venue of 50 or 60 square meters, a microphone, a bouquet of light, and a few rows of hard back seats are crowded together. If you can't sit down, you can stand by the actor.

The talk show is considered a "offensive art." The "offense" here is not a traditional offense, but refers to the values of the audience during the output view of the actor, and the collision of different views triggers new thinking and perspective. In Iris's view, the talk show funny can only be regarded as "passing lines", let alone "exist for offending", and should obtain a short "exemption" on the stage.

If the actor does not succeed in "offense", she will subconsciously confirm her eyes with strangers next to the stranger, which means: "Well, you know, this stalk collapses."

Iris believes that this is the place where the talk show is attractive- "offense" a kind of tacit understanding and emotional resonance. However, the political and social sensitive issues involved in resonance are precisely the "red line" of Chinese society today.

On May 13th, House, the talk show of Xiaoguo Culture, participated in offline performances in Beijing.

After the performance, Weibo netizens "Manchester United Fan Tianmou, who do not want to disclose the name", stated that Li Haoshi mentioned in the paragraphs of Li Haoshi: I saw two wild dogs chasing pine squirrels on the mountain, reminding him of the eight words- " Excellent style, can win the battle. "

The netizen believes that this stalk "insults the children of the people."

"What's wrong with these eight characters?" Before the House incident, Iris never heard these eight words, but a Communist friend told her that this sentence "is a sensitive topic, so you shouldn't say."

The slogan of "excellent style and can win the battle" has always been used by the authorities to describe the Chinese army. Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in November 2013 that the full sentence is: "Building a people's army that listened to the party, can win the battle, and excellent style is the strong in the new situation in the new situation. Military goal. "

After the incident was fermented, some netizens showed the bridge section in the film "Shang Ganling" produced by China in 1956: the Chinese People's Volunteer Army caught pine squirrel in the tension atmosphere of gunfire. Impressing this is similar to the scene described in Li Haoshi Duanzi.

Li Haoshi himself quickly apologized on Weibo, saying that he had used a very inappropriate metaphor in the performance; his Shanghai Swordsman Culture Media Co., Ltd. also soon issued an apology statement and suspended all performance activities indefinitely. The Beijing Municipal Cultural Tourism Bureau announced on the 17th that it would impose administrative penalties for Xiaoguo culture, warning and confiscation of illegal income of more than 1.32 million yuan, and fined more than 13.35 million yuan. According to the company's behavior that violates Article 25 and 26 of the Regulations on the Management of Business Performance. "People's Daily" and Xinhua News Agency call it "serious insults."

"House just wanted to shake a cleverness to be funny. I didn't expect netizens to go online. If his entire paragraph spit for three hours of the People's Liberation Army, he was detained. But he seemed to just say that eight words, which was too worthless. "

Iris believes that if a talk show is said in China, it is necessary to swallow the helpless environment, because the environment will not change in the short term. If the actors in the mainland want to survive, there is no way to put the real view of the output first. "How to say" seems to be more important than "what to say", "the output view can not be so straightforward."

This type of talk show presented by Li Haoshi comes from the "Stand-UPCOMEDIAN" of the United States. In the United States, "Monoic Comedy" is usually a comedian with a microphone to perform a paragraph in the theater or Music Ministry; and the "Talk Show" (Talk Show "(Talk Show) is similar to the so -called" conversation show ". The host and the guests discussed around specific topics.

Many "talk shows" on the Chinese stage are strictly speaking in the strict sense of actual performance.

In 2010, when the American Asian talk show, Joewong, when he was invited to participate in the annual performance of the White House press conference, he "Tucao" was then the US Vice President Biden: "I have read your autobiography, and I have seen you today. It, I think autobiography is much better than me. "

On December 3, 2010, Joe Wong, a Chinese comedian, performed in an independent theater in the United States. At first, people did not understand his English, but he appeared on Davidletterman's program and achieved great success.

The talk show has never been a form of artistic expression. However, this "below" style seems a bit "unconvinced" in China's environment.

"Very sad, unexpected."

The 25 -year -old LAN D (pseudonym) is from Hubei. This year is the first time she went home three years after her epidemic. She started watching the talk show since 2018, and originally planned to go to Shanghai to watch the offline performance of Xiaoguo.

After graduating from undergraduate in 2019, she came to Ireland to study a graduate degree alone. This decision is not accidental.

"This is the closest time my review system from China." When LAND sophomore, she was responsible for organizing school speech contests. One of the topics was about child abuse in Beijing's red, yellow and blue kindergarten in 2017. Although only the last one, this is one of LAND's most socially valuable programs. After the performance, the secretary of the Youth League called her and said, "Haven't you tried the speech? How can you tell this?" Land asked: "Isn't the theme of this speech contest called‘ speak for the times ’?”

"Most people in China can be said to be imprisoned, or they are too lazy to think about which direction." This is the biggest feeling after LAN D returned to China.

"Everyone is talking about some painful topics. As long as it is related to the government and the party, it is not allowed to challenge, but it is not clear." Land believes that the talk show in China and the West, whether it is wonderful from the paragraph, In terms of degree and point of view, the level is much worse.

At that time, although the talk show in China has not yet said "industry". However, in the form of artistic expression, a series of programs have long been combined with social issues. In 1996, the "Tell the Tell It Like Itis" hosted by Cui Yongyuan, the host of Chinese host, was considered a talk show in the true sense of mainland China. The show will discuss and invite guests to interact with the audience on Chinese social issues. In 2009, "True Truth" was suspended, because the ratings were poor. But in "Douban" -n a Chinese social media platform, once known as "paradise for relatively free discussion", with a program score of 8.2 (full division of 10). People who are not able to say a few words of wind and cool words to the sleeping world. "

China's review system of remarks seems to have penetrated from the field of news reports to talk shows that integrate social hotspots into the paragraph. From "To the truth", to Zhou Libo's "One Weekly Libo Show", Venus's "Venus Show", "Tucao Conference" and "Talking Show Conference" of Swordsman Culture.

The limited theme of Chinese talk shows has stimulated the potential of the creators to dig more diversified content, and the "red line" is tentative in the gaps, and some golden sentences even become hot topics.

"Why does he look so ordinary, but he can be so confident?" The tentative tentative of the talk show actor Yang Yan's self -esteem of Chinese men has aroused fierce online debate, and the vocabulary "Puxin Man" derived from it Confidence) was pointed out by netizens to create "gender confrontation"; twins Yan Yiyue spit on the stage and pushed a blind date to marry marriage, pointing directly at social issues related to marriage and family: "There are always people around us who are particularly annoying. Marriage makes me feel that the marriage organization is particularly mysterious. As soon as I enter, I have to develop offline. "Pang Bo used the" vegetable blind box "mentioned in the paragraph, telling his life during the seal of Shanghai, implying During the isolation period, because you can't go out to buy materials, you can only eat the dishes sent by the community.

After each season's "Talk Show" played a thrilling political "wiping ball", the topics of social hotspots such as fertility, employment, gender equality, and women's rights in the game often rush to the Weibo hot search list.

### Fast -growing industry and reef practitioners

Before the House incident, the talk show was becoming a new way of entertainment loved by young people in China. According to the "2021 National Performance Market Report" released by the China Performance Industry Association, the business performance of the talk show market in 2021 reached 18,500, and the box office revenue was 391 million yuan, an increase of more than 50%over 2019. In 2022, the large and medium -sized talk show held in the professional theater increased slightly compared with the previous year.

After the "white paper protest" in 2022, Xiaoguo's talk show actor Meng Chuan wrote on Weibo on November 27, 2022: "I hope my weakness can become a hard bone like the south children." He mentioned The "Southern Biography" was regarded as Nanjing Media College, which was launched last year. After that, Meng Chuan's Weibo is in a state of "forbidden words". Another talk show actor pool publicly talked about China's epidemic prevention policy and review system in the North American tour in February this year. Soon his information was blocked by Chinese social media and the Internet.The eight words have triggered the "cold effect" of the entire industry. Chinese talk show practitioners have also opened "self -examination", and the cultural regulatory departments have canceled or extended the talk show performance plan. This shows that the movement of the Beijing authorities to rectify the cultural and entertainment market has become increasingly upgraded. BBC Chinese attempts to contact the 13 mainland talk show actors and agents in the two industries, but they all rejected the request for access.

Some people are even worried that this review of the talk show will allow China to return to the "era of not laughing."

Iris feels that China's censorship system will become more and more stringent, and there will be fewer and fewer things to say in the future. It is very important for Iris to hear the talk show that Chinese people talk about. "I want to listen to the Chinese people." She said, because the Western talk show actor, although there will be a paragraph involved in China, but not It will be so familiar with Chinese culture and will not resonate in depth.

"The talk show is my political snack, I can't quit." Lan D said, "China can say more, everything can be turned into paragraphs."

After the House incident, the talk show actor Carm posted on Weibo that "Welcome to House into the Group."

In 2020, Kamin, born in Karamay, Xinjiang, was arrested. On January 9, 2021, Kam was released.

This Weibo has reposted 10,000, but was quickly reviewed. Carm later responded to netizens on Weibo: "On a humorous power, a group of people laugh, a group of people must cry." Some netizens commented: "Everyone will laugh casually."

Perhaps in Kam's "group chat", the Chinese talk show actor put aside the correct yoke of politics, and found a correct "opening method" on the edge of the "offense".

"China's talk show has no future." Iris believes, "This is a red line of self -architecture, which makes us self -examination. This is very unfair and the most terrible place."

De Santis's election will challenge Trump.

** Governor of Florida Ron De Setis(Ron Desantis, Disante)It has been announced to compete for 2024 Republican President's nomination. **

He accepted a live visit to Twitter Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on May 24, but the activity of Twitter Spaces had a technical failure and delayed 20 minutes before it started.

He promoted his conservative positions, anti -blocking urban measures and educational reforms during the epidemic situation.

"I am running for the president of the United States to lead our great American rolls."

###

 Earlier, former President Trump has announced the nomination of the Republican President's next president, and De Santis is regarded as the main opponent of Trump.

De Santis is relatively relative in American politics. He was first elected as a member of the parliament in 2012. Six years later, in 2018, he was elected Governor of Florida after the running senator failed.

He supervised the highly noticed law, making it easier to have guns, restricting schools' sexual education and gender identification education, and reducing the chance of abortion.

He claims that this "Florida blueprint" can be used as a guide for federal policy and enables the United States to develop in a more conservative direction.

He is one of the competitors to overthrow Trump, but Trump is currently leading the party with more than 30 percentage in the national polls.

[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65720053/P0FQ96bb/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65720053/p0fq96bb/zh-hans)![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-05-26T08-49-46.000Z/p0fq96j6.jpg)** Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials ** video plus injection text,

The BBC compiled the five things about De Santis and helped the audience to understand his political attitude.

At the official start of Twitter live broadcast on May 24, hundreds of thousands of Twitter users had left the platform.

Since Musk took charge of Twitter last October, he has fired thousands of employees, including engineers responsible for website operation and technical failure treatment.

After a technical error occurred, Desantis's team quickly carried out public relations decoration. They wrote on Twitter that the live broadcast made people "excited to the Internet" and issued a link to a campaign website.

His press secretary Bryan Griffin said that the online event raised $ 1 million (£ 808,000) within an hour.

According to statistics from Reuters, Twitter live broadcast has attracted more than 600,000 listeners, but at the end of the event, the number of people was only less than 300,000. In contrast, British Broadcasting Corporation(BBC)Last month interviewed Musk, attracting more than 3 million listeners in Twitter space.

### Conservative position

After the live broadcast, De Santis turned the topic to his conservative position and touted his handling of the Florida epidemic crisis -at the time his anti -city approach was praised by many Republicans.

He defended his reform of the education system in Florida, saying that his state "chose the facts rather than fear, education rather than instilling, laws and order rather than riots and chaos."

Subsequently, De Santis talked about a more specific commitment in an interview with FoxNews, including the first day of the White House announced that the southern border of the United States entered an emergency, and promised to fired the Federal Investigation Bureau director of Trump CHRISTOPHERWRAY and the "anti -US energy policy" of President Biden.

Earlier on May 24th, De Santis confirmed that he sought the Republican presidential nomination that he released a stylized announcement film after registering by the Federal Election Commission.

"Our border is a disaster, crimes invade our city ... and the president is in trouble," he said in the film. "But recession is a choice, success can be achieved, freedom is worthy of fighting."

Trump and his campaign team issued a large number of emails and posts on Truth Social, the former president's social platform, and expressed welcome to Texetis to join the 2024 election.

In the live broadcast, De Santis told Musk that he would study the US Constitution and "see what button I can press" to call the administrative power shortly after. Trump immediately posted a post on De Santis: "My red button is more Big, better, stronger, and normal operation (truth!), You are not!(According to the conversation with Kim Jong -un in my North Korea, he will soon become my friend!) ""

The latest survey of Morning Consult (Morning Consult) shows that before De Santis announced his election, he lags 38 percentage points behind Trump and ranked second in the Republican Party.

In the long -term primaries starting early next year, Republican voters will decide which candidate will face the Democratic President Biden who seek re -election in the November 2024 election.

### Campaign funds

The Florida Parliament recently passed a bill that allows the governor to be able to run for presidents not to be resigned.

He will also have a generous campaign. As of the end of last month, he had 88 million US dollars (£ 71 million) in Florida's re -election in Florida, which could be used for the presidential campaign fund.

According to reports, he has about $ 30 million by an independent committee control, and his allies can be used to support him for campaign.

In contrast, Trump said that in the first three months of 2023, the total fund raising was US $ 18.8 million.

De Santis is expected to use Generapeck as a campaign manager. Peck is the highest political adviser of Desandis. In 2022, he led the governor to run for the daily operation of re -election, which helped him achieve nearly 20 percentage points.

According to the Associated Press and the New York Times, De Santis has recruited at at least 18 states.

Description: China is the country in the world's most death penalty. Although Taiwan promises to "gradually abolish", experts believe that the Taiwan government has not promoted substantial progress.

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Asian Ritual Death Strategy Symposium" appeared in Taiwan on Friday (May 26). This two -day meeting was sponsored by the French "Cooperative Anti -Death State Organization" (ECPM).

ECPM CEO Raphaël Chenuil-Hazan told DW that Taiwan has freedom of speech and the spirit of the rule of law. Moreover Use the death penalty, but go to the direction of good use of abolition, showing that you are not like the Chinese government, unlike Xi Jinping, but more tendency to democracy. "

He also said, "If Taiwan maintains the death penalty, who knows what will happen in the future and who knows if there is a government or dictator in the future? You should abolish the death penalty so that it will not be too late. "

Lin Xinyi, CEO of the Taiwan Waste Alliance, also said that in the face of intimidation of the Chinese totalitarian government, "Taiwanese are not afraid" and still adhere to democracy, freedom and human rights value. This is also different from the two sides of the strait.

ECPM held a three -year conference in Berlin, Germany last year. This year, it was decided to abolish Taiwan's death penalty to promote the league and Asian anti -death network (ADPAN) and other organizations to jointly hold regional meetings in Taipei. Lin Xinyi told DW that this was because Taiwan's human rights performance was seen by the outside world, and many people had a good opinion of Taiwan.

In the global death penalty report in the 2022 of the International Terminal, China described China as "the number one puppet hand in the world." [According to the statistics of the organization, 20 countries in the world have been executed last year](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球死刑数量创五年新高在中国仍是国家机密/a-65638885)Including China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries; although the Chinese government has not disclosed the number of executives, it is generally believed that at least a thousand people are believed.

In a speech at the seminar, Chennhazan pointed out that although China has been sentenced for thousands of years, the death penalty is by no means a "tradition" in China, and there have been a stage of abolishing the death penalty in history. However, under the administration of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong used the death penalty to consolidate political power and target people of objections; during the Xi Jinping period, the death penalty debate became "one of the most important ideological taboos in China", which was considered "preaching Western thought".

In contrast, Taiwan's death penalty environment is relatively mature. The last death penalty in Taiwan was in 2020, and there are currently 38 death prisoners. Although Wang Rongzhang, deputy chairman of the Taiwan National Human Rights Committee, said on the 26th that before the law was abolished, the "strongly required government to suspend the execution of the death penalty", [in Taiwan as long as there are major criminal cases, the people will have a strong death penalty. Sound](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣卡關逐步廢死-專家死刑淪政客廉價操作/a-64859404)Essence

Guillermo Martinez, deputy director of the European Economic and Trade Office, and Jean-François Casonnave, director of the French Association in Taiwan, also attended the abolition strategy seminar on the 26th. The European Union and France support Taiwan to gradually move forward. Gongsun Meng bluntly stated that from his observation in the past four years, Taiwan's abolition has not made great progress, and what Taiwan most needs is more public discussions on the death penalty.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T09-43-00Z/65741480_401.jpg)The Asia's Research Seminar of the Disposal Penalty Strategy was held on the 26th in Taipei City. The opening ceremony invited Taiwan's injustice Su Jianhe (the first right of the back row).

###

At this stage, many Taiwanese are opposed to abolition, and the Taiwanese government often [explaining why it cannot be abolished immediately on the grounds of "public opinion"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界反死刑日民意是维持死刑的藉口/a-45807287)Essence The death penalty has also become a tool for some politicians to incite voters. In response, ECPM's Chekhazan responded that political leaders should respond to the actual situation, instead of using the death penalty to achieve political purposes. He said that there are many arguments that can support abolition, but the only arguments behind the death sentence are "revenge." He believes that after all, the death penalty cannot bring real healing for the victim's family members, nor can it be observed.

As the presidential election in Taiwan was approaching in 2024, some of them intended to run for the presidential claim that if they were elected, they would "shoot all the death penalty"; even some groups proposed a referendum that claimed that the death penalty should be performed within 6 months after the verdict.

"To be honest, human rights are not the value that everyone complies. Many human rights issues are actually the value that everyone opposes and hates." Lin Xinyi told DW that Taiwanese society should discuss "whether human rights can referery" and clearly think about what it looks like The topic can be referendum, otherwise, once a precedent is issued, "it has a great impact on the democracy and human rights in Taiwan."

Lin Xinyi described the proposal of abolition to say that it can be said to be "the most stressful and the most brave group of people." Sarakowal, a member of the Asia -Pacific anti -death network, also mentioned that the harassment and persecution encountered by Asian human rights workers are becoming more and more serious and cannot be ignored.

Lin Xinyi quoted [Lieutenant of the Taichung MRT accident, the deceased human rights initiator Lin Shuya](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不只行人地獄台灣捷運重大死傷案惹議/a-65585044)The words: "We feel that the only thing that can jump out of political awareness is to adhere to the concept of human rights and obtain the understanding of all the questioners as much as possible." She emphasized that she will not give up the opportunity to dialogue. There is no death penalty.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T09-43-00Z/65741425_401.jpg)Lin Xinyi, CEO of the Taiwan Waste Alliance, said in a speech that the proposal of the abolition of death can be said to be "the most stressful and brave group of people."

### The possibility of injustice

The opening ceremony also invited Su Jianhe, who was rehabilitated in Taiwan's death penalty case, to share his story to the abolition of the proposal and human rights groups from 14 countries.

"I was detained for 11 and a half years, and then wearing 2 kg of feet 镣 11 and a half years ... It was also suffering from being tortured, but there was no way to receive treatment. Not to mention when I was determined by the death sentence, it brought it with it, it brought it with The pressure comes is very cruel and inhumane. However, these things are caused by ... my case is caused by misjudgment. "The existence of the injustice shows that the judicial may be wrong, which is one of the basic claims of Taiwan's abolition of the proposal. But in addition, can Taiwan be a model of democratic democracy in Asia, can it be more positive on human rights issues and show democratic value?

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T10-34-00Z/49332287_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65742553/49332287)(Voice of Germany) "World News" recently reported that China has been working hard to recruit retired Federal Defense Forces officers and soldiers and former German intelligence personnel. Among them, NATO retired pilots are the key targets of China recruited. Last year, there were media reports that China had recruited the British Air Force's active and retired pilots to let them teach the Chinese Air Force pilots about the knowledge of Western fighters and the "weakness" of Western military aircraft. The British Department of Defense said that about 30 former British pilots had provided relevant services to China.

Not long ago, the German Federal House Management Committee held a meeting to require strict legislation to regulate the private economy field after retiring the retirement of civil servants in sensitive areas. The German Ministry of Defense told the World News that the relevant parties are currently discussing whether it is necessary to correctly amend the current regulations. According to the current "Military Law" in Germany, the Air Force pilots from the safe and sensitive field are required to declare if they engage in new jobs within five years after retirement. There is no need to declare after the retirement period expires.

### Federal Constitution Defense: Keeping in China to be vigilant

The Federal Constitution Defense also warned Chinese overseas recruitment operations. At a seminar last week, Thomashaldenwang, director of the Constitutional Security Bureau, said that the activities of Chinese intelligence agencies have become extremely frequent recently, and activities with the purpose of obtaining "professional knowledge" are particularly prominent. "In order to achieve the goal of occupying the world's hegemon in the political, economic, military and academic fields, Beijing has invested a lot of manpower and financial resources for its spy activity."

Haldewang said that in addition to cyber attacks, the Constitutional Defense Administration also found that China "has strengthened spy activities against all fields of German politics." He said that Russia is also working hard to impact German society, but Beijing's behavior is also acting, but Beijing's behavior But "more hidden and long -term strategic goals."

In the previously exposed British pilot providing training in China, a flight school in South Africa attracted widespread attention: [Test Flying Academyof Southafrica, which was founded in 2003, mainly served Chinese customers.

The former pilot who had played for about 20 years in the German Air Force wrote in a professional journal that he started teaching theory and practical courses to helicopter students from China in South Africa in 2003.

Description: The over -construction of many years has led to the excessive demand of the Nanchang property market, and the vacancy rate is the highest among 28 large and medium cities in China. Although the Chinese authorities have launched incentives to stimulate the property market, the recovery of the real estate market is not balanced.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T10-47-10-08-00/00china-nanchang-01-jzcf-master1050.jpg)**** The prosperity of China's real estate industry has transformed the eastern city of Nanchang from a rough manufacturing center to a modern city. The rows of high -rise buildings on both sides of the Ganjiang River are the testimony of this change.

Today, those skyscrapers have proven a very different situation: the Chinese real estate market is in crisis after years of excessive construction.

In the past 20 years, with the prosperity of the Chinese economy, in order to meet the growing demand for residential and workplace, Nanchang, the Jiangxi Provincial Congress, has built large -scale apartment groups and bright office buildings. In order to achieve economic growth at any cost, Nanchang is reflected in the slogan of his pursuit of urban expansion: "Eastward, Nanyou, Xituo, Bei Rong, ZTE".

However, the continuous downturn in China's real estate market has exposed the problems of cities such as Nanchang. The continuous construction of these places over the years has led to the problem of excessive supply. There are measurement standards, Nanchang [20%of housing uninhabited](https://finance.sina.com.cn/china/2022-08-10/doc-imizirav7483050.shtml)The vacancy rate is the highest among 28 large and medium cities in China.

It can be seen from the situation in Nanchang that policy makers face huge challenges when trying to revitalize the Chinese economy. When the economy had previously appeared, the Chinese government started the economy by investing in real estate and infrastructure construction. But this time the downturn does not have a simple solution. Real estate developers are already debt, and cities across the country are vacant housing everywhere, and the local government's finance has been hollowed out by nucleic acid testing costs in recent years.

In Nanchang, many of the latest apartments are still vacant because developers have no money, and the selling apartments cannot be completed. Some homeowners [Pay mortgage for apartments that have not been delivered](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230130/china-unfinished-apartments/)This method of expressing different opinions has appeared nationwide, which makes the CCP feel nervous.

The central and local governments have launched incentive measures to attract buyers from last year, including requiring banks to relax loan review and cancel the restrictions on the cooling real estate market before the epidemic.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T10-47-10-08-00/00china-nanchang-02-jzcf-master1050.jpg)There are measurement standards, 20%of Nanchang's housing vacancy. Qilai shen for the new york times

In the first four months of this year, the prices of new houses in 70 largest cities in China have risen, which has reversed the strictest period of the new crown prevention and control measures for a year of decline. But the rebound just appeared to lose motivation. The increase in house prices in April this year has slowed down.

And the recovery of the real estate market is not balanced. House prices in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have risen. The recovery of the real estate market is more milder in second -tier cities such as Nanchang, and there is almost no appearance in smaller cities.

Yes [Thesis](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/09/29/A-Tale-of-Tier-3-Cities-524064)It is showed that the problem of the Chinese real estate market is more obvious outside of large cities, because excessive construction is more common in small and medium -sized cities. The author of this paper is Kennis Rogif, a professor of economics at Harvard University, and Yang Yuanchen, an economist at the International Monetary Fund.

Rogif said that China's real estate prosperity is based on "forever and rapid growth", but the economic growth rate of many small and medium -sized cities has not kept pace with housing construction.

"For decades, China has been building real estate and supporting infrastructure quickly," he said. "In the end, there will be a decrease in income."

China's real estate prosperity began in large cities in the late 1990s, and later expanded to small and medium -sized cities such as Nanchang in the first decade of this century. China built about 2 million apartments in 2000. By the mid -2010s, there were more than 7 million apartments built every year in China. Real estate quickly became the pillar of China's economic growth, accounting for about 25%of all economic activities.

The real estate industry has created employment opportunities and supports local finance (most of the local finance comes from the right to use the land required for the land required by the new building), and provides a few reliable investment options for ordinary people who want to accumulate wealth. As the economy relying on real estate increasingly relying on real estate, Xi Jinping, the supreme leader of China, began to severely crack down on debt developers. He announced that "the house is used for living, not for speculation."

In cities like Nanchang, the new housing area exceeds the demand that can be maintained by population growth alone. During the ten years of 2021, Nanchang's housing construction area has doubled, while the population has only increased by 25%.

Converse, a agent who was engaged in existing housing transactions in Nanchang, said that the real estate he traded was located in the suburbs of the city, and house prices there have been steadily declined, and it has fallen by 25%since 2019.

He expects house prices will decline further because too many people are trying to sell houses. Some people want to buy updated apartments to improve existing housing, and some people want to sell apartments for investment before the government levy real estate tax. Mr. Kuang said that about 80%of his customers refused to reduce prices, hoping that the market would rebound.

"Now because the real market is not like before," he said.

According to a report released by the Shell Research Institute in August last year, the average vacancy rate of 28 large and medium -sized cities in China was 12%, and the vacancy rate of 20%in Nanchang was higher than the average level. The high and altitude rates across the country have attracted a lot of attention because they have confirmed that China's real estate crisis is more common than the government revealed.

After the report was published, the Shell Research Institute has removed it from the Internet, saying that "the research samples and programs are not standardized", and the data "cannot fully reflect the real situation."

Traditionally, Nanchang's economy depends on the manufacturing and construction industry. Nanchang tried to introduce higher salary digital economy and technology industries, but was not very successful.

The city is famous for its "Nanchang Uprising". In the past century, the Communist Party of China launched an armed rebellion here and defeated the Kuomintang army for the first time. But as the choice of office location, many cities around Nanchang are more attractive.

The native Sindrila Fang (Yin), who was born in Nanchang, is 28 years old. When she was a child, most apartments were low -rise buildings without elevators, and there was no such planned residential area. She said that the place where she stayed as a child had become a large 30 -story apartment building.

After finishing college in Beijing, Ms. Fang returned to Nanchang in 2019. She hopes to find a job and may buy a house that can affordable. But one month after returning to Nanchang, she moved to Shanghai because the only job that could be found in Nanchang was marketing, and she was only one -third of her salary when she was in Beijing.

"The employment environment in Nanchang has not been very good," Ms. Fang said.

For other foreigners who moved to Nanchang, what attracted them was the reasonable house prices and good public schools, but they encountered problems that developers could not hand over their houses.

Andy Cao (Yin) lived and worked in Shanghai. Shortly after her daughter was born in 2019, she bought a unprecedented apartment in Nanchang, who was closer to her rural hometown. She intends to move in after the developer originally scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2021.

However, developers have encountered financial problems, and the apartment building has been suspended in July 2021. After continuing to pay a year's mortgage, Ms. Cao and other homeowners began to resist the repayment in July last year.

Ms. Cao said that the salesperson had told her that the apartment she bought was located in a district with good conditions in Nanchang, where there were good schools, but in fact, the apartment's community was a relatively backward area as planned as planned.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T10-47-10-08-00/00china-nanchang-05-jzcf-master1050.jpg)In cities like Nanchang, the new housing area exceeds the needs that can only be maintained by population growth. Qilai shen for the new york times

"But it is very good to promise you verbally, and everyone is deceived," she said. "Otherwise, how can you buy so many people in the suburbs."

She said that because the apartment was not yet completed, she would continue to resist housing repayment. She said that the police had found her parents and asked them to call Ms. Cao not to stand publicly. The bank is now suing some neighbors who resist the repayment with her.

"It is simply," Ms. Cao said. "I didn't expect that this would happen to the people like us."

Zou Shengji, a real estate agent in Nanchang, said that the negative news about the unfinished apartments made many people who want to buy a house to "be afraid and worry."

The Labor Day holiday in early May of each year was a busy time for house sales. Mr. Zou said that his sales team only sold less than 20 apartments during that period. The apartments they sold in the same period two years ago were three times that of this.

Many said that the potential customers who want to see the house have applauded, he said. Customers are unwilling to buy a house because they feel that the real estate market is too risky at this moment.

"There are more people who wait and see now," said Mr. Zou. "In the future, the house may really be difficult to sell."

He specifically mentioned the case of Li Zhiying, the founder of One Media Li Zhiying who was sued by the Hong Kong government to violate the Hong Kong National Security Law and accused Hong Kong's administrative administration.

"Apple Daily" was founded by the wealthy businessman Li Zhiying in 1995. Li Zhiying, who smuggled from Guangdong to Hong Kong when he was a teenager, publicly supported the 89 Democratic Games and was therefore officially sanctioned by the mainland. After he founded One Media Co., Ltd. in 1990, he published newspapers such as "One Weekly" and other newspapers and magazines, and then expanded to TV, the Internet and other media, and founded Taiwan's "Apple Daily" in 2003.

"Top Ten Outstanding Youths in Ningxia" and other titles. During the investigation stage of the case, the public security organs had publicly solicited the "illegal criminal clues" four times, and the suspect was arrested for nearly three years before the trial was opened. During the period, the families of the three suspects were arrested for shouting injustice. A senior legal person said the case was a typical guilt and found evidence. There are also relevant persons reports that during the process of handling cases, the cases of cases have relatives, illegal evidence collection, and illegal restrictions on lawyers meeting with the parties.

According to reports from the Information Center of the Rights Protection Network, Liu Weiguo, a rights protection lawyer, posted a video on the 24th that a series of major cases of major cases have appeared in the trial process. The trial procedure is finished. This means that the "Criminal Procedure Law" and the provisions of the rights of defendants and defender's rights in the judicial interpretation are invalid in court.

Lawyer Liu Weiguo also said that the judge of the Ningxia Wuzhong Intermediate Court tried Ding Xuefu's case to adopt this "strong push -type" trial method. The judge ignored the jurisdiction objection and avoidance of the jurisdiction proposed by the lawyer. Wang Jing, the chief of the trial, interrupted the defendant, and he was high, and repeatedly reprimanded the defendant Ding Xuefu: "Clarify your identity!Pay attention to your identity!" "What are you doing, you are here to accept the trial!" It was once in chaos.

It is reported that a man in mainland China was unfortunately killed in Taiwan five years ago. The Kaohsiung Court quoted the above provisions to make compensation rulings, and the latest statement of the Taiwan Executive Yuan caused heated public opinion.

The man named Qian Qian rode a bicycle around the island in Taiwan in August 2018. He was killed by electric shock through the light leakage of the street light through the Kaohsiung Road District. According to reports, in the first instance of Kaohsiung City, the Dead was the people of the mainland and did not apply to Taiwan's "National Compensation Law". However, the Kaohsiung District Court determined that the Kaohsiung City Conservation Work Office had liability for negligence. At the same time, "the people of mainland China are also the people of the Republic of China." The second trial of the case also maintained the first trial.

Recently, the DPP legislator Zheng Yunpeng pointed out in the Legislative Yuan that he did not oppose compensation on the grounds of human rights, but the reason for the judgment was based on the letters of the Ministry of Justice 30 years ago. This is obviously not in line with the current laws and national emotions and requires legal affairs to require legal affairs The interpretation of the letter was abolished.

Chen Mingtang, the second director of the Legal Affairs Department, said: "Later, the" Nationality Law "was amended for the definition of the people of the Republic of China, so it was about 90 years of the Republic of China.(year 2010)After that, the letters are not directly applicable. "

The DPP legislator Zheng Yunpeng: "Some courts were deliberately transferred to the central kitchen of cognitive operations. Compensation is to compensate, regardless of him, he is a native of China, Hong Kong and Macao. "

** The Taiwan Political Court ordered the people of the Chinese mainland to be non -national.

After Zheng Yunpeng's inquiry, he received Taiwan's Executive Yuan in Taiwan on the 25th. Do not enjoy or bear the rights and obligations of the Republic of China, and those who have the old letters to be confused should stop applying or not for use from now.

"In the future, the judge has similar references and judgments to the personal ideological issue of the judge, which is the wrong judgment. It is necessary to accept the criticism of the Chinese people. The next thing is the judicial court, and he has to explain the education and training uniform." Zheng Yunpeng proposed on Facebook. His view.

Lawyer Huang Diying has published related articles on this judgment many times. When he was interviewed by this station, he said that the judge interpreted itself and then introduced the administrative letter by himself. The judge knew that he was the national of the People's Republic of China, but he "interpreted the people of the People's Republic of China as the nationals of the Republic of China."

"Such a judgment is ridiculous, and the gap between the social gap and the normal judgment with the international judgment is very impressive." Huang Diying further pointed out that "the court's judgment was originally restrained by administrative letters. ","

** Qu Zhaoxiang: The judgment affects whether there is any existence of the Republic of China **

Professor Qu Zhaoxiang, a Professor of Rongguang from Taiwan Normal University, told this station that the key to the case lies in the inconsistency of the court and the administrative department, but the insights of the administrative department are not the last opinion or the most authoritative opinion. In the end To the Supreme Court: "I estimate that this case will be determined to enter the judge meeting of the judicial court."

He explained that although Taiwan ’s president Tsai Ing -wen stated that“ cross -strait does not belong to each other ”, it did not clearly define it as an administrative or legal sovereignty, so there is still a vague space. If the judge's meeting explained the case, there was no way to avoid it.

"This is equivalent to Pandora's box, and someone opened it. The monster had already ran out." Qu Zhaoxiang believes that this judgment has a profound impact and will affect whether the Republic of China of China is still there. If the judge's explanation is still the same as the administrative organs, "this is equivalent to legal Taiwan independence."

** Judge "No. 328 Explanation" Territory is a major political issue and cannot be explained by the judicial constitutional interpretation authority **

Huang Diying pointed out that the "explanation of No. 328" of the big judge has explained that territory is a political issue, not the judicial institute that can explain: "Therefore, the judges of the local courtyard actually overlook the judges and turn all the people of the People's Republic of China into our nationals."

According to the "interpretation of No. 328", Article 4 of the Constitution does not adopt a list of "territory of the Republic of China". Reasons in history. The definition of its inherent territory as a major political issue should not be explained by the constitutional interpretation authority of exercising judicial power.Reporter: Huang Chunmei Editor: Xu Shuting, He Ping.com Edited: Hong Wei

According to reports, the Yawan high -speed rail connects the Indonesian capital of Jakarta to the tourist destination Bandung, with a total length of 142.3 kilometers. The maximum operating speed of the train will reach 350 kilometers per hour. It is the first time that China ’s high -speed rail has exported technology and standards overseas. In the future, Jaca's travel time will be shortened from more than 3 hours to 40 minutes.

According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, China has obtained the bidding of the project in 2015. China Railway and other state -owned enterprises and Indonesian state -owned enterprises are formulated by Indonesian Chinese high -speed rail companies with 40 % of Chinese capital. The project is expected to be completed in 2019, but engineering delays due to land acquisition and new crown epidemic.

Pengbai News reported that the Yawan High -speed Railway started on June 9, 2018 and was promoted by the heads of China and Indonesia. The project is of great significance to promote the high -quality development of the "Belt and Road" and the implementation of the "Global Marine fulcrum" strategy of Indonesia.

However, Shi Jianyu, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, accepted an interview with Liberty Asian Radio: "After all, it overdraws a billion US dollars, how to deal with it? Will China be willing to bear all? Loans from China Development Bank, and we must also pay for it to pay back. "

Shi Jianyu said that how high security is still a question mark. The Yawan Railway is symbolic in the "Belt and Road" maritime Silk Road blueprint in China, and Wanlong was also the place where Zhou Enlai attended the meeting.

Shi Jianyu: "Indonesia's anti -China sounds in the past, will this railway change to Indonesia's stereotypes of China's original? Lost, including the risk of overdraft and whether the initial operation stage is profitable, maybe all China must swallow. "

Chen Bingzheng, an associate professor of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Political University of Taiwan, accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty: "There were many controversy in this case, and the project was a bit delayed. Of course, Indonesia hopes to operate smoothly. Go to other Chinese high -speed rail output plans. "

Chen Bingyu mentioned: "Some criticisms feel that this is the victory of Chinese competition. Many people will regard it as a victory of geopolitical competition, but from the perspective of Indonesia, Indonesia may not think this is an indicator of geopolitical competition. Indonesia's demand To build a high -speed rail, there is no way to build it yourself, you must ask foreign countries to help build. "

Chen Bingzheng said that in recent years, China's high -speed rail has made great progress in China. The outside world has been watching how the Yawan high -speed rail construction is. If China ’s export of high -speed rail is successful, other countries will be more confident in China's high -speed rail technology.

Chen Bingzheng also said that for many countries, it is not good to use land politics to restrain the policy choice. If geopolitics can only do business with a certain country, unless you are willing to pay such money for geopolitics, Many countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, are unwilling to do so. Do these countries mainly consider whether there is a way to complete this project and how much money it costs, not that the country is good or bad in China.

Shi Jianyu mentioned that Japan was very interested in the Yawan Railway. In the end, he was disappointed without bidding. China was able to grab this project with its own affordable risks.

Shi Jianyu said: "After ten years of policy operations in the Belt and Road, China's economy is not as good as before. Is China willing to subsidize these projects from foreign blood transfusion? From this perspective, China must lose. Do not return, it is a very actual economic loss for China, but China has increased some influence. "Shi Jianyu said that if China has obtained all projects, the risk of burden is great, and the influence will increase. If China does not participate in construction, the Yawan high -speed rail will not be considered so successful.

** "Ping An Beijing" "Sending" is speechless "to beware of information. Netizens questioning the attitude of public security against fraud group **

The keywords of the "Gun Decision", on the official Weibo of Beijing Public Security "Ping An Beijing" to release the same reminder, once again aroused heated discussion among netizens, because the post was added with the description of "really speechless!" The keywords of speechless death have become hot search on Weibo. Netizens ridiculed the attitude of the public security organs and made people feel speechless, saying that even public security was speechless. How can ordinary people cope with the information of fraud. Some netizens questioned why the public security department only issued a reminder and did not enforce the law.

** Comment: The Public Prosecution Law only attaches importance to suppressing citizens' free "speechless".

Zhang Jianping, a commentator from Yixing in Jiangsu, believes that the public security organs expressed "speechlessness" and caused a warm response to netizens.

Zhang Jianping: "For example, Li Wenzu lived in the family of Yejing Ring. The public security was named in the name of reporting and harassing it in the middle of the night. As long as you take out the power of 10 points for the speech review to be targeting fraud, it is easy to curb. Therefore, the public security uses the "speechless" sentence so that the people do not buy it. This is also the root cause of the public security without credibility. "

** The victim of the online fraud personal experience experience the law enforcement tendency of public prosecution law to be interested in harming the interests of national interest **

Fang Yuan, a current affairs commentator, was also a victim of online fraud, and his friends he knew had been deceived, but he said that he was treated coldly when he reported to the public security.

Fang Yuan: "I was on Taobao, and fake customer service had scammed us. At that time, I lost more than 6,000 yuan and was scammed. I went to the public security report. The investment of some false projects was deceived to report the case, and they (public security) also shirked and did not give the case. It seemed that there was no interest. But the corresponding was several times we wrote some articles on the Internet, but they actively asked us to talk. These cases can be seen that there is a clear tendency in law enforcement, and things that are harmed by the people are basically not interested. "

Fang Yuan said that the public prosecution law department needs to remind the public not to believe in such ridiculous fraud messages, reflecting the Chinese people's fear of offending the public prosecution law department, no more ridiculous and unbelievable requirements, and obedience.

Fang Yuan: "The public power of the prosecution law is too strong, and the deterrent of the people of the civilians is enough to fear. Once people look at the news in this area, they will immediately look white, and even say that they are trembling. They are more willing to believe in these. Things are true, because in reality, if you do not cooperate with public power to enforce the law, you do not obey, then your consequences are imaginative, so this kind of fear is used by the fraud group. "

Fang Yuan said that in the era when China entered economic downturn and online fraud, it was difficult for the public to expect that the public security department could have to fight fraud. It can only protect themselves by increasing their legal knowledge to protect themselves.

# Never take off your socks: how much do you know when flying ceremony

Description: With the advent of busy summer, we need to discuss some common etiquettes that can make flight happily. A senior empty multiplier summarizes 12 common ride rules, which can not only get comfort for yourself, but also facilitate others. Hannah Agosta is now complained when talking about flight. Nevertheless, a little goodwill will also help the improvement of summer aviation travel.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-05-26T12-42-01-08-00/24flight-attendant-etiquette-master1050.jpg)After 21 years of flight attendants, I have seen everything. The epidemic exacerbated the intense atmosphere on the plane, and the most extreme passengers were upgraded to violent incidents. However, it is even more common that I see rude behavior can cause disputes or unpleasant.

As we enter busy summer, it is necessary to discuss daily etiquette. I dare to say that they can make flight happily.

The following is my flight etiquette rules. The purpose is to ensure that you are reasonable and comfortable, but also think for the people around you.

** Everyone has the right to put the chair back behind -but to be polite.

The wrong approach is to put back the back of the chair hard and quickly. This may make the bad laptop computers in the back row, which causes the beverage to spill out, and may even trigger a fight, causing the flight to surrender. Pay attention to the situation around you. Before you go back, see what is behind you, and politely ask the other party if you mind.

** After your child is messing up, you have to clean up ** **. **

We are not servants. Air passengers can only use hand washing solution, wet paper towels and air fresh agents, and cannot use a vacuum cleaner, broom or cleaning supplies. This is not what you have to do, but for politeness, you should do it. If you do n’t clean up, you will have a chain reaction: the messyness may cause hidden safety hazards; and large -scale cleaning work will even cause delays in the next flight. Active thinking is helpful. Can children hold a large bag of snacks? If not, you can pack it in smaller and easier to manage in advance.

** The luggage compartment on the top is not your Russian cube game. **

Economy class luggage compartment comes first. The position above the seat does not belong to you. You can't take out the bags of others and put your bag in. Moving luggage to maximize the space is okay, but leave complicated problems to the flight attendants. Remember, the small bag should be placed under the chair, and the luggage compartment above the head is left to a large luggage.

** No one wants to listen to your video chat. **

We don't need to hear the conversation between the two parties; in addition, boarding is not when you are busy saying goodbye. At this time, you should focus on finding your seat and putting your luggage as soon as possible, so that the people behind you can do the same thing. Speaking of this, no one wants to listen to your movies, video games or Tiktok, so bring headphones. Even if the child is the same.

** The seat in the middle can use the armrests on both sides. **

Passengers squeezed among the two are nowhere to be reliable, which is the comfort award for them. That's it.

** Headphones are a completely acceptable conversation tool. **

The neighbor is too talkative? The headset is a good way to avoid the hints that do not understand the hints, so that you will not be forced to chat. This is my commonly used method: After the whole sky is multiplied, the noise reduction headset is my shelter. I want to keep calm on my way home.

** Don't take off your socks. **

If it is a long -distance flight, be sure to relax and take off your shoes, but there is absolutely no reason to take off your socks. Foot odor is inevitable. Also, control your feet. It is unacceptable to put your feet on the armrest of the front seat. And I strongly recommend that you put your shoes up when you go to the toilet.

** Wisdom to use the call buttons wisely. **

If you need it -renewal cups, uncomfortable body or help to coordinate your passengers -please use it. This is better than poking or shooting the flight attendants, because these two actions are inappropriate. Before you press the button, make sure you don't see us pushing a beverage car or garbage bag on the aisle -it means that we are here!If you have a real emergency, please know a few more times, so we know that things are important.

** Don't discipline the children of other people's houses. **

Nothing is more uncomfortable than the back of your chair. However, if a child makes trouble behind you and tells his parents. You have no right to yell at other people's children. A good way is to ask their parents calmly and with a smile, they realize whether the child is kicking your back. Then say that this is very troublesome; do you have any way to stop your child? In this way, there is no meaning in your tone, but in a request, not in the finger.

** Solve the seat problem before boarding the plane. **

If your family fails to sit together and at the peak of chaotic boarding, air passengers will not be able to help you coordinate. The staff at the boarding gate can see the seat watch and family booking, so please ask if they can change their seats. [Some airlines even stipulate that families with children under 13 years of age must sit together](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard), So the boarding gate is the best place. Or a better way is to call the airline before going to the airport.

advertise

** If someone asks you to change seats, you are not unsatisfactory. **

I want to say something that is not popular. No, if someone asks you if you can change your seat, you don't have to agree. If you pay extra money for the seat, even if you just feel inconvenient, you can refuse friendlyly. If you change your seat to you, such as replacing the middle seat with a window, or if you are happy to help, then change it.

** Please rush to the toilet. **

This should be common sense, but somehow, it has not become common sense. I do this every day. I don't want to rush off your excrement, and passengers who use the bathroom behind you don't want to. If you can't find the button, please find it yourself: I promise it to be there. Every plane is available.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T12-57-00Z/63389469_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65744704/63389469)According to Ernst & Young statistics, China's investment in Germany fell from US $ 2 billion in 2021 to about $ 290 million in 2022

(Voice of Germany) Consulting company Anyong (EY) reported this month that foreign investment in Germany fell to the lowest level in 2013. American companies are still the most important investors in Germany, and investment from China has declined.

The report wrote that although Chinese companies' investment in Germany has remained stable for a long time, Chinese projects have decreased in 2022. Nevertheless, Ernst & Young also pointed out that when Chinese companies invest in Europe, most investment is mainly in Germany. Among the total 222 Chinese investment projects, 85 were carried out in Germany; followed by France with a total of 32 projects.

[German Federal Foreign Trade and Investment Agency](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/各国在德投资-美国蝉联榜首-中国排名下滑/a-65697529)The statistics released this week also have similar results. Despite the influence of the war and energy crisis, the number of foreign companies in Germany in 2022 remains stable. The United States is still the country with the most investment. Switzerland and Britain ranked second and third, and China slipped to fourth place. Among them, the number of investment projects from China fell to the lowest level since 2014.

China's investment in Germany has fallen to the lowest level in the past years, [Woodker, Chairman of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China(Jörg Wuttke)Recently interviewed by the Nande will](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体谁改变了谁/a-65745734)Sorry for such a situation. Woodker said that it supports China to invest in some areas of Germany and in those areas where Germany has a technical gap with China, so that we can learn from China. "

### No longer favored by Chinese investors?

According to [another report released by Ernst & Young this year](https://www.ey.com/de_de/news/2023/02/weniger-chinesische-firmenuebernahmen-in-deutschland)German companies are losing their attractiveness to investors. The report entitled "Chinese Enterprises in Europe" states that the number of Chinese companies' acquisitions on Germany and European companies is declining. In 2022, China conducted 139 acquisitions or investment in Europe, and 155 in 2021. The estimated value of these 139 investment was $ 4.3 billion (about 4. billion euros), which was almost two -thirds compared with 2021.

According to Ernst & Young statistics, China's acquisition in Germany in 2022 dropped from 35 to 26, and the investment amount also fell from $ 2 billion (about 1.87 billion euros) to nearly 290 million US dollars.

In contrast, in 2022, the United States acquired 242 companies in Germany, leading in other countries, and the second Britain acquired 128. China ranks 12th in the national ranking. The report pointed out that in 2021, China ranked 9th in this ranking, and in 2016, China was the fourth largest investor in Germany.

Compared with this year's record in 2016, China is particularly cautious. At that time, Ernst & Young calculated the case of Chinese investors' acquisitions or holdings of European companies from 309, with a total value of 86 billion euros. Seven years ago, the largest transaction in Germany was China -US group acquired Augsburg robotic manufacturer KUKA, with a single acquisition amount of $ 4.7 billion. Since then, these numbers have continued to decline almost, and there are few acquisitions in Germany in Germany. According to Ernst & Young data, only 26 Chinese investors acquired or invest in German companies last year. EY's data shows that buyers from China have now avoided large -scale acquisitions of controversial politics.

### In the face of Chinese investment, how should Europe be dealt with?

In 2022, the largest investment in Chinese buyers in Europe was that Wuxi's micro -core acquired the world's second largest mobile base station radio frequency semiconductor company, Dutch AMPLEON.

The larger transaction in Germany was East China Pharmaceutical Investment Holding Company's equity investment in Heidelberg Pharma, Heidelberg Pharmaceutical Company, as well as AMSOSRAM to sell its digital lighting system Europe and Asian business to Inventronics.

### Why does China reduce acquisitions and investment?

Sun Yi, the head of the reporter of the report and the German business department of Ernst & Estate, said: "The number of Chinese companies in Europe has maintained a relatively low level in the past few years." The reason is due to the new crown epidemic, Chinese businessmen have been unable to travel for a long time. On the other hand, for China, its expansion in Europe has obviously lost its importance.

Sun Yi further explained that Chinese companies faced considerable political resistance in the acquisition and trading cases of many European countries, such as infrastructure, such as infrastructure. She said: "Therefore, Chinese investors are now carefully examining the potential acquisition goals to avoid discussions on these sensitive issues by the government and the public."

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T12-57-00Z/19317982_404.jpg)The reporter of the report, Sun Yi, the head of the German business department of the German District of Ernst & Estate, Sun Yi

Sun Yi also pointed out that the tense political relationship between China and the United States has also suppressed trading activities: "If the potential acquisition target has production facilities or R & D centers in the United States, potential Chinese buyers are usually not invited to participate because they are worried that they will be concerned about them. Rejected by the relevant U.S. departments. "

According to Ernst & Young data, in 2022, Chinese investors' acquisitions in Europe for high -tech companies in Europe first surpassed the traditional industrial field. The report pointed out that in 2022, Chinese investors are most interested in the medical industry. Of the 17 transactions in the fields of European biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical technology, 9 have occurred in Germany. The United Kingdom has once again become the most popular investment destination for Chinese companies.

Despite the decline in investment, Sun Yi believes that Chinese companies are still very interested in Germany. In the report, she pointed out: "Most of the transactions that have occurred in recent years are very successful. In this context, China and Germany have now established a close and flexible connection on many levels." She believes that there will be more Chinese companies this year Looking for acquisition objects in Europe. "However, the number of transactions will still be significantly lower than the period of prosperity."

According to the "Overview of China Overseas Investment in the first quarter of 2023" released by Ernst & Young on May 11, in the first quarter of this year, the amount of mergers and acquisitions announced by Chinese companies in Europe was US $ 950 million, a year -on -year decrease of 39%. It fell 24%, mainly investing in the United Kingdom (real estate, hotels and construction) and Germany (advanced manufacturing and transportation). The transactions of the two countries accounted for 86%of the total M & A announced by China Enterprise in Europe.

### "Establishing mutual dependence will bring benefits"He further stated: "I support safety inspections in sensitive fields. In this regard, we can also learn from China, and they have done it for decades. But we should pay attention not to lose the nature of market liberalism. Industrial policy may cause triggered Conflict, but we live in a society that can resolve these conflicts. The authoritarian system cannot do this. "

The college graduation season is coming, and the problem of Chinese students in the United States has become a hot spot again. Coinciding with all walks of life in the United States worrying about the Chinese government's stealing technology and even threatening the national security of the United States, how does the sensitive professional students view their "Chinese" identity?

*** [Politics coming out in the United States must still beware of risks](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/eng-04302023075633.html)***[** A Chinese student faces US judicial allegations that have been tracked and harassed "White Paper Movement" supporter **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/bx-12152022135741.html)In Mayday of Phoenix Flowers, a large number of graduates of graduates in American universities weekends in almost every weekend wearing a bachelor's robe and a scientific hat. They lined up at the graduation ceremony and waited for the spike ceremony. They also symbolized that they were about to say goodbye to teenagers.

Looking at the graduate of this year, I left the school and Ais pine, a Chinese doctoral student who was studying in electronic engineering in Pennsylvania. According to the program, he still has half a year at school, and he does not need to grab the narrow door with other peers in the hot summer. Not only did the American science and technology market face the cold winter of employment this year, Ace's undergraduate background of the "Defense Seven Son" also made him have more "original sins" than other graduates.

Ace: "We are not treated by China, because we are anti -thief (opposed to the Communist Party) and are not treated by the United States, because we come from China to get angry on both sides."

** "National Defense Seven Son" in the United States? **

For personal safety considerations, Ace accepted an interview with this station in English. He has been investing resumes for internships a few months ago, but he contacted more than ten laboratories, including institutions funded by the US government, but none of them. Ace believes that his sensitive majors, the background of the defense seven sons and the identity of Chinese citizen let him eat closed doors all the way.

"I am a professional electronic information of the Seven Sons of Defense (university). Our sensitive and sensitive schools, I don't know how to refuse my human resources what to think. People will definitely not say the real reason. It may be considered the seven sons of the defense, especially in some national laboratories. "Ace couldn't help spitting bitter water to reporters.

In recent years, the Chinese government has actively dug in American sensitive scientific and technological talents and intellectual property rights, and some of the purpose even to strengthen the modernization and military capabilities of the Chinese PLA. Jillmurphy, deputy assistant director of the FBI (FBI), is in charge of the anti -intelligence work, recently testified to Congress that the threat of intelligence and economic spy from China constitutes the largest and long -term threat to the United States' scientific and technological innovation and economic security. In addition, Chinese scholars have been sued by the US government for stealing intellectual property rights, commercial secrets and returning relevant information back to China.

However, will American companies be more guarded by Chinese students? An anonymous person who had served as a manager at a technology giant company in the United States revealed to this station that he also has the experience of sensitive industrial work. Because US laws are not allowed to discriminate against the race, nationality, gender, etc. It is not the primary focus of technology companies. Even if companies are concerned about citizens of specific countries when recruiting, they will not understand the notification. However, he believes that if you are in a sensitive industry, the application may be more special.

The American manager said: "Recruitment managers usually do not pay special attention (nationality of job seekers), unless this is a very sensitive industry, such as national defense or nuclear weapons. If it is a job seeker from Iran, China or North Korea I think it is easier to cause a dangerous signal. Recruitment units will independently examine all the background information of each job seeker, but broadly, people from Iran, China, North Korea and other countries may be more worrying. "

Ace came to the United States with a student visa in 2018. He told the reporter that he was not immediately approved when he applied for a visa in the US Embassy in China. According to the official website of the US State Department, the embassy staff may require the applicant to further administrate the administrative trial when it is determined that more information is required to help decide or refuse to issue a visa.

"I got (visa) for three months for three months, and this process was still very torment. Because in the process of checking, many people did not pass it, so I rejected After passing, although it is a relatively sensitive major such as the seven sons and electronic information. "Ace recalled."Seven Defense" is the 7 universities directly under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, including Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Harbin University of Technology, Harbin University of Technology, Northwestern University of Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Nanjing University of Technology.

June Teufeldreyer, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, said in an interview with this station: "We need to sacrifice privacy to a certain extent to protect national security. Can appeal. This is different from China. "

And another Chinese student John in the United States believes that although the U.S. government's intention to defend national security is good, but if there is no proper planning and proper tools, I am afraid it will become a cup of cups and label all the Chinese students with sensitive professional backgrounds so that the United States will lose the United States to lose the United States. Opportunity to recruit top talents.

For safety reasons, John, who specializes in the field of biotechnology, is unwilling to use its name. He told Liberty Radio: "I agree with the United States to strengthen the prevention of China, but it depends on how to prevent it. Some precautions for China are actually mutually beneficial. For example Drive everyone away, (the United States) does not know what good talents are being driven away. "

** The decline in US -China relations is still the first choice for studying in China **

Although US -China relations are not as good as before, the United States is still the first choice for Chinese students. According to the "Open Portal Report in 2022" released by the US International Education Association (IIE), the 2021/2022 academic year, the total number of Chinese students studying in the United States accounted for about 33%of the total number of international students, ranking first, and China became the largest in the United States for 13 consecutive years. International students of international students. Among them, the proportion of mathematics and computer specialists accounted for nearly a quarter, followed by projects.

Professor Kim Defang revealed that her two Chinese students returned to work after graduation, and contacted her last year, hoping to help issue a recommendation letter from the American master's degree. She believes that many Chinese students are actually talented, and they have the potential to make great contributions to the United States in terms of economy and technology.

"Some of them may be spies, which will be judged by the Federal Investigation Agency." Kim Defang said.

** Reading in one minute: **

Recently, the "Russian Liberal Legion shouts to talk about the Chinese People's Liberation Army" short video. The picture is a member of the Russian Liberal Legion spoke in Russian. Simplified Chinese subtitles say "Your Pig Head Emperor, like Putin, is a dictator who oppresses the people."

After investigation, the Liberty of RussioGion did release this video, but the content has nothing to do with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The translation of Chinese subtitles that have been circulating in Chinese subtitles are inconsistent with the original videos. It is added by Twitter users "Wall Country Word". But the publisher stated that most of his works were funny with subtitles. Asian facts investigation of the laboratory found that when some online media and netizens reposted this second -created Chinese subtitles short video, no subtitle was ironic creation, which may lead to the true faith.

** Deep analysis: **

Asian factual inspection of the laboratory noticed that there are more than 400,000 booking households in YouTube, and the channel "Persistence to report the truth and fight against the total authority of the Communist Party of China" has recently released a short video, title ["Russia in Russia Liberty Legion shouts to talk about the Chinese People's Liberation Army "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=336rJfbYwV8)Essence The picture spoke in Russian in men's uniforms. Simplified Chinese subtitles read "Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, we are the Russian Liberty Legion, we will fight for our compatriots, fight for freedom ... Your pig head The emperor, like Putin, is a dictator who oppresses the people. "

First, we check the authenticity of the video. The "Russian Free Legion" released short videos on Twitter on May 22, and many media have reprinted and reported. According to [Canada Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cIjh3SY9qI)[Thames Radio] under the British "Times"(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rvyx-xFkF0)Reports and translations, the video content is roughly about lies, corruption, review, and restrictions on Russia under Putin's rule. It is time to end the Cremlin's rule, and Russia will be free. These news reports did not mention that the video involved related content involved in China and the Chinese PLA.

The floating watermark in the lower right corner of the original video is the "Russian Liberty Legion" badge, but the floating watermark in the lower right corner of the Chinese character short video says "Wall country absurd characters". After investigation, ["Wall Country Words"](https://twitter.com/xingzhe2021/status/1661067499180376100)The Twitter account released a short video in the early morning of May 24. As of the afternoon of the 25th, the number of views of more than 580,000, more than 400 reaches. There is a message to praise the subtitles in this video tweet, but because the video does not indicate that the translation of this video is a ironic joke, some people ask "Is this true", and some comments pointed out that they should not deliberately spread the error message.

And his Twitter account introduction also wrote that the Chinese subtitles were edited by movies and TV clips for secondary creation, and in the form of funny and ironic, they exposed the ridiculous and evil of the dictatorship.

However, similar to the "flag -raising" that released the video above, some oil pipes and Twitter accounts did not mark this ironic joke work when reposting the video.

**in conclusion:**

The videos of the Russian Liberty Legion are true, and the Chinese subtitles are used for the irony second creation. Therefore, the so -called "Russian Liberty Legion calls to talk about the Chinese People's Liberation Army" is not true. Asian facts check the laboratory that funny and ironic are freedom of creative creation, and most audiences can recognize the content of obvious spoofing.

However, under such charm, European companies still show great caution. He said: "China is not the same as before. Economic growth is not so strong. The top ten European companies in front of them account for 80 % of investment in China, and they continue to invest. Or leave. This is very different from the situation in the United States: the German economy there is very excited, and the industrialization has made the German industry also gain orders.

Woodkek told the Nande will that the biggest problem in China's economy is in the real estate industry, accounting for a quarter of the national economy. Despite the continued construction of the suspension projects, there are almost no new development.

Woodker said: "State -owned enterprises and five -year plans have been giving directions, but in the past, private enterprises had more space, and former President Jiang Zemin also brought them to the party. The scene was repeated. At that time, private entrepreneurs took over the economy and the media, and the party collapsed. In China, we have not been in the 1960s when the Cultural Revolution, but the direction is like this. "

The reporter asked: In the past, the slogan of "transformation of trade promotion" in Germany's debate in Germany would always be mentioned. Is China's current situation that we can predict at the time? Woodkek replied: "The promotion of trade is realized. The Chinese have changed us. We have never thought of it in the past. Now we look at the nationality of investors in Germany. The Chinese show us industrial policy."

Woodke also said that China has great potential if it can be completely liberalized. But the party could not see this potential because I wanted to maintain control.

# The login of the "sensitive facilities" in the Hamburg Port in Hamburg Port was intentionally delayed?

Author: None (Language: zh)

Time: 2023-05-26T14:29:00Z

Description: The controversy caused by Chinese -funded Hamburg Portal Welfare Wharf is still being extended: it is reported that the relevant institutions have not listed this dock as a protected facility in time, and the expression of the Hamburg Port operator has previously said that the dock is not a sensitive facility. Colleagues do not match.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T14-29-00Z/63564330_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65746595/63564330)(Voice of Germany Chinese) Disputes on the Chinese -owned investment in Hamburg Portal Welfare Land finally settled in mid -May: The federal government completed the approval of this investment plan, allowing the Chinese capital to participate in the Hamburg Port CTT CTT Fuki Container Terminal Pier Essence At this point, many Federal Ministry of Germany have rejected the Federal Prime Minister's Palace on the objection to the transaction.

However, the decision -making of the Prime Minister's Palace is also controversial. On the eve of the federal government's approval, the relevant docks have been listed as a sensitive infrastructure worthy of special protection. The key to the problem is that this dock should be positioned as sensitive facilities earlier, and the government's approval results may be completely different under the case of selected sensitive facilities. So who should take responsibility for this?

According to the information obtained by West Germany and North Germany, the HHLA of Hambao Port and Logistics Co., Ltd. HHLA has announced many times during the government approval that the Fuyidi Wharf that Chinese capital to invest is not a sensitive facility. However, the operator is wrong with this position of Fudi Wharf. Because the annual throughput of the dock far exceeds the standard for the pier's selected sensitive infrastructure. A spokesman for Hamburg Port and Logistics Co., Ltd. did not refute relevant allegations when he was questioned by the media. She just said that all government departments can fully understand the operation of the pier at any time.

### error decision made under the premise

The problem of HHLA is that in accordance with relevant laws, port operators must not only inform government agencies in a timely manner, but also register sensitive facilities in a timely manner. [But Hamburg Port has been delayed for several months. At the same time, BSI, BSI, who is responsible for the registration of sensitive facilities, has not asked the incident to Hamburg Port for a long time. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/汉堡港福地码头被列入关键基础设施-中远入股还有戏吗/a-65293775)It is said that the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs has urged the Ministry of the Interior to complete the login of sensitive facilities as soon as possible, but obviously has not been responded. Under the premise of such a mistake, the German government passed the approval procedure of Chinese capital to invest in Hamburg Port.

The error decision under the premise of this error has attracted the attention of many federal parliamentarians. This week, the Federal House Economic Council has questioned the Federal Information Security Administration and its superior Federal Ministry of the Interior. But who should be responsible for this wrong decision is not yet determined.

According to news surveys conducted by North Germany and West Germany, Chinese -funded shares have falsely fallen in the Hamburg Port approval procedure, and the time span has continued from the summer of 2021 to this day. In 2022, the new sensitive facilities came into effect. Hamburg Port should have completed the registration of sensitive facilities in Fudi Wharf before April 2022, but Hamburg Port did not do this.

On April 29, 2022, the relevant parties held a meeting in Berlin to discuss the approval procedures for the issue of Chinese investment. The participants were said to include HHLA, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Representative of the Prime Minister's Palace. During the meeting, the representative of the Hamburg Port showed a document that the Fudi Wharf was not a sensitive facility. But the error message at the time did not attract the attention of the participants. This is also the beginning of a series of wrong decisions.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-26T14-29-00Z/65711026_401.jpg)German Prime Minister Shulz and his Prime Minister's Palace are active promoters of Chinese -funded investment in Hamburg Port.

### Prime Minister Mansion hopes to promote port transactions

If the Field Wharf was included in a sensitive facility in accordance with the regulations, the subsequent government decision -making results may be very different. Because at that time, although the dock was not included in sensitive facilities, the six federal ministries participating in decision -making are opposed to the Chinese capital's investment in Hamburg. However, the German Prime Minister's Palace headed by Schilde was an active advocate of the transaction and turned on the green light for future negotiations. One of the core reasons proposed by the Prime Minister's Palace is that the Field Wharf is not a sensitive facility.

### The Green Party and the Alliance Party propose to criticize

Felix Banaszak, an expert in the Green Party, put forward a strong criticism of a series of errors in the approval procedures of the Hamburg Port. He said: "Unfortunately, the entire approval process allowed the German Prime Minister's Palace, the German Ministry of Political Affairs, and the German Information Security Administration to have no light. Especially after being positioned as a sensitive facility at the Field Pier, the German Prime Minister still obstructed the transaction to the transaction. Re -evaluation is undoubtedly a serious mistake.

Stefan Rouenhoff believes that there is still a series of problems to be clarified: [[until the end of the cabinet related meetings ended on October 26, 2022, the Fudi Wharf was positioned as a sensitive facilities. There are reasons to think that This is intentional.](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国内阁批准中资入股汉堡港-警告声不绝于耳/a-63562744)"Lainehov also criticized the Prime Minister's Palace and the Federal Information Security Agency. He said:" We have reason to question whether the German Ministry of the Internal Citizen under the leadership of the Social Democratic Party is covering a cover for the Prime Minister's Palace, so there is no (to the Field Pier (to the Field Wharf, The positioning of sensitive facilities) conducts in -depth review.

In the same, the models in the photos are Westerners. The slogans of promotion are sustainable and fashionable. Each piece of clothing shoes and hats sold out of the original price and discount on another. Although the webpage is known as Zurich Fashion, Amsterdam Fashion or Swiss Fashion, according to the Swiss Observation News (Bilick)The reporter's survey, the clothing sold is actually produced in China.

The newspaper published a shopping experience on the webpage of a pseudonym giuliah. She bought two pairs of sneakers and a pair of pants and spent 160 Swiss francs. A pair of name "Air Forceflower", the shoe is printed with "Air". When she bought it, she thought it was Nike's Air Force. After 10 days, the goods arrived, and the sneakers were packed in plastic bags, and there was no shoe box. She thought Nike shoes were actually cheap products imitating Nike. The sticky glue was a bit off, and the brand was called "Fashion". The other pair of soles of the shoe is hard, and the pants are too large. If you want to return the goods, you must write an email. The answer is that because she bought a discount product, she could not refund the money. She could only give a voucher on the webpage. The only way to return the goods is to send the goods to the shipper in Hong Kong. The customer has to pay the fare of 50 Swiss francs. Giuliah.

None of these two operators were registered in Switzerland. In addition, Mariefragonoir.com webpage, known as Paris Fashion, has cited users to the online shop of Claudemartin. The URL and store names are not one of the obvious features of fake online stores.

The "Observation Daily" reporter also found that although the online business operators from Amsterdam and Paris show that they are not the above companies, they have the same phone number as them. The same is true of Norahansen.com, another online shop that claims to be Norwegian fashion.

The Chinese real estate market has been cold, and new recruits for selling houses have continued. In Chongqing, Shenzhen and other places, the phenomenon of "negative first payment" and "zero down payment" in Chongqing, Shenzhen and other places have attracted attention. According to the Chinese media "Zhongxin Jingwei" report, negative payment "means that buyers not only need to pay the down payment, but also can be renovated and other funds.

For example, "Zhongxin Jingwei", a set of 5.2 million yuan in real estate in Luohu District, Shenzhen can loan 5.7 million yuan, which means that the down payment not only does not need to "pay for it", but also loans more than 500,000 yuan from the bank. I am afraid that it violates violated it Related financial credit policies.

On May 26, the Shenzhen Real Estate Intermediary Association issued a solemn reminder on "Prosperity to Prohibit the participation/assistance of" buying a house negative payment "and" zero down payment "and other violations of laws and illegal acts" to prepare to rectify.

"Zhongxinwei" also published Zhang Dawei, the chief analyst of Central Plains Real Estate on the same day that the "negative payment" house purchase is essentially a "high -review high loan" model, which is a illegal act of fraud. Wang Yuli, director of the Beijing Gold Prosecution Law Firm, also believes that this approach is obviously illegal and there are many legal risks. Using this model often needs to sign the "Yin and Yang Contract", which is also illegal in itself.

A spokesman for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the 26th that the German government has demanded that the Chinese envoy Li Hui "put pressure on Russia" to allow the Russian army to withdraw troops from Ukraine.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-26T17-09-00-04-00/000000.png)In March 2023, the CCP leader Xi Jinping was "elected" President at the National People's Congress. Reuters information picture [Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx 05262023143937.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05262023143937.html/@@stream)A few days ago, the Wall Street Journal of the United States published an article signed by Chun Hanwong, "Throughout the Mystery of Xi Jinping's Class", saying that "he (Xi Jinping) broke the ten -year governance cycle established by the previous Chinese leaders and in the party in the party, and in the party Consistent confidence in the interior, the age of these relatives, and the qualifications, are not enough to stir up the successors of the successor. "

According to the author of the article: "Xi Jinping, who is about to be 70 years old in June this June, this is a mystery he intentionally set. Under the case of unclear successors, the elite in the party needs to be careful to help Xi Jinping Maintain control and strive for time to evaluate the potential successors ... "

A few days ago, several Chinese media introduced the article by Dr. Wu Guoguang, a scholar published by the Institute of Policy of the American Asian Association in this month.

Dr. Wu Guoguang's article pointed out: The average age of the new Politburo members appointed by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was more than five years ago, ten years ago, or even twenty years ago. At the same time, after the 20th National Congress, Xi Jinping began to increase the post -60s and 70s upper position. However, Xi is the first leader who has not arranged a successor "Prince" since Deng Xiaoping.

Mr. Guoguang's "Prince" here is in the sense of "successor", not in the sense of "skirt". That is, the word Xi Jinping once used at the party meeting, "Chu Jun."

According to Wu Guoguang's calculation, the average age of the Politburo Standing Committee selected in October 2022 was 65.1 years old, 62.9 years in 2017, 63.1 years in 2012, and 62.0 years in 2002. This reflects Xi Jinping's deliberately promoting officials in his tenure and postponed the trend of promoting young officials.

The average age of the Standing Committee of the Politburo Standing Committee held in the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October last year, the reason why the Standing Committee of the 18th Central Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the 16th Central Politburo Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 16th Central Politburo was more than ten years ago. Yes, first because Xi Jinping himself broke the "seven, eight and eight", and the second was that Wang Huning, who was already 67 years old at the time of the 20th National Congress, was left in office. That is, Cai Qi, who is 66 years old, is Li Xi. In this way, the average age was pulled up.

Of course, in the newly promoted Politburo Standing Committee member of the Twenty National Congress, there was finally a post -60s, Ding Xuexiang, a member of the last Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Secretariat, born in September 1962.

However, Ding Xuexiang, the only post -60s of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee, was also over 60 years old at the conference. When he held the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China 15 years ago, at the same time Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, who are directly promoted to the Standing Committee of the Seventeenth Central Political Bureau, became the general secretary and the premier of the State Council, "spare tires".

If you compare it further, in the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2002, nine Politburo Standing Committee members were mainly 40s, and there were 3 30 generations, but they were born in the late 1930s. Among them, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao of the General Secretary of the successor and the Premier of the State Council are 60 years old, Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the National People's Congress, is 61 years old, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee of the CPPCC, is 62 years old. He became the youngest member of the Political Bureau of the Politburo after the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Here is another emphasis. Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, who were 16 years ago, were successfully successively successively successively successively successively successively successively. Today, the only post -60s post -60s, Ding Xuexiang, who is just 60 years old, is just a succession of a executive deputy prime minister.

In this way, when you can fully explain that Xi Jinping is considering the twenty high -level personnel arrangements, while determining that he is re -elected for the third and five years, in fact, there is no perspective from the "age echelon". That is, the issue of the "first -one hand handling" problem held by the Planning Council at the Twenty -first class held around October 2010.

For example, the author of the Shangwal Street Journal article analyzed that the secret establishment system of the Qing Dynasty was the invention of the Emperor Yongzheng, which was ascended to the throne in 1722. He was deeply felt in the tragedy of his father Kangxi Emperor Kangxi in the world. He decided to choose the secret of Chu Jun after his lifetime, and after his death, the ministers saw the widow of the imperial heir to see. Yongzheng believes that the establishment of secrets can reduce the risk of the princes, so as not to let the emperor's power fall next to the reign, and also avoid Chu Jun from competing for power from the emperor.

Today, three hundred years later, Xi Jinping, the biggest power of China's power after Mao Zedong, also seems to be happy. Xi Jinping, who opened the third general secretary last year, can choose his successor and successor time, but he has been reluctant to show the cards.

The author believes that in the article, Xi Jinping's private considerations of "successors" and the secret establishment of the "Qing Dynasty (emperor)" are far -fetched. The more accurate analysis should be that Xi Jinping's third term has undoubtedly had the third and fifth determination to design his third term. And this determined psychological factors, in addition to "the world's big people" and "who I am" from the perspective of ability, there are also "picking two hundred pounds of burden to take 20 miles of mountain roads and do not change shoulders" and " The "physical health, forever health" of "5 kilometers per day" is extremely confident. Therefore, at least when the age composition of the "leadership collective" of the third term that accompanied himself in the third term last year, Xi Jinping may consider the problem of the second hand and the third hand ... Announcement, consider his successor's succession tire. From his self -use analysis, he would not even consider his so -called "potential successor" from the perspective of "preventing accidents".

When four candidates of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Twenty of the 20 assigned specific positions, Xi Jinping also seemed to consider how to avoid the problem of "successor".

At this point, we might as well return the time back to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year.

At that time, the outside world commented or "internal news", and Ding Xuexiang, then Ding Xuexiang, was optimistic about the "big inner manager", but there was no analysis article. None of the "according to Beijing news," mentioned that Ding Xuexiang will be the executive vice prestigious vice prestigious of the State Council.The New York Times article also analyzed: Ding Xuexiang, 60, is the youngest member of the Standing Committee. But many analysts say that because of the lack of provincial leadership experience, he is unlikely to become Xi Jinping's successor. In this sense, for Xi Jinping, he may be the best candidate for fish and bear's paw: loyalty but not threatening.

In other words, Ding Xuexiang's 20th major "entered", which was originally considered to be "nailed" by the outside world.

However, if Xi Jinping's personnel arrangement of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the 20th National Congress of Politburo is the most "not published in accordance with the card", or the least "follow -up" is to take a day of the deputy prime minister of the State Council, or even Li Qiang, who has never experienced the work experience of the State Council for half a day, was directly promoted to the Prime Minister of the State Council from the position of the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. It has never been in the post of the "Inner Management" of the government leaders or government departments from the grassroots level to the central government or the government departments.

Theore to theoretically, when Xi Jinping must further use himself as the leader of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and his second general secretary, Ding Xuexiang, who is in the term of office of his second general secretary, judges in accordance with "common sense". Ding Xuexiang should take over the job of Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the 19th Central Political Bureau, and analyzes from the perspective of logically and familiar. So why not arrange this?

Imagine that if Xi Jinping after the 20th National Congress must make Ding people "enter", it is not because Ding is not arranged as the executive deputy prime minister of the State Council, but is arranged as a de facto party "Deputy Secretary" Then, whether it is inside or outside the party, there will definitely be Xi Jinping's nine -year -old Ding Xuexiang who is nine years older than himself.

In comparison, Xi Jinping arranged for Cai Qi, who was in the age group as the party's second leader, and did not constitute the "age echelon", which would not cause unnecessary conjectures of "successors". In fact, after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, when Cai Qi replaced Wang Huning's "Deputy Secretary", he was confirmed by his new Politburo Standing Committee and the Secretary of the Secretary of the Central Committee (1). It was the perspective of "Vice Chairman Lin" around Mao Zedong, but it was only from the perspective of "intimate assistant of" great leaders ", not from the perspective of" successor selected by the great leader himself ".

Of course, on the premise of rewarding Ding Xuexiang as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the State -level National -level, there is no other choice for its specific job arrangements. Such as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. As for the positions of the chairman of the National People's Congress and the chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, since it was arranged to give a re -elected member of the Politburo Standing Committee in the 1950s, it naturally excluded the post -60s and was the first time to enter the applicability of Ding Xuexiang.

So in the distribution of the two specific positions of the State Council Executive Vice Premier and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Xi Jinping gave Ding Xuexiang the post of executive deputy prime minister of the State Council. Obviously, he had a consideration of the next five years.

Regarding the so -called "seven, eight below", there is no need to explain in detail here. After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year, it was questioned that Xi Jinping "broke the hidden rules of seven up and eight." But in fact, in addition to Xi Jinping himself, only the military representative Zhang Youxia and the diplomatic representative Wang Yi are "exceptions". All other deputy national levels including the political bureau members are not members of the Politburo. "Age" is still "seven, eight and eight".

It should be noted that in addition to Xi Jinping himself, the 20th Political Bureau of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee is also the principle of strictly obeying the principle of "seven, eight, and eight". Out of the situation, and Cai Qi, who is 67 years old, is often entered.

One of the most convincing facts is that under the premise of failing to re -elected the Politburo Standing Committee because of age, Han being able to be arranged as a national vice chairman by Wang Qishan five years ago. Out of the situation is not politically losing Xi Jinping, but just like Wang Qishan, five years ago, the simple age.

In addition, the former member of the 19th Central Politburo, Secretary of the Secretariat and Minister of the Central Team. Xi Jinping's "Shangpu Brothers" Chen Xi when he was a student of workers and soldiers in Tsinghua University. Being able to obtain the opportunity to be promoted to the Standing Committee of the Politburo on the 20th National Congress is enough to explain that Xi Jinping's "hidden rules" in the decision of the 20th high -level personnel, or "age bar" "" ".

At this point, we will compare the six and twenty Central Political Bureau Standing Committee members of Xi Jinping one by one, and we can see that Xi Jinping's purpose is 5 years, that is, the existing 20 of the 2027 will be held in 2027. The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, from Cai Qi to Zhao Leji, from Wang Huning to Li Xi, coupled with Li Qiang, born in 1959, must be "due to age", leaving only Xi Jinping and Ding Xuexiang for re -election. At that time, Ding Xuexiang replaced the post of Prime Minister Li Qiang's post.

In fact, before the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a commentator who had guessed that Hu Chunhua would take over as the Prime Minister's position. One of the reasons he held was that Hu Chunhua was one year younger than Ding Xuexiang's age advantage. After deciding that he could take over Prime Minister Li Keqiang, he could be re -elected as Li Keqiang as Li Keqiang. Two sessions, and the premiers of the State Council for two sessions are important factor in maintaining the relatively stable work of the State Council and relatively coherent governance.

However, now that Xi Jinping has arranged for the 21 -year -old Li Qiang to take over the post of prime minister, the inner abacus is likely to be the Central Party and the main head of politics except Xi Jinping. Whether it is the "Deputy Secretary" or the Prime Minister of the State Council, whether it is the chairman of the National People's Congress or the chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, whether it is the Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission or the Vice President of the Standing Committee.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

Associated Press Information Picture [Audio-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jieduxinjiang/xinjiang-05262023144127.html/@stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jieduxinjiang/xinjiang-05262023144127.html/@@stream)Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, welcome you to interpret Xinjiang with me. The newly announced document reveals how the Chinese authorities avoid forced labor censorship in Xinjiang, and Beijing also uses a centralized authoritarian system to punish the behavior that does not comply with its poverty alleviation movement. Political nature of labor. In response to this situation, the China House of Representatives China Issues Special Committee issued a report released on May 24, urging Uyghur forced labor to take further action, and at the same time eliminated clothing websites that allowed clothing websites to sell Uyghur forces in the United States Vulnerability, and formulate a list of foreign manufacturers known known to force the laborers. In this episode, we will learn more about these situations together.

An internal document that has not been disclosed before ordering local cadres to "repeat ... ideological education" to lazy people, alcoholic and "other people with insufficient internal power" to ensure that they participated in the "cotton in Xinjiang to pick cotton. "Poverty Alleviation" movement.

The documents issued by the poverty alleviation working group in Shache County in Kashgar area in July 2019 and suggested that the authorities should take mandatory measures if these efforts fail to produce "obvious effects".

By the end of 2019, the Salian Authority was preparing a "powerless" list, including the old man who was 77 years old and proposed solutions for their "laziness", including sending them to other counties to work in Miantian.

On May 2nd, Zheng Guoen, director and senior researcher of the Chinese Research Director and Senior Researcher, headquartered in Washington,(Adrian Zenz)These documents were announced in a report.

The document shows that after 2018, the authorities have strengthened their efforts in Xinjiang to force the Uighurs to take "poverty alleviation" measures -including labor transfer and seasonal labor. In some cases, these documents require the "political status" of poverty alleviation work, and at the same time warn cadres that if they have not achieved results, they will face the consequences of "serious".

Documents also show that historical models (such as models used by international labor organizations) are often unsatisfactory when used to evaluate regions including Xinjiang, because they only consider commercial exploitation rather than political exploitation. Zheng Guoen said in an interview with the Victoria Group of Liberty Asia, saying that

"If governments like Western countries want to effectively crack down on Uighurs' forced labor, these are factor that they need to consider and examine

"The forced labor of state funding is a method that affects the entire government and society that affects the entire region, not just ... the isolated forced labor points everywhere. It causes the entire regional systemic risk and social risk."

Zheng Guoen also said that by promoting poverty alleviation into a political task, rather than pure economic tasks, Beijing has been able to associate forced labor with terrorism. He said,

"You let them leave the land, where they can do their own things freely, they may have a free season, so they can choose a job or not to work.

"But this is considered to be the laziness of the Uighurs and is regarded as a national security risk. This is why the efforts to promote Uighurs to engage in various tasks in 2018 and 2019 are regarded as national security issues ... Of course, this sense of urgency is of course, this sense of urgency Caused a very strong coercion. "

The report entitled "The Forced Labor in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Uzbekistan cotton cotton" states that in Xinjiang, the Beijing authorities use a centralized authoritarian system to punish the behavior of not observing its poverty alleviation campaign.

These penalties include detaining threats and discovering abnormal behaviors through preventive police automation systems. The report claims,

"The environment that generates 'structural forced consent' may not be immediately observed by outsiders, and it may be difficult to evaluate through traditional means such as forced labor indicators of international labor organizations. This framework is not designed to evaluate state funding. Forced labor. "

Zheng Guoen called on the European Union to formulate "effective legislation", forced labor for national support affecting the entire region, and called on the United States to continue to implement the "Uyghur forced Labor Prevention Law" in December 2021. They did not use Uyghur forced labor manufacturing at any stage of production.

The report warns that if the international community does not need appropriate tools to investigate China ’s responsibility for such practices,“ Beijing ’s economic and long -term political goals in Xinjiang may mean that forced labor can be transferred to cotton picking and related industries. time."

Communist victim commemorative foundation chairman and former United States representative of the United Nations Andrew Brunberg told Liberty Radio that the United States and international community were "serious in short" to solve the measures for the forced labor issues of Xinjiang, and for Beijing in the region in the region The policy is not available. He said,

"The United States needs to help leaders' efforts on the basis of bilateral basis to strengthen our own laws ... and cooperate with other countries to let China take responsibility in multilateral environments such as international labor organizations. At the same time, we need to strengthen these organizations and The entity cooperates with other countries to ensure that they can better prevent forced labor from funding by the state. "

The European Union is currently reviewing the proposed legislation, which will allow import ban on products related to serious violations of human rights (such as forced labor).

Brunberg welcomes the proposed legislation, but warns that if the European Union wants it to produce expected results, such rules must be correctly constructed. He said,

"If they try to use only forced labor indicators used by international labor organizations in the past, considering the uniqueness of the state support for compulsory labor, it may not affect the products that are forced labor production from Xinjiang."

Brunberg said that the international community needs to make a strong response, including resistance to imports, in order to "make clear to China that their behavior, their violations of personal rights, human rights ... punish."

At the same time, the Uighurs headquarters in Washington issued a statement that condemned the compulsory labor measures supported by the state supported by Zheng Guoen's report. It is not easy to find through standard measures such as forced labor indicators for international labor organizations. "

Rushan Abbas, the executive director of the Uyghur Movement, said that the report "reveals the deep -rooted systemic coercion dynamics, and these developments continue the environment of" structural forced consent "in Xinjiang, which makes the innocent Uyghur power. "Ruxian Abbas, said from China's high -pressure national machine", saidIn addition to calling on sanctions on China ’s compulsory labor behavior in Xinjiang, the Uyghur Movement also called on the company to check its supply chain thoroughly and take action immediately to ensure that they will not promote such infringement.

In addition, the China House of Representatives China Issues Special Committee stated in a report released on May 24 that the US Congress should eliminate the loopholes that allow clothing websites to sell Uighur forced labor in the United States and formulate a known exploitation of exploitation List of foreign manufacturers who forced labor.

The report also suggested that Congress through legislation to fund public archives recording China for racial extinction against Uighurs, and suggested that the administrative department conduct diplomatic efforts to help those who escape from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to find a shelter.

The report calls on the "minimum" threshold for changing customs inspection. If the value of the package is less than 800 US dollars, the threshold allows foreign fast fashion websites to ship the goods directly to consumers without being subject to the Uighur forced labor prevention law.

The "Uyghur forced Labor Prevention Law" was approved in 2021 to prohibit the import of any products made by forced labor manufacturing. According to official data, goods that have prevented more than $ 1 billion in the United States have been prevented according to the bill.

The committee report shows that the "lowest" threshold for customs inspection increased from $ 200 to $ 800 in 2015.

After this change, as the "rise of new online retailers" selling products one by one, the value of goods that entered the US market in the US market have risen from less than 10 billion US dollars in 2020 to nearly 40 billion yuan in 2021 Dollar. The report also pointed at the same time,

"Utilizing the minimum threshold may be the main way to avoid the" Uyghur forced Labor Prevention Law "by Chinese companies (such as Higin SHEIN and Pinduodu TEMU) directly to consumers."

"Officials of the US Customs and Border Patrol" are unable to rationally review goods from China to the United States according to the current minimum rules. "

In addition to reducing the threshold, it also urged Congress to provide more funds to the Ministry of Land and Safety- "to implement the" Uighurs forced Labor Prevention Law "and list all the comprehensive list of companies involved in forced labor."

The Special Committee of the House of Representatives was led by the Republican members of Wisconsin Michael Garrat, but the committee has been working hard to show the participation of the two parties. Clehnenamulti insisted that they paid the same pace on Chinese issues.

Crisa Murdi told Radio Free Asia, "The information we tried to convey through this report is that the CCP needs to understand that in the two parties, it may be the two houses of the public, and it is actually a unified way- We are speaking with the same voice, that is, we must end this racial extinction now.

The well -known Tibetan film producer Wan Ma Caidan has died recently. He is the first Tibetan to shoot a story film in Tibetan. It is also a filmmaker who still shows the life of contemporary Tibetans from a real perspective under the strict review of the Chinese review agency. Essence His movie "Back to a Sheep" and "Balloon" won the award at the International Film Festival. In addition, US Secretary of State Brillin's remarks on the large -scale collection of DNA in Tibet and Xinjiang have caused strong dissatisfaction with the Chinese authorities. Brinken said that the Chinese government's collection of biological data has triggered more human rights issues. This approach is a form of control and monitoring, and expresses serious concerns about this. In this episode, we will understand the news together.

Several sources told Radio Liberty that the award -winning Tibetan film producer Wan Ma Caiman died in Lhasa on May 8th. The works of Tibetans are admired by the Han and Tibetans. He was 53 years old.

A source close to Wanma said he died of heart failure. Sources said he lived in Mozhu Gongka County, Lhasa, where he was shooting movies.

The film directed by Wanma Caidan won awards at the Busan Asian International Film Festival and the Taiwan Film Festival, and was translated into three languages of China and Japan. Tibetan filmmakers and writers who live in Dallanala, India, said,

"In the difficult situation of Tibet, there are very few Tibetan filmmakers in exile. Wanma Cai Dan has assumed the responsibility of shooting movies based on Tibet's real situation and changing changes. He has made extraordinary contributions to the Tibetan film industry. His death is a huge loss for the Tibetan community, which is a sad news for all Tibetans. "

According to Variety, the three films he finally completed, including "Taro", were invited to be screened at the Venice Film Festival.

Dan Zeng Suonan said that Wanma's early films- "Quiet Stone" and "Lacmar" -also left a deep impression in international film production.

Wanma Caidan studied movies at the Beijing Film Academy. He was the first director to make movies in Tibetan, but his award -winning works usually did not criticize the Chinese authorities' rule in the region. In recent years, he has been a professor at the Academy of Film Academy of China.

Wanma Caidan was arrested by the police in Xining in western China in 2016. After interrogation and beating, he had to be hospitalized.

Police said in a statement that the filmmaker had a dispute with airport security personnel after trying to return to the luggage claim hall.

Sources said that Wanma Caidan, like all artists who explore ethnic minorities and religions in China, were reviewed by the national review agency and asked to submit the Chinese script for review.

Dan Zeng Sonan said, "The challenge faced by Wanma Caican is to produce movies that can reflect Tibetan identity and Tibetan culture sensitivity without annoying the Chinese authorities, and he has controlled this delicate line. "

In addition, U.S. Secretary of State Broskere expressed concerns about the Chinese authorities' collection of DNA from Tibetans and Uighurs, causing strong response from Beijing.

At the Freedom House Annual Liberty Awards at the Capital Washington on May 9th, US Secretary of State Brosky said that the Chinese government collects biological data on ethnic minorities in order Genomic monitoring based on DNA is possible, which may promote power abuse. Blindken is the highest -level U.S. officials raised this issue.

"We have seen some of them, for example, the People's Republic of China on the crimes of Uighurs in Xinjiang and other ethnic minorities." He also said, "We expressed serious concerns about the Chinese government's large -scale collection of Tibetan gene samples, which is another way to control or monitor the population of the Tibetan population."

In recent years, the Chinese government has strengthened its suppression of Tibet. This includes the biometric data and DNA of school children and DNA in the form of non -voluntary collection of blood samples without the permission of their parents.

When a media reporter asked Brinken's comment, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said on May 10th, "The United States is very ridiculous about the remarks. It is meaningless except to create sensational fake news."

Wang Wenbin said that China is a country ruled by law, and Chinese citizens are protected by law regardless of their nations.

Wang Wenbin pointed out that the United States is a country that collects and use genetic information extensively. He also quoted reports of the Wall Street Journal on the development of genetic engineering weapons plans for the development of the US Department of Defense and the military collection of genome data.

He also quoted the "Russian Russia" TV website website that the US Air Force Education Command has issued recruitment information, specifically pointed out that the Russians' nucleotic acid and synovial liquid samples need to be obtained.

Wang Wenbin said, "Whoever uses genes to engage in unspeakable activities, I believe everyone is like a mirror."

The American State Department spokesman later told Radio Free Asia that the United States is committed to promoting the human rights of Tibetans and supporting the protection of its unique heritage, and continues to put forward concerns about human rights in the region to the Chinese government.

The spokesman said in an email: "We are shocked about the use of large -scale DNA collection in Tibet as another report of control and monitoring of the Tibet population. We urge the Chinese government An disturbed policy. "

In the speech, Brinkin also mentioned an administrative order issued by US President Biden in September last year on biotechnology and biological manufacturing innovation, which aims to ensure that the United States and its partners formulate advanced biotechnology specifications and rules that reflect their values.

He said that these guidelines are "a way to start the establishment of guardrails and shaping space, especially those in countries at the forefront of technical suppression seek their models and technologies, including all prejudices and risks, and do a large scale.""For me, the important development is that China may be forced to admit the existence of the plan, or at least forced to discuss with those who have pointed out the fact that the facts of the DNA facts."

Citizenship laboratory focuses on the research and development and strategic policies of information and communication technology, human rights and global security cross -fields.

Last September, Dex produced a report on the large -scale DNA collection of Tibet from 2016 to 2022, and found that the Chinese police may have collected genome data from 25% to 33% of the 3.7 million population in the region.

According to public sources, the report found that, in addition to any criminal investigation, the police took Tibetan men, women and children -in some cases, including Buddhist monks -the goal, to collect DNA, similar to Collect a lot of data from Uighurs living in Xinjiang.

Although the authorities collect DNA as a way to crack down on crimes, find missing persons, and ensure social stability, the report states that the authorities can collect DNA for any purpose without viewing police power.

The report pointed out that the plan is equivalent to a social control form of Tibetans who have long been monitored and suppressed by the state.

Human Rights Observation Wang Songlian, deputy director of the Asian Ministry, said that the US government should invest more resources, investigate Chinese companies participating in DNA collection, and seek to stop this behavior.

According to the Voice of Tibet, the "Human Rights Observation" headquartered in New York, USA, pointed out in a report released in September 2022 that there is evidence that the Chinese authorities have collected the people's genes (DNA) in the large -scale collection of people in Tibet and Qinghai Tibet. sample. Local police expand police activities on a large scale, claiming that the purpose of collecting genes is to crack down on crimes. Police have deepened to collect blood samples in rural areas. Children over five years old need to collect, and ordinary people cannot refuse.

Human rights observation also concludes the above conclusions through official reports of the Chinese government, and the information of bidding documents and leaks.

Promoting the organization of the International Solidarity Tibet Movement in a statement issued on May 10th stated that "China has regarded Tibet as a laboratory for implementing a relentless social control method", including large -scale DNA collection activities.

The statement said that "the best way to protect Tibetans from being exempted from Chinese autocratic rule is to promote peacefully to solve illegal occupation of Tibet by Tibet." The statement also suggested that the United States can promote the resolution of the Tibet-China Conflict Act in the two parties of the Congress.

The purpose of the bill is to authorize the US government to achieve the long -term goal of allowing Tibetans and the Chinese government to resolve divergent differences through dialogue.

In order to control Tibetans at all levels of society, the Chinese government continues to use various monitoring and supervision methods, including arbitrarily extracting Tibetans 'genes, iris and fingerprints such as biological samples to monitor Tibetans' every move. The actions of large -scale collection of gene samples are being implemented in seven administrative districts in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The authorities collected genetic samples of up to 1.2 million Tibetans, including children only five years old.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-26T18-20-00-04-00/000000.png)The first China-Central Asia Summit has been held in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province on May 19, 2023. /@@ stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenpokong/js-05262023165121.html/@@stream)In May this year, the two summits were held at the same time. One in Xi'an, China, the Central Asian Summit, and the Chinese Communist Party invited five Stan State of Central Asia to participate, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan.

Another seventh -nation summit in Hiroshima, Japan, and invited other nine countries to participate in the conference, including India, Brazil, Vietnam, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia (ASEAN rotating chairman), Komoro (the non -alliance rotating chairman), The heads of the Cook Islands (Chairman of the Pacific Island Forum), as well as the Ukrainian President Zeroski.

What makes the international community open is that the Xi'an Summit is engaged in powsing, bustle, luxury and luxury, and has a clear comparison with the simple, simple and frugal formation of the Hiroshima Summit. The Xi authorities have made a lot of money or lonely, 26 billion!If it wasn't for this huge sum of money, these five Stan State would not come. Sprinkling coins, so there was a Central Asian Summit. Help people buy expensive tickets, the head of the five kingdoms raised his head, holding his chest, and came.

In fact, these two summits not only compare the difference between the system, but also the corruption of the autocracy and the integrity of the democratic country; but also show the isolation situation of Beijing. More countries are united around the United States, and a few countries that interact with China are nothing more than money, for some short -term benefits.

After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Xi authorities were busy with diplomacy. There are both performances with Russia's reinforcement, as well as the efforts to alleviate the relationship with the United States, as well as the United States and Europe to fight against the United States and differentiate US -Europe relations. But after more than half a year, the effect is very small, not only has it been unable, but also shows a negative effect.

The specific response is that the United States and European countries, the United States and Asian countries, especially the world's democratic countries, reach unprecedented consensus, unite, and deal with the Communist China together. There are chip alliances of the United States, Japan, South Korea, Dutch, and Taiwan, as well as military alliances such as the United States and Japan, the United States, South Korea, the United States, Britain, Britain, Australia, the United States, Japan, India, Australia, and NATO, as well as international political alliances such as the Seven Kingdoms Summit. Unanimous to the CCP, stop Beijing in the Taiwan Strait, troubles in the South China Sea, and provoke the border between the East China Sea and China and India.

In January of this year, India invited 120 countries to hold a summit to focus on developing countries and South -South cooperation. Only China did not invite China. The Chinese Communist Party media is sour in Ah Q's mentality: "Fear of China attending the limelight of grabbing India; as long as China attended, India is gone." In May this year, the European Union invited the Asia -Pacific countries to hold a summit. Country 48 did not invite China, only "disagreement because of ideas and concepts." The Communist Party of the Communist Party of China Sour EU: "This world has changed, and the small country has united to bully the big country. It is really a big change in a century." And threw down the Q -Q golden sentence: "China refuses to participate in the forum because of not receiving invitations. "

In April and May of this year, the seven western countries, from foreign ministers and financial ministers to the summit, unanimously settled: de -risk, that is, Chineseization. At the same time, the 27th countries of the EU held a foreign ministerial summit and also reached the same common knowledge. All countries have defined: Communist China is the biggest challenge and risk.

Xi Jinping's misunderstanding is that he can win in all aspects of power struggle within the party. He thought that as long as he was all his own people, the so -called Xi Family Army had the will to unify his will and banned it. There was nothing in China. (In fact, you have not done anything in China, employment and people's livelihood, and nothing in China). He thought that as long as the diplomatic system was his own, Xi Family or War Wolf, there was nothing in international relations. I think that as long as the "big country diplomacy", "head of state", and "point out the direction of the development of the relationship between the two countries", what Sino -US relations, China -Europe relations, China and other countries are not uncertain.

All of these thoughts are self -righteous, and they are mistaken. As everyone knows, it is after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China that the international community has made up his final determination to cut with the Communist China. Even if the word is decoupled, it is at least risky, that is, Chineseization. Imagine how can even the different factions and different opinions within the party be able to listen to the voices of entering the international community? If you have to do unified will in China, let you see the international unified will: no, no to dictatorship, no persecution, no threat, no expansion.

Description: (AFP Moscow, 26th) Russia and Georgia interrupted airlines in 2019. They did not recover until last week, but a group of Georgia people protested outside the airport. Russian President Pu Ting said today that he thought everyone would be grateful and was surprised to have a demonstration.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-27T-5-32-08-00-00/000000.png)A Russian passenger plane landed last week at TBILISI airport at George's capital. It was the first to see since 2019, but dozens of Georgians protest outside the airport. The slogans in their hands say "Don't welcome you" and "Russia is a terrorist country."

Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The war is now in the second year. Russia is getting more and more isolated in the Western world, and George's position is more inclined to the West.

Vladimirputin said in a talks with business people: "Seriously, their reaction surprised me too much. I thought everyone would say" Okay, then thank you, this is a good thing, but it is a good thing. " No, there is a completely incomprehensible dissatisfaction in this incident. "

Pu Ting also said: "From our perspective, I think they are crazy, and they can't figure out the original committee of things."

Russia fought with Georgia in 2008. Although the time was short but miserable, Georgia's anti -Russia mood is still difficult to wear. In response to the anti -Russian movement in Tbilica, Russia banned air travel with Georgia in 2019.

However, Puting unexpectedly canceled the ban this month and also implemented a 90 -day visa -free measure on Georgian citizens.

Pu Ting said today that his understanding is that Georgia's leadership "repeatedly" requires Russia to cancel the air ban and implement visa -free measures.

But he also said that Russia would not intervene because "Georgia's domestic situation is not about our affairs," the Georgian people should decide the future direction of the country.

More and more people have accused the Georgian authorities that secretly cooperate with the Russian government after many years of tension with Russia. The Georgian government insisted that maintaining economic exchanges with Russia is inevitable.

She said: "We treat the US Treasury market as a backer of the global financial system. This backing needs to be stabilized."

When Putin met with business people on Friday (May 26), he admitted that Georgian demonstrations made him "very surprised" at the airport.

Putin said in a TV speech: "I thought everyone would say, thank you, it's great. But the contrary, I can't understand what they are dissatisfied."

Putin said: "In my opinion, their brains have problems. I don’t know what the situation is there."

As a response to the Tivis anti -Moscow rally, Russia stopped Georgian routes in 2019.

Surprisingly, Putin announced earlier this month to lift the flight ban with Georgia and launched a 90 -day visa -free measure for Georgian citizens.

On May 29, 1953, Dan Zeng Nuo Gai(39 years old)And Edmond Hillary(33 years old)Shortly took photos taken after the peak of Mount Everest.

** "I think they are the real pioneers and explorers, and paved the way to unknown areas. It is because of the two of them and their team that we can do a lot of things today." JamlingTenzing Norgay said. **

He refers to May 29, 70 years ago, that day, his father became the world's first peak in the world.

Tenzing Norgay, accompanied by New Zealand beekeeper Edmund Hillary, climbed the Mount Everest on the border between Nepal and China.

The son of the two climbers, Jamling Tenzing Norgay and Peterhillar, grew up listening to his father's heroic story since he was a child. Both followed their father's footsteps to conquer Mount Everest.

On the anniversary of the historic climbing, they proudly told the BBC about the brilliant achievements of their father.

[Warning issued 24 times to the top of the Charles at the top of Mount Everest](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-48571610)* [Mount Everest "People in the Mountains", the danger of the exposure of the mountain road congestion](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-48414350)###

In the mid -1970s, Jamel was with his father and brother.

"When they went up, they were just ordinary people, and they became world heroes when they came back. This did not change them. They are equally simple and humble people. They all give back to the people of Himalayas with their own lives," Jamel said proudly Essence

"Whenever someone has done something that has never been done before, it will send a signal you can also do to others. On the 70th anniversary of (human first reaching the Everest), let us celebrate this achievement."

In 1953, the summit undoubtedly created a precedent, and many people would follow the imitation: in the first ten days of the climbing season this year, more than 500 people reached the 8849 -meter -high Mount Everest.

The advancement of technology, logistics and communications made it possible, but Dan Zeng Noga and Edmond Hillary achieved this strong role without GPS or satellite telephones.

The news of their success was passed to London three days later.

In the 30 years before the summit, the two of them failed to successfully adventure.

Among them, Da Zeng Nuo Gai participated in the six top trials of 20 years, including the failure in 1952.

"When my father was a boy who raised yaks, he was often curious why no bird could fly over the mountain," Jamelin recalled.

"The prediction of Lama (senior Buddhist monk) inspired him, he said that Buddhists would first reach the peak."

### 15 minutes of the world -famous world

Peter said that when his father was invited to participate in the Ninth Britain's Well -Type Mount Everest, he knew it was a good opportunity to create history.

"He always knew he wanted to walk ahead. He was an ambitious person," said Peter in an interview with the BBC "Witness History" program.

"One of the most clear things I remember is, he described how he crossed the ice and snow to the South Peak."

"He said that he was in front of the steps, and the large snow and ice collapsed from the steep hillside and fell to Tibet."

They continued to move forward regardless of bad weather. Peter said that if it was other peaks, his father might give up and come again. He believed a voice in his heart and told his father to continue.

They were hypoxic when they reached the top of the mountain. After about 15 minutes on the top of the world, they came down.

Decades later, when Peter and Jamel boarded Mount Everest, they knew their unknown fields that their father had passed through.

"The first time I climbed was in 1990. I just always thought about my dad. When I walked to Hillary's steps, I witnessed the scene that my father had seen. I also had the same experience. This makes people very exciting. , "Peter told BBC.

Jamel "reached the top" for religious and personal reasons in 1996.

He and his father are both Shilba. This is a nation from Tibet and is known for its hiking skills. They have a deep spirit of linked spirit with the Himalayas.

"For me, this is more like a pilgrimage. I want to re -associate with my religion and customs to understand everything my father has experienced."

In 2001, climbers lined up when climbing Mount Everest.

As many people reaches Mount Everest every year, Peter and Jamel are not sought after by the public like their father.On Tuesday, Kami Rita reached its peak for the 28th time, breaking the record he created, and it was only one week before his last creation record.

But he said that he would not retire soon because his competitors, Pasang Dawa, followed closely, and it has been on the top of 26 times, and it is still increasing.

Lakpa Sherpa kept a record of female climbers, and she settled at the 10th time last year. They are not household names.

"Compared with my father's time, it is easier to climb climbing now. The technology is very helpful. After the summit, some people take a helicopter from camp 2 to Kedman. Both of them are carried by the Shilba. "Jamel continued.

"No adventure stimulus. It has become a photography event. It is not because they like to climb."

Peter agreed with this view. "We have a lot of ropes from the big camp to the top of the mountain, there are ladders across cracks, and the Charba team with hot tea in the camp. You can be rescued by helicopters safely at a helicopter from 6300 meters to 6,500 meters."

"But the mountain is still old. This is a challenging mountain."

This statement is more conservative. In the past 100 years, more than 300 climbers have died. In this season alone, the number of deaths reached 11.

"This mountain taught you to respect nature," Kamlin said. "We are just passengers on this planet."

###  China to strengthen the invasion of Taiwan

The Chinese fleet through the Taiwan Strait marks the upgrade of military tensions on both sides of the strait. The Chinese government believes that Taiwan is part of its own territory.

The government led by Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen strongly opposed Beijing's sovereignty requirements for Taiwan, and insisted that only the people of Taiwan can determine the future of Taiwan.

Tsai Ing -wen said on Saturday (May 20) in his last "520" inauguration anniversary in the 7th year of the governance, "Facing the scary of Chinese cultural attacks, the people of Taiwan are calm and unreasonable." She emphasizes that she emphasizes "War is not an option, and either party cannot change the status quo in unilaterally in a non -peaceful way."

In recent years, [China has strengthened the invasion of air and sea around Taiwan](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/发泄怒气后北京将如何走出台海危机/a-62735778)Essence In addition to the Chinese fleet through the Taiwan Strait, the Ministry of Defense of Taiwan also stated that in the past 24 hours, eight Chinese fighters across the strait midline. Since the large -scale military exercise was held in August last year, the invasion of Chinese fighters on Taiwan has become a commonplace.

In March last year, a few hours before the US President Bynden will talk to Chinese leaders Xi Jinping, the Shandong aircraft carrier in China has crossed the Taiwan Strait.

According to Chinese media, local people in Dalian are used to calling aircraft carriers "big ships." The length of the aircraft carrier is 315 meters, which is equivalent to the length of the three football fields, and its width is 75 meters.

### "Boss" Liaoning

The Chinese Navy's only active aircraft carrier "Liaoning" is rebuilt on the basis of the "Warkeg" manufactured by Ukraine. Some experts believe that the "Liaoning" is not an aircraft carrier that can really be used for military operations, but a platform for exercise and training and conducts one -step research and development.

At the end of 2016, the "Liaoning" conducted drills in the South China Sea and "detoured Taiwan" on the way, causing international attention. However, Taiwan media quoted military people and pointed out that Liaoning did not have all -weather combat capabilities. If you put it into actual combat, you can only play 30 % of the combat power.

### The third aircraft carrier?

In addition to the "Liaoning" and "Shandong", China currently has the third aircraft carrier -but its role is only used to entertain and recreational. The former Soviet Navy's "Minsk" sold to China after retiring in the late 1990s, and was transformed into a military theme park in Shenzhen.

### "Small step fast run"

In 2016, the ship was dragged to Zhoushan to renovate, and it is said that it will settle in Nantong, Jiangsu in the future. As for the real third aircraft carrier of the Chinese Navy, it is reported that it is built by Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard. Chinese military expert, Major General Xu Guangyu, told the media that the development strategy of Chinese aircraft carriers is "small steps" and will realize nuclear -powered aircraft carriers in the future.

Although China has invested heavily in strengthening the navy, there is still a certain gap compared with the United States. The U.S. military currently has ten active aircraft carriers, including the recently sailing to the Korean Peninsula. The latest generation of three "Ford -class" nuclear -powered aircraft carriers are also under construction, with a total length of 337 meters, a width of 78 meters, and a displacement of up to 100,000 tons (the corresponding data of the 001A type are 315 meters, 75 meters, and 70,000 tons).

(Voice of Germany), about half a year after the end of the "Clear Zero" government, [a new wave of new crown virus infection has appeared in China](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国新冠第二波疫情高峰预测6月底到来-二阳可怕吗/a-65719438)The number of people who have experienced the so -called "Eryang" has continued to rise in the last few weeks. According to the Beijing Municipal Health and Health Commission on Friday, the new crown infection has first ranked first in various types of infectious diseases.

Some areas have warned the school to maintain vigilance and preventive measures. Zhong Nanshan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, predicts that by the end of June, this wave of infection may reach its peak, and the number of people in the country may be as high as 65 million at the highest at the highest. He emphasized that prevention of epidemic prevention cannot be done once and for all, and this wave of infection is also expected. Zhong Nanshan estimates that the number of people infected every week is about 40 million per week.

Experts point out that between December last year and January this year, it is estimated that eight to ninety -to -ninety -to -ninety -to -nine sorters in China have undergone new crown infections, and the immunity established gradually weakened after 6 months.

Germany pointed out that Chinese officials have not announced the number of new crowns in the past winter. According to the estimates of foreign experts, the number of deaths should be around 1 million. According to media sources, the Ministry of Civil Affairs did not announce the funeral data in the fourth quarter of 2022 on Wednesday as expected. During the peak of the epidemic at the end of last year, because the number of deaths exceeded usual, the crematoriums in various places were overloaded.

After persisting in strict and zero -epidemic prevention policies that have been strictly clearing for three years, the Chinese government suddenly abandoned epidemic prevention measures such as seal control, forced isolation, and large -scale nucleic acid testing in early December last year, but did not allow medical institutions to make fully prepare preparations, resulting in leading to preparations, resulting in leading to a good cope. Medical resources are crowded when the number of infections surge.

### Expert reminds vulnerable group vaccination

However, it is estimated that a new wave of infections from mid -April will not cause chaotic scenes like winter. Nevertheless, the health department reminds the elderly and people with basic diseases to strengthen protection.

Currently popular in China is [Omikon XBB series poison strains](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新毒株xbb15传播虽快但不可怕/a-64284418)It is characterized by fast transmission and easier to break through the human body's immune barrier, but it is not much different from the disease in terms of disease. The official media quoted experts that in the winter, the group that had been infected with Omiko had been infected. If it is infected again now, the symptoms are generally easier than the first time.

### to "negative clear zero"

After relaxing the epidemic prevention policy in early December, the number of infections showed an explosive growth. According to the "Minutes of the National Health and Health Committee Meeting on December 21", in just 20 days, China has accumulated a total of 248 million infections. On December 20, about 37 million infection cases were added nationwide. Bloomberg and the Financial Times confirmed the authenticity of the Minutes of the meeting from the participants. Many Chinese people's intuitive feelings are: the people around them are Yang. The canned yellow peach is also tight.

Along with this wave of infection, people across China crazy look for drugs, snapped drugs and blood oxygen instruments. In many places in China, there is a case of cold, antipyretic drugs, and shortages, and some cities have implemented drug restrictions. This has also caused some doubts: Why did the government prepare accordingly in advance? At the same time, Paxlovid, the new crown oral special effects drugs developed by Pfizer, is difficult to find. The Indian version of the generic drugs are also hot. The familiar bridge in God staged again. "

### Medical system is full of official data completely distorted

The infected tsunami also puts tremendous pressure on the Chinese health medical system. Hospitals, patients with dying in life, exhausted medical staff, funeral home and the crematorium are arranged by long teams -such pictures are everywhere. The new crown infection and death data released by China has been completely disconnected from the real situation. According to the official figures, only a dozen people have died in the new crowns since December in early December.

### The most injured by the elderly

Many media and public articles pointed out that Chinese hospitals and clinics are full of elderly people (the picture shows Shanghai Tongren Hospital on January 3). As early as mid -December, foreign media reported that funeral parlor and crematorium in Beijing and other cities were abnormally crowded. Since mid -to -late December, many people have posted news about the death of elders at home in the social media, and even the Chinese media have reported the news that "6 days, the Republic lost 16 academicians". However, Chinese reports did not know the cause of the death of these elderly academicians. Some Netease Public Article Articles said on December 24: "9 days of 9 academicians died in 3 days. They could not hold on to medical care, let alone ordinary elderly people."

### The spread of infection from the city to the countryside

Zeng Guang, the chief scientist of the former Chinese disease control epidemiology, said at the Phoenix Finance Association at the end of December that he estimated that Beijing's infection rate may have exceeded 80%or even higher. Zhang Wenhong, director of the China National Infectious Disease Medical Center, also said at the end of December that the infection rate of this wave of epidemic in China has been very high, many large cities have exceeded 50%, and the Lunar New Year will reach 80%. The research of Shanghai Jiaotong University and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center recently made a preliminary judgment on research. This wave of new crown infection has crossed the peak before and after the New Year's Day in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou in 2023. Rural areas will usher in a peak in January. Compared with urban areas, medical resources in rural areas in China are more scarce (the picture shows a sick elderly in Ziyang, Sichuan).

### Data analysis: Infected death will reach the peak on January 23

According to British Health Information Analysis Company Airfinity in late December estimates that thousands of people in China currently die every day, and millions of people may die in the new crown (the picture shows a crematorium in Beijing on December 18). The company also predicts that the death of Chinese infection will reach its peak on January 23, 2023, and the single -day death case will rise to about 25,000. And January 23 is the second day of the Chinese New Year of the Chinese Lunar New Year.

### China announced that "0+0" countries have begun to quarantine China

Chinese officials announced on December 26 that from January 8, 2023, the detection and centralized isolation of nucleic acid testing and centralized infected infected people in China will no longer be isolated. At the same time, after the entry restrictions are relaxed, it will further optimize foreign people to come to China to arrange in China, and "orderly restore" Chinese citizens' outbound travel in the future. This has caused some countries to worry about the input of viruses from China and possible virus mutation. Japan, the United States, France (pictured) and other countries have first announced that they have implemented entry restrictions such as isolation or nucleic acid detection from entryrs from China.

[](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);)Zhong Nanshan said that inoculation of protein vaccine in the vaccine or sub -unit, plus a infection, such a "hybrid immunization" can provide a protective effect of about six months for Omikon infection. However, in the face of the mighty peak of XBB infection, he still suggested that the vulnerable groups injected new vaccines to prevent infection.

There are also criticism of criticism that since the end of the winter infection, the advancement of vaccination has been significantly weakened. At present, there are two types of vaccines specifically for XBB. The specific listing date has not been announced.

He said, "AI will develop to the point where humans do not have any jobs or lose any goals. I never agree with this idea."

When asked about the media industry, Atman pointed out that ChatGPT should be more like a 100 assistant assistant to help investigate and inspire inspiration.

ChatGPT can write articles, poetry and dialogue based on brief instructions, so it is popular at the end of last year.

Earlier this week, Atman hinted that if the European Union (EU) supervision was too severe, OpenAI could leave the European Union market, which seemed to annoy the EU.

(Voice of Germany) in recent weeks, [China and Russia have been strengthening the "unlimited" partnership](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国驻欧大使傅聪友谊无上限是一种修辞表达/a-65259688)Senior officials on both sides meet frequently in Beijing and Moscow to deepen their connections in different fields. On Friday (May 26), [Chinese Eurasian Affairs Special Envoy Li Hui arrived in Moscow to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国特使李辉访俄-欧盟吁中国促俄撤军/a-65741813)Lavrov accused Ukraine and Western countries have "seriously obstructed" Moscow and Kiev to start peaceful negotiations, and at the same time reiterated Russia's commitment to "conflict with political diplomacy." In addition, Lavrov also praised Beijing's "balance" position in the Ukrainian war.

Prior to this, Li Hui visited Europe. On Thursday, ENRIQUEMORARA, an EU senior foreign policy official, said after talks with Li Hui in Brussels that the European Union expects China to help Russia withdraw troops from Ukraine. Officials in Ukraine and Poland also expressed similar information, urging Beijing to put pressure on Russia to end the Ukrainian war.

Although China hopes to eliminate some doubts about the credibility of the Ukrainian war through Li Hui's interview, some analysts believe that Li Hui is basically cold in European countries. "When we look at the response of European countries, it is clear that Europe refuses to accept the" China Stance on Political Resolution of Ukrainian Crisis "in China.(Letters)Chinese analyst Justynaszczudlik said.

According to her, Ukraine, Poland, and the European Union sent a coordinated information to China, emphasizing that Russia is an invaders, and the international community should support Ukraine based on the peace plan proposed by Ukraine President Zeelianki. She told Germany: "From the perspective of China, Li Hui's interview was a failure, because Europeans did not regard him as a peaceful mediation person who could start certain matters."

### China -Russia strengthens security and economic relations

Although Li Hui's controversial interviews did not seem to eliminate doubts in European countries, Russia and China still tried to deepen security and economic connections when the pressure of democratic countries led by the United States.

During the meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, Michase Jing said that the relationship between Moscow and Beijing is "unprecedented high level" and is characterized by mutual respect and common response to the challenges brought about by the West pressure. Li Hui said that China is willing to cooperate with Russia and raise pragmatic cooperation in various fields to "new levels." Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Federal Security Conference, held talks with Chinese highest security official Chen Wenqing on the 22nd. Although this is a routine talks every year, experts believe that due to the deterioration of the relationship between Russia and the United States and China and the United States at the same time, this talk and other high -level bilateral exchanges between China and Russia are affected.

At the same time, it is acknowledged that it is necessary to fight against China to use economic coercion for other countries.

### In the future, Russia will be reduced to a "gas station" in China?

Corolhv told Germany: "When Russia invaded Ukraine and the need to deal with China's rise, China has the motivation to consolidate and strengthen the relationship with Russia, although this relationship is quite powerful."

Other analysts believe that democratic countries try to "bind China and Russia together". It is counterproductive because it will only lead to further closer to Beijing and Moscow. Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of international relations at the University of Barker, said: "(G7) The more the country tries to show‘ unity ’to China, the more China needs to strengthen the relationship with Russia.”

### China's "dual -track strategy" on the Ukrainian war

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, [China has been trying to show the "neutral" position in this conflict](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国的中立人设/a-61204277)Essence However, its rejection of condemning Russia's invasion has caused other countries to doubt its true position in the conflict. In February this year, China proposed the "12 -point Peace Plan" to further strengthen its "mediation" image.

Zhu Zhiqun, an expert at the University of Barker, told Germany that the relationship between China and the United States and its allies was deteriorating because of this suspicion that this suspicion was to a large extent. China is adopting a "dual -track strategy" to deal with the Ukrainian war. He said: "While consolidating the China -Russia partnership, it is trying to mediate between Russia and Ukraine."

However, Schurutrick, a Chinese analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM), said that China is in contradiction to maintain a balance between maintaining partnership with Russia and as mediationrs. "These interests conflict with each other, but China wants to achieve these goals," she told Germany.

### Interview: China is learning from the Russian and Ukraine WarKorolov at the University of New South Wales believes that although the factors of some groups are coming to appear -on the one hand, China and Russia are strategic alliances, on the other hand, the United States and their allies -but many countries are trying not to clarify any party. Alliance.

He told Germany's voice: "We see many countries in the two."

He said: "These countries do not work with Russia or China, but they are not with the West. They have a doubt about the perspective of seeing the problem. There are huge gray areas here, but the main trend is the consolidation and China of the China -Russia Alliance and China. The beauty of beauty confrontation is intensified. "

"Not long ago, Chinese President and Party Leader [Xi Jinping met with Russian Prime Minister Mi Shusi Jing](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/习近平会见俄总理-许诺支持彼此核心利益/a-65724304)And announce the strengthening of the relationship with Moscow.

His schedule in Europe was mainly listening to it. China also realized that Moscow's intention to fight is clear, and Putin's personnel publicly expressed this. "

"The integrity of Ukraine's territory still leaves a lot of question marks for China. In any case, Li Hui has not brought any new propositions of China."

Active efforts made by the crisis. " However, the original words of Berlin were Michels "welcomed China to terminate the Russian aggression war and the recent dialogue between China and Ukraine."

Sooner or later, one day, Beijing will remind everyone again on one day. "

Title "[China Diplomacy Show](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/china-sondergesandter-ukraine-europareise-1.5883304)"The article wrote," So far, China has not even explicitly stated that it has a specific understanding of maintaining the complete maintenance of Ukrainian territory, let alone Chinese senior officials or Xi Jinping will urge Russia to withdraw troops. "

"The recent consensus by Europeans is that China's primary goal is to be regarded as a big country that is regarded as a end war and restricted negative influence globally instead of really to end the war through constructive proposals. People think that China's position is too much too much After a single side, in many cases, it is consistent with the propaganda of Russia. "

"According to this interpretation, the main target of Li Hui's diplomatic operation is the global southern countries. These countries are urgent to end the war as soon as possible, even at the cost of Ukraine."

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Citizen Party is one of the most famous democratic groups in Hong Kong. After their members were crowded out of the Legislative Council or District Council and were related to the National Security Law, they were held on Saturday (May 27). The general meeting voted to decide to be clear.

The Hong Kong Citizen Party, also known as the "Large Party", was founded by professional elites (mostly from the legal community) in 2006. The goal is to promote Hong Kong's democratization and civil society.

The party is one of the last opposition groups in Hong Kong. Because of the National Security Law promulgated in 2020, political objections were announced as illegal, and Hong Kong's civil society has been forced to transfer to underground or exile overseas.

On Saturday, the Hong Kong Citizen Party held a special meeting. A total of 31 party members attended it. With 30 votes in favor of and 1 abstraction, they passed a special proposal to start the voluntary liquidation disbanding procedure. It takes about one month to complete this program.

Liang Jiajie, the last chairman of the Citizen Party, said that the Citizen Party will "disappear from the earth" after completing the procedure.

The 65 -year -old Liang Jiajie is a well -known democratic person in Hong Kong and one of the founders of the Citizen Party. When Liang Jiajie was the vice chairman of the Citizen Party, he participated in the 2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive Election. This is the only chief executive candidate who has not passed Beijing's premiere. Unsurprisingly, he lost to Zeng Yinquan, who was struggling to re -election.

Since its establishment, the Citizen Party has always hoped to become a governing force, not "just oppose". When it was most popular, the Citizen Party was the second largest group in the Hong Kong opposition camp. In 2012, it won six seats in the Hong Kong Legislative Council.

[Liang Jiajie](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访施行国安法后-香港无异于京沪/a-54080749)In the chairman's report, the Citizen Party was established in the outbreak of controversy in Hong Kong's political system. It has always been determined to defend democracy and rule of law, protect the rights and interests of Hong Kong people. Support each other in difficulties.

He said: "Even in the past 16 years, even if it did not reach its peak, the Citizen Party has taken the way to the right and comes to the end of this Democratic party."

In 2019's "Counterfeit" Movement, the Citizen Party plays an important role. With the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law in 2020, the Citizenship's Legislative Council or District Councilor members were either retired from the party or they were seized or resigned to show dissatisfaction.

The Hong Kong Democratic School issued an unofficial "Legislative Council Primary Election" in 2020. Subsequently, 47 participants, including 4 Citizen Party members, were charged with "conspiracy to subvert the state power."

ALBERT LAI, one of the founding members of the Citizen Party, told AFP that the party's dissolution "can be considered a symbol of the end of the Hong Kong's local democratic movement." "But failure does not mean that this movement is meaningless."

Li Guangde said: "In the process, many people were mobilized and accumulated a lot of social capital, which is meaningful to the next chapter of Hong Kong history."

Liang Jiajie said that from history, it can be seen that the world has become impermanent, "I hope that Hong Kong people are living with optimistic and living, looking forward to tomorrow."

The Citizen Party, one of the most famous democratic groups in Hong Kong, voted on Saturday and decided to dissolve. After the Hong Kong authorities suppressed the party and threatened the arrest of members of the party, the party could not select a leader.

According to Agence France -Presse reports on the 27th, the Hong Kong Citizen Party is known as the "Lawyer Party" because many founders of the party work in the legal community. The party was founded in 2006 to promote the democratization process in Hong Kong.

According to Liang Jiajie, the current chairman of the Citizen Party, "The Citizen Party will disappear from the earth after all procedures are completed." Liang Jiajie is one of the party's founders and a famous figure in the United Kingdom to return Hong Kong to China since 1997.

In 2007, Liang Jiajie was the first and the only candidate for the Hong Kong Chief Executive's position without being supported by Beijing. Unsurprisingly, he was defeated in the election. But his political party has been committed to becoming a "governance" power since then, not just the opposition.

When it was most popular, the Citizen Party ranked second among the oppositions in Hong Kong and won six seats in the 2012 Legislative Council election.

In recent years, the opposition in Hong Kong has been hit by the National Security Law and the reform of the election system implemented by China. These reforms have greatly excluded democracy outside local politics.

China implemented the National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2020, and many members of the Citizens Party were arrested, including former Legislative Councilor Yang Weiwen and Tan Jerry. Yang and Tan were detained for more than two years in the national security cases and were rejected by bail, while another senior member Margaret Wu(Margaret of)The crime of being sentenced to illegal assembly was established. Others fled abroad.

Comprehensive foreign news reports, the Portugal Cyber Security Commission (CSSC) recently issued a resolution, which will make the government more likely to formally ban telecommunications operators from using Chinese equipment on high -speed 5G mobile networks and 4G platforms.

According to Reuters, the Portuguese Cyberspace Commission is the consulting agency of the Prime Minister. This resolution document will cause another blow to the Chinese technology giant Huawei, Huawei, to enter the Portuguese 5G (5th -generation Action Communication Technology) market and the efforts of possible renewal.

According to the law passed in August last year, the Portuguese government can decide "exclusion, restricting use or discontinuation of equipment or services (telecommunications companies) equipment or services", and formulate conditions and final deadlines that operators must observe.

Portugal's major telecommunications operators Altice, NOS, and Vodafone have stated that because Europe and the United States worry that China's participation in key infrastructure may endanger security, they will not use Huawei devices in 5G core networks. The Chinese government and Huawei denied such claims.

Huawei stated in the statement that the company "did not know in advance and has not been consulted in this matter." The company is still collecting information used for evaluation, hoping to continue to serve Portuguese customers.

Russia ’s Saturday (May 27) refuted US President Biden Criticive Moscow's plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Beros, saying that Washington has deployed this nuclear weapon in Europe for decades, and said that the United States can reflect on others before accusing others.

Reuters reported that Russia said on Thursday (25th) that it is promoting the first deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in overseas since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991; President Berlos Lukashenko said that these weapons have been moving.

Bayeng said on Friday (26th) that he expressed his "extremely disappointed" plan to promote Russia's promotion of tactical nuclear weapons in Beros. The US State Department condemned Russia's nuclear deployment plan.

The Russian Embassy in the United States issued a statement on Saturday: "In the large -scale hybrid war we launched in Washington, we can ensure that our safety is the sovereignty of Russia and White Ross with the means we think. The legal obligations are exactly the same. "

The United States said that due to the remarks of Russian President Putin during the conflict of Ukraine, the world faces the worst nuclear danger since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, but Moscow claims its position. Putin said the Ukrainian war as the survival of Russia against Western invaders. He warned many times that Russia owned more nuclear weapons than any other country, and would use all means to defend himself.

Tactical nuclear weapons are used in tactical income on the battlefield, which is usually smaller than that aimed at destroying strategic nuclear weapons in the United States, Europe or Russia.

The Russian Embassy said that the United States' criticism of Moscow's planning deployment was hypocritical and said that "Washington can be reflected before accusing others." "For decades, the United States has maintained a huge nuclear weapon library in Europe. It has participated in the nuclear sharing arrangements with NATO allies and trained for the use of nuclear weapons in my country."

German government sources said that at the request of Russia, hundreds of German civil servants working in the education and cultural department need to leave Russia.

AFP quoted Saturday (May 27) that the Russian authorities decided to force Germany to cut diplomats and public institutions such as Cultural Organization of Goethe College and Moscow German schools before June.

Before Moscow invaded Ukraine, Germany was a close economic partner of Russia, but since then, it was far from Moscow and supported Kiev in conflicts in finance and military. According to the German security department, since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, Russia's spy in Germany has grown at a rare rate in recent years.

In mid -April, Germany expelled some Russian diplomats on the grounds of "reducing the existence of intelligence departments"; Russia expelled about 20 German embassy staff to show revenge.

In 2022, Germany expelled about 40 Russian diplomats who were considered to threaten security. In October last year, Arneschoenbohm, the head of the German network security agency, was fired because news reports show that he is closely related to a network security consulting company that he believes in a Russian intelligence department. One month later, a German reserve officer was sentenced to one year and nine months for spy for spy activities for Russia.

The Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kishida intends to cooperate with the UN General Assembly held in New York, USA in late September to hold a "friendly national meeting" that is necessary to open negotiations on the "Convention on the Production of nuclear weapons fission materials" (FMCT).

The Kyodo News Agency quoted the Japanese government sources on Saturday (May 27) that Kishida Wension would call on the heads of the country and ministerial officials to attend the meeting. The meeting aims to expressed concerns about the movement of China's construction of fast -to -neutron proliferation reactors, and emphasizes the importance of nuclear disarmament.

In view of the fact that the nuclear -supported countries including the United States, Britain and France, confirmed that they would participate in the "Nuclear Warless World" at the Summit of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7 Hiroshima Summit), Kishida hopes to take the friendly national conference as a specific step towards the nuclear discharge diplomacy.

FMCT is a treaty for the production of weapons. The G7 leader "Hiroshima Vision" through the summit's nuclear disarmament document "Hiroshima Vision" was strongly called to immediately open the treaty negotiations to all countries, and concentrated political attention to the FMCT in order to prevent the nuclear arms reserve competition again.

Kishida also confirmed the importance of opening the FMCT negotiation immediately with the G7 members of the Nuclear Nuclear State India.

According to relevant sources, friendly national conferences will gather countries that agree with FMCT and confirm the importance of startup negotiations. Before the negotiations reached a compromise, Kishida called on the international community to announce the suspension of the production of nuclear weapon fission materials.

McCarthy, Speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States, said on Saturday (May 27) that he and Democratic President Biden made a "progress" on the negotiations on raising the upper limit of the federal government debt.

The US Treasury Department said on Friday (26th) that if there is no Capitol's actions, the government will have a shortage of funds on June 5 and cannot pay all the bills. [U.S. Finance Minister Yellen on Friday to give a letter to Congress](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230527-1398613)Unless Congress agrees to increase the debt limit of US $ 3.1.4 trillion (about $ 42.4 trillion), the government will exhaust its funds by June 5, which will trigger a potentially disaster debt defaults.

Any principle agreement reached between Biden and McCarthy will open a one -week legislative process, and the process will be carried out through a severe division of parliament.

McCarthy told reporters: "We have not reached an agreement. We have not reached that step. We did make progress and we work until today. And we start working again now."

The hardliners Republicans threatened that they should prevent any bills that do not meet their expectations, including significant reduction of expenses. Democrats threatened to refuse some compromises proposed, especially the new work requirements on the Federal anti -poverty plan.
