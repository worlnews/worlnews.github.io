<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/1-06292023112824.html">Yelun's visit to China to re -establish contact with Beijing</a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/1-06222023113800.html"><strong> Minister of McGrady Yellen: Maintaining Maintenance is very critical </strong></a>The website and official media of the Chinese Ministry of Finance posted news on Monday that after the agreed of both parties in China and the United States, the Minister of Finance, Jennite Yellen, will visit China from July 6th to 9th. Last Friday, Zhu Min, former vice president of the People's Bank of China and former vice president of the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview with the Global Times and other media. The revocation of the "301" investigation and sorting out the first phase of the Sino -US economic and trade agreement will be a topic that the two parties need to focus on discussing. Zhu Min also said that the current tariffs on American commodities in China are 7.1%, and the tariffs on the export of goods to the United States are 19.2%, which is unequal.</p>
<p>Ma Ju, a senior commentator in the United States, said in an interview with Liberty Asia on Monday that Bayeng has continued its former government's tariff policy to China after taking office. China believes that the United States should cancel high tariffs on China. He said: "In fact, tariffs on China have become part of the US national security strategy. Although Yellen visits China as a financial minister, he hopes to establish economic connection with China, alleviate political tensions, etc. In particular In the case of the Ministry. But I believe that the US government, especially the White House and the US Trade Representative Office, and the Ministry of Commerce have their own considerations. "</p>
<p>Ma Ju believes that Yellen will also pay attention to the trend of the RMB exchange rate and the business behavior that affects the interests of the United States. After Yellen visit China, the United States will be unlikely to cancel tariffs on China and Canada. Therefore, Yellen's visit to China is difficult to make breakthroughs in the economic and trade field.</p>

China pays attention to US tariffs </strong></p>
<p>This is the first time in the United States to visit China in recent years, and Yellen is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Senior officials of the US Treasury officials said on Sunday (2nd) that Yellen would talk to senior officials of the Communist Party of China on a series of extensive issues, including Washington's concerns about the Chinese version of the Anti -Spy Law.</p>
<p>Wu Qiang, a political commentator from Beijing, believes that from a technical perspective, Yellen's visit to China is a number of commitments reached by the first China dollar in the Bali Summit. Following the US Secretary of State Brosky, Yellen visited Beijing to communicate with Chinese officials in terms of finance and economy and trade, which became logical. This marks the normalization of Sino -US exchanges in the second half of the year. He said to this station: "Secondly, as Zhu Min said, Yellen visited China, China will talk about the revocation of high tariffs on China and investigation of '301', and there are some other technical issues."</p>
<p>Zhu Min also mentioned his evaluation of "de -risk" in an interview. He believes that the United States is aware that "decoupling" with China is difficult to achieve, so it has begun to emphasize "de -risk". "But 'de -risk' is a vague and dangerous concept. Its biggest problem is that it cannot tell where the border is." Zhu Min believes that "de -risk" is dependence and will eventually become "anti -globalization".</p>
<p><strong> China's desire to "de -risk" exchanges will welcome </strong> **</p>
<p>In this regard, Wu Qiang said: "China's exchanges with this' de -risk" itself is an attitude of refusing to return. All related policies in China can not refuse the communication under the "phoenix danger" policy. This is A huge contradiction in China's US policy. This is reflected in Yellen and Brinken's visit to China. "</p>
<p>Current affairs commentators Cai Shenkun believes that this time Yellen's visit to China is the continuation and adjustment of the Bayeng government to ease the policy of China: "Not long ago, Brinken visited China and expressed the continued to maintain the friendship between the United States and China. There are competition, but it is not opposed to each other or decoupled from the two countries. Yellen's visit to China is mainly to conduct some in -depth discussions on economic, trade, finance, etc. This can alleviate the confrontation between China and the United States. "</p>
<p>During the past three years, the United States and China have been tit -for -tat in terms of epidemic traceability, human rights, and the situation in the South China Sea, and Taiwan issues. Cai Shenkun said that Biden intends to restore the normal diplomatic relations with China, but China has repeatedly rejected. Broskere has recently visited China to reach a number of consensus with Beijing, but it is difficult to return to the past.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Yellen once said in an interview that benign competition is good for companies and workers in the United States and Chinese.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-03T04-28-49-00-00/000124252_piclink.jpg" />On June 28, the National People's Congress of China passed the "Law of the People's Republic of China", which passed the macro specifications and guides China's diplomatic work, and fully implemented on July 1st, which became the focus of the attention of international media last week. The international media pays attention to the confrontation of this law, that is, China takes this law based on this law and adopts the "countermeasures" and "restrictions" operations on the sanctions and threats of Western countries; The Chinese leaders have entered several iconic foreign policy initiatives of global security, global development and global civilization, and reiterated China's position against "hegemonism and power politics".</p>
<p>The author believes that Chinese diplomacy often considers policies rather than laws, or policies are more important than law. The significant difference between policies and laws is: the law strictly emphasizes the law without compromising; the policy is flexible, but once a decision is made, it often only focuses on the law and even the program. Therefore, this "Foreign Relations Law" may prevent prevention and deterrence of the West, but in a certain period of time, Sino -foreign relations may also be more nervous. These two consequences may exist at the same time.</p>

The photo shooting location is Liverpool Street Station in London, England. For more than 80 years, the identity of these three girls has been a mystery. Until recently, the mystery finally revealed. </strong></p>
<p>Inge Adamecz in the middle of the photo is unknown to the shooting, and it has not even known its existence for decades. At that time, the 5 -year -old girl, together with her ten -year -old sister Ruthadamecz, escaped their home in Breslau, Germany, now the home of Wroclaw, Polish.</p>
<p>Their mother and younger girl stayed in their hometown, and later died tragicly at the Oswelin concentration camp.</p>

<p>The first British newspaper appeared in the 1939 British newspapers.</p>
<p>In the book "Never Again" by historian Martin Gilbert, Ing accidentally discovered this photo of his childhood.</p>
<p>English said, "That's really a big surprise."</p>
<p>"He only wrote" 3 little girls "in the book. So I wrote a letter to him and told him that we were still alive. At that time, people said that I looked like a child star Xiulan Deng Poor. Why am I in the photo? What about laughing? "</p>
<p>"Look at the sister Luz in the photo, her expression is very tight. But I don't know who the third girl with the doll is. I never know who she is!"</p>
<p>In fact, the girl holding the doll was 10 -year -old Hannacohn. She and her twin brothers Hans (later renamed Gerald) from Halle in Germany and other girls withdraw from other girls. train. You can also see the legs of the little Hans on the original film.</p>
<p>However, just like Ing and Ruth, Hannah has no memory of the photos, but she remembers the journey and doll holding in her hands. However, she died in 2018 and talked about her experience in an interview with the University of London during her lifetime. Hannah said: "I remember that after the Netherlands, there were kind ladies on the car gave us biscuits and lemon soda."</p>
<p>"We arrived at Liverpool Station from Harwei's train. I was a person who followed the rules. At that time, my seats were all cushions, not wooden seats. I was worried that I might sit in the first class."</p>

<p>"Liverpool Street Station sounds like Liverpool, another British city. I was still worried that it was not going to London. However, we finally arrived at this station with a huge hall. I grabbed a doll named Iflin."</p>
<p>Hannah's twin daughters Debbie and Helen told BBC that their mother was always curious about the identity of the other two girls in the photo. Debbie said: "When we saw this photo, she sat there, braids, and hugged the doll. Mother always said during her lifetime: I want to know who the other two girls are?"</p>
<p>Then, in January this year, more than 80 years after the photo was taken, her daughters discovered the truth after hearing a BBC broadcast show series by accident.</p>

<p>"We were so excited. I sent a text message to Debie, and I said," We found these two girls!"</p>
<p>Later, in April this year, Ing finally met with Hannah's daughters at the London Empire Museum. This photo has been displayed in the museum for more than 20 years. Now, people can now understand the things behind two families and photos.</p>

<p>However, who is the photographer?</p>
<p>We learned from the records of Getty Images Hulton archives that the photographer's name was Stephenson, who had worked in Topical Pressagence. The agency hired more than 1,000 photographers at the time to provide a lot of pictures for the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>The work record of the photographer retains the date of July 5, 1939. It is clearly marked with "3 children waiting for Liverpool Street Station Station", and marked the photographer's name Stephenon.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>John F Stevenson may be photo shooters.</p>
<p>We cannot be sure, but it may be a Scottish named John Festevenson, who is famous for his song "Dear Glasgow's Old Town" with his people. In the 1930s, Topical Pressagence recorded a contact information for his address in Glasgow.</p>
<p>With the help of the Scottish Public Archives Office, the BBC found his family through the address on birth and death.</p>
<p>His reporter's grandson Gordonestevenson (Gordonestevenson) had some memory of Grandpa's work in London as a free reporter in the late 1930s. "I remember he told me that his job was to interview these homeless children and provided them with benefits. He told me that he took a lot of such photos."</p>
<p>Although this photo has become so important, we still don't know. However, the identity mystery of the three girls and photographers was finally solved. And the story of their brave survivors, as witnesses of the Nazi Massacre, and brave survivors, will always spread to the world.</p>

Sun Junhao made every effort. "</p>
<p>"I don't know how Sun Junhao's spirit and physical condition are now. We can only pray. I hope he can know that we can help him behind him," Klinsmann said after the list was announced.</p>

<p>(Dragon, eagle controversy)</p>
<p>Long Yan sees that my diplomacy is trapped now, and the economy is going down. There is one thing. Hey, you can never compare!</p>
<p>The eagle of more than one billion honest and obedient people!</p>
<p>Look at it, you will answer it</p>
<p>Eagle -defense people first, the world's highest pressure. People are not "obedient" and they are strange!</p>
<p>Dragon is really not. The dragon family wisdom, the light is not possible, it is still sparse!</p>
<p>Eagle head back to hear</p>
<p>Long let you see your knowledge: This sparse is the most proud of the people of our Long family, preventing class solidification, and the reassurance of the grassroots people -imperial examinations!</p>
<p>Eagle?</p>
<p>Dragon is wrong, it's the college entrance examination!</p>
<p>Eagle is indeed, the Dragon family who comes to us, that is, the issue of college can hold a group</p>
<p>Is Long? Is it the real ancestor of our Long family: the prince will have a kind of one!</p>
<p>Where is the eagle? Someone really believes that can be admitted to your Party Central Committee all the way?</p>
<p>Dragon, you don't understand, we must let go of this caliber. The book has its own golden house -to convince the people, as long as there is a pen, everything will be available!</p>
<p>Is someone believed in the eagle?</p>
<p>Dragon Xin!Trust the pen is useful, and they will forget that we still have guns in our hands!</p>
<p>(<em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06072023040907.html">Https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06072023040907.html</a></em>)</p>
<p>The more unequal the eagle, the more you need to "carp to jump the dragon door" anesthesia!</p>
<p>Dragon is right!</p>
<p>Even if the eagle does not make a class transition, it is purely to make money, and the confidence in the college entrance examination is in the avalanche -graduation employment situation for one year. The number of college entrance examinations in first -tier cities has declined year by year. "The people are not stupid. Are you not afraid that people will not play with you someday?</p>
<p>"(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/jw2-06062023132743.html)_)</p>

<p>Of course, the dragon people are not stupid. Squeezing your head to college, do you think you can find a high salary job if you do n’t enter the system for learning knowledge and hone your skills?</p>
<p>Eagle is right, otherwise?</p>
<p>Dragon Haha, it's too naive. What is the mystery of our Long family reform and opening up for thirty years?</p>
<p>Eagle common people obedient</p>
<p>Dragon is right!We have carefully maintained the low human rights advantage of 30 years, that is, to allow you to be a low -end population except for the college entrance examination. Drink again, and arrange it clearly!</p>
<p>I have a long -sighted eagle. It turns out that most people have worked hard to enter the hometown, not to enter heaven, but more to escape from hell!</p>
<p>Dragon, you finally touched it!</p>
<p>Eagle's graduates who can't learn both skills and work, but also lose confidence in the family. Isn't it going to break your leek training plan?</p>
<p>Long is better than four years in advance, right? It can be dragged for four years, and it is drunk today!</p>
<p>Eagle is really "one college entrance examination and one dream"!</p>

In June this year, she published her latest Chinese novel "Miradi" through a publishing agency established in Berlin, Germany. This reporter Wang Yun interviewed Yan Geling on this. The following is the content of the interview.</p>

<p><strong> Diseases </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Mr. Yan, hello!From the perspective of the content, this novel seems to be that the girl Miradi became a young writer after transferring to the industry in the 1980s. Some encounters at that time, and after the summer of 1989, after going abroad, freedom was free after going abroad. Creative experience. This process seems to be divided into the early summer of 1989. What is the intention of novels to do this arrangement?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: You can also see that the content of the novel is closer to my experience and timetable, so you can say that it is closer to my autobiography, but in fact it is also fictional. I used my experience in the 1980s. From 79 to 89, I also included the old generation of artists and intellectuals I met to lay out and structure the story. I left China in the fall of 1989, and I followed my footsteps to write this novel.</p>
<p>Reporter: Do you have any backgrounds if you left China in the fall of 1989? We all know that the Tiananmen Study Games and the "June 4th" incident occurred in early summer of 1989.</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Yes, after June 4th, I feel particularly disappointed and distressed, and there is a huge sense of disillusionment. At that time, I went out because of an invitation of the United States. I went to a university in Buffalo, called the State University of New York State University, to attend the 20th Century Military Literature Symposium. Before that, I had been to several writing centers in the United States, so I was very envious of the creative atmosphere of American young writers. I also went to the most elite young writer writing center in the United States. Go to see their discussions and participate in their courses. At that time, I wouldn't know English, but my translation told me that they were criticizing each other's works. I am very envious of that freedom to be able to criticize and discuss my works so fiercely. In fact, since then I have been determined to come to the United States to study.</p>
<p>Reporter: You say that you feel a huge disillusionment before leaving. What does it mean?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Of course, it refers to the Tiananmen incident. In Tiananmen, such a generation of young writers in Tiananmen felt very, very shocking and distressed. In fact, it was not in Tiananmen, but from my unit, Yuquan Road to Tiananmen, there was a wooden land in the middle, because my unit was a railway soldier, and later changed to the railway engineering headquarters. That road happened to be the road that soldiers entered the city. So I feel very disillusioned.</p>
<p>Reporter: What is the disillusionment?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: In the 1980s, we thought we could create and express freely like American writers or Western writers. At that time, we found that it was impossible to make me feel like ten years. A sense of the Chinese dream.</p>

<p>Reporter: In the past ten years, you came out of the military literary group. In this military career, you have also been displayed in previous works such as "Fanghua". For your creation, is it more mainly a familiar material, or is there a certain complex?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: I still have a certain youth plot. As a soldier, I am a soldier very young, so my ideology formation, as well as a period of life in adulthood, is in the army. So that life was unforgettable, and it also formed my own personality. For example, very self -discipline and very strong will, these are inseparable from my experience in the army.</p>
<p>Reporter: I have watched the movie "Fanghua", which is a very touching movie. In fact, it is a very huge tragedy. In these works, I am thinking about a problem. Can this military career be regarded as the starting point of your literature, or is it the hometown of your personal literature?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Yes, the military career is to me. Because I do n’t live as a student like a normal child, and then I live step by step, I have exposed to different cultures very early. For example, Tibet and Yi people are two big nations. Our tour is often in Tibet, in Daliangshan area. So I opened my vision from different cultures very early.</p>
<p>Reporter: But have this military career restricted your later creation?Reporter: Back to this novel, you also mentioned that this is a novel similar to an autobiography. Why do you arrange and publish it at this time? Why not before?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: I actually wanted to write this novel. I want to write a novel that has no specific central drama plot. Therefore, this novel is scattered, especially characters. It is not like "Ninth Widow", "Fusang", or "Fanghua", "Auntie Duo Crane" and other novels. These novels have a center. Drama nuclear, there is a center of drama incident, which is developed around this drama nucleus. So the story of this novel is relatively scattered.</p>
<p>Reporter: The novel actually wrote around the 1980s ...</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Yes, it is the awakening and disillusionment of the 1980s.</p>
<p><strong> The intellectuals who sleep collectively </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: One of them is particularly meaningful to the present, that is, especially the phenomenon of intellectual groups after 1989, the phenomenon of sleeping collectively. What do you do based on the so -called "sleeping collective" here?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Yes, you see this very sensitive. This is actually an expression of metaphor. The excitement at the beginning was like the feeling of waking up, but later it was found that it was still the same, and then it was disillusioned, that is, the feeling of sleeping back.</p>
<p>Reporter: Can you mention some specific phenomena you observed?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: My friends and friends of my writers. When we were young, our friends who played literature were the same, each of which was the same, each of which was very, very vulgar. In the 1980s, we believed in truth and thought it was taken for granted.(If you want to take it for granted, we will have more freedom to write, express and think about)I think it must be a wider and broad possibility, and the possibility seems to be infinite, especially when I first first came into contact with the works of the United States. There are not many works in my father's house in the United States, most of which are Russia and France. But suddenly, I felt like a dream, and I didn't know if I woke up or in the dream. That ten years were the feeling. Now when we talk about it, we still feel that in the 1980s, compared with now, how beautiful at that time.</p>
<p>Reporter: You have come into contact with many intellectuals in the literary and artistic circles of mainland China. Do you think they are really asleep, or a camouflage, that is, there are many, many of them want to express?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Yes, I think most people are pretending to sleep. There is a saying that you will never call people who do n’t wake up to sleep? Many people are like this. In this case, everyone is not saying, and many things can actually be released. Many themes cannot be involved, and now it has become, and it is not possible to mention drugs in the work.</p>
<p>Reporter: Do you describe this kind of collective sleeping phenomenon, do you want to express a tragedy?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Of course, this is very sad. Because many of my novels are exploring the theme of freedom. For example, "Lu Qian Zhi" wrote a political prisoner who was locked up. The theme of freedom is such a theme that I have been playing, repeatedly in questioning and speculating. Some phenomena of the West now also remind me of the word freedom. Not all freedom is beneficial, and some freedom hurts others. "Miraci" is also a theme of freedom. "Lu Qian Zhi" is also about this theme. "Ninth Widow" is also. An old landlord was detained in the cellar and lost freedom, but he later refused to come out. He felt that he had gained freedom. This freedom was he gave himself. There are people like Fuso. A prostitute like Fusang actually had a freedom in her heart. It was not given to her, but this kind of freedom she had, so she refused to be saved. I don't know if you have watched "Fusang", and I am very fierce about freedom in it.</p>
<p><strong> Freedom is an important theme </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: You have a lot of experience in the United States, and China is your hometown, and you are now in Germany. We know that there is a big difference between Chinese and Western in the word freedom. Because the root of freedom is only in Western culture. In Eastern culture, there is no root of freedom. Therefore, it seems that in this issue, there are differences between China and the West. In your years of multinational experience, in the process of writing for many years, do you think that the understanding of freedom of Chinese or Chinese culture is very different from the West?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: What we are talking about now is freedom of thought and expressing freedom, that is, to express the results of your free thinking freely, use unrestrained, unrestrained, and unsatisfactory ways. What we call is this, not the words of freedom abstractly. Intellectuals, including writers and artists, we are all about freedom on such a context.</p>
<p>Reporter: Back to the theme of the 1980s, it is very important for you in the 1980s. And some of today's words, regardless of the text, or in social sciences or humanities, people still seem to be looking back in the 1980s. What kind of psychology is this looking back?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: It was a kind of nostalgia, because at that time a lot of books and many subjects could not be involved now. Including the initial scar literature's reflection and criticism of the Cultural Revolution, the understanding of human nature, and the performance and analysis of human nature in the Cultural Revolution, they are now unable to touch. Therefore, we miss the degree of freedom at that time.</p>
<p>Reporter: In terms of literature, many of the most important writers in the Chinese literary circles today are from the 1980s. Many of their works readers are familiar with it. What important impact do you think it has left the contemporary Chinese literature community in the 1980s. ?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Of course, some of the writers who came out at that time were still a front -line writer. Because of that era, suddenly many things and themes, the subject matter of many large society and individuals can be exposed to, especially after the establishment of the People's Republic of China Show. Our generation of writers are not entirely concerned about personal hearts. We pay attention to individuals and nations, and we are connected to think and express. Later, these writers may pay more attention to personal and personal life. Our generation of writers are not like this.</p>
<p><strong> Worried about self -waste martial arts </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Your work is writing Chinese in an open and free environment. Can you compare your writing and writers who write in China? Such as Wang Anyi and others. Do you feel that your topic and strokes will be more free and unlimited?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: If it is published in China, it is the same because it is through the same review system. Some magazines are slightly larger, and some are slightly smaller. Some publishing houses have a bit of responsibility, and some lack a little bit. It's just such a difference. However, the review system is completely the same system. For example, the book division below the Propaganda Department is responsible for reviewing and reviewing books. They hold the book number in their hands. So why did I decide not to play at once and not play with them. I just afraid that this system will slowly and gradually form a censorship habit in the subconscious. This kind of subconscious I am forming such subconscious. This is the most obstructive of his creative power for a writer. This hurts his original power. Therefore, I don't want anyone to review me anyway.</p>
<p>Reporter: You have published works in China for a long time before. In the process, do you have self -examination and self -castration?Reporter: This novel is published only outside China many years later. You also said just now. Many people say that this novel is very different from before. Is this different because you can express it yourself in a completely free and open environment?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: There are all aspects. First, this is a diverse, not a central incident. It mainly writes such a set of images. She string them up through Miraci. Her father, mother and uncle, and also There are comrades and others. There are still different things, it is really brave.</p>
<p>Reporter: Can you tell a detail to explain that some text or expression is that you were absolutely impossible in China?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: Including what you mentioned just now, I woke up, and went back one by one, in the new century. I wrote that they died on their bodies. I wrote that Miradi's father and uncle, one by one, left like this.</p>
<p>Reporter: The last small question, why is the protagonist of the novel "Miraci"? Is there any specific meaning?</p>
<p>Yan Geling: The book mentioned at the beginning that her father was a amateur violinist, so she gave her three notes, Miradi.</p>
<p>Reporter: Thank you for accepting my interview.</p>

Slowly, when we grow up, we can talk about the college entrance examination lightly. Its impact on our personal life is slowly fading, but the traces left seem to be engraved in our bones.</p>
<p>Recently, I chatted with my friends. Everyone said with a smile that the college entrance examination was thrown away the wrong question set, but they could not throw the "wrong question syndrome". <strong> The long -term education model has formed a deep -rooted "wrong" thinking </strong>. "Staring and collecting your own mistakes, I always feel that my life is not good enough. It is also easy to see the shortcomings and tolerate the flaws when you look at people close to you. "</p>

The two litigation departments were mentioned by the non -profit organization "Student Fair Admission Alliance". Among the decisions of most factions, the six conservative judges of the Supreme Court believe that the Affirmative Action (Affirmative Affirmative Action "in the school's enrollment plan violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution. This means that more than 60 years of historical equal rights have been legally abolished.</p>

<p>IAEA pointed out that IAEA had previously verified the security of Japan intentionally intending to dilute the dilution of the "nuclear waste water" into the sea. Today, the report announced that Japan's emission countermeasures meet international security standards.</p>
<p>The report added: "Controlled and gradually discharged the water after processing to the sea ..., the radioactivity effect on humans and the environment can be ignored."</p>
<p>Because the discharge into the sea is based on international standards in terms of security, it means that the Japanese government's preparations to start discharge into the sea this summer will also enter the final stage.</p>
<p>Fukushima First Nuclear Power Plant occurred after a nuclear accident after a tsunami invasion of the 311 earthquake in 2011. The pollutant water generated during the melting nuclear fuel stick in the furnace in the furnace was continuously removed. , It is called "nuclear waste water" (including 氚 wastewater, that is, ALPS processing water).</p>
<p>The nuclear accident caused by this is the worst since the Chernobyl incident. The cleanup work lasted for more than ten years. Most of them were announced by the region that were announced by radiation, and it has now been reopen.</p>

<p>The Thai far party accidentally won in the election held in May this year, which shocked the Thai governing authorities and believed that this was a threat to the status quo of the country and the monarchy. Some senators have announced their opposition to the party leader Pita Linklingla(Pitimimaroenrat)The latter is a 42 -year -old entrepreneur graduated from Harvard University.</p>
<p>The election results show that the progress of the advanced party's progress has caused the public to be tired of the current military rule of Thailand's current Prime Minister Ba Yushang for 9 years. As the commander of the Army, Bayu seized power in the coup in 2014 and re -served as the Prime Minister after the 2019 election.</p>
<p>However, the reasons for many voters to be welcomed by many voters shocked those conservatives of the monarchy.</p>
<p>The party promised to reform many powerful institutions, including the monarchy and the army, and these institutions retained power and influence according to the written constitution during the period of Pakistan.</p>
<h4>political transformation?</h4>
<p>The ideological threat from far away from the party is obvious. However, one of the current unpredictable issues is the tension between the party and its largest partner "for the Thai party".</p>
<p>There is a controversy of who has been in the party and the Thai party who has been as the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Thai Research Scholar at Wisconsin University Thai Hibberkon said, "The location of the Speaker of the House of Commons is very important because it will determine the agenda of the parliament and then determine the degree of political transformation."</p>
<p>The two parties announced a compromise after the 3rd meeting. The alliance will nominate Wan Muhamano Ma, a senior leader from the Thai National Party (Prachachat)(And that Mohamed Normaha)As the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the far -end party and the Thai party will appoint one vice chairman.</p>
<p>Pitta said that this decision was to strengthen the unity between the alliance alliances to support him for the Prime Minister. Pitta needs 376 votes to get this position. He currently has 312 votes, so he also needs to get 64 votes from hostile political parties or conservatives appointed by military rule.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-04T01-30-34/image-1688433855.jpg" />Thailand's far -entered party and allies reached an agreement on the joint program(Peninsula TV Station)</p>
<h4>Active</h4>
<p>Atlagak Satanura, a professor of historiography at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, said that the obvious distrust between the two parties may be the biggest threat to the Pita campaign prime minister.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that it is related to face, and the leaders of the Thai party cannot make people feel that they have made too much concession to their partners.</p>
<p>Atlak pointed out that "the members of the Thai party believe that it was once a heavyweight party that has won many elections, and it has the ability to become the agenda maker." The position of the House of Commons was divided into a share of the Thai party.</p>
<p>However, Atachack also pointed out that if the Thai party failed to show an unbreakable connection with the far away party, it would "weaken the power of this alliance that claims to be democratic groups" and will let the House of House of House ofhere Members and conservative allies "have more reasons not to choose Pitta."</p>
<p>In addition to the problems between the party and the House of Lords and the Thai party, people also seriously worry that Pitta and its political parties will be hindered by legal challenges -the same fate has caused the collapse of political parties that have conflicted with conservative establishments.</p>
<p>On July 3, local time, the king of Thailand Maha Kajiralon was accompanied by the queen Su Tida to attend the meeting, and reminded the members of the white uniform at the scene to keep in mind the mission of "representing the Thai people".</p>
<p>The king emphasized in the short speeches of prepared, "the progress of the country depends on your wisdom and loyalty." "If everyone can recognize this, then work will succeed smoothly."</p>

<h3>Sino -Russian relations are becoming increasingly close</h3>

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, Russia has been isolated and sanctioned by Europe and the United States, which is closer to China's strategic partnership.

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>The initial ally</h3>
<p>On the second day of the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the Soviet Union became the first country to establish diplomatic relations with China. At the end of the year, Mao Zedong went to Moscow to visit and stayed in the Soviet Union for more than two months to participate in the 70 -year -old Japanese celebration life movement (picture). After the incident, Mao Zedong complained that he was not well made by Stalin and the progress of the signing talks was not smooth. On February 14, 1950, Mao Zedong signed the "Sino -Soviet Friendship Alliance Mutual Aid Treaty" in Moscow, and the two countries and the Soviet Union were ally.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>"Big Brother" in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>From the 1950s to the early 1960s, it was regarded by the outside world as the "honeymoon period" that the outside world was regarded as Sino -Soviet relations. The two sides signed a series of agreements. The Soviet Union provided China, supplies, and personnel from trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry. Aid to help China build a complete industrial system. The first "five -year plan" formulated by the Chinese government in 1953 was introduced by the help and planning of the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong emphasized that he would learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects, "the Soviet Communist Party is our best gentleman." The picture shows a report from the 6th anniversary of the Sino -Soviet Friendship Treaty in 1956.</p>

<h3>From reverse to break to break</h3>
<p>In September 1959, the Soviet leader Khrushchev visited China (pictured) to participate in the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. At that time, the contradictions of the differences between the Chinese and Soviet leaders in the political concept and the strategic interests had emerged. In 1960, Moscow recovered all the Soviet experts that recovered China to abolish various agreements for economic and technological cooperation between the two countries. Beijing has carried out long -term sharp criticism of the Soviet Union's "revisionism" and the foreign policy of the CPSU.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>Border conflict</h3>
<p>China and the Soviet Union are the two neighbors in the world with the longest land border. In 1964, the first round of border negotiations in China and the Soviet Union failed. On June 3, 1969, the Chinese and Soviet troops broke out in the Treasure Island of the Uranus River in the Jiehe River (the picture shows the Chinese defense of the Treasure Island), and both sides have casualties. In the same year, the two countries conflict again on Basai Island, Heilongjiang and Tielekti, Xinjiang. In September, the Chairman of the Soviet Minister's Meeting, Koshin, took the road to Beijing and met with Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai for 3 hours at the airport to achieve a consensus to maintain the status quo and avoid armed conflicts.</p>

<p>After Brezhnev served as the leader of the CPSU, Sino -Soviet relations were still in a confrontation. After the Chinese Cultural Revolution began in 1966, almost all exchanges between the two countries. In 1967, the Red Guards hit the Soviet Embassy in Beijing.

<h3>Resisting the Moscow Olympics</h3>
<p>After entering the 1970s, China began to improve relations with Western countries led by the United States. In 1972, Nixon's visit to China opened the door to China's opening to the international community. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was severely sanctions and confrontation due to invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Moscow held the Olympic Games, and China joined the resistance camp of Western countries led by the United States.</p>

<h3>Relationship Normally</h3>
<p>At the end of the Soviet Union, Sino -Soviet relations eased. From October 1982 to June 1988, the special envoys of the China and the Soviet Union conducted 12 rounds of consultation on the normalization of the relationship between the two countries. In May 1989, Gorbachev, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited China to meet with Deng Xiaoping.

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>From good neighbor to strategic partner</h3>
<p>After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, China announced that Russia was the heirs of the Soviet Union. The highest levels of the two countries began to recover. In 1999, the "List of Two Sections on the East and West of the Sino -Russian Boundary Line" was signed. After Pujing came to power in 2001, Russia signed the "Treaty of China -Russia and Russia's Neighbors and Friendship Cooperation" to determine the strategic collaboration partnership of equal trust. In 2010, the two countries confirmed the "comprehensive strategic collaboration partnership".

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>to the international stage</h3>
<p>After entering the new thousand years, with the increase in economic strength, Beijing and Moscow intend to play a more active role on the international stage. The multilateral platforms such as the BRICS Summit and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (established in 2002) provided opportunities for this. The picture shows the BRICS summit held in India in October 2016.</p>

<h3>Friendship of Political Strong Man</h3>
<p>Xi Jinping and Putin, the two authoritative authoritarian leaders, have similar political beliefs of a large country. While firmly consolidating its own power, they also hope to break the existing international order led by the United States. During the visit to Beijing in February 2022 and attending the Winter Olympics, China emphasized that China and Russia were "unlimited friendship and endless cooperation."

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>is not an ally, it looks like an ally</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war in February 2022, Russia has been sanctioned and isolated internationally. However, China has always refused to condemn Russia's aggression, and accusing the United States and NATO in charge of conflict, opposing sanctions, and calling on the "security concerns" of Russia. At the same time, China has greatly expanded imports from Russia, especially energy imports. In March 2023, Xi Jinping visited Moscow and became the first head of head of the Ukrainian war since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war.</p>

<p>Description: After the Supreme Court overthrew educational equal rights containing racial considerations, a legal activity group proposed a new appeal, saying that Harvard provided preferential treatment for alumni or donors to provide preferential discrimination during enrollment and asked the federal government to terminate this approach. Kayana Szymczak for the New York Times Saturday, Harvard students and supporters were marched in Harvard Square to oppose the ruling against the Supreme Court against equal rights operations.</p>

In the appeal submitted on Monday, a legal activity group asked the federal government to suspend this approach and pointed out that after the Supreme Court strictly limited racial considerations last week, it achieved more urgent issues to achieve fair education.</p>
<p>The three groups in the Boston region require the Ministry of Education to re -examine the admission behavior of Harvard University, saying that the university's enrollment policy discriminates against blacks, Western and Asian applicants, and favors those whites who have alumni or donors. applicant.</p>
<p>"Why should we regard the privilege and advantages accumulated by the ancestors as a reward for children?"(Lawyers for Civil Rights)Executive Director Ivan Espenosa Madridar asked. "The amount of family surnames and bank accounts is not a measure of measurement, nor should it affect the results of college admission."</p>
<p>Shortly before the liberal group initiated a complaint, the conservative organization organized the "fair admission of students"(Students for Fair Admissions)<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/us/politics/supreme-court-admissions-affirmative-action-harvard-unc.html?name=styln-affirmative-action-scotus%C2%AEion=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;variant=undefined">I won a lawsuit in the Supreme Court</a>Essence The case brought greater pressure on Harvard University and other prestigious universities, asking them to cancel the preferential treatment of alumni and donors.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education's Civil Rights Office, which is responsible for reviewing the appeal, may conduct investigations. President Biden said in a statement after the Supreme Court issued a statement that he would ask the Ministry of Education to review the practices of "inheritance admission and other admissions systems that expanded privileges rather than opportunities."</p>
<p>Harvard spokesman Nicole Lula said that the school would not comment on the appeal, but she reiterated the content of the statement last week: "As we said, in the next few weeks to several months, the school will be based on the court's new new court's new court. The example to determine how to maintain our basic values. "</p>
<p>Some universities argue that such enrollment can help establish a campus community culture and encourage donations, and these donations can be used for tuition fees.</p>
<p>A polls released by the Pew Research Center last year found that more and more public (75%) believes that inheritance preferences in college enrollment should not be a admission factor.</p>
<p>Recently, more and more voices for the cancellation of inheritance and donation admission preferences in various political factions have increased.</p>
<p>The New York State Democratic Representative Alexander Okasio -Colos said on Twitter that if the Supreme Court's "ridiculous' racial color blindness" claim is serious, then they should abolish inheritance admission That is, it belongs to the equal rights action of the privileged class. "</p>
<p>South Carolina Republican Senator and Presidential Candidate Tim Scott on Fox News "Faulner Focus"(The Faulkner Focus)The above said, "One of the ways to make enrollment more equal to Harvard University is to cancel the inheritance of the inheritance of children who are shaded."</p>
<p>Duke University's economist Peter Alsidiako after analyzing the enrollment data of Harvard University <a href="http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/legacyathlete.pdf">Discover</a>The typical white inheritance applicants have five times higher than the typical white without inheritance applicants.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Even so, the study pointed out that the cancellation of inheritance admission cannot offset the damage caused by diversity after the recruitment of racial factors to consider racial factors.</p>
<p>Some judges of the Supreme Court also criticized inheritance admission in the decision to consider racial factor enrollment. In the opinions consistent with the majority of the court, the judge Neil Gosach said for the preferential treatment of donors and alumni children: "For applicants who cannot show their parents' success or the experience of alumni activities, these There is no help. Although this appears to be neutral, this preference is undoubtedly the most beneficial to white and rich applicants. "</p>
<p>Judge Sonia Sodomary mentioned inheritance admission in his opposition. She believes that it is fair to maintain a race -based priority admission policy, because most of the current reality is "not conducive to the problems in enrollment. "Ethical minorities with insufficient representation".</p>
<p>Although Colorado passed the law that banned public universities from inheritance admission in 2021, the legislation of Congress and other states failed to make progress.</p>
<p>Last year, the bill proposed by New York was opposed by the state's private school organization "Independent College and University Committee", which included famous universities such as Columbia University, Cornell University, and Corget University.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Council held a hearing on this issue last year. Yale University was one of the private schools that publicly opposed it. Yale University undergraduate admissions Jeremy Qinlan is <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/HEDdata/Tmy/2022HB-05034-R000217-Quinlan,%20Jeremiah,%20Dean%20of%20Admissions-Yale%20University-TMY.PDF">written testimony</a>It stated that the proposed ban belongs to the government's interference in university affairs.</p>

<p>Some prestigious schools in the cancellation of inheritance admission are particularly slow. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University and Amester College are one of the few elites that do not adopt this admission method.</p>
<p>Last month, Ameme Matt College said in a press release of the college -the first student recruited after the college's cancellation of inheritance admission preferences, saying that the number of new family students in the autumn of this autumn has created History accounted for 19%, and students with a background accounted for 6%. The previous proportion was 11%.</p>
<p>The three organizations that appealed to the Ministry of Education are the Qica Plan(Chica Project), New England African -American Community Economic Development(African Community Economic Development of New England)And the Great Boston Latin Internet(Greater Boston Latino Network)。</p>

<p>Description: The Sino -US chip war has been upgraded, and China has announced that it will restrict the exports of 镓 and 锗. These two metals are important materials for manufacturing semiconductors. The German Federal Economic Minister Habeck said on Tuesday that if China further expands the restrictions on rare metal exports, such as expanding to lithium, Germany will encounter "big trouble".</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs stated in a statement on Monday (July 3) that in order to "safeguard national security and interests", from August 1, Related items implement export control restrictions. Since then, if exporters want to export related products, they must apply for a license to the ministry and report detailed information from overseas buyers.</p>
<p>These two metals can replace the traditional silicon wafers in some special uses, or make components in military and communication equipment. This move in China is therefore interpreted as <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国对华芯片政策再收紧-特供之路恐走到头/a-66053763">Western World Semiconductor Restrictions</a>Cavination.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/晶片戰延燒-媒體美荷對中國祭新出口管制/a-66077370">the Netherlands only announced a series of control measures to restrict high -end chip manufacturing equipment overseas. The United States also reported that it will restrict specific Chinese manufacturers' semiconductor equipment for the Netherlands</a>Essence This is not the first time in Western countries led by the United States for the first time to set up restrictions on the semiconductor industry; at the same time, countries around the world are also trying to get rid of its supply chain's dependence on overseas equipment.</p>
<p>The British "Financial Times" reported that so far, Beijing's most acute attack on this is to ban the use of American memory chip manufacturers "Meiguang Technology] in its" key country infrastructure "in May.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/分析封禁美光后-北京反制空间有限/a-65735679)"(Micron) products.</p>
<p>The German Federal Economic Minister Habeck said on Tuesday that if China further expands its restrictions on rare metal exports, such as expanding to lithium, Germany will encounter a "completely different (degree) problem." He emphasized: "We should go from the experience in recent years to achieve certain autonomy in the production field to maintain energy and economic security."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-04T05-30-00Z/65224835_401.png" />China announced in May that its "key national infrastructure" disables the memory chip (data photo) of American business "Meiguang Technology".</p>
<h4>?</h4>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that Alastairneill, a member of the Critical Mineral Institute of nearly 30 years of experience in China's metal industry, said that the export control of China ’s exports to the semiconductor industry for the export control of China’ s prince and 锗 The immediate chain response, especially in high -performance chips. "</p>
<p>He added that the Sino -US chip battle made him see a model of mutual concession between China and the United States and returning to teeth. If the United States sacrifice trade sanctions, Beijing will often return to corresponding countermeasures: "If you do not let high -end chips be transported to China in China , China will not provide you with high performance elements needed for these chips. "</p>
<p>Paultriolo, a high -level vice president of China, said that the export control will allow Beijing to take geopolitics as a consideration for individual companies, and More objects in specific industries make decisions; and this is exactly a signal to the United States, indicating that China intends to export control to establish a new bilateral dialogue, and this latest measure may also provide Beijing with more negotiation chips.</p>
<p>Trade lawyer Nazaknikakhtar, a trading lawyer who has served as related positions in Guoan and the cargo and trade industry, told the Wall Street Journal that China is indeed reminding the United States to "how much control they (the United States) supply chain will supply chains in the United States) "Li", but she didn't think this was enough to be a bargaining chip for China -US negotiations.</p>
<p>Nikahtar said that Washington should take this opportunity to remind the Chinese side that the United States can further tighten the current US <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美欲限縮中國晶片發展-出口管制有用嗎/a-65767213">Export Control</a>The vulnerability and further strengthen the force of economic sanctions.</p>

<h3>镓, 受 exports are limited, how big the impact?</h3>
<p>According to the US Geological Survey, China is the largest producer in the world; data from the British key mineral intelligence centers also shows that China's pupa production accounts for about 94%of the world's.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that these two metals are by -products that are processed by processing coal or production of aluminum. They are not particularly rare and difficult to obtain, but the cost of mining is relatively high, and China's supply has always maintained a lower price. If the export volume of the country's crickets and crickets is reduced, the production capacity of global technology, telecommunications, energy, and automobile related industries may slow down and increase prices.</p>
<p>However, the report also quoted Rogersa, an analyst of RECON Analytics LLC analyst, said that the impact of China's move on the global technology industry "depends on the inventory of existing equipment." He said, "This is more about showing muscles in the next year or so. If the time is dragged for a long time, the price will rise."</p>
<p>The head of the investment bank in New York City, Hallgarten &amp; Company, analyzed that China ’s move may be raised briefly, but China will also lose market dominant positions in China. Essence "When they (China) stopped the price, it became imperative to minimize these metals in the West. China is equal to playing another oolong ball," he said, "The same situation also happened in the same situation before, tungsten, and other [tungsten and other <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论西方能撼动中国的稀土垄断地位吗/a-60294498"> Rare Earth Products</a>superior. "</p>
<p>The British "Financial Times" also pointed out that some Chinese companies are worried that this export control may be counterproductive. A executive of a Chinese semiconductor material company said: "During the period of economic downturn, (this move) may affect the business of Chinese manufacturers, but the impact on the international market in the short term is limited."</p>
<p>According to the metal industry intelligence provider CRU Group, other producers of the cricket include Japan, South Korea, Russia, and Ukraine; and Canada, Belgium, the United States and Russia also produce crickets.</p>

<p>Description: Park Yumei has become famous for publicly about North Korea's dark life and his escape experience. Now he is involved in the field of US politics and has become a right -wing media star. She said that the teaching of American universities is comparable to the brainwashing of the North Korean regime, criticizing politics and "awakening" culture. Jeenah Moon for the New York Times "I think many Americans think that the United States does not know why it is not affected by tyranny," recently, Park Shark told the crowd at an event in Queens.</p>

<p>"This is made by the dictator: they laid the seeds of suspicion everywhere, and there are distrust of people between people, and even family members. The teacher told their children," she continued, "If your parents say If you shouldn't say, let's tell the teacher. '"</p>
<p>In the stage of television, the stage of the conference, and the best -selling memoirs, Park Shark has repeatedly told this story. In the past ten years, she has been one of the most famous northern people in the world, and has escaped the isolation and totalitarian country of the Jin family.</p>
<p>But in recent years, she has added a new post.</p>
<p>"Now," she told the audience on Long Island last weekend, "I saw the same thing in the United States."</p>
<p>Conservative experts and politicians have long warned that liberal economy and cultural politics will bring the United States on the left -wing authority. But they have never had allies like Park Yumei until two years ago. The 29 -year -old Park Shark is a refugee from North Korea. This is the most infamous Stalinist country left over the world. She claims that her personal experience has confirmed these most terrible fear: for example, she will compare racism in mathematics teaching with courses she accepted in Korean schools when she was a child.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox News host Mark Lvin last month, Park Shark described his undergraduate experience in Columbia University in the past few years, saying that the school's teaching method "was used by the North Korean regime to brainwash people for people. method". She said, "I think", the left -wing thoughts in American education institutions instill "the biggest threat to our country and our civilization."</p>
<p>She is now condemning Hillary Clinton, who had spoke with her as a "deadly scammer and liar", and criticized the cross -sex marketing activities: "Political correctness has wiped out women," she recently was on Facebook Written.</p>

When she was 13 years old, she fled North Korea, appeared in a popular TV show in South Korea many years later, and then wrote a memoir "To Live". William Campbell/Corbis, Via Getty Images</p>
<p>All this is emphasizing warning that these dissatisfaction is more sinister than that everything that adds up in Fox News. "I think many Americans think that the United States does not know why it is immune to tyranny, and the dictatorship starts like North Korea," said at an event hosted by a conservative organization "US turning point" in the Queens District. "But things are not like that. It starts with amazing equal promises. They promised us a socialist paradise."</p>
<p>"With this promise," she also said, "They took away everything from us little by little." The crowd stood up twice to applaud her.</p>
<p>It is extremely rare that Park Shark's transformation from a celebrity to the north to a loud and loud critic for freedom and politics. Of the tens of thousands of people escaped from North Korea, few people were involved in domestic politics of shelter.</p>
<p>However, under the encouragement of exaggerating its words and spreading concerns, Park Reinion, which became a citizen of American citizens in 2021, found a place where it was favorable.</p>
<p>Her second book "Taking Taking Time"(While Time Remains)Published in February, she claimed to be "a warning to Americans", and her sales had exceeded her hard -selling memoirs in 2015. She is a frequent right -handed TV network and podcast, and a speaker of conservative universities and think tanks.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, she became a speaker of the "American Turn Point", and the right -wing activist who has recently expelled the "Truth Plan" and recently expelled from the "Truth Plan" [James Ouyff], who has recently been expelled from the "Truth Plan",(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/us/politics/james-okeefe-project-veritas.html)Wait for the characters to attend the meeting together.</p>
<p>Her recent changes have caused the retreat of some past allies and supporters, and they are worried that her involvement in the American Culture War may affect her effect as a human rights advocate. Some observers who were concerned about her career noticed that she had reshaped her past experience and questioned the accuracy of her narrative. They were surprised by her recent behavior.</p>
<p>"She is a amazing performer," said Jie Song, a professor of North Korean Research at the Asian Research Institute of the University of Melbourne by the Australian Research Institute of Melbourne. "She is very smart. She always makes an article on keywords."</p>

<p>Park Yumei, who is currently living in New York, said in a recent interview that her own political views are not as strong as she often expressed in the media. "I support same -sex marriage and is very liberal in society," she said. "I never thought that she was a conservative." When asked if she recognized herself as a conservative now, she denied it.</p>
<p>She compared the original intention of the second book to Alexis Dekovir. "He came to the United States from France -studying American democracy," she said. "So, what if a Korean people see the United States and analyze the United States?"</p>
<p>Most of the time after Park Reinion has lived in the media in some form of review. In 2007, at the age of 13, she fled North Korea with her mother. Five years later, she participated in the popular variety show "<a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20190531/korea-tv-reunification/">Now see you</a>", The protagonist is the young woman from the northern northern.</p>

<p>The show premiered in 2011, making North Koreans attract new attention in South Korea's popular culture. Park Yumei is one of the most dazzling stars in the show. She is cheerful and describes that her Korean family is relatively wealthy. She is called "North Korea's Paris Hilton".</p>
<p>"I think many Koreans have learned a lot of things from that program," said Jon H. Lee, a reporter reported by North Korea and South Korea for the Associated Press. "But it also created a celebrity culture."</p>

<p>In 2014, Park Shark was invited to give a speech at the World Youth Leadership Summit held in Dublin, telling the story of his life in North Korea and the darkest in the process of escape.Park Yanmei's short speech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei-gGvLWOZI">Video</a>It is widely spread online, and a 21 -year -old thin woman in the video is wearing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/style/one-garments-journey-through-history.html">Traditional Korean Clothing</a>With tears and trembling telling a terrible story, which made Park Yanmei a celebrity of international humanitarianism. For a few months, she signed a book -out agreement with Penguin Langdon Book House to write memoirs with Marian Walles, which was the writer of Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Park Shark tells the stories to Korean audiences and <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a16414/yeonmi-park-escape-from-north-korea/">The story telling today</a>There are obvious inconsistencies between them.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-04T05-59-46-08-00/22pol-defector-fckh-master1050.jpg" />Park Shark was criticized for his description of his life experience. She blame some inconsistent situations on language barriers and trauma effects. Jeenah Moon for the New Yorktimes</p>
<p>Park Yumei raised some of the criticisms of Juli, but also acknowledged other criticisms. She said that some were caused by language difficulties or trauma effects. She said that some of them originated from the random use of her identity by Korean show producers.</p>

<p>Park Shamei said that when she wrote the first book, she and the publisher noticed the suspicion caused by Juli's article. Both she and Walles <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector">Represents</a>Through interviews with family members and other northern people, they confirmed her story as much as possible.</p>
<p>According to the data of Circana BookScan, the sales volume of the hardcover and peaceful installation of "To Live" exceeded 130,000 copies. Park Shark received widespread attention from the media. She received an invitation from Jeff Bezos's private party and and with Scarlett Johnson <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialyeonmipark/photos/a.834011640050263/1817628525021898/">selfie</a>Essence She and the founder of Audemars Piguet Joe Jobia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/fashion/joe-gebbia-yeonmi-park-met-gala.html">Participated in MET GALA</a>, And gave a speech with Hillary on the same stage (it was an event co -organized by the New York Times). Park Shark later wrote that Hillary Clinton looked at her eyes after the speech, "promised that she would do my best to help North Korea Women. (Hillary spokesman Nick Merrill said that Hillary and the staff who were present at the time did not remember her saying this.)</p>
<p>However, in her new book, Park Yanmei wrote that her contact with the elite disappointed her. She began to believe that they were more interested in emotional satisfaction, not action.</p>
<p>In 2016, she began to study human rights from Columbia University, hoping to become a professional advocate. But some people who met her at the time said that the process of transforming from a celebrity with different political opinions to a more concerned of a fidelity did not seem to be smooth.</p>
<p>She tried to use her star influence to help an organization called "North Korea's Freedom". The organization organized funds for a sisters in South Korea, which rescued North Korean refugees from China -this is what she likes to do. However, Park Zhen (Yin), a former human rights activist who worked with her at the time, said that Park Shark was not able to do this role and soon left.</p>
<p>"We think she may be a good funding person, because she has contacts and networks," he said. "I think she has worked hard, but asking others for money is not as easy as it sounds." (Park Yumei said that she quickly realized that she was too busy at the time and was not suitable for this role.)</p>
<p>Shortly after graduating in 2020, Park Yanmei and his son were attacked while walking in Chicago, and the wallet was robbed. She said that when she recorded a black woman who attacked her with her mobile phone, another woman yelled at her and said she was a racist. (The court records show that the attacker was arrested later and acknowledged the crime of illegal detention.)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-04T05-59-46-08-00/22pol-Defector-blqp-master1050.jpg" />Park Yanmei was held at the "US turning point" at a event in Changdao. She said the organization gave her $ 6,600 a month. Jeenah Moon for the New Yorktimes</p>
<p>She wrote that the incident became a turning point in her political career. "This shows how serious the disease that" Awakening "has developed in the United States, how humane it has made the normal people." She started looking for like -mindedness. Allies.</p>
<p>After reading a book of Canadian psychologist and popular conservative media person Jordan Peterson, she found his daughter Mihayra. She was a podcast anchor and a lifestyle on social media. Internet celebrities; Mihayra invited her to her own podcast. I heard that Peter Sen was a collector of Soviet art. Park Shark sent him a North Korean postcard he had preserved.</p>
<p>Peter Sen invited her to her own podcast who told her experience at Columbia University in the podcast. This interview attracted the attention of conservative media. Shortly after that, Simon and Schost's conservative publishing house Thresholdeditions signed a publishing agreement with her at a price of $ 500,000. Peterson wrote the foreword for this book.</p>
<p><strong> "This is a free society" </strong> **</p>
<p>Park Yanmei always believes that the recent outspoken has made her pay the price instead of earning money. Although the prepaid on "Time" is considerable, it is far lower than the 1.1 million US dollars received by her previous book. She said that the invitation of corporate speeches with expensive compensation is now poor, and the income of these activities has accounted for a large part of her income."The establishment of a school in the North Korean regime is not to teach children how to think, but to instill them in faith," Hughes wrote, and he also pointed out the danger of "group thinking and collectivism." In view of the equal education plan implemented by his area, "it should be reminiscent of the example of North Korea", he wrote.</p>
<p>Park Yumei said that her latest position change may not be the last time.</p>
<p>"I may write a completely different work in five years," she said. "I might say that everything I wrote in the second book is stupid. But it's okay."</p>
<p>She laughed. "This is a free society," she said.</p>

Under such circumstances, I think the official media report is the brainwashing and publicity war on the public. "</p>
<p>Official media and local media reproduced the news of the West to return to poverty</p>
<p>Summarizing the recent reporting perspective of Chinese official media, local media and self -media, focusing on economic recession in developed countries, Western refugees may pour into China, including "the younger generation in Japan is not full, no deposit"; , Australians can't afford to eat ";" 30 million people in the United States are hungry and 43 million people are homeless. " Forced to starve "and so on.</p>
<p>However, experts such as Chinese economists and presidents of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics Liu Yuanchun recently warned in the "China Macroeconomic Analysis and Forecast Report in the mid -2023" that Chinese youth unemployment problems will continue to intensify in the short term and may last for 10 years. If it is not handled properly, it will not only trigger social problems, but also trigger political problems.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Police Hanging Million Wanted Eight Social Transporters, Luo Guancong was worried about the threat of security</h3>
<ul>
<li>James Landale, Alys Davies * BBC reporter</li>
</ul>
<p>7:21 am on July 4, 2023 Recently updated: 8:15 am on July 4, 2023![] [] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-04T07-21-47.000Z/_130277599_gettyimages-1244448988.jpg"></a>Image source, AFP</p>
<p><strong> Democrats who fled in Hong Kong told the BBC that his personal safety would become more dangerous because the authorities wanted to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want. </strong></p>
<p>Nathan Law, who is currently living in the UK, is one of the eight exile people wanted by the Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities rewarded HK $ 1 million (about 100,581 pounds; $ 127,637), collecting information that can lead to their arrest.</p>
<p>Luo Guancong said that due to the existence of a reward, he needs to "be more careful" in revealing his whereabouts.</p>
<p>These eight targeted activities were accused of collusion with foreign forces -this is a crime that may be sentenced to life imprisonment. After large -scale democratic protests in 2019, Hong Kong implemented a severe national security law three years ago. This crime is a crime under the National Security Law.</p>
<p>British Foreign Minister James Cleverly said that Britain "will not tolerate any intention to intimidate and sorrow in Britain and overseas individuals."</p>
<p>He said in a statement: "We call on Beijing to revoke the National Security Law and call on the Hong Kong authorities to stop those who maintain freedom and democracy."</p>
<p>Under the National Security Law, hundreds of democratic activities were arrested and convicted in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Beijing has stated that this law is needed to stabilize the city, but critics claim that the law aims to suppress dissidents.</p>
<p>In this announcement, eight people named in the United Kingdom, the United States or Australia -have no extradition treaties between these countries and China.</p>
<p>Li Guihua, General Police Division of the Hong Kong Police, said that the crimes of "harm to Guoan are very serious".</p>
<p>He acknowledged that if they stayed abroad, the Hong Kong police could not arrest them, but said they would not stop law enforcement.</p>
<p>Luo Guancong is one of the main characters in the Hong Kong democracy protest. He said that although he felt that he was in the UK, the situation was "relatively safe", but after the news of the reward was announced, he had to be more cautious.</p>
<p>"Someone may be in the UK -or anywhere -provide some of my information (for Hong Kong authorities). For example, my whereabouts, when I transfer to some countries, they may be able to extradite me, "Luo Guancong said.</p>
<p>"All these may put my life in a dangerous situation. If I don't be careful about seeing or where to go. This makes me have to live a more cautious life."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-66051256">The Hong Kong Government will re -push the "23": What is the difference between the National Security Law? </a>Luo Guancong posted a post on Twitter, urging others not to cooperate with the authorities in this matter, and said: "We should not limit ourselves, self -examination, intimidation, or living in fear."</p>
<p>Guo Fengyi, an exile activist who was included in the wanted list and the executive director of the "Hong Kong Democratic Commission", also expressed the same view, saying that the purpose of this reward was to threaten her and other activists.</p>
<p>"We are united to fight for our home -Hong Kong's freedom and democracy," she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Liu Zudi, also wanted, told the BBC that the "little pink" people who could encourage overseas to pro -pro -pro -Beijing "small pink" people would attack or harass them on their personal attacks.</p>
<p>Luo Guancong said that in the long run, he is not very worried about his future.</p>
<p>"In the final analysis, I wonder how countries with a strong rule of law system will cooperate or cooperate with the Hong Kong government to extradite any of us among us, because this is obviously a political crime and violates our basic human rights."</p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Pennywong said that the Australian government's announcement on the announcement of the reward "deeply disappointed" and said that Australia "still pays attention to the continued erosion of Hong Kong's human rights, freedom, and autonomy."</p>
<p>The other five in this reward list were Xu Zhifeng, Guo Rongzhang, Meng Zhanda, Yuan Gongyi, and Ren Jianfeng.</p>

<p>China implements export restrictions on two metal minerals. The United States calls that these two materials are essential for the production of semiconductor, missile systems and solar cells. This is the power display before the two opponents of China and the United States conducting economic talks.

<p>Turkish President Erdogan showed that Sweden did not stop covering the organization that was regarded as terrorists by Ankara as a terrorist one day, and Turkey would never agree with Sweden to join NATO.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that Turkey has repeatedly emphasized that Sweden must take more actions to the members of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and Ankara's identification of the group members responsible for the Turkish coup in 2016.</p>
<p>Erdogan (July 3rd) attended the cabinet meeting that Turkey asked Sweden to stop the members of the two organizations. "Everyone should be very clear that people who allow terrorists to hold demonstrations in their most important central squares in their country cannot establish friendship with Turkey."</p>
<p>In recent months, in the demonstrations held in Stockholm, some demonstrators have wielded the banner of supporting the Kurdish Workers' Party. This national separatist organization has also been identified as a terrorist organization by the Turkish Western allies.</p>
<p>Erdogan said: "Our positions, expectations, and commitments are clear. The principles we now defend are the same as last year. We just ask them to be loyal to the agreement they signed."</p>
<p>Sweden said it maintained some of the contents of the agreement with Turkey in Madrid last year. The agreement signed by Sweden and Turkey in 2022 aims to solve the security issues of Ankara's attention, including a new anti -terrorism law promulgated by Sweden this month. However, Turkey believes that the Kurdish worker's party holder is still holding a protest in Sweden, and Sweden's legislation is "meaningless".</p>
<p>NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said that Sweden and Turkey will hold a high -level meeting in Brussels before holding a summit this month to discuss the possibility of Sweden joining NATO.</p>
<p>Last week, a Iraqi citizen living in Sweden stepped on and burned the Kochi Sutra in front of Stockholm's biggest return to the church, causing a strong protest from many Muslim countries.</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden and Finland abandoned the long -term military -free alliance policy and applied to join NATO last year. Finland has officially become the 31st member of NATO in April this year, and Turkey and Hungary have not yet approved Sweden applications.</p>
<p>According to the NATO regulations, NATO must obtain "unanimous consent" of all member states in order to absorb new members.</p>

<p><strong> Voice of Germany: What is the purpose of your trip to Taiwan? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Although this is the first time I visited Taiwan as the Secretary -General of the International Inneure Organization (Identnial), the relationship between the international amnesty and Taiwan has a long history. During the period of Taiwan's dictatorship, international amnesty was committed to assisting with conscience. During this interview, during this interview, during the interview, I also saw two of them -Chen Qinsheng and Chen Ju, chairman of the Taiwan National Human Rights Committee.</p>
<p>No matter where I go, everyone will mention this long -term relationship and the efforts of international amnesty in democracy and human rights. Therefore, some of the reasons for my visit is to rebuild these relationships and pay special attention to the continuous work of the International Amnesty Taiwan Branch, because it is not only one of the most successful branches of the International Amnesty Organization in the region and even globally globally. Essence As a national entity, it has indeed achieved extraordinary achievements. Therefore, I am very eager to meet with members, staff, and directors in Taiwan in Taiwan to understand their work and see what our other members have.</p>
<p>This is the first reason I came here, but there are other why it may not be very good. I come here to evaluate the progress of the Taiwan government in terms of human rights and practical human rights conventions, and it is also to explore and understand the impact of increasingly intensified international tensions, especially the tension in the United States and China on the protection of human rights in Taiwan for human rights. Impact, but not only this.</p>
<p>Taiwan is indeed at the front line of the international system reorganization and the conflict between China and the United States. Last year, Russia's invasion of Ukraine had exacerbated this conflict. Therefore, this visit also wants to know how to deal with the increasingly tense situation and how we should respond to ensure that human rights are protected anyway.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: What do you find about the impact of the geopolitical tensions of the China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Well, of course, I think there are many impacts, such as resources, fear, fake messages and other aspects. All this makes the protection of human rights, on the one hand, it is particularly critical and important, and on the other hand, it may be reduced to a victim in the tension.</p>
<p>Taking false information as an example, any researchers around the world will tell you that Taiwan is the first victim of the fake information. In terms of human rights and democracy, the people of Taiwan are the targets of fake information. The purpose of these false information is to instill fear, so that people believe that human rights are unhelpful, human rights have no effect, human rights cannot protect the people, and the Taiwanese government cannot protect the people of Taiwan. This level of false information is already a form of infringement of human rights, making it more difficult to advocate human rights protection and human rights education. However, this also highlights how important international human rights organizations such as INENE Organizations are investing in Taiwan can ensure how much protection of Taiwanese people understand human rights and know how much protection of human rights conventions, human rights operations, and human rights and justice can bring them.</p>
<p>Another example is the fear of military intervention, which makes people feel strong uncertainty and fear that something will happen to themselves or children. Creating such an environment itself is already infringing the rights of Taiwanese. Of course, no matter whether it is public or direct, any form of military operations will constitute a major human rights violation of the people of Taiwan.</p>
<p>We haven't reached that step, but what I want to express is that even in the current environment, the severity of false information, (Taiwan Strait) militaryization and human rights politics need to be specially considered to consider how to safeguard human rights.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-04T08-10-00Z/66107005_401.png" />On the eve of June 29, Karamar accepted an exclusive interview with the Voice of Germany at the International Amnesty Organization Taiwan Branch.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: When I talked with your Taipei team earlier, I learned that you met with Taiwanese officials and citizen groups. Who is particularly impressive? After seeing them, do you think Taiwan is ready to face the impact you mentioned just now? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Everyone I met was impressive. Of course, because I have a human rights background, I am particularly moved by those who are struggling with the rights of myself or others.</p>
<p>When I met some people who were illegally detained because of free expressions in Taiwan, or in China, or in China. They have resistance, and their wives and family also have resistance, which is impressive. I also met the prisoner, including Mr. Qiu and Mr. Wang (referring to Qiu Heshun and Wang Xinfu). Their philosophy of life is also impressive. It can teach us what it looks like to continue to live in the fear of being executed, but they are again Being able to discover beauty in simple things in life and prepare for your own life.</p>
<p>I also met the person in charge of the National Human Rights Commission (Chen Ju). She was a conscience and a victim of torture. International amnesty had assisted the rescue when she was detained. Her determination to protect human rights is impressive, even if some rights were deprived when she was young.</p>
<p>Politicians in Taiwan are all in a very complicated environment. Taiwan's unique international status allows them to continue to weigh between various priority matters and issues. Although I do not always agree with the road that Taiwan chooses, I never doubt that they are committed to ensuring human rights as much as possible, so this visit to Taiwan brought me huge hope.</p>
<p>Over the years, although Taiwan has not affiliated to the United Nations -this position has been given to China in the past, Taiwan has found its method of implementing the human rights agenda. The Taiwan government and the civic society jointly designed and practiced a very creative system, which shows that their commitments to international standards and their willingness to accept external evaluation commitments based on these standards. They are copying special mechanisms and procedures for the existing human rights system in a more effective way. This is something that must be particularly emphasized, and I personally inspire a lot.</p>
<p>Five international conventions have been included in Taiwan's domestic regulations and systems. These five conventions are supervised by international experts who visit Taiwan on a regular basis. After they issued a review report, the Taiwan government will evaluate the report and promise to implement regulations in accordance with the recommendations. This is a virtuous circle, and it is very rare in terms of human rights and must be prominent; this is a great achievement in Taiwan.</p>
<p>One of the tasks I visited actually told Taiwan: You have done so much, but you can do more. In terms of the "Torture Convention" and "Refugee Convention", Taiwan can do more and incorporate these conventions into domestic law. Therefore, all kinds of talks I held here are to emphasize to the Taiwan government that they have established a road, and this path should be linear, which means that there is only one direction in advance, that is, to continue to localize these international obligations And implement it.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Let's talk about the recent incidents of international amnesty organizations. In May this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/維族學生下落查明-港府籲國際特赦組織道歉/a-65760933">International Amnesty Organization said that there were Uygur students who disappeared at the Hong Kong airport, but found that this is not the facts</a>Essence This incident seriously damaged the reputation of your organization. I want to ask what happened. How will your organization rebuild the trust of the outside world? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: There are a few words in your questions that are not correct, so I correct me a little bit. Traditionally, international amnesty organizations are committed to helping people who are in danger of life due to being imprisoned, missing or illegally detained.When this person disappeared 3 weeks later, "I don't want you to speak on behalf of me." At this time, we will stop because our basic principles are to obtain consent and do not cause damage. Therefore, when some people say that we do not want us to speak on their behalf, we do not want us to initiate and publicize the case, then we must definitely follow their instructions immediately, and we do this too. After 3 weeks of disappearance, this person asked us not to do anything, and we stopped action. This approach has practiced the key principles and standards of our investigation, that is, does not cause damage, and takes into account consent and accuracy. In my opinion, this is the key message that the outside world should know from this.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: But the information received by the public is that your organization said that he disappeared at the Hong Kong airport, but found that he did not go to the airport at all. So is this in terms of accuracy — </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: There are different explanations to the incident. In my opinion, as a reporter who should avoid damage, you should adhere to the "The Do NO Harmprinciple". We should not talk about the student's situation because this may make the situation worse. This is our bottom line. This is not what happened and nothing happened. The question is to how much we receive the current consent to talk about this? We did not agree to talk about this. In addition, if we continue to talk about this, to what extent will it hurt? There will be a lot of damage, so we no longer talk about this. This is the position of the International Amnesty Organization as a human rights organization.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Okay. So what you mean is that your organization stops this project because he does not agree with consent? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Yes, this is the most important key.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Why did this information not mentioned in the more corrected statement of your organization? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: What information?</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Nothing to agree. </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Yes, this is the key principle. I don't need to repeat things that have been disclosed. I am supplementing the information for you: The working principle of the International Amnesty Organization is "no harm" and "obtaining consent." In the case of these two principles, we immediately take action and ensure that we do not cause harm; if (the parties) withdraw from consent, we must also withdraw any related actions. That's it.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Okay. I see. What about Beijing? When your organization issued other in -depth investigations on Xinjiang Uyghur ethnic minorities in the future, the Chinese government may refute you with this incident. How will you deal with it? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: I am very resolutely committed to continuing the work we have done. Regarding the International Amnesty Organization, the Chinese government has proposed too many allegations, no matter what they say now, it is nothing new. We and other organizations have published an exquisite research on China to treat Uighurs. China's approach is equivalent to anti -human crimes, but China has not yet proposed any accurate and effective refutation information.</p>
<p>China will put forward various allegations on anyone, for international amnesty organizations, as well as the Taiwan government, as long as we dare to doubt their human rights issues. No matter where we are, China and Russia have accusations about us, and Israel accuses us of anti -Skilk because we publish racial isolation reports. This is the script of all dictatorship, we are used to it. We know how to deal with it, and we will continue to adhere to our working principles and the commitment to maintain human rights.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Do you personally think that the incident has damaged the reputation of the International Amnesty Organization? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: I don't know which event you are talking about. But no, I don't think (I think) people from this area understand that this incident does not have any impact (for the organization).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-04T08-10-00Z/59619639_401.png" />After the "Hong Kong National Security Law" passed, the International Amnesty Organization announced at the end of 2021 that two local branches were closed.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Some people on the Internet have accused the International Amnesty Organization as a "anti -China organization" to maintain human rights and act as a non -governmental organization in Western political instruments. How do you respond to these remarks? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: As I just said, we suffered a lot of allegations. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人权组织指责乌军队违反国际法-乌总统正面回怼/a-62724439">Whenever we emphasize that a country has human rights issues, the government and supporters of the country usually accuse us of opposition to the country</a>Essence We criticized Ethiopia to commit anti -human crimes in Tigray's conflict, and was criticized against Ethiopia; when we talked about Israel's treatment with Palestinians, we were accused of anti -Jewie. We have also been accused by the US government for pointing out human rights violations. Therefore, China's accusations of our authority are consistent with the usefulness of authoritarian leaders, that is, trying to shift the focus to avoid their own human rights violations.</p>
<p>International human rights are neither West, east, not Latin America, nor Africa. It is a universal standard. Most people in the world, and even governments of various countries gather together. It is the basis for the relationship between the government and the people, and it is a way to ensure that individual rights are exempted from the infringement of government rights. Rights are naturally held by us. As long as you are an individual, you have the right to. Chinese people have human rights, Taiwanese have human rights, and French people also have human rights (compiled by: Karamal is French).</p>
<p>I will describe it so much that in a series of tensions such as the Chinese government and the United States, and in the battle between the global superpowers, human rights have become one of the instruments of this conflict. The U.S. government is allegedly advocating political, citizenship and democracy, while China advocates (economic) development, national sovereignty and economic rights. In fact, the position of the International Amnesty Organization is that we do not choose the side station in this conflict. We are still quite fair. What we want to express is that human rights are inseparable, and citizenship, political power, economic power, social power, and cultural rights are part of our birth and must be protected equally. They are abused and misused by Chinese governments and other countries, do not mean that they belong to another country or government. We must safeguard human rights around the world, including China, and resist China when necessary.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Do you have to take action to fight against the accusations of China? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: At any time, I mean, this is always the case. For example, when China accuses us of inclined to the West in terms of human rights advocacy, we can usually do two things -the first thing is to show that as a human rights organization, international amnesty organizations also pay attention to the United States, China, Russia, Mali, etc. A series of countries.</p>
<p>The second thing is that we have just released a report on global human rights. Among them, we pointed out that Western countries have made double standards, because they look at the Ukraine conflict priority than many other conflicts and fail to maintain from a global perspective to maintain human rights. When they realize their vision, they actually discharge the order of high and low. We did not hesitate to point out the weakness, limitations or violations of the so -called western countries. So I can say that we often do this without any justice. This is what must be done.We resolutely condemn the Chinese authorities that have repeatedly violated the freedom of speech. We have prepared and will continue to condemn the Chinese government to perform the death penalty, infringe the right of strikes of the people, and infringe on the people's assembly rights. The Chinese authorities have committed a variety of human rights violations, some in terms of citizenship, politics, and economic, social, and cultural aspects. No matter what China does to us, we will continue to condemn them.</p>
<p>I can guarantee you that we are a global (initiative) movement, and we have everything to resist Chinese fake messages.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: You mentioned at the Oslo Freedom Forum last year that many Western countries did not publicly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and once said that "neutrality is not an option." If China really invaded Taiwan, do you think the Western world will be more difficult to form a united front? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Listen, I will not start to predict what China may do and won't do anything. When a government -no matter which government -the key principles that violate the "United Nations Charter" and the formation of the formation and governance methods of the international community, and infringe on human rights, "neutrality" cannot exist.</p>
<h3>Ukrainian counterattack is stalemate</h3>
<p>I said a year ago that it is still clearly expressed that it is not an option to take a neutral attitude towards Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Governments of various countries, governments including Africa, Latin America, and Asia, should be with Ukraine, because Ukraine's territory is invaded, the country is completely violated, and the people are killed. (Russia) committed many sins of war. So yes, neutrality is impossible.</p>
<p>In the face of other large -scale human rights, it is also impossible to maintain neutrality. For example, the Myanmar government has done what local people and ethnic minorities do; dozens of people have been imprisoned in Egypt or Saudi Arabia because of freely. So no matter where these infringements happen, we must resolutely oppose it.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Do you think the situation of "neutrality" is also applicable to the tension of the Taiwan Strait? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: As long as there is a large -scale violation of human rights anywhere, neutrality is not an option. It's not advisable.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: Do you think the Western world is paying attention to Taiwan? Is Western countries paying attention to the situation between China and Taiwan, and possible human rights disasters? </strong></p>
<p>Karamar: There is no doubt that the world is paying attention to what is happening in Taiwan, including organizations like us. As I said, one of the reasons for my trip is precisely because Taiwan is in the increasingly intensified frontline of international tensions. Therefore, we need to understand how to protect human rights in such a complex background. In the end, the people of Taiwan decide where they want to go. Therefore, from the perspective of international amnesty organizations, we will put forward a position based on international law and international conventions related to human rights.</p>
<p>So yes, everyone is paying attention to Taiwan now. We came here to safeguard human rights, because the people and authorities of Taiwan have made great progress in maintaining human rights. We really want to support them to continue to do so, including incorporating international conventions such as the "Torture Convention" into the domestic law. This is the basic principle of the international human rights system, but has not been well included in Taiwan's domestic system. Therefore, one of the key messages I want to bring in this trip is that (Taiwan) should not waste time. This is very important, which is part of Taiwan's commitment to international human rights.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: As you mentioned, you encountered some death prisoners in Taiwan. According to your organization, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球死刑数量创五年新高在中国仍是国家机密/a-65638885">China is the most active country in the world in the world</a>; In Taiwan, although the government has a gradual abolition of the death penalty, the public support rate of the public is actually as high as China. What's your opinion? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: I regret that the people of Taiwan have not opposed the death penalty. The death penalty is the ultimate form of punishment. It is inhumane and humiliated. In some cases, it may be equivalent to torture.</p>
<p>Before joining the International Amnesty Organization, I served as a special reporter who was arbitrarily executed by (the United Nations). The death penalty is part of the scope of my responsibility, and I have received a lot of information about the case of death penalty. I can assure you that none of the cases of death sentences are in line with the principles of fair trials from the United States to Saudi Arabia, Taiwan or China. In other words, when people are sentenced to death, they have become victims under infringement, such as the pipelines of the lawyer, and what I am talking about now is just the situation in the Western or democratic countries.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-04T08-10-00Z/61280460_401.png" />In 2020, the International Amnesty Organization protested by the French government through the Global Security Law, which plans to imitate China to use face recognition monitoring technology in the public field.</p>
<p>These people (referring to the death penalty) may have the opportunity to contact a lawyer after being sued for a long time; it may also vomit information or confession under torture or abuse; they may not speak the language or even communicate with the police because there are often there is often, there are often, there are often, there are often, there are often, there are often there is, there are often, there are often, there are often, there are often there is, there are often there is a way A large number of victims of the death penalty are migrant; many of them may be poor. Among the death penalty victims around the world, the largest number of people is extremely poor and the most vulnerable group.</p>
<p>There is really no fairness to say that the death penalty. In the end, it is just unacceptable that it is arbitrarily deprived of life. Therefore, regardless of the standpoint of the Taiwanese people, the position of our organization is that we will continue to advocate opposition to the death penalty; we will continue to educate people to understand the truth of the death penalty; we will also call on the authorities to decisively (abolishment) than the present.</p>
<p>Many people around the world believe that the death penalty is meaningful, not only Taiwanese and Chinese, but this belief is actually ubiquitous. Even in countries that have abolished the death penalty, especially those who have just been abolished, you will find that many people still think that the death penalty has its meaning -the fact is not the case, and the death penalty is the opposite of justice -but the governments of these countries are still brave Tell the people, you see, we will implement (abolition) operation, we will convince you and educate you, we will prove that the death penalty is a kind of violation of human rights.</p>
<p>We must continue this trend now. This trend is that the number of (countries) who have abolished the death penalty far more than those who have not been abolished. Every year, more countries abolish the death penalty, and more countries are de facto or legal to suspend the death penalty. Currently in Taiwan, (the death penalty) has been suspended in essence. We call on the authorities to continue this substantial suspension and turn to legal suspension, and eventually move towards abandonment. At the same time, in some cases, the president can take action through amnesty. We call on President Tsai to at least forgive Mr. Qiu and Mr. Wang (referring to Qiu Heshun and Wang Xinfu). Both of them should be released.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: According to your experience in studying the death penalty around the world, do you think it is a feasible way to gradually abolish the death penalty? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: Listen, we don't know, you know, of course, international amnesty firmly advocates completely abolishing the death penalty. This is our ultimate goal. However, we are also pragmatic and realize the importance of gradually abolishing the death penalty and gradually performing human rights obligations. When we involve the death penalty, we are using a gradual method. For example, the first step is to be executed for children or disabled; the second step should not be performed in crimes related to drugs, or the death penalty of the death penalty according to international law should not lead to the death penalty. Therefore, we certainly support this pragmatic method against the death penalty, but our ultimate goal is to achieve a comprehensive abolition of the death penalty.Karamal: This is quite outstanding. As I said, Taiwan is on a good road in terms of human rights protection. This must continue and independent of what is happening (referring to the potential conflict of the Taiwan Strait). In this international background, the best response is to put attention to the full implementation of international human rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台湾通过同性婚姻法案-开创亚洲先河/a-48769839">Taiwan's right to do in LGBTQI's rights is amazing</a>Essence Of course, we must congratulate the Taiwan authorities through this legislation. Of course, you can do more. What else can you do?</p>
<p>At present, there is a problem with the equality bill, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣跨國同婚獨漏中國-台陸伴侶有苦難言/a-64484094">that is, it excludes one of the partners from Chinese nationality</a>Essence We understand the sensitivity of (cross -strait) issues, but we insist that this has created a discriminatory aspect -frankly, this can even be said to be a bit ridiculous, because if you are a heterosexual couple, there will be no such way to have these question. Why are this regulation imposed between same -sex partners? This is completely unreasonable. This is to make discrimination, and it does violate basic human rights standards. Therefore, we call on the authorities to review this specific clause and ensure that their spouses including Chinese citizens should be recognized by the Taiwan government. This is an example that can be adopted and should be taken immediately.</p>
<h3>524, we are married!</h3>
<p>Another problem is that those who need to change their legal gender identity must be underplayed by surgery. The position of international amnesty is that the mandatoryness in this specification is very problematic, it violates people's autonomy and the right to retain physical integrity. Of course, if individuals want to do such surgery, we welcomes and agree with this. However, when the surgery becomes compulsory, it is actually authorized the state to make a decision for "things that should not be determined by the state". When it involves physical integrity, it should be determined by individuals. Therefore, on this issue, we also call on the authorities to cancel the provisions of gender identity through mandatory surgery.</p>
<p><strong> Voice of Germany: What else do you want to add to this visit? </strong></p>
<p>Karamal: The key information brought to me this time is that Taiwan is a vibrant civil society. It has vibrant intellectuals. People are also committed to ensuring that Taiwan's human rights issues in this region play a leading role. At present, Taiwan has also done this in specific fields, including integration and the implementation of the five major international human rights conventions in China to pass international and expert review. In terms of LGBTQI rights, Taiwan has also made great progress, and many public and politicians have a clear commitment to human rights.</p>
<p>However, there are still some issues and themes that have not received the attention. Some of my visiting parts are also to focus on these issues, such as refugee issues. I once said that the Taiwan government actually signed the Refugee Convention before the membership of the United Nations membership was transferred to China, but so far, this contract has not been implemented (in Taiwan). The refugees who are sheltered will live in a state of lack of human rights and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of the main goals of my task this week is to ensure that Taiwan has the necessary legal framework to protect these refugees, so as not to drive them back. This includes seeking from Hong Kong, China, and other places from Syria, Uganda and other places. Shelter. For me, this is a blind spot for the Taiwan authorities and must be resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, the Taiwan authorities must also find methods to balance climate justice, indigenous people's rights and migrant rights. 12%of Taiwan's labor is from outside Taiwan, and the proportion is quite high. These workers must be completely protected by labor law. I sincerely admire the achievements that (Taiwan) has achieved here. At the same time, the international amnesty is also willing to give more support, so that Taiwan will continue to move in the direction of comprehensive human rights protection.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-04T10-16-23-08-00/30beinart-fzgj-master1050.jpg" />The Biden government recently announced two frustrating news: Iran <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/09/united-states-security-council-russia-iran-weapons-00101191">helps</a>Russia manufacture drones. China in Cuba <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230612/china-spy-base-cuba/">Operation</a>A spy base.</p>
<p>The information is clear: the enemy of the United States is united. With the recent statement of the new American Security Center in Washington, they now form a new "wigmist axis", threatening the interests of the US interests from East Asia to the Caribbean Sea and the Persian Gulf. This name implies that the government of Russia, China, Iran and Cuba is their common aversion to democracy. This is an attractive narrative for the Washington Foreign Policy Class that often describes the geopolitical struggle of the United States as a contest between freedom and tyranny.</p>
<p>But there is a problem in it. The Cuban government and the Iranian government seeking a closer relationship with Washington was just a few years ago, although the two countries had the same authoritarian political system at the time. They did not turn to Russia and China because they realized that they hated democracy. They suddenly turned because the United States rejected their favors and pushed them into the embrace of a great power with the United States. First under the leadership of Trump, and then under the leadership of President Bayeng, the US government participated in creating the anti -US partnership that it lamented now, which was exactly what the US government did during the last Cold War.</p>
<p>Take Cuba as an example. The Cuban government's strategy has always been quite clear for most of the time after the Cold War: maintaining the closure of its political system and investing in an open economy in foreign countries. This strategy requires a better relationship with Cuba and the United States, because US sanctions not only make Cuba unable to obtain the biggest potential resources of tourism and trade, but also scare away European companies. William Lao Leagran, an expert in the University of America, told me, "All the main components of the Cuban economic strategy in the past two decades are long -term expectations to improve relations with the United States."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>In 2014, this expectation began to be rewarded. The Obama administration announced the end of the United States for decades of hostility to the Cuban government. Soon, many well -known people began to show up in Havana, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/03/05/conan-obrien-goes-to-cuba-the-5-most-conan-moments/?variant=f27f5ed60de5b498">Conan Obrain</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-havana-gov-andrew-cuomo-urges-engagement-with-cuba-1429582209">Andrew Komo</a>And <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/steve-nash-cuba-trip">Steve Nash</a>Essence Just as the Cuban experts of the University of Miami Michael Bustatmant at the time <a href="https://www.e-ir.info/2015/05/07/cuba-and-the-united-states-beyond-the-hype-a-long-road/">point out</a>As the American flag has even become the most fashionable national flag, it appears on the Cuban's T -shirts, tight pants and vests. "</p>
<p>After Donald Trump entered the White House, all this broke. In 2019, Trump has implemented Cuba for more than half a century.(https://theconversation.com/trump-declares-economic-war-on-cuba-115672)Essence One month later, Cuba started <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/cuba-forced-into-rationing-as-us-sanctions-and-venezuela-crisis-bite">Quantitative distribution</a>Soap, eggs, rice and beans. According to the Wall Street Journal, at the same time, China ’s monitoring network on the island“ completed a significant upgrade ”(Cuba and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have denied reports on the deployment of monitoring facilities in Cuba). Evan Elis, an analyst at Latin American analyst at the School of War of the United States Army War, to the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cubas-spy-deal-with-china-has-echoes-of-cold-war-tensions-64e5022c">Said</a>The transaction between China and Cuba "basically is a paid game of China". He added that "China has provided the latter's urgent funds to Cuba and obtained the opportunity to set up monitoring." Last fall, China <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-wins-china-debt-relief-new-funds-2022-11-27/">Agree</a>Reorganized Cuba debt and donated $ 100 million to Cuba. Cuba still needs Chinese funds. One of the reasons is that the Bayeng government retains key sanctions during the Trump era.</p>
<p>The relationship between the United States and Iran also follows similar models. When the two countries signed the 2015 nuclear agreement, then Iranian Foreign Minister Muhammad Jvad Zarv <a href="https://twitter.com/jzarif/status/620946867371810816?lang=ar-x-fm">称</a>The agreement "is not the upper limit, but a solid foundation. We must start to continue to develop on this basis now." Like Cuban leaders, Iranian leaders have hoped that improving relations with the United States will stimulate Western investment. Although some hardliners in Iran are worried that establishing economic ties with the West will weaken the country's regime, President Zarve and Hazan Rouhani still bet on a stronger economy to strengthen Iran's regional position and resolve people's dissatisfaction, so as to It helps to consolidate the country's authoritarian political system.This is not the first time that the United States has pushed the small country into the embrace of its superpowers. The United States did this during the Cold War. Frederick Logvar in "Embers of War"(Embers of War)The book pointed out that until the end of the 1940s, Ho Chi Minh, a nationalist leader in Vietnam, always believed that the United States "may become a defender of Vietnam's independence cause" and helped the country get rid of the French colonial rule. During the "Second World War", Ho Chi Minh's rebellious army "Vietnam", in the battle between the United States and Japan, with the former Strategic Intelligence Agency with the CIA <a href="https://www.pritzkermilitary.org/explore/vietnam-war/history-vietnam#:~:text=The%20Viet%20Minh%2C%20as%20they,defeat%20of%20Japan%20in%201945.">Fighting on the shoulder</a>Essence</p>
<p>However, with the intensive tension of the Cold War, the Truman government ignored the views of its Asian issues -many of them believed that the "Vietnamese" was mainly a nationalist movement, not the communist movement -but supported France's maintenance of Maintenance The efforts of its imperialism. Since 1950, "Vietnam" has obtained weapons from Communist China.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Ten years later, the United States did similar things in Cuba. Fidel Castro began to re -assign wealth after he took power in early 1959 to modify the belongings of Cuba to the United States in history. Although Castro has a left -leaning tendency, William Lao Logland and Peter Cohen Bulu are in their co -authored "Informal Channel with Cuba"(BackChannel to Cuba)The book pointed out that Castro "did not show special preferences for the Soviet Union in the first year of governing." It wasn't until Castro's state -ownedization of large -scale plantations and led to the beginning of the plan to overthrow him that the Eisenhower government started to rely on Moscow's economic and military assistance. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's observation is that the hostility of the United States pushed Cuba "like iron dumbs towards magnets" to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Cold War should remind us that countries with similar political systems are not necessarily allies. During the Cold War, many American decision makers can maintain skepticism independence on the communist government in the Soviet Union. But this was exactly what happened to Yugoslavia. Josep Broz Tito parted ways with the Soviet Union in 1948, and later accepted US assistance. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union and China became opponents.</p>
<p>If even the government that shared Marxist ideology can not always get along well, there is no reason to think that authoritarianism can now become binding binders, so that China, Russia, Iran, and Iran, and Iran who can implement different forms of tyranny Cuba is united. There is no inevitable ideological connection between Havana and Beijing, or the growing security or military relationship between Tehran and Moscow. These alliances are largely because Washington tries to starve Cuba and let Iran yield, instead of establishing a working relationship with the political system and foreign policy orientation that we don't like.</p>
<p>Today, although sanctions have led to Iran and Cuba <a href="https://webassets.oxfamamerica.org/media/documents/bp-cuba-blockade-women-250521-en.pdf">ordinary people</a>Can't get <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/06/12/iran-sanctions-medicine/">food and medicine</a>Washington people still say that the United States cannot lift extensive sanctions on Iran and Cuba because these two countries are working with the enemy in the United States. Maybe the eagle people should consider this problem before they first contributed to these partnerships.</p>

<p><strong> General U.S. military general asked Musk? </strong></p>
<p>The Chinese subtitles below the video wrote, "The U.S. military convened a meeting to deal with China's increasing military threats. At the meeting, the U.S. General John Thompson asked Musk to ask Musk: How can the United States defeat China?"</p>
<p>In fact, this is the "Annual Air Battle Seminar" of the American Air Force Association, which is not a conference held in response to the threat of Chinese military. Thompson has stated at the beginning that the discussion on the same day focused on "innovation" and how to make the Air Force the most defense department the most. Innovative unit. As for Thompson's question about US -China relations, it is not "how the United States defeats China" written by subtitles.</p>
<p>At 47 minutes and 12 seconds in the full video, Thompson asked Musk that he had any ideas to share with the US -China or military competition between the United States and China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T10-19-00-04-00/000004.png" />The host of the conference and General U.S. Army Thompson explained that the theme of discussion on the day was innovation. (Figure cut from DVIDS website) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-07042023100850.html/3-7f8e8ecd4e0a5c076e6f666e68ee572820205e7476847a7a623078148a0e67034e0a8207727965af62c957f7884c957799ac65af514b5c0d8ac7-958b583466428aaa660e757659298a0e8ad6527565b030025716622a81eadvids7db27ad9.png">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T10-19-00-04-00/000005.png)</a><strong> How did Musk answer? </strong></p>
<p>The subtitle explanation below the video said: "Musk said in a calm and firm tone:‘ the United States cannot defeat China ’.”</p>
<p>When Musk spoke, the Chinese translation in the video was: "<strong> If the United States wants to defeat China by military, the United States must overcome the huge gap between the Chinese and American economies. If the United States does not have innovative ways, the United States will lose. If the United States has always been unreasonable, the United States can only be the second child in the United States. This is the truth that even elementary school students understand. What surprised Americans is that </strong> China's economy is two or three times that of the United States, at least two have been two, at least two have been two, at least two have already been two. More than **, I believe that people with common sense know that the foundation of war is economy. "</p>
<p>The bottom line and body in the previous quotation are added by the Laboratory of the Asian facts. This is two wrong translations. First, Musk did not say, "The Chinese economy is two or three times that of the United States, at least twice as much". What he said is the future tense, that is, "the Chinese economy will be two or three times that of the US economy. At least twice.</p>
<p>Secondly, Musk did not say, "If the United States wants to defeat China for military", he said: "In order to make the United States competitive in military." In addition, the translation of "if the United States has always been thinking for progress" is inaccurate, Musk's original text is: "If there is no fundamental innovation"</p>
<p>What's more important is that in this question and answer on the American and Chinese competition, Musk did not say that Chinese subtitles emphasized: "The United States cannot defeat China."</p>
<p><strong> Musk called on the United States to maintain an innovative advantage </strong><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>In this discussion on innovation, Musk is emphasizing the importance of scientific and technological innovation in comprehensive national strength and calling on the United States to maintain innovation advantages. The original intention of Ske and the talks misleads the audience.</p>

Some comments believe that the authorities issue a wanted order with a high attitude.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st-07032023232406.html">Hong Kong rewards, wanted overseas dissidents, American criticism is a dangerous precedent</a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/jw-07032023095306.html"><strong> The third anniversary of the National Security Law Hong Kong wanted 8 people in the name of "endangering national security" </strong></a>The eight Hong Kong people who have been fled overseas and are suspected of endangering national security include three former Legislative Council members Xu Zhifeng, Luo Guancong, and Guo Rongzheng. The eight were wanted by the Hong Kong Police State Security Department. Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao said on July 4 that the Hong Kong government will hunt for life. The wanted person to end the wanted career, there is only one way to surrender.</p>
<p>Tang Jiazhen, a member of the Hong Kong Executive Council and a senior barrister, acknowledged that it was difficult for the Hong Kong government to request a foreign government to extradite people who were suspected of violating the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District to return to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Tang Jiazheng: "All national security crimes, not only Hong Kong, China, and countries in the world are the same. They are political crimes. According to the guidelines of the United Nations and Hong Kong law, the transfer of suspects is not applicable. It is not applicable. Because the basic principles of our law have never changed, they cannot be required to be transferred to some politicians. Regardless of whether he committed a political crime or a political crime. "</p>
<p>The legal profession and the time critic Samp believe that the eight -person wanted order of the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police seemed to be very casual, in order to scare overseas Hong Kong people.</p>
<p>Sanpu: "It (Hong Kong Government) has not stated that the eight people are wanted for what specific reasons. The purpose of its (wanted order) is not aimed at those eight people, but for many surrounding people who engage in proposal human rights and community building work. People, both in Taiwan or the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia (Australia), "are there."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T10-24-00-04-00/000002.png" />Time Critics Sanpu said that the eight -person wanted order of the Hong Kong Government was aimed at scareing people from foreign Hong Kong people. (Sangpu is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf-07042023074708.html/m0704gf-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T10-24-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Several Congress of the United States sent a letter to the Secretary of State Brillin last month, asking Washington not to invite Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao to attend the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC) summit in November in San Francisco. Sanpu estimates that the Hong Kong government hopes to take the opportunity to test the bottom line of the United States.</p>
<p>Sanpu: "It is a difficult way to force the United States to express the attitude of the United States in a more tough way. It is critical to get the United States into a problem to invite Li Jiachao to the United States. It is critical to respond to this matter in the United States."</p>
<p>Eight wanted Hong Kong people are in the United States, Britain, Australia and other countries. Wang Xinli, a researcher at the Chinese Chinese Strategic Foreign Prospective Society, believes that once they leave the country, there will be variables in safety.</p>
<p>Wang Xinli: "The safety of eight people should be indifferent, but if they move abroad one day, they may ask for arrest when they move abroad to a country with criminal extradition with mainland China or Hong Kong."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T10-24-00-04-00/000004.png" />Taiwanese scholar Wang Xinzhi (pictured) said that if the eight wanted Hong Kong people left their country, they would have a variable. (Wang Xinli is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf-07042023074708.html/m0704gf-2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T10-24-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> The United States and Britain criticize the Hong Kong police wanted overseas Hong Kong people </strong></p>
<p>The US State Department spokesman condemned the Hong Kong police to want eight overseas Hong Kong people, and believed that it was a precedent for threatening the human rights and basic freedom of the world. British Foreign Minister Clever also said that Britain strongly opposed China to suppress Hong Kong's freedom by the National Security Law. Among the eight people who were wanted, some people were in the UK, which was another example of the influence of legal authority in China.</p>
<p>Scholar Wang Xinzhi estimates that the Hong Kong Government has already taken into account the strong response of the international community's wanted order.</p>
<p>Wang Xinli: "Mainland China or the Hong Kong Government doesn't care about the so -called international sanctions. Their current thinking is 'national security is higher than everything'."</p>
<p>Time reviewers Sanpu said that China's "war wolf diplomacy" is gradually expanding. The Hong Kong government has taken off the packaging of "one country, two systems" and stood on the same line as Beijing. Essence</p>

<p>US Finance Minister Jennte Yellen, Bank of the World Bank Ajay Banga, and many world leaders witnessed Zambian President Hakand Chichema to pick up the microphone. At that time, the scene was: June 24th, French President Emartel Macron presided over the Paris Summit, which was brainstorm and discussed the solution to the debt crisis that swept developing countries.</p>
<p>For Zambia, this is a breathing. In 2020, after suffering the new crowns, Zambia became the first African country to default in sovereignty debt. In Paris, the largest loan institution, including China and Western countries, agreed to(G20)Promoting the reorganization of Zambia's $ 6.3 billion loan.</p>
<p>However, after thanks to France, China, South Africa and other countries in the negotiations, Chicorima proposed a warning, and he pointed out that the Zambian debt restructuring plan was approved after more than two years of negotiations. Chicorma said, " "For the country that follows us, the process needs to be accelerated," he added, "we cannot deliver these things within the scope of our control every day. We are basically increasing costs and damage will become more serious. "</p>
<p>Teams like Zambia who seek debt reorganization are still increasing.</p>
<p>Today, most low -income developers are either in debt dilemma or close to debt dilemma. At the same time, public debt between the United States and China, the two major economies in the world, is expected to increase significantly compared with the outbreak of the epidemic.</p>
<p>Ghana and Sri Lanka owed foreign debt in 2022. Bigzibia was two years later. Pakistan and Egypt were on the edge of breach of contract. On June 30, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund Organization(IMF)A temporary financing agreement of $ 3 billion was reached and promised to provide potential short -term relief.</p>
<p>The level of global public debt is still very high -by the end of 2022, it will account for GDP(GDP)92% - Despite the decline in the record level of the new crowns, the level of public debt reached 100% of the GDP at the end of 2020 at the end of 2020.</p>
<p>So, will the debt crisis spread to the world? Is the risk facing low -income countries much higher than that of other countries? Will all countries be forced to accept harsh rescuers? What measures can financial institutions such as rich countries and international currency funds and the World Bank to relieve pain?</p>
<p><strong> The brief answer is: </strong> The growing debt of the poor country is shocking, but there is no evidence that this spread may trigger a global crisis. However, economists and debt management experts say Relatively newer creditors, all parties, including China and private sectors, jointly participate in debt restructuring agreements to accelerate the economic recovery and avoid repeating the debt crisis in the 1980s. The country is many years.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-04T10-43-07/1-1688465785.png" />On November 5, 2022, Ghana Kra, the protesters held a demonstration, opposing the depreciation of the Ghanasus, rising fuel prices, and general economic difficulties caused by the debt crisis of West Africa (Agence France -Presse)</p>
<h4>collapse</h4>
<p>The popularity of the new crowns has destroyed global economic activities, leading to shortage of income and increasing government expenditure, in order to protect the economy from economic slowdown and disadvantage of layoffs. As a result, the proportion of global public debt has soared from 84%at the end of 2019 to one year The latter 100%.</p>
<p>Poor countries -the most serious blow to the public health crisis -it has to rely more on external loans to survive.</p>
<p>About 60%of low -income developing countries are now facing high risk or in debt dilemma, and they have or about to start the debt restructuring process. This number is 40%before the outbreak of the epidemic.</p>
<p>In February 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine was fully invaded, which made debt conditions worse. This war led to rising global commodities and food prices.</p>
<p>Ueogo Panza, a professor of economics at the Institute of International and Development, Geneva International and Development(Ugo Panizza)Tell the Peninsula TV, "Now that inflation is up again, it means that the main central bank raises interest rates, which leads to a high cost of debt repayment, which is a problem for low -income and middle -income countries."</p>
<p>A total of 52 developing countries -having half of the world's extremely poor people -are facing serious debt problems and high lending costs.</p>
<p>As often occurred during the crisis, as investors demand for US dollars that investors are regarded as security assets increase, compared with most emerging economies and currencies of developed economies, the US dollar appreciates in 2022. Due to most cross -border loan The international debt is denominated in the US dollar, which in turn makes the cost of low -income countries' performers in performing debt obligations.</p>
<p>Researcher Juds Seson, a researcher who specializes in private investment and financial development, told the Peninsula Television, which specializes in private investment and financial development. That way, Sydi collapsed, and your ability to repay debts will be greatly damaged. "</p>
<p>"The high level of US dollars and interest rates may last for several years. This is a serious problem."</p>
<p>From January to October 2022, Ghana currency depreciated by more than 50%, resulting in Ghana's debt burden increased by $ 6 billion. Ghana owed most of the foreign debt last December. The repayment of foreign debt is reduced by half to ensure that it has obtained a $ 3 billion loan agreement from the International Monetary Fund as part of its debt reorganization.</p>
<p>However, the dilemma of Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia, and other dozens of other dozens of crumbling of the country at the edge of the contract is not unprecedented.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-04T10-43-07/1-1688465845.png" />On Friday, October 9, 2015, in Peru Lima, a protesters held a slogan near the police with Spanish saying "International Monetary Fund and the World Bank rolling out". The police prevented the protesters from approaching international currencies Fund Organization and the World Bank held an annual meeting venue (Associated Press)</p>
<h4>"Lost Ten Years"</h4>
<p>The impact of oil prices in the 1970s led to high inflation. In 1981, the central banks of various countries increased interest rates to control prices, which led to a decline in the global economy.</p>
<p>As many as 16 Latin American countries and 11 other underdeveloped countries led by Mexico have to re -arrange their debt periods, triggering the first global debt crisis.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, it was also known as "lost ten years" because many developed countries agreed to reduce infrastructure, hygiene and educational expenditures in exchange for debt restructuring. Some countries' income level at the end of this decade was lower than 1980. EssenceBrugel, headquarters in Brucel's economic think tank(Bruegel)Director Jerumin Zetmel co -authored in April with other people entitled "Does a low -income country facing another debt crisis? "The paper, he told the Peninsula TV station that the current debt status is similar to the impact of the past, and there are also differences.</p>
<p>Jelo Ming Zetmel said, "Most sovereign debt crisis will experience high (budget) deficit and debt accumulation before the occurrence of sovereign debt crisis. Some crises are caused by the rise in actual interest rates," he added, "Therefore, there, so, therefore, therefore These factors of sovereign debt crisis already exist now. "</p>
<p>However, Georumin Zetmel said that he lacked other "ingredients" and pointed out that this crisis was not just the repeat of the crisis before the world. Some poorer countries are also the main exporters of oil, natural gas and minerals. The decline in commodity prices has damaged their income, but the price of commodities is relatively high. "</p>
<p>Zetmel said that the debt crisis does not seem to be global. In the worst case, the debt crisis may be limited to developing countries. The vulnerability of the country's debt is far less worrying as that in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Zetmel said that the economic fundamentals of poor countries also look stronger than the 1980s and the 1990s.</p>
<p>Taking Sri Lanka and Zambia as an example, Zetmel said that the defaults of the two countries are the result of poor domestic economic management, and the popularity of new crowns has exacerbated this situation.</p>
<p>However, in these two cases, due to the emergence of a new main participant: China, a solution to solving the debt crisis has spread from the global financial sector to the geopolitical field.</p>

<h4>Where does the funds come from?</h4>
<p>Traditionally, poor countries mainly borrow from the so -called Paris club creditors, most of which are richer countries such as the United States, Britain, Australia, and Germany, as well as multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund or African Development Bank.</p>
<p>However, in the past 20 years, Chinese and private bond holders have become important lenders in these countries.</p>
<p>The proportion of foreign debt of low -income and middle -income countries owed Paris Club creditors decreased from 28%in 2006 to 11%in 2020. At the same time, the proportion owed to China rose sharply from 2%to 18%. The share of European bonds (international bonds for currencies outside the issuer) increased from 3% to 11%.</p>
<p>China holds more than half of the foreign debt of Zambia, and Sri Lanka owes more than 10%of the repayment of Beijing. In fact, the Group 20 Group "suspend debt repayment initiative"(Debt Service Suspension Initiative)——Based on the initiative, from May 2020 to December 2021, among the 73 countries that paid debts to creditors due to the popularity of the new crowns, China is now the largest official bilateral credit country.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate more and more private participants such as China and more and more private participants into the process of multilateral debt reduction, the G20 Group established a "common framework" in 2020 to coordinate the Paris Club and other major bilateral creditors such as China, India, and Saudi Arabia. Debt processing of low -income countries.</p>
<p>But three years later, it turned out that this common framework was not very successful. Only Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia and Ghana requested it to use it. Zambia became the first country to reach an agreement with the official creditors committee.</p>
<p>In one case after another -whether it is Sri Lanka or Zambia -negotiations have been accused of shadowing the game. Western countries have accused China of delaying the agreed restructuring plan, thereby delaying the process, and Beijing denies these charges.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that the real problem may be deeper.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-04T10-43-07/1-1688465926.png" />French President Emartel Macron and Kenya President William Rudo were shaking hands to discuss the global economy (Reuters) during the new Global Financial Agreement Summit in the Bloomnia Palace in Paris, France on June 22, 2023, 2023.</p>
<h4>"Design Error"</h4>
<p>These experts believe that the design of the universal framework itself limits its chances of success.</p>
<p>This framework follows the step -by -step method of the Paris Club, the debt country starts the reorganization process, and then implements the economic reform plan supported by the International Monetary Fund. The debt country fully discloses all its loan commitments. Similar (even if it is not matched) relief.</p>
<p>At the same time, multilateral development banks such as the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank enjoys the status of priority creditors, which means that their sovereign debt repay is preferential to other creditors.</p>
<p>China demands this change and requires multilateral development banks to reduce the debt restructuring of Zambia and Sri Lanka like commercial creditors and foreign governments.</p>
<p>The Owen Law Firm International Law and Policy Expert Thomas Larrya specially provides consulting services for international financial affairs for government and creditors. He told Peninsula Television, "The purpose of a general framework is to achieve this, but one of the weaknesses, but one of the weaknesses, but one of the weaknesses, but one of the weaknesses, It was designed around the old Paris club process. I think this is a design error. "</p>
<p>Zetmel agrees with this.</p>
<p>Thomas Larrya said: "New participants, especially the largest loan country and China, are a bit cautious about simply following the rules of Western game rules," he added that the core role of the International Monetary Fund also irritated Beijing, " The main difficulty is that China does not want to entrust the decision of debt reduction to such institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, it has been reluctant to sign the Western debt restructuring procedure. "</p>
<p>Laria also criticized the common framework of "reducing private creditors into the remaining creditors".</p>
<p>According to the current procedures, bilateral government loan institutions have negotiated with liabilities on liability countries. Private creditors are expected to abide by the terms of these agreements. Laria said that this is "a major mistake, because private creditors are important sources of financing in some countries." Essence</p>
<p>Personal lenders who are dissatisfied often refuse to match the conditions provided by bilateral creditors, thereby delaying the debt restructuring process.</p>
<p>Tyson of the Overseas Development Research Institute believes that one of the ways to solve this problem are to actively participate in the reorganization process, rather than trying to reach a consensus on the terms that they decide without consulting them.</p>
<p>People are increasingly recognizing the necessity of changes. Earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the GAT of 20 set up the Global Sovereign Debt Round Table Meeting (GSDR) to repair the common framework and speed up the debt that has faced delayed debts. Reorganize.</p>
<p>Larrya said that in the final analysis, if the debt of a country becomes unable to repay, no one will benefit.</p>

The first time was affected by the new crown epidemic in 2020, the summit originally scheduled to be held in St. Petersburg was changed online.<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访中俄是否将上合组织变成反西方联盟/a-63149734">Founded in Shanghai, led by China -Russia -led SCO, June 15, 2001</a>Member states include China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, India, Pakistan, etc. The organization is regarded as a political, economic and security organization that comes to the Western structure.</p>
<p>Iran is expected to be accepted as a member country at the summit.

If these two countries with observer and maintain close contact with Moscow become members of the SCO, the organization will expand its sphere of influence in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Modi was invited by US President Biden to visit the United States two weeks ago. The two countries declared that each other was "one of the most intimate partners in the world." In addition to the SCO Summit, India is also the rotating chairman of the G20 this year. As Moscow invaded Ukraine last year, and Beijing was increasingly tough on the global geopolitical stage, which led to tight relations between Western countries and Russia and China, India has taken a difficult route in diplomacy. Putin talked with Modi last week to discuss the consequences of the Wagner's mutiny. In the discussion, Modi once again called for the Russian crisis through dialogue and diplomatic channels. Putin and Xi Jinping are expected to go to New Delhi to participate in the G20 summit in September. U.S. President Biden and leaders of other member states will also attend. India refuses to blame Russia's responsibility on the Russian and Ukraine War, and significantly increases the purchase of Russia's oil, making bilateral trade a new record, which angered some Western countries.</p>
<p>The summit was also the first time that Modi and Xi Jinping attended the first time after the last G20 summit last year after the last G20 summit. The relationship between these two Asian countries with nuclear weapons has not been harmonious because of border disputes. The summit will also discuss various issues such as Afghanistan, terrorism, regional security, and climate change.</p>

<p>The 23rd meeting of the head of the head of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization was held in India on July 4th. Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the meeting in a video, emphasizing that the members of the SCO members should increase unity and mutual trust between members of the SCO organizations, be alert to inciting "New Cold War" in the region, to oppose any country to interfere with the internal affairs, and motivate the "Color Revolutionary Revolutionary Revolutionary Revolutionary Revolutionary Revolution. ", Independently formulate foreign policies and control their destiny in their own hands.</p>
<p>This speech has aroused heated discussion on the Chinese social media outside China's online firewall. Some netizens satirized on Twitter that "white is also a color." The meaning of the white paper movement that happened in China at the end of last year may be the so -called color revolution that Xi Jinping watched. Others said in an analysis that the Chinese destiny is indeed now in the hands of Xi Jinping. Now he requires that the boss of SCO member states also copied homework. However, Xi Jinping's homework was bad and he could not master his destiny. Some netizens said straightforwardly, "A government that does not serve the people, the people have reason to launch the color revolution to overturn it."</p>
<p>In addition, Xi Jinping emphasized that the "New Cold War" may also be pointed out on the occasion of the SCO. Two weeks ago, during the visit to Washington, the Indian Prime Minister Modi announced that the United States and India announced that the two countries were one of the "closest partnerships in the world". Essence At that time, some comments pointed out that this shows that the United States tried to strengthen cooperation with India to compete to counter challenges from China.</p>

The plan is to start the sea around the summer.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2011, a serious accident occurred after the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station experienced a severe earthquake and tsunami, including the melting of cores. For more than 12 years, the destroyed reactor must continue to cool with water. Due to the penetration of rain and groundwater, the amount of water contaminated by radioactive pollution is increasing every day. Today, there are more than 1.3 million tons of water in about 1,000 pools. Tokyo Electric Power Company of Fukushima said that there is no additional space for accommodation. Therefore, these water will be purified by a pipeline that extends about one kilometer in the sea and discharged with seawater.</p>
<p>However, the water treatment system called Alps cannot make <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/含氚核废水真的不会危害健康/a-57184856">radioactive element 氚</a>Filtered. Dongdian and the International Atomic Energy Agency believe that this will not bring risks, because after the water is diluted, the content of crickets is very low, which is harmless to humans and the environment. According to Germany, professionals said that nuclear power plants around the world regularly will regularly receive polluted cooling water for decades <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日本确定排福岛核废水入海-邻国表示反对/a-57178163">discharge into the sea</a>Essence According to the Kyodo News Agency, the diluted activity was less than one -fix of national standards.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Fishing and survival</h3>
<p>When cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly recovered. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Place of cooling water</h3>
<p>The damaged Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station scene at the scene of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is the focus of controversy. According to the authorities, these water storage tanks must be removed before rebuilding. These water is mainly used for cooling reactors after the disaster.</p>

<h3>cooling water is safe?</h3>
<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<h3>In control?</h3>
<p>The radiation test standards cited by the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation and the Tokyo government are stricter than other countries that are also discharged. This release has also been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "We have equipment to make water safe." Tomohikomayuzum, a spokesman for Tokyo Power Company, told Reuters.</p>

<h3>Fish in the wastewater tank</h3>
<p>In order to prove the processed water innocence and harmless, Tokyo Electric Power Company is breeding fishes in the water tank of the abandoned Fukushima first nuclear power plant. Toshihirowada at the University of Fukushima said that it can understand the fishermen's concerns. He said that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation announced that the emission of polluting water was "unfortunate" for the fisheries that have just recovered in the region.#</p>
<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3>Sprinkle salt on the wound?</h3>
<p>Fisherman Ono Haruki poured the fish he captured into a water tank. He was angry at Tokyo Electric Power Company: "The ocean is not a trash can." He said in an interview with Reuters and asked, "Why do you put water to the waters of Fukushima, why not put water to Tokyo or Osaka?" He said, he said, The people in the region have suffered sufficient pain, and now they have suffered more pain.</p>

<h3>The future of fishermen</h3>
<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T11-34-00-04-00/000002.png" />On July 4, 2023, President Tsai Ing-wen met with 6 Republican Hern (RSC) chairman of the Federal House of Representatives (RSC), and 6 members led by Kevin Hern (R-OK) visited the delegation. (Reuters) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-07042023082643.html/2023-07-04t063645z_1572311842_rc26w1ahv0d2_rtrmadp_3_taiwan-usa.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T11-34-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Regarding the endless visits to Taiwan, how to transform the increasing concern into the issue of support for Taiwan, Li Chun responded that people outside Taiwan were affected by false information and thought that the situation in Taiwan was very dangerous, and the people were nervous. Visit Taiwan through foreign guests to feel the current situation of Taiwan. He said, "They will see that Taiwan is very calm, no provocative, and no dangerous movements. We face China's intimidation and threats and show strong toughness."</p>
<p>Li Chun pointed out that a key information that Taiwan hopes to convey to a guest is that "China's threat is real, but it should not be a factor that hinders investment and technology."</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan security is related to global interests </strong></p>
<p>Some reporters asked that the purpose of receiving the delegation was to convince the delegation and investors to believe that Taiwan had a safe and reliable investment environment. On the other hand, it was necessary to convey the urgency and warning of China's threat to the delegation. Is it contradictory?</p>
<p>"In my personal opinion, I haven't seen the conflict between these two areas." Li Chun explained to ensure that Taiwan's security is very direct. Taiwan hopes to cooperate with democratic countries and establish a collective deterrence mechanism. This is Ensure the most effective way to ensure the safety of Taiwan. This is not only for Taiwan, but also for their interests, but also for regional and even global security and prosperity.</p>
<p>Li Chun emphasized that deterrence is the most effective tool to avoid military conflicts. It is not provocative: "When we invite and seek cooperation to establish a collective deterrence mechanism, it is not because Taiwan is in a dangerous danger. The situation, I hope to start working hard now to avoid the worst situation. "</p>
<p><strong> Establishing dialogue channels in the United States and China can avoid misjudgment of the United States' strategic position without changing. </strong>Li Chun analyzed that the US -China strategic competition will continue in the next ten years, or even longer; while competing, it is necessary to avoid misunderstanding or conflict due to misunderstandings. Therefore Related to interests in the United States, China, and Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea have developed a good and active development. At present, it has not seen any changes in the United States' basic strategic position in China.</p>
<p><strong> Chinese chip is in the future or competes with Taiwan </strong></p>
<p>In October last year, the United States issued a chip ban on China, restricting the export of chip production equipment below 14 nanometers to China. Recently, the Netherlands has also announced the latest semiconductor equipment control measures, requiring the manufacturing equipment industry to export DUV(Deep ultraviolet light)The lithography machine must apply for permission.</p>
<p>For the prospects of China's semiconductor industry, Li Chun, a financial scholar, analyzed that according to the US export control measures, China will be difficult to obtain advanced process equipment and materials, and development will slow down. However, the purpose of the United States is to curb the development of Chinese military and civilians, and it has not intended to eliminate China's semiconductor industry. In the future, China will invest more resources and develop a mature process semiconductor, which will inevitably impact some Taiwanese operators, but this can also accelerate the upgrade of the industry in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Li Chun emphasized that Taiwan's semiconductor is not completely ahead of science and technology. For 30 years, the trust relationship established between Taiwan and customers has not been smashed with budgets. He is convinced that even if facing the competition in China's mature process in the future, Taiwan can continue to maintain the trust relationship with customers.</p>

It will be implemented from August 1.</p>
<p>The announcement pointed out that export operators should go through export permit procedures in accordance with relevant regulations and apply to the Ministry of Commerce through provincial business authorities.

<p><strong> Experts: US -China scientific and technological warfires affect the global semiconductor supply chain changes </strong></p>
<p>Liu Peizhen said: "In 2022, the part of the cricket is mainly based on Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Germany, Malaysia. Carbonized and fourth category of oxidation. The first category is mainly impacted by the substrate industry, and the second category will be affected by related negatives. The second and third categories must be observed closely. The situation requires follow -up observation. At present, the US -China science and technology war still affects the changes in global semiconductor supply chain. "</p>
<p>When the Chinese Ministry of Commerce set up a ban on export semiconductor -related materials, it coincided with the eve of the US Treasury Minister's visit to China. Liu Peizhen analyzed that China began to adopt anti -countermeasures. After visiting the U.S. Secretary of State Brills and met Xi Jinping, the US -China scientific and technological war did not seem to stop.</p>
<p>Liu Peizhen said: "Previously, in July, I am afraid that in July, I am afraid that there will be a further expansion of the AI -related chips in China, which has led China to take stocks that can hold corresponding sanctions and chips related to the United States."</p>
<p>Liu Peizhen analyzed that, in addition to the so -called safety review of Micron's so -called safety review before, this stage has not passed the export control of 镓 and 锗 materials at this stage. The supply chain adds uncertain factors to the complex situation of the global semiconductor industry and the complex situation of competition in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>Li Chun, the second director of the Taiwan Foreign Ministry, was asked at a press conference on the 4th on the 4th that the incident may have a shortage in the short term, and the price may be higher. The source of supply, or cooperate with like -minded countries, should improve the situation. In terms of strategies and long -term goals, Taiwan should move towards the level of improvement of strategy.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun, director of the National Institute of Defense Strategy and Resources of Taiwan Defense Safety Research Institute, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that there are currently some nitride chips of semiconductors. , But the amount is small, it is estimated that if the raw material increases by 10%to 15%, it will affect the total sales profit of less than 1%.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun analyzed: "The annual output value of 年 is only about 3.73 million yuan. Beijing also knows that this ban is symbolic, which has a small impact on the industry. It is only used as a political chip for the seller."</p>
<p>Su Ziyun said: "The amount of 蕴 China accounts for 95%, and the other 5%are distributed in Ukraine, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Out directly from the mine, it is indeed a absolute majority of China, but why is it unattended? You can also produce by -products from aluminum. "</p>
<p><strong> Rare earth war pre -war, countries have alternative plans </strong></p>
<p>Su Ziyun mentioned that in 2014, China launched a rare earth war, and the industries of various countries were caught off guard. After nine years, it was prepared. Former US President Trump proposed to strengthen the security report of the defense industry chain at the time, and pointed out that some industrial products in China have safety problems, and similar metals such as rare earths, crickets, and 锗 have also been monopolized by China, requiring the industry to provide solutions.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun said that there are many sources of alternatives to various countries, including by -products of re -mining, re -aluminum refining, redesigning products to reduce the demand for 镓, and strengthen the recycling of rare metals. By.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun also pointed out that according to the statistics of Chinese customs, the export volume of 镓 in 2022 was 92 metric tons, and the world's required amount was about 350 to 400 metric tons, of which about 200 metric tons were met from aluminum. China's crickets in the market account for about a quarter of the world's needs, and China has the largest number of underground storage in China, about 190,000 metric tons.</p>

<p>__ (Voice of Germany Chinese Network) Broken windows, burning cars, and residences of the French mayor have been attacked. This is just a few days in the past few days <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/法國動亂遇害少年祖母籲停止暴力/a-66096894">large -scale riots in France</a>Some of the scenes.</p>
<p>Thousands of people on the streets across France, and some expressed violently to express the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/警察枪杀少年事件在法国引发大规模暴力抗议/a-66067433">17 -year -old Algerian teenager Nael M (Nael M) was shot shot by police in the suburbs of Paris</a>Angry.</p>
<p>The conflict between the demonstrators and the police, dominated by young people.</p>
<p>Another topic has also surfaced, that is, Nair's killing and the riots and anger it triggered, how to associate with the systemic racism issues inside French society and the country's long colonial history.</p>
<p>French President Macron said Nael's killing was "unbearable" and "unpredictable". Crystalfleming, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York, disagreed: "This is not an impossible explanation," she told Germany. "This is not a mystery, this is racism."</p>
<p>Fleming added that the protests and riots broke out after the police shot by the police were "reactions to French racism related to colonialism." The two are usually denied by the French authorities and politicians and wiped out from collective memory -although the country has made racial compression for centuries of ethnic minorities and the colonial population.</p>
<h3>France is still troubled by its colonial history</h3>
<p>France is indeed one of the largest colonial countries in Europe. From the 16th century to the 1970s, like leaders in many other European countries, French leaders believed that their "civilized mission mission" was legitimate and rationalized its mandatory exploitation of countries and territories around the world.</p>
<p>In 1789, the French Revolution promised to bring the concept of "freedom, equality, and fraternity" to all men in France (women are not included, but that is another theme that needs to be expanded), and those people living in colonies daily life Life is full of oppression and can only dream of equal rights. Everyone was forced to "assimilate" the language and culture of France.</p>
<p>The relationship between France and Algeria is particularly sensitive. This North African country was colonized for the first time in 1830 and was later incorporated into France. When Algeria wanted to regain sovereignty, a brutal war broke out and captured hundreds of thousands of people's lives, most of which were Algerians, and eventually caused France to end its rule in 1962.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-04T11-51-00Z/59492815_401.png" />The history of France and Algeria is particularly complicated</p>
<p>At the same time, France was forced to abandon its control of other colonies, which mainly attributed to the success of the independent movement. However, some overseas territories still exist so far, and France still maintains economic, political and military influence in its previous colonies, especially on the African continent, such as maintaining their own interests by supporting authoritarian leaders.</p>
<p>The current French President Macron is more acknowledged that France's colonial history is a "historical crime" than any of his former national yuan capital. He vowed to be stolen and set up a committee to investigate the role of France during the extinction of France in Algeria and Rwanda.</p>
<p>But critics such as Fleming believe that this is not enough. Many people think that France should take full responsibility for past crimes, such as acknowledging its crimes committed in the colonial rule.</p>
<p>But Macron said he did not intend to "seek forgiveness" on France on the Algerian issue because it would "break all the links and contacts."</p>
<h3>"The French government continues to portray itself as non -racists"</h3>
<p>French society and textbooks have always claimed that colonialism has its own positive side. [2017, Marine Le Pen, a very right -wing politician]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/勒庞vs马克龙-政策背对背-选你没商量/a-38594775)It means that the French colonial "has brought a lot" to its former colony. In 2017 and 2022, Le Pen entered the final round of French presidents, which also shows how common this idea and thinking are.</p>
<p>At the same time, "the French government continues to depict itself as non -racists." Fleming said that in fact, France has long described itself as "color blindness", which means that it does not collect the census of the population of its citizen races or Other related data.</p>
<p>However, many immigrant descendants who went to protest on the street did not feel this. "French police have systematic racism," said Rokhayadiallo, a famous French racial activist and writer, and Rokhayadiallo. The French government has repeatedly denied this allegations.</p>
<p>According to a study by the human rights supervisor of the country, young men who are considered to be blacks or Arabs are probably 20 times more likely to be intercepted by the French police. Many of these people can go back to the former colonies of France. They currently live in the so -called suburbs of Banlieues, such as Paris, Marseille, or Lyon.</p>
<p>Just as the writer Johny Pits ("Afropean-Notes from Blackeurope" described in his book "Afropean-Notes from Bladeurope", these suburbs are actually now loved by many people. And the mission to cherish the development of Paris City Development. In the middle of the 19th century, Napoleon III relied on the wealth mainly from the African colonies to entrust urban planners Georges-Eugene Haussmann to build a New Paris with wider streets and better drainage systems.</p>
<p>Those who have less budget were rushed to the suburbs. After the Second World War, high -rise buildings were built due to economic growth encouraging immigration migration.</p>
<p>These suburbs have always been ignored by the French government. Former President Sarkozy recommended to clean the suburbs with a high -pressure cleaning machine in 2005.</p>
<p>Since then, some plans have been formulated and have been discussed, but they have not changed much.</p>
<p>A resident who lives in NANTERRE told the Voice of Germany reporter SoniaPhalnikar. It was the French government created "this poverty" and added: "I know poverty and" Misery. But we seem to be unable to get rid of it. "</p>

<p>Grossi, General Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), began a four -day visit to Japan on Tuesday (July 4). He will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kanada and announce the final safety review report for Fukushima nuclear treatment water.</p>
<p>It is expected that the report will approve the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station in the next 30 to 40 years to discharge processed nuclear waste water into the sea. Japan plans to release 1.3 trillion tons of water to the sea, but this plan has triggered a strong response from neighbors, including China, and local fishermen are also worried that this will affect fishery reputation.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Japan said on Tuesday that the IAEA report cannot be a "pass" for Japan to discharge water to the sea. It cannot prove the legitimacy and legitimacy of Japanese emissions treatment water, and it cannot be exempted from Japan's responsibility for moral responsibility.</p>
<p>The South Korean government revealed that Grones visited Seoul from 7 to 9 to explain the results of the investigation of Fukushima's treatment of water.</p>
<p>Kyodo News reported on Sunday that in order to strive to start the treatment of water into the sea in order to strive to strive for the summer, the use of the underwater tunnels and other equipment has been completed. Dongdian showed the use of the cutting device to stop providing water training when the emergency situation occurred, promoted "safety", and tried to eliminate strong concerns about the treatment of water for the treatment of water.</p>
<p>Operator training started in December last year. The training using the simulator began in May this year. It is said that after the sea is rowed, they will continue to train at a frequency of one and a half months.</p>
<p>Dongdian plans to use a large amount of seawater to dilute water to reduce the activity of the cricket to one -fourth of the national standard, and then discharge from the sea tunnel from about 1 kilometer away. However, it is not easy to understand the understanding of fishermen who oppose the sea.</p>

The tension between the two countries is disturbing the global market.</p>
<p>Four years later, when Treasury Minister Jennite Yellen was about to arrive in Beijing, despite the tone of Bayeng's government, many economic policy issues that continued to deteriorate between the United States and China still exacerbated and even exacerbated.</p>
<p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are still effective. President Biden has been working hard to limit China's key technologies such as semiconductors. New restrictions on US investment in China are about to be introduced.</p>
<p>Yellen will arrive in Beijing on Thursday to conduct a four -day visit. Officials of the US Treasury have faded the expectations of a major breakthrough in this visit. They believe that her meeting with senior Chinese officials aims to improve the communication between the world's two largest economies. However, the situation between the United States and China is still highly nervous, and the dialogue between Yellen and peer officials may be difficult. According to the US Ministry of Finance, she met with the Chinese ambassador Xie Feng on Monday, and the two officials conducted a "frank and effective discussion."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Here are some of the most controversial issues. They have sowed different seeds between the United States and China.</p>
<p><strong> Technology and trade control </strong></p>
<p>In 2022, the Bayeng government's decision <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221008/biden-chip-technology/">strict limit</a>Chinese officials are still unhappy about the types of advanced semiconductor and chip manufacturing machinery that can be transported to China.

<p>Semiconductor has always been one of the largest exports to China and the highest value to China. Although the Chinese government is investing in domestic capacity, it still lags behind the United States for many years.</p>
<p>The Biden government's strengthening of subsidy plans to support the US semiconductor industry has also aroused dissatisfaction among Chinese officials, especially because of its restrictions on investment in China. Companies accepting US government funds in the United States to build new chip facilities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/business/economy/chip-industry-congress.html">banned new high -tech investment in China</a>Essence Beijing made a period of time on Monday that it would have a limited limit on specific mineral exports for the production of certain chips.</p>

<p>Although Chinese officials and some American manufacturers believe that the Bayeng government is expected to cancel tariffs on imported products worth hundreds of billions of dollars, this does not seem to be realized quickly. Although Yellen questioned the effectiveness of tariffs, other senior officials in the government believed that tariffs would help encourage the supply chain to evacuate China.</p>
<p>The government is using carrots to increase rods to implement the policy of "de -risk" or "Youkan Outsourcing" -that is, the supply chain of key products such as electric vehicle batteries, semiconductors and solar panels to leave China.</p>

<p><strong> The business environment worsen </strong></p>
<p>Companies in China are increasingly worried about causing the government's negative attention. The latest goal is Micron Technology. The American storage chip manufacturer failed to pass the security review of China in May. This may cause Micron Technology to sell products to Chinese companies that operate key infrastructure, so that the company <a href="https://investors.micron.com/static-files/5d57ee3a-72f3-40f2-99e5-51322403192b">about one -eighth</a>Global income is risky.

<p>"We think this is very unwise. We have stated to several government members," said in an interview in Beijing in Beijing. "<strong>exchange rate</strong></p>
<p>China's currency RMB often attracts concerns from US officials. They sometimes accuse China of deliberately devalue the RMB and make their products be sold overseas at a lower price.</p>
<p>The recent weakness of the RMB may be the most difficult problem facing Yellen. In the past 12 months, the exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar has fallen by more than 7%, and the exchange rate against the euro has fallen by nearly 13%. Falling in exchange rates will make China's exports more competitive in the United States. China's makeup trade surplus has accounted for one -tenth of the entire economy output <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230629/china-exports-economy/">one tenth</a>Essence</p>
<p>Recently, it is not only RMB to the US dollar. The yen also depreciates due to various reasons. For example, the Federal Reserve has improved US interest rates to increase inflation.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Chinese economists also blame the RMB weak on this factor. Zhan Yubo, a senior economist at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that the depreciation of the RMB is the direct result of the recent interest rate hike in the Fed.</p>
<p>At the same time, China has been to boost its downturn's economy through interest rate cuts. Overnight loan interest rates between banks -this is a monetary policy benchmark that often affects all other interest rates -currently in the early 5%in New York and only 1%in Shanghai. This reverses the long -term mode of interest rates in China.</p>
<p>The Fed's interest rate hikes make companies and families more willing to transfer funds out of China and invest in the United States, even if China has imposed strict restrictions on overseas funds.</p>
<p>In the first stage of trade agreement reached with the United States three years ago, China promised not to use the advantages of manufacturing trade by lowering the RMB exchange rate. However, if China will be devalued by the RMB, the Biden government's response choice may be limited.</p>
<p><strong> Global debt </strong></p>
<p>China has provided more than $ 500 billion loans to developing countries through a loan plan, and is one of the world's largest debt countries. Since the epidemic, many borrowing countries, including several African countries, have fallen into economic difficulties and faced possible debt defaults.</p>

<p>The United States and other Western countries have been <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230417/china-debt-relief/">pressure to China</a>It is necessary to allow some countries to reorganize debts and reduce the amount of arrears. However, for more than two years, China has insisted on demanding that other creditor countries and multilateral loan institutions bear financial loss as part of the debt restructuring, which has led to the deadlock of the loan reduction process, which may cause the number of developing countries to be deeper into a deeper population in a deeper population. poor.</p>
<p>In June, the international debt party, including China, and Zambia reached a debt reduction plan to provide a wide range of interest payments for Zambia and extend their loan expiration date. This plan does not require the World Bank or International Monetary Fund to sell debt, so the global policy makers, including Yellen, see the hope of making similar debt restructuring in poor countries.</p>
<p><strong> Human rights and national security issues </strong></p>
<p>The tension on national security and human rights has led to a lack of mutual trust and affected economic relations. This year, the incident of Chinese reconnaissance balloons over the United States made the US public deeply disturbed. Congress members have been urging the government to disclose more information about the balloon. Biden <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230621/biden-china-spy-balloon/">Recently known as Chinese leader Xi Jinping</a>For the "dictator", it angered Chinese officials and official media.</p>
<p>U.S. officials still have concerns about China's infringement of human rights, including the suppression of the Hong Kong democratic movement and the detrimination of the minority of Muslims in Xinjiang, northwestern China. A senior official of the Ministry of Finance who was unwilling to be named said before the visit of Yellen that during the meeting in China, the United States had no intention of avoiding human rights.</p>
<p>Chinese officials continued to protest against various sanctions on Chinese enterprises, institutions and individuals on the grounds of national security threats and human rights violations.(https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-names-us-sanctioned-general-li-shangfu-defence-minister-2023-03-12/)One of the objects.

<p>Breast stated that according to the EU's "Digital MarketsAct", the role of the gatekeeper must be more strict supervised in order to prevent them from seeking "blocking users in their ecosystems."</p>
<p>This includes allowing instant messaging services to have interoperability, so that users can transmit messages between different apps, and prevent enterprises from controlling which APP is pre -installed in the mobile phone or guided users to use their products.</p>
<p>This new law tries to ensure that smaller companies can enter the market and will not allow them to be crushed by Silicon Valley technology giants before they start.</p>
<p>The European Union will formally decide which companies are eligible for the "gatekeeper" on September 6.</p>

And young people over 35 years of age have encountered age discrimination, not only cannot find a stable job, but it is also difficult to get married and have children. Why is there the phenomenon of "35 -year -old curse"?</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/hcm1-06152023001531.html">Chinese youth unemployment rate 20.8% hit a new high</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/gl-11102021064235.html">Chinese youth chose to lie down in the third quarter of the third quarter, the number of weddings hit a new low</a></em>**<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/nuxinghunyu/"><strong> Chinese women's wedding child selection </strong></a>After the end of China's new crowns and control policies, the economic recovery and recovery of peaceful life have become the public's expectations. However, although the seal -control policy has been lifted, the economic situation has continued to weaken for more than half a year. Not only not only insufficient consumption demand, poor housing market prosperity, but local governments are trapped in debt crisis. At the same time, the unemployment rate of young people has reached a new high in 5 years. According to the official data released in April this year, as many as 20.4%of job seekers from 16 to 24 years old are unemployed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the "35 -year -old spell" phenomenon in the Chinese job search market has also attracted public opinion. When many companies are recruited, they often stipulate that they only recruit applicants under 35 years old. "35 years old" seems to have become a curse number and become an invisible restrictions on their labor market. The situation of unstable employment has further made it difficult for young people in China to establish business. ****</p>
<p><strong> When overtime becomes an older Chinese age discrimination, it is becoming increasingly deteriorating </strong></p>
<p>Emma, a 39 -year -old youth who lives in China, told reporters in this interview: "In the past 10 years, the Internet industry in the mainland has developed rapidly. However, the Internet industry is often a heavy overtime industry, so they are very old to people. Very discrimination. Including companies that have become rich 10 years ago, like Huawei, I remember that when I just worked, Huawei would regularly cut off the older employees. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T13-43-00-04-00/000002.png" />A job seeker talked to a company's recruiters at the Beijing job fair. (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/tj-06302023101959.html/000_32h69mu.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T13-43-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Emma said that since 2017 and 2018, China's economic development has stalled, and since then, there has been a "35 -year -old curse" phenomenon: "At that time, the age discrimination of the employment market has gradually begun to become very sharp, each of which Stepping discrimination, for example, you will consider whether you are going to get married and have children. "</p>
<p><strong> Age discrimination makes Chinese young people dare not leave </strong></p>
<p>Mr. Chen, 34, who worked in a Chinese -state -owned enterprise cultural unit in China, told reporters that because he was afraid of re -job hunting, he did not dare to leave even if he did not like his current job: "My job has been maintained for 5 years, this is 5 years, this is for 5 years, this is for 5 years, this is for 5 years, this is for 5 years, this is for 5 years. This is 5 years. In 5 years, I did not think about going jobs, but on the one hand, because of the epidemic, the employment situation was worse and dare not move easily; on the other hand, it gradually reached the threshold of 35 years old. Seeing that when the company recruits new employees, she basically likes those young people who graduate or just work for a few years. Many friends around me are similar. "</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also told reporters that at the age of 35, he was admitted to the age threshold of civil servants. Therefore, after this age, job seekers will quickly depreciate in the labor market: "Why is 35 years old? Because in China, before 35 years old, you can represent you before 35. Go to the civil servant and enter the system. As a employee, he may have a retreat that you can go to the compilation of ', although it may not be able to pass the test. He immediately lost its price in the employment market. The company also understood, so all kinds of prices. I have a friend who went out to interview outside at this age, and the salary was cut half. "</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen's analysis, as for his cultural industry, companies prefer young people with good physical strength, instead of paying attention to the experience value of people in their 30s: "As far as my industry is concerned, it is still in the stage of labor -intensive. The 35 -year -old professional knowledge and management experience accumulated by mature talents are not valued at all. Most of the work only requires the accumulation of labor time. Therefore, of course, companies tend to use young people who have just entered the workplace. They can pay more Labor time. "Mr. Chen pointed out that the status of unstable work has also become a hindrance to the establishment of his family in his peers: "Unstable work represents the unstable income and unstable income, and the future expectations will become worse. ","</p>
<p><strong> Worried about age to become a career hinders young people in the United States for job hunting in the United States </strong></p>
<p>Ms. Wang, who was studying in Seattle, USA, also told reporters that because she was worried that Chinese age discrimination would affect her work development, she decided to retain the United States for job hunting: "When I graduated from college, although I was only 22 years old at that time, I have heard that There are many stories of (China) age discrimination. For example, in Internet companies, there will be a 'optimized' over 35 years old, that is, layoffs; and I originally wanted to apply for civil servants and government agencies at the time, but some positions would clearly explain age requirements For example, you cannot exceed 25 or 30 years old. Especially as a woman, I feel that age discrimination is even more serious. Because I do n’t want to be bound by this age discrimination, I want to have a healthier workplace environment, so I choose to study in the United States and apply for job hunting. "</p>
<p>Ms. Wang believes that China's current weak economy has led to poor employment situation and the incomplete labor law, which has led to the emergence of age discrimination: "As a great population country, China's labor force is too required. Especially during the epidemic period, economic development is slow, and the labor force is for labor. Little demand is. This kind of supply and demand has led to the lack of basic respect for employment in employment. People over 35 years of age can also be added. In addition, I think the incomplete labor law in China has led to the lack of legal employees. To safeguard its own rights and interests, when discrimination is discriminated, it can often only swallow the voices and promote the atmosphere of age discrimination. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T13-43-00-04-00/000006.png" />Job Fair in Zhengzhou, Henan Province (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/tj-06302023101959.html/000_1vu2lv.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T13-43-00-04-00/000007.png" /></a><strong> Chinese 35 -year -old youth was informed by the company "no age competitiveness" </strong></p>
<p>Mr. Ge, who works in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, told the station that he was laid off in 2021. Because of his age, he experienced a difficult job search process at the time: "At the end of 21, I had an unemployment experience. At that time When the epidemic began to be closed. The problem I was facing in the job. The first is that my age is not competitive. HR (human capital) said directly that during the job search process, my age is too old. Second, HR does not shy away to ask me the economic situation directly. Will there be a mortgage and family life? "</p>
<p>Mr. Ge pointed out that because of the epidemic, Chinese companies generally do not hold offline recruitment, but there are many false information on the online job search platform, which makes it difficult to get job hunting: "In my job search process, many positions have actually recruited 2 and 3 It ’s actually a false job. In order to make a profit, these Internet platforms are about false recruitment and recruitment violence. The platform side has no human and energy to do it. There is a big problem with social integrity." <strong>*</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, 35 -year -old young people often have more work experience, but why do Chinese companies prefer to hire "fresh people"? Hua Haifeng, an investigator of the China Labor Observation Organization, told reporters in an interview that Chinese companies preferred fresh people who had just leaned out of society because these people had low salary and better management.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T13-43-00-04-00/000008.png" />A young man in a professional introduction in Shanghai. (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/tj-06302023101959.html/000_1qv1e7.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-04T13-43-00-04-00/000009.png" /></a>Hua Haifeng said that many 35 -year -old young people have become families as an example. The requirements for salary and living standards are higher: "(youth over 35 years old) may not be able to meet them, and young people are even more. It is easy to manage, because their experience in society is not so rich. Therefore, for manufacturing, ordinary positions are more inclined to hire young people. "</p>
<p>Hua Haifeng also said that the appearance of the "35 -year -old spell" is also related to China's current economic downturn: "Of course, there will be problems in this regard in the past few years, but not as obvious now, because there are more jobs before, The demand for manpower is also relatively large, and enterprises do not have much selection and restrictions on manpower. In recent years, the lack of positions in recent years will become more and more obvious. "</p>
<p>In response to the "35 -year -old spell" problem in the Chinese workplace, independent economist Qin Weiping also believes that after 35 years of age, many people have a family business and need more stable income guarantee. For Chinese enterprises, they are an increase in operating costs: "From the perspective of reducing operating costs by enterprises, they are open, semi -open, and default to recruit young people under 35 years old; on the other hand Young people are easier to manage because they lack social experience and are more likely to be forced to work overtime by enterprises.

Such a posture will only make the world more poorer and unsafe. The author calls on the two parties to adopt a practicalist strategy to carry out cooperation based on economic rationality.</p>
<p>"Since Trump has opened a trade war against China, the confrontation between the United States and China has been in danger. After the Bayeng government took office, he did not cancel the punishment tariff on China. And restricted direct investment. Both sides are talking about decoupling, and the army of the two countries has repeatedly passed by in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>"China under the rule of Xi Jinping requires more and more nationalist voices. Xi Jinping hopes to independently stand independently in the economic and political aspects and strengthen military power. The Spy Act and the Data Security Act have further caused China to be closed. "</p>
<h3>Expert: The opposition state "brings damage to the US -China economy"</h3>
<p>"U.S. consumers and companies are paying a high price of trade protectionism in Washington. After the cancellation of epidemic control measures, Chinese companies still fail to be prosperous. China's economy is panting, and the unemployment rate of young people has climbed to 20%of the worry. Beijing's leadership must be interested in better economic and trade relations. "</p>
<p>The author believes that excessive emphasis on security theory does not make the world more secure, but is more tense. "The mutual implication of trade and investment is not enough to be a guarantee of peace-Russia. Russia is an example. However, it can at least increase the probability of mutual cooperation and the threshold and cost of mutual opposition. The Chinese government, which is a promise of getting rich and facing heavy pressure, will be more likely to provoke a military conflict than an economical successful Chinese government. "</p>
<p>"Over the past few decades, global division of labor is likely to be the most important prosperous helper. On the contrary, it is a very high -cost policy as much as possible. Moreover, global risks such as climate change cannot pass this method. Come to deal with. "</p>
<p>"Security not only covers the field of military and sovereignty. Security also needs cooperation. Economic rational and economic prosperity can not only make our lives more comfortable, but also make it safer. Of course, we should not face Beijing too well. More requires peers and more compromises in international occasions. However, US Treasury Secretary Yellen visit China. The outside world is looking forward to mutual concessions and specific results. Acknowledging differences, on the other hand, we are also committed to more cooperation and mutual trust.

<h3>Where can I refine it from?</h3>
<p>色 is a kind of gray -white metal with luster and hard texture. It belongs to carbon elements. However, ore rarely contains high concentrations, generally comes from lignal mines, lead zinc smelting by -products, and so on.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the European key raw material committee (CRMA), China ’s production accounts for about 60%of the world's, and the rest comes from Canada, Finland, Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>According to the data released by China Customs, last year, China ’s cumulative exports were 43.7 tons of products.</p>
<h3>metal element</h3>
<p>以 以 Do not exist in a single quality in nature, often using 镓(III)The forms of trace are scattered in zinc ore (such as light -zinc ore), aluminum ore and other ore. According to the data materials of the European key raw material committee, 80%of the world's crickets are produced in China.</p>
<p>Arsenal arsenide is widely used for high -performance chips because it is more resistant to high temperature and humidity than silicon, and has better conductivity. The Wall Street Journal quoted the report from the US Geological Survey on 2023 that the above applications did not have an effective alternative to gallium arsenidized.</p>
<p>According to data from the European key raw material committee, only a few companies in the world have the ability to refine production in accordance with the required purity, one of which is in Europe, and the rest are in Japan and China.</p>
<p>According to data from the General Administration of Customs of China, from January to November 2022, China ’s cumulative export 镓 products were 89.35 tons, an increase of 44.1%over the same period in 2021.</p>
<h3>锗 处 What is the use of 处?</h3>
<p>American companies Global Wafers pointed out that gallium arsenids are more resistant to high temperature than silicon, and wafers made of gallium arsenic can also work at a higher frequency.</p>
<p>Moreover, the noise produced as a device manufactured as a material manufactured by silicon, so it can be better applied in radar and radio communication equipment, satellites and LEDs.</p>
<p>红 It has a wide and important application in the fields of fiber communication, infrared optics, solar cells and other fields. In the military field, for example, you can make night vision devices and satellite image sensors.</p>
<h3>fluctuation in price</h3>
<p>According to Ludfon EIKON data, in the Shanghai metal trading market, on July 3, the valuation of 99.99%of China's purity was 1775 yuan ($ 245) per kilogram, an increase of 5.97%from the previous trading day, and May 16 The highest level since day. On July 3rd, the price of Chinese ingots was 9,150 yuan per kilogram ($ 1,264).</p>

He believes that Chinese GDP forecast is based on government data, which is much worse than the actual situation.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) Chinese businessman Shen Dong was invited by the House of Representatives of the United States to testify to the Strategic Competition of the Chinese Communist Party at 7 pm on the 13th of Eastern time at 7 pm on the 13th of the United States to talk about China's business environment.</p>
<p>He told DW that the reason was that he wrote <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论习近平会打碎红色赌盘吗/a-59209968">Red Roulette</a>This book. Shen Dong pointed out that there has always been few people like him who have a business background to go to the United States to attend this kind of hearing. "Isn't it more concerned about China in all aspects of the United States now? I want to do a deeper understanding through our unique background," Shen Dong said.</p>
<p>The United States and China are constantly competitive. In order to counter the enclosure of the UShew chip, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国管制出口的镓锗究竟是什么/a-66113298">China announced on July 3 to restrict semiconductor metal exports</a>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国务院发布最新旅行警告前往中国须慎行/a-66100657">the U.S. Department also issued the latest travel warning</a>It means that after the amendment of the "Foreign Relations Law" and "Anti -Spy Law" in China, there is a risk of arbitrarily enforcement and error detention.</p>
<h3>"How are you moving?"</h3>
<p>The National Development and Reform Commission of China's Supreme Economic Regulatory Agency held a symposium on private entrepreneurs on July 3 to exchange with 5 private enterprises including Sanyi Group, Oaks Group, Yuantong Express, Bosideng, and Nongfu Spring. Policy measures for pragmatic management, try their best to help enterprises solve practical difficulties and create a good development environment for private enterprises. "</p>
<p>"All entrepreneurs I see, not only themselves, including entrepreneurs around them, everyone's first thing is to go capital, and they all say how to go." Shen Dong told DW, saying that "Chinese private enterprises are desolate "".</p>
<p>He introduced that he had met more than 20 entrepreneurs in Taiwan a few months ago. The topics that everyone talked about during the meeting was "How did you move? What is the proportion?"</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-04T14-52-00Z/65959997_401.png" />Shen Dong believes that Chinese entrepreneurs understand that China under Xi Jinping is not good for business, and many people are investing.</p>
<p>Shen Dong mentioned that in addition to the United States demanding the second supply point of China and increasing the pressure on tariffs, the main thrust is "Xi Jinping's policy."</p>
<p>"They (Chinese entrepreneurs) are afraid of the Communist Party, far more than overseas people's fear of the Communist Party, because they have all experienced it, and they are undergoing many things around them. Stronger than everyone. "</p>
<h3>China Real Estate can't go back?</h3>
<p>Not only many production companies want to move away from China. The real estate industry, which has long been China's economic development engine for a long time, is currently in a state of unprecedented downturn. According to China News Network reported on July 3, the sales sales of the top 100 housing companies in China in the first half of the year were slightly increased, and the number of companies with sales exceeding 100 billion yuan fell from 9 to 7. Faced with real estate dilemma, the People's Bank of China said on June 30 that it would provide loan guarantee to provide pre -sale housing delivery to promote the steady and healthy development of the real estate market.</p>
<p>"I used to do real estate myself, and real estate could not return." Shen Dong believes that China's real estate industry has come to an end without a rebound.</p>
<p>He said that China's per capita houses have the highest volume in the world, and about 87%of people live in houses. "Now that the real estate goes down, the wealth drama will be reduced again, which is very powerful. 87%of people see their wealth shrink. In this case, the consumer market cannot be mentioned."</p>
<p>Shen Dong said that since he has been doing warehousing in the warehouse and the airport industry for more than 10 years, Xi Jinping has seen the return rate of infrastructure when he came to power.</p>
<p>"China's economic growth in the past 10 years is actually supported by bonds. Because of political reasons, I never want the economy to fall ... As long as I don't explode in my tenure, I will support the economy. I am gone, as for how he came to deal with this matter, it exploded in his hands, that's nothing to do with me. "</p>
<p>Shen Dong believes that China has gathered from geopolitics, economic conditions, and social development at this point "to the end" and "the clouds in various places." He can't see how China gets out of the new bureau.</p>
<p>DW asked Shen Dong, he believes that if you go to the US Congress to testify this time, will it have a practical impact on the Chinese economy? He said, "I just tell everyone I know China. As for everyone who took this information, after understanding, what they did by themselves, it was their choice."</p>

<p>Facebook founder Zuckerberg(Mark Zuckerberg)It is planned to return its company META to China.

Meta cannot sell equipment in China.</p>
<p>At present, META is planning to sell its head -of -wear equipment in China, and has discussed the issue of returning to China with Chinese technology companies including Tencent and made progress.</p>
<p>However, sources believe that Chinese officials may still have doubts about Zackberg. Zuckerberg had previously accused China of stealing technology and criticized the parent company of Tiktok, a short video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Meta's predecessor was banned in China in 2009 because of refusing to abide by Beijing's review. The plan to return to China and the potential partners negotiated with META reminded that the content of virtual reality equipment may be supervised in China.</p>

<p>Niu Tengyu, who was persecuted by the Chinese government because he disclosed Xi Jinping's daughter Xi Mingze's personal information, has recently been transferred to the new prison in the Sihui Prison in Guangdong. Due to harsh conditions, his torture recurred.</p>
<p>According to the Minsheng Observation Network, a person who has just been released from prison revealed that in the new prison area, there was no air conditioner in the supervisor (the original), and Niu Tengyu's sequelae of the torture were all recurred, including the deterioration of the right hand of the disabled. His otitis media recurred, and it was difficult for him to eat; Niu Tengyu lost more than 10 pounds in more than a month.</p>
<p>Niu Tengyu, born in 1993, is a Shanxi. His "vulgar vitamin" website disclosed many Chinese Internet incidents and characters, and also involved some news content that Chinese officials and their second generation and the Chinese government were restricted by the Chinese government. Niu Tengyu himself was arrested by the Guangdong police in 2019, and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for a number of crimes such as "provoking trouble". He was sent to Sifi Prison in Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province since May 2021.</p>
<p>Niu Tengyu's relatives and friends have always called on the outside world to pay attention to his experience, and his conditions have improved. But in order to prevent Niu Tengyu from applying for injustice, the police put him into the new supervision area and threatened that if he did not plead guilty, he would stay in a bad supervisor.</p>

<p>The "VOX" news website commented on the sanctions of gold and diamond mining activities related to Mali and the Russian mercenaries of the United States and the Chinese and African Republics Mercenary Group on Tuesday. Rigo was trying to rebel in Russia.</p>
<p>U.S. website reports that the US Department of Finance's Foreign Asset Control Office(OFAC)He said that the Gold and Diamond Modeling Company, as well as a UAE distribution company and a Russian company, participated in the plan to get rich for some members and collaborators of Wagner in Russia and African countries.</p>
<p>The website supplemented reports that compared with the huge amounts of funds provided by the Russian government, the group's income from illegal mining activities was insignificant.</p>
<p>Although the Russian government is not the only entity for Wagner and its leaders, all signs indicate that it is a large guarantor of this fund.</p>
<p>Russian military analyst Paville Lujin, a Russian military analyst of the European Policy Analysis Center, said that anything else, whether diamonds, gold, petroleum, nickel or natural gas, are just a drop in the sea, or "pocket money".</p>
<p>Although the Russian government is not the only entity for Wagner and its leaders, all signs indicate that it is a large guarantor of this fund.</p>
<p>The US website said Wagner's mining rights in Mali and the Chinese and African Republic are not completely clear.</p>
<h4>uncertain future</h4>
<p>According to the OFAC Tuesday statement, the United States imposed sanctions on Midas Resources Sarlu. This is a company located in the Central African Republic. It is associated with Pryigo. Essence</p>
<p>In addition, the company ", together with other companies related to the Chinese and African Republic, is the key to providing financing for Wagner's business in the Chinese African Republic and other regions."</p>

<p>According to The Sentry, this is a report issued by the Internet that is dedicated to destroying the network that is profitable from the conflict). West Malaysia's gold mines have intimidated the civilians in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>The conclusion reported by the VOX website is that other companies connecting to Pleigo have also carried out business in the Chinese and African Republics, but so far, these entities are more useful than financing sources for national acquisitions. There is uncertainty in the future. However, Russia's foreign policy goals remain unchanged, and Moscow may continue to use puppet forces such as Wagner to achieve its goals in Africa.</p>

<p>Switzerland hopes to participate in the European Shield Air Defense initiative. Critics believe that this move is inconsistent with Switzerland's long -standing neutral position.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the Swiss Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday (July 4): "Switzerland hopes to participate in the" European Sky ShieldInitiative "and will sign an intent statement in Berne."</p>
<p>Swiss Defense Minister Viola Amherd will sign the intent statement when meeting with Austria and the German defense chief on Friday (7th).</p>
<p>Switzerland hopes to participate in the Tiandun air defense initiative to attract the attention of lobbying groups. The right -wing conservative association Pro Schweiz Getenman said: "This is not in line with strict neutral Switzerland."</p>
<p>He was worried that the move would lead to military and NATO in the military and NATO, making Switzerland a target.</p>
<p>Germany set up a European Shield Air Defense initiative in 2022 to strengthen European air defense forces. After Russia invaded Ukraine, European air defense forces have become the focus of attention. At present, 17 European countries have participated in the initiative, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden. Its purpose is to reduce costs by coordinating the procurement of air defense and missile defense systems such as the Patriot missile system and achieve training, maintenance and logistics cooperation.</p>
<p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, the neutral Switzerland was under increasing pressure from neighboring European countries, including requiring Switzerland to allow export arms to Ukraine. Switzerland rejected the Swiss Defense Corporation Ruag last week that the sale of 96 Leopard 1 A5 main battle tank for Ukraine was used for Ukraine. Denmark and Germany earlier hoped to dispatch armored vehicles and ammunition made from Switzerland to help Ukraine were rejected by Switzerland.</p>

<p>Afghanistan <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/ta-li-ban">Taliban government</a>Ordering the beauty salon to close within one month, further restricting public places where Afghan women can get in and out.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the Taliban government's anti -evil and virtue spokesman Mohammed Sadik Akidv said on Tuesday (July 4), "The last period of closing the women's beauty salon is one month."</p>
<p>Since Taliban regained power in 2021, its increasing restrictions on women have been condemned by multinational governments and UN officials. The Taliban authorities closed most of the female high school last year, <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20221221-1345626">forbidden women to go to college</a>And prevent many Afghan women's assistants <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230412-1382312">work</a>Many public places including bathhouses, gyms and parks are no longer open to women.</p>
<p>At the end of 2001, a few weeks after the Taliban was driven down, that is, a few weeks after the 911 incident, the beauty salons in other cities in other cities in Afghanistan appeared like mushrooms. Two years ago Taliban re -controlled power, many beauty salons were still in business, providing employment opportunities for many women and providing customers with services. These beauty salons generally only allow women to enter and cover the windows, and the customers inside cannot be seen from outside.</p>
<p>Kabul's resident Sahar goes to a beauty salon for hair and nails every few weeks. Now that the decree is issued, she feels that the final security social approach except her family is cut off. She said: "Parks do not allow women to enter, for us, this is a good place to meet friends. This is a good reason. Let us meet with each other and discuss issues with other women and girls." She then said that : "Now, I don't know how to meet them, how to see them, and how to talk to each other. I think this will have a great impact on us and women from all over Afghanistan."</p>
<p>The Taliban government said that according to its explanation of Islamic law and Afghanistan customs, it respects the right to women.</p>

<p>According to the information and data of Tuesday (July 4th) of the EIKON ship tracking system of two transactions and Refinitiv (July 4th) based on the two transactions sources and the US Refinitiv (July 4th). Ural oil supply in the Turkey market, while India has maintained its largest purchasing share.</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, the Indian Times reported that India has already used RMB to pay for the import of crude oil imported from Russia. According to relevant statistics, India's imported Russian crude oil in June surpassed the sum of imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.</p>
<p>It is reported that with the changes in the international situation, India has been trying to solve the problem of how to pay the cost of importing Russian crude oil.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted Indian government sources on Monday (3rd) that if the Bank of India is unwilling to settle related costs in the US dollar, some refineries will pay foreign currency such as RMB.</p>
<p>According to sources, India Petroleum is India's largest Russian crude oil buyer. The company became the first Indian state -owned refinery to pay some imported Russian crude oil in June this year. It is also reported that at least two of the three private refineries in India are also paying some Russian crude oil costs imported from RMB. However, it is impossible to determine how many Russian crude oil has been purchased in the Indian refinery.</p>
