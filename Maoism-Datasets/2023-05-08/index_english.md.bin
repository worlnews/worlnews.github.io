(Voice of Germany) If Germany really stops trade with China's intermediate products and junior products, then Germany's actual GDP may shrink by 2%. The decourse of the German and British product chain will also shrink the German GDP by 2%. If it is decoupled with the American product chain, the German economy will even shrink by 3%. This is an estimate of the latest research published by Gabrielbermayr, the director of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research. The study was commissioned by the Munich Family Enterprise Foundation, and the background was political discussion about the German economy's dependence on China and other countries. The author is Oliverkrebs. Felbemel is one of the most famous economists in the German community. He has worked at the IFO Institute of Munich for many years. From 2019 to 2021, he served as the director of the Kirl World Economic Research Institute. Since 2021, he has been the director of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research.

The study emphasized that Germany's cutting -off relationship with other countries is always higher than the export relationship, but it is just the opposite of China's trade. If the industrial intermediate products and junior products in Germany, the European Union and the world's other parts of the world are completely cut off, the actual income of German citizens will decrease by 20%in the short term. Actual income is an economic indicator that reflects purchasing power. For household income, divide the consumer price index.

Gabriel Felbemel and Koles wrote in the study that decoupling will have a long -term impact on the national economy. "Therefore, politicians must deal with this problem very cautiously, and even the measures taken The supply country or department is completely decoupled. "The study clearly mentioned [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟离战略自主还有多远/a-64286779) 。

### decourse has a different impact on various economic departments and regions

Based on the model calculation, the decoupling of other countries will have a different impact on various economic departments and regions. In the long run, the German economy can make up for some losses. It is especially affected by the decourse. Two researchers also simulated countries that are not affected by political disputes with the EU, including Switzerland. Based on this study, if intermediate trade with Switzerland is interrupted, it will mainly damage the neighboring Baden-Vottenburg, Germany.

RainerkirchdöRFer, chairman of the Family Enterprise Foundation, commented that the new crisis and the Ukrainian crisis prompted politics and enterprises to re -evaluate the supply chain and dependence. This is wise, but research also shows that "the advantages of global trade are usually indispensable Relief. "

Germany's dependence on other economies can also be seen from the latest export data. According to data released by the German Federal Bureau of Statistics on May 4, due to the weak demand of the United States and China, the United States and the European Union in the world, Germany ’s exports in March accidentally declined significantly, which decreased by 5.2%compared with February to 129.7 billion.

The European Union has an output value of 136.9 billion euros in the pharmaceutical industry. The draft legal case proposed by the European Commission aims to re -activate the enthusiasm for investment in the pharmaceutical industry to improve the supply of drugs and restore drug prices to normal. Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, the budget in the field of health care is seriously inadequate.

However, the countries that signed the above documents, including Belgium, France, Spain, and Germany, the EU requires the European Union to formulate the "Key Drug Law" to ensure the safety of the EU in the core drug field.

At present, the production of drugs in various countries in the world depends on a few Chinese producers and the effective ingredients they produce. This status quo has aroused concerns from related countries. Among the EU's standards of effective ingredients, more than 50%of the five companies from China.

Related documents say: "The European Union has increasingly relying on several producers in a few regions. In 2019, more than 40%of APIs (active drug ingredients) are from China. In the middle of the product, almost all API manufacturers in the world are inseparable from China. "

According to the document, the drugs that have already appeared in many times should be first implemented. In addition, the relevant countries also hope that the European Union can introduce specific measures, allowing countries to launch mutual assistance operations without finding alternative suppliers and alternative drugs.

(Voice of Germany) nearly 80%of Japanese people think that the society of this Asian country is heavy, and this is a recent investigation conclusion released by the Japanese Cabinet House. The survey showed that only 14.7%of residents believed that Japanese women were treated equally. The study emphasizes that there are serious gender inequality in all fields -from politics to education to "social acceptance concepts, customs and practices.

What are the most serious inequality in society? Nearly 82%of the respondents replied: Political fields; more than 64%of the respondents said: workplace. In addition, nearly 60%of people emphasize family life: social customs stipulate that women should cook, clean up, manage their families, and raise children.

"The results of polls did not surprise me. Unfortunately, there seemed to be no change and no improvement." Said Chisato Kitanaka, a professor of sociology at Hiroshima University.

"This is a problem in all aspects of Japanese society. This may be the most obvious in terms of income differences and women's employment opportunities." She told Germany's voice that "young women graduated from university have the same skills and knowledge as men, but The company and organizations hiring them often stay on the old way of thinking. "She said that they think women will leave the company to get married and have children in a few years." Therefore, they provide the same training and promotion opportunities for women to provide women with the same training and promotion opportunities as male employees. meaningless."

### Japanese women have something to say

### In the field of education

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/森喜郎失言風波日本政壇女性弱勢現象/a-56558078)Among the 180 countries monitored by the Global Parliament (IPU), Japan ranked 165th. In the recently lower house elections, only 18%of candidates are women.

At least in the field of education, men and women are equal -at least this is a long -term assumption. But this is not true.(Hiromi Murakami)Said, "This difference may not be so obvious. But in recent years, some scandals have occurred, and universities have preferred male applicants instead of women with better test scores."

European Employment and Social Rights Commissioner Nicolasschmit was surprised by the Seventh -way Group Labor Minister Meeting in Japan recently. He subsequently told the reporter of Kyodo News that we need to issue a clear and powerful statement.

### from the conservative countercurrent

Japanese Prime Minister Kishida also emphasizes this. He has instructed the cabinet and labor market experts to ensure that the administrative positions of large Japanese enterprises have 30%of women by 2030. Kishida Wenxiong said that higher wages, more promotion and social violence to women are essential for women to obtain more high -level positions in the company.

Conservative traditional doctors do not agree with women who are discriminated against by women in the workplace. "I don't think women are in an unfavorable position in Japanese society. For a long time, there have been laws to protect them with the same rights as men." Said Yoichishimada, a researcher at Fukui County University, "Perhaps the disadvantage is that the society expects women should expect women to should It is the child's main caregiver. But this is not a rare problem. In other parts of the world, the same is true of the United States or Europe. This is not a big problem. "

It is this attitude that allows sociologists to be very pessimistic about the real changes in Japan. "These attitudes are deeply ingrained in our society." She said, "Maybe there will be changes, but it will gradually and slowly come."

(Voice of Germany) Washington Thought Germany's Marshall Foundation on Tuesday (May 2) pointed out in the latest report that if Western countries want to maintain their influence on the international stage, it must be more meaningful with the emerging "swinging country" to make s contact.

The author pointed out, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/巴西总统愿与中国阿联酋联手调解俄乌冲突/a-65339949) 、 [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人口超越中国的印度能获得人口红利吗/a-65471911), Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey are swinging countries with important influence on the world stage. They have different preferences for cooperation outside the Western Cross -Atlantic Alliance.

Invasion in Ukraine and [] in Russia(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国国家安全顾问对华关系要去风险-而非脱钩/a-65462184)In the context, these countries can more affect global affairs than ever.

Heather A.Conley, chairman of the Marshall Foundation, wrote: "The West often mistakes these swinging countries with other choices or other countries that chooses to be or in two emerging global groups, which are collectively referred to as 'Global Southern', but this label reflects it. Lack of rigorous knowledge. "

"These countries are international entrepreneurs at international opportunities."

### International cooperation needs flexibility

The report pointed out that Brazil's cooperation is pragmatic, and its leadership does not think that cooperation with different partners (such as China, the European Union, Russia and the United States) conflict with each other. As a result, Western countries should strengthen cooperation with other global governance issues on climate change, inequality, and other global governance issues, and accept the transfer from traditional power centers.

### Once up to the world camp

During the Cold War, the world was classified as East and Western camps according to different ideology. Western capitalist camps are regarded as the so -called "first world", and the Eastern Socialist camps are regarded as "the second world", and the "third world often refers to the" Southern World "with a more backward economic level. This classification is now outdated. After the Cold War, the concepts of the global northern and global southern souths divided by socioeconomic and political characteristics have become more popular (the picture shows the first Asian -African conference in 1955).

####  The "Global South" and "Global Northern" you need to understand

### "North -South Different"

Simply put, the global south is characterized by low income, dense population, and poor infrastructure, which can be understood as developing countries and low -income countries. The global northern part of the world mainly refers to developed countries and high -income countries. "North-South Different" (also known as "North and South Gap", North-South Divide is widely used. The "South" and "North" here do not refer to the south and north in the geographical orientation.

### global north

According to public academic data, in general, the definitions of the global northern part of the world include the United States, Canada, almost all European countries, Israel, Cyprus, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. However, the division of international in the world has no recognition definition of the global and south of the world, and there are also controversial and different interpretations.

### Global South

There are also many interpretations for the south of the world. The World PopurationReview website states that traditionally, the global southern refers to a country that is underdeveloped or economically in a vulnerable country. These countries often face colonial rule of the global northern countries (especially European countries). However, there are other definitions, and the global south is used to refer to countries that are negatively affected by capitalist globalization. It is generally believed that the southern world is composed of African, Latin America and the Caribbean, Pacific islands, and developing countries in Asia.

Like India and Brazil, China is also regarded as a global southern country. The United Nations South -South Cooperation Financial Center has a list of global southern countries. The list currently includes 78 countries, and the list is also called "77 countries and China".

### South -South cooperation

South -South Cooperation (SSC) is a term used by decision makers and academia to describe the exchanges and cooperation between southern countries around the world in various fields. Public information shows that the formation of South -South cooperation can be traced back to the Bandung Conference (pictured) held in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955, and is considered to promote the formation of South -South cooperation. In the 58/220 resolution passed on December 23, 2003, the United Nations will be the South -South Cooperation Day on December 19th each year, and later changed to September 12.

### Why is the global southern attracted much attention?

[ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);)South Africa also advocates a multi -level global order and recognizes the so -called south of the world. The report states that Western leaders can promote closer cooperation by focusing on specific policy areas that are beneficial to both sides.

Reporter Martin Quencez and Racheltausendfreund pointed out: "The government of these swinging countries does not think they want to choose between two static poles."

"They are more inclined to move from one option to another based on their specific interests and strategic analysis."

### Balance between the big country

With the heating up of the Sino -Indian border dispute and economic competition, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/言论出格印度外长批评索罗斯很危险/a-64750121)However, its strategic autonomy still keeps close connection with countries such as Russia.

The report pointed out that the West can contact India more effectively by avoiding the mentality of "we or them", because this way of thinking is incompatible with India's more targeted small multilateral diplomacy.

Indonesia's goal is to be in the competition of big powers. With the assistance of the United States, it has handled disputes in the South China Sea without the assistance of the United States.

The report pointed out that the infringement of Western countries during the colonial and Cold War periods, which led to Western criticism of new unsuccessful policies in the West did not be recognized by Indonesian legislators.

The author wrote: "A more constructive foreign policy dialogue can focus on mutual respect for national sovereignty and multilateralism."

"Although the swaying country generally aware of the risks of the ambitions of Russia and China, they do not think that the United States or Europe is a trusted global advocate of national sovereignty."

### Different national defense and trading partners

Turkey's strategy has always been balanced between major powers to reduce the impact of this competition. Its recent mediation in the Ukrainian war also confirms this.

Turkey is still an important member of NATO and close economic partners of the European Union. It also believes that the world is "not limited to five countries" -This refers to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.

Saudi Arabia also maintains close relationships with the West in terms of security, especially with the United States. But Saudi Arabia regards Russia as an important partner of OPEC+(OPEC+), and China is its main trading partner.

The report of the Marshall Foundation believes that the West should not ignore the global mediation capabilities in other countries; as the United States is expected to decrease in the Middle East, Liade is taking this opportunity to strengthen his position in the region.

Overall, experts from the Marshall Foundation believe that the European Union and the United States must show their flexibility in cooperation. They are open -minded to non -Western countries and avoid forcing geopolitical partners to make a choice.

The report of the report wrote: "Establishing a relationship with the decentralized political actors may also help the long -term interests of all partners."

The new spiritual activity material is also called "planning medicine" and "laboratory drugs" in the Chinese world. These substances are transformed drugs, which can imitate the effect of existing illegal drugs and avoid legal restrictions -in many in many State, legal restrictions are bound to specific substances and chemical composition.

### ** Study samples of 47 cities, including Chinese cities **

The team led by the University of Queensland, Australia, analyzed samples of 47 cities in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, China, Brazil and South Korea for three consecutive years from 2019 to 2022.

They detected 18 new substances, which are similar to street drugs that can change their minds, but the chemical structure of new substances has changed slightly.

"Dr Richardbade), a researcher at the University of Queensland, said:" These substances are synthesized to replace the banned substances, which means that their molecular structure is slightly different to bypass legal restrictions. "He also pointed out," Their manufacturing volume is generally smaller than traditional illegal drugs, making it difficult for law enforcement departments to control its circulation. "

### Afghan Drugs: Who will save them

### ** What type of substance do they belong to? **

The survey shows that the use of new spiritual activity substances (NPS) is used all over the world, but there is a strong regional trend.

Synthetic Casitone is the most common type of NPS. It is chemically related to Casitone, which has a stimulating effect on the central nervous nerve in the chemical chemical. One of the chemicals-3-methylticone, the content found in Europe is extremely high, especially in Spain and Slovakia. In 2019, the substance was found in the analysis of wastewater in Europe, but it spread to North America and Oceania in the subsequent years.

The same is also known as a phenyleine, which can produce a similar effect on the central nervous stimulator amphenobenzine and a sedative effect.

The research team discovered seven new spiritual active substances in Australia, including Mephedrone. These substances have [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国周末派对满是可卡因摇头丸/a-2331749)or [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/可疑包裹在公海漂浮-新西兰查获32吨可卡因/a-64642453)Similar effects.

According to the Yonhap News Agency, Kishida Wenxiong went to the National Cemetery of the National Cemetery in Tongqui District, Seoul, and worshiped. In the afternoon of Friday, Kishida and Yin Xiyue held a summit at the Presidential Palace of Longshan.

Kishida said he hopes to discuss the recent incidents and cooperation on global issues in the Indo -Pacific region before the Seventh -way Group Summit. Kishida had previously invited Yin Xiyue to participate in the Seventh -way Group Summit in Japan this month, and will hold a three -party talks with the United States outside the United States.

According to the Kyodo News Agency, Kishida Wenxiong said at the beginning of the Sunday's Japanese and Korean summit that the two countries had opened various dialogues, hoping to exchange opinions on the progress of the relationship between the two countries.

Yin Xiyue quoted Yin Xiyue that he felt the sense of responsibility in the era of unprecedented friendship between the two countries. Although the two countries restarted "shuttle diplomacy" after 12 years, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/有意放弃历史恩怨-韩总统时隔4年首度访日/a-65007845)"Although the trend of good changes is hard to come, once it is formed, it is likely to become the general trend."

### difficult historical issues

Japan had been occupied by the Korean Peninsula for 35 years before 1945, leading to a long period of cold relationship between Japan and South Korea. Japan's atrocities in North Korea during the colonial period, such as sexual slavery and forced labor, made it difficult for the two countries to reconcile.

South Korean President Yin Xiyue is trying to repair bilateral relations and regards it as a priority of governance. Although there is historical grievances between the two countries, Yin Xiyue visited Japan in March this year, hoping that Japanese -South Korean relations can open a new chapter.

Before returning to South Korea, Kishida Wenxiong told reporters that he hoped to "openly communicate with Yin Xiyue".

However, rare experts believe that Kishida Wenxiong will apologize to Japan's atrocities on the Korean Peninsula, even though they think that Japan's apology has not suffered.

2015, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日韩外长就慰安妇-难题达成协议/a-18944995)Essence According to this agreement, South Korea will set up a "comfort woman" compensation fund, and the Japanese party allocates 1 billion yen (about 8.3 million US dollars). However, due to the lack of help provided by the Foundation for the victims, it was quickly canceled by the South Korean government.

Ben Engel, a research professor at the Institute of International Issues of the University of National University, told AFP that if Kishida Wenxiong apologized sincerely, he is unlikely to be welcomed in Seoul.

Daniel Russel, former assistant Secretary of State, East Asia and Pacific Affairs, pointed out to Reuters that Japanese leaders are slowing down to adapt to domestic politics.

On Saturday, about 100 Korean people protested by Kishida, arguing that the wrong behavior of colonialism must be the primary topic of the agenda of the summit.

### North Korea's nuclear target is put on the agenda

Li Xinhe, a professor of international relations at the University of Korea, pointed out to Reuters that Yin Xiyue has previously stated that Kishida's apology is not necessary; he may pay attention to the common cooperation of Japan and South Korea in the face of the North Korean nuclear threat.

In fact, according to Kyodo News, Yin Xiyue stated that "the concept that must not be able to get rid of historical issues in one step, and cannot move towards future cooperation." He had previously said in an interview with the Washington Post that he could not accept such a view because he asked Japan to kneel on his knees.

US President Biden recently received Yin Xiyue in the White House, and the two sides signed the Washington Declaration. According to this declaration, the United States promises to share more core information information with South Korea. Yin Xiyue promised that South Korea would not pursue his own nuclear project.

Investors have been putting pressure on the executives and asking how the luxury goods industry will respond to the sharp rise in passenger flow after the epidemic, but Beronney said that they are more happy to see that customers gradually return. "No one is ready to deal with the turbulent crowds, whether it is a shop, a hotel or a airline." He said.

Overall, luxury companies are focusing on attracting more purchasing power. Among them, the GUCCI parent company Kaiyun Group, who hopes to be newly opened ultra -high -end "Gucci Salon", provides products with a price of up to $ 3 million.

Luliano Santel, the chief company and supply executive of luxury retailers, told analysts on Wednesday (May 3) that Chinese people traveling to Europe are still "a small part of contribution, But this number is growing every week. "

EXANE BNPPARIBAS, a securities institution of the Bank of France, reported by the Research Report before the May Labor Day holiday stating that the industry in Paris and Milan believes that Chinese consumers are the third largest consumer groups after French and Americans, and sometimes they are sometimes in Stores in the tourist area are jumping for the second largest consumer group.

As wealthy Chinese returned to Europe and other foreign tourism destinations, the attractiveness of the tax -free shopping location of Hainan Island, China seems to be weakened. The retail and consumer goods partner of the consulting company Oliverwyman said that the discussion with Hainan sales staff showed that as many as 70%of the people who purchased high -end goods in this tropical island were Purchase luxury goods for the first time. She said that China's "high -level top luxury consumers have gone abroad to travel abroad," which led to a significant decline in Hainan's per capita consumption.

### The first batch of tourists in China was welcomed in Cambodia

### is not enough, and there are more than below

Luxury company reports that since February, after the wave of infection of the new crown virus in China and the decline of the new crown virus, the consumer army headed by Hainan has come back again. Lu Weixuan and Hermes are the biggest beneficiaries. This was reflected in their global sales growth in the first quarter, and increased by 17%and 23%, respectively.

But this comparison based on the period of the Qing Zero policy last year is not as good as it looks like. At that time, severe blockade suppressed expenditure, and in the second quarter, large -scale suspension also occurred in Shanghai.

"This year, it is important to make the performance of the company with the entire industry." The person in charge of the consulting company Roland Berger Jonathan Yan, the person in charge of Shanghai, said, "the growth of double digits does not mean What."

Owa Consulting Wats said that 2022 is an extremely sluggish year. However, the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020 and the return of luxury goods to China, 2021 is another year of an abnormally increased.

However, compared with 2019-at that time, 70%of the luxury expenditures of Chinese consumers were carried out abroad-2021 were dwarfed again. Analysts predict that even in the long run, overseas consumption expenditures are unlikely to return to the level at that time.

"If you communicate with luxury brands, they are a bit difficult to determine what the actual benchmark is."

Since the beginning of this year, the problem of corruption of China's grain management system has become increasingly emerging. In February this year, the website of the National Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China disclosed that this year, we will deepen the rectification of corruption in the field of grain enterprises.

From the information page of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, it can be seen that news about the special rectification of grain systems has appeared frequently in the near future.

At the end of April, Zhang Wufeng, former director of the National Food and Material Reserve of China, was suspected of accepting bribes and was prosecuted by the Deyang People's Procuratorate in Sichuan Province. In early May, the reports of disciplinary inspection and supervision in Xinjiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi have clearly listed the special rectification of the grain system.

The more prominent is Shaanxi Province. According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the website of the State Supervision Commission of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, since the special rectification of corruption in the field of grain purchase and sales, the province has accepted more than 800 clues in the province, and more than 50 million yuan in chaoser and losses. At the same time, a number of granaries, including the former party committee secretary and chairman of Shaanxi Grain and Nong Group Co., Ltd., were investigated and dealt with.

It can be seen that the problem of corruption in China's grain system is more common, which is consistent with the previous estimates. It is unclear to what extent the so -called special rectification can be carried out, and how much can it solve the problem of corruption accumulated for many years.

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Chinese media "crooked brain" in Washington, USA published an article "Run is a personal negative resistance to the country, but also implies the new possibility of social movement." The author Zhong Shan pointed out that in the past ten years , Chinese political disagreements, rights protection lawyers, feminine activists, and workers have encountered rigorous suppression. Not only did individuals pay the cost of losing freedom, but their families were harassed or even punished by "sitting". Fair education rights. As the suppression has become more and more intense, the legal form is the same. Now let alone an activist, that is, ordinary people may suffer from socialist iron fist at any time. Sending a tucao post on their social account can alarm the online police to "check the water meter". For many people who have experienced a nightmare, "Run" can make themselves and their offspring a new life and live a normal life.

The author believes that after the social movement has lost all the space, it is also a resistance to choosing to completely withdraw from this injustice. It is not fair to say that it is just a negative "escape". when" [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体润学在中国/a-62355958)"Gradually becoming a collective movement and the significance of" voting with your feet ", it will be difficult to say to the shaking of a totalitarian country.

### CCP's anti -American propaganda out of insecurity

The New York Times published an article "Do China really want to replace the United States", author Jessica Chenweiss believes that Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to defeat the efforts of "encirclement and suppression", led by the United States, and said "capital The ultimate death of doctrine and the ultimate victory of socialism. " But this kind of ideological declaration is out of security to a certain extent -most communist countries have collapsed, and Chinese leaders are worried that they will be the next -and this ideological declaration is more to instill the domestic party to the party to the party to the party. Confidence and loyalty, not the belief that reflects actual policies or fixed.

The article said that people are increasingly doubting whether China can achieve the goal of surpassing the United States to become the world's largest economy, let alone other measures in the world. In China, it is generally believed that it is still weaker than the United States in military, economic and technical, and further modernization depends on continuing international technology, capital and markets under the stable economic order. The article quotes Chinese scholar Huang Renwei and pointed out, "The United States wants to curb if China is impossible, China wants [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳洲智库-中国在关键新兴技术竞争中正超越美国/a-64862977)It is impossible.

####  The Battle of Changjin Lake in history

### U.S. military surrounded by ambush

In late November 1950, the 10th Army of the United States deployed in the northeast of the Korean Peninsula was surrounded by the Chinese army hidden in the Changjin Lake area. Before being surrounded by ambush, the goal of the U.S. forces was to annihilate the Korean People's Army as soon as possible and strive to unify the entire Peninsula before 1950. The picture shows the U.S. Marine Division's march.

### Chinese Army lacks winter clothes

At that time, extremely cold weather appeared in the Changjin Lake area, and the temperature fell to about minus 30 degrees. The 9th Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered the Korean Peninsula urgently and replaced the leaders such as the 42nd Army. Among them, in order to accelerate the travel of the army, some troops even gave up heavy weapons and winter military uniforms. Both the history of the two countries in China and the United States mentioned that the 9th Corps suffered extremely serious non -combat minus members due to extremely cold weather. The picture shows a pre -war mobilization of a volunteer force wearing a single clothes in a minus 30 degrees.

In the emergence of East East of Changjin Lake, the "Polar Bear Group" under the jurisdiction of the 7th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army was attacked by the 80th Division and 81st Division of the Volunteer Army, and the casualties were suffering. It was also hit hard. The U.S. War of the United States was ordered to be rescued, but it was also greatly resistant. The picture shows the gap between the battle. According to the history of China's war, the battle against the "Polar Bear Group" was the only battle for the Volunteer Army to participate in the early days of the Korean War to destroy the US military. The U.S. military records that after the "Polar Bear Group" successfully broke through on December 1, only 1,500 people had only 1,500 people left, of which only 385 could continue to fight.

### The strategic goals of both parties have not been achieved

When the U.S. military surrounded the Chinese army, it used a large number of solidified gasoline bombs thrown in the air, causing volunteers to suffer major casualties. According to Chinese historical records, during the Battle of Changjin Lake, the 9th Corps of the Volunteer Army was 19,000 injuries, about 30,000 frozen frostbite, and a total of 48,000 people reduced a total of 48,000, and the reduction of more than half. Although China prevented the US military from overcome the strategic attempts of the Korean Peninsula, its strategic goal to wipe out the U.S. Marine Division has not been able to achieve it.

###  The battle of "Changjin Lake" has finished "the battle to fight"?

On April 27, Yin Xiyue, a South Korean President who visited the United States, praised the first division of the US Marine Corps in the speech [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/爱国主义大片长津湖-引韩国人愤怒/a-59520117)The sea tactics that broke through the CCP's troops were raised and achieved miraculous results. Taiwan's "report" published an article "Yin Xiyue watched the Chinese" God's Work "<Changjin Lake> What to think of it", the author He and Huai pointed out that the battle for the very heavy price of the Changjin Lake was still regarded by some people of the Communist Party of China as a " Great victory. " According to the "History of the Volunteer Army of the Chinese People's Volunteer" compiled by the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, during the Korean War, the total number of volunteer army casualties, disappearances, accidents, diseases, and captured was about 900,000 people, and hundreds of thousands of burials were buried in foreign countries. In front of the world, the "sea tactics" of the Communist Party of China "grass tactics" is the fierce life. The war also greatly damaged the national economy, which was too late in China at that time, and made Chinese people miserable.

The author said that in the past, the Chinese Communist Party felt humiliated and reluctant to the battle of Changjin Lake, but now it is touted. What is the reason? War films are used to review tragic and misfortune, not to stimulate the enthusiasm of war to incite human hatred. There is a classic line "Changjin Lake": "We played all the battle we should fight, and our younger generations need not play." However, in recent years, the CCP has been around the world, so it has also caused extremely deteriorating the international environment. Today, I have repeatedly emphasized "throwing away fantasies and daring to fight". Now in the words of the Communist Party of China, the term "struggle" is endless every day.

Taliban establishes a close relationship, and does not even rule out the possibility of recognizing (legal status). "

Mariasultan, director of the Pakistan South Asian Institute of Stability Stability, pointed out that the three -party conference showed that "without the stability of Afghanistan, there is no future of this region economy." What she thinks is important is to establish a formal relationship, and this is only possible to effectively restore diplomatic connections.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Beijing's recent restrictions on the opening of domestic data to the outside world may be caused by reports from some think tanks in the United States.

The restrictions mentioned here include the practice and detention of foreign management consulting companies and audit companies in China for several weeks, as well as restricting foreign visits to Chinese databases.

The report pointed out that related reports include analysis reports from the Security and Emerging Technology Center of George City University and the New American Security Center. These reports are considered sensitive information involving China.

Among them, a policy briefing published by the Security and Emerging Technology Center in June last year analyzed how the Chinese military obtained advanced chips made by US companies in Taiwan and South Korea. A report by the New American Security Center in 2019 pointed out that the Chinese military is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence to improve its combat capabilities.

People familiar with the matter revealed that the China Internet Information Office notified various Chinese data providers in March to restrict information such as overseas access information, patents, procurement documents, academic journals, and official statistical yearbooks.

According to the Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on Sunday (May 7), Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lópezobrador said that the country has intercepted a smuggling at Lázaro Cárdenas at the Pacific port. Fentany's containers.

The Mexican Navy Minister Ohda said that the smuggling container has a weighing 35 kg of Finnini drugs and methamphetamine. They set off from Qingdao, China, passed through Busan, South Korea, and finally arrived in Mexico.

President Obrado said that Mexico now has evidence that they will ask the Chinese government to help cut off the smuggling of these goods. Obrado said he believed in Chinese President Xi Jinping in March this year to ask Beijing to provide support for anti -drug struggles; he emphasized that he would convey information to the other party in a very respectful way.

Fentny is 50 times more toxic. The US government claims that Fentney has become the main cause of drugs using drugs to use drugs. The U.S. government issued a report last year that although China is not the main exporter of Fennei, Chinese merchants still sell fentanyl's precursor raw materials to Mexico; after the illegal merchants in Mexico make fentanyl, they enter the United States. The United States has repeatedly demanded that China has taken more actions to prevent the trafficking of related drugs.

However, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied illegal smuggling Fennyi between China and Mexico last month.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-07T23-02-09-00-00/000000.png)The Republican Party has been putting pressure on President Biden, and wants to reduce expenses in exchange for raising the upper limit of debt to reach an agreement. But Janet Yellen insisted that responsibility was on the parliament.

She told the US Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) political program "thisweek": "Congress threatening the upper limit of debt raising will pay the price of economic disasters that cause economic disasters to American families and global financial systems, which is simply unacceptable."

Ye Lun warned on the 1st that the United States may use the funds to pay debts on June 1 as soon as June 1, which may detonate the crisis of default debt reversing.

The upper limit of public debt in the US government has a statutory limit, and it can only be improved through the legislation of Congress and signed by the president.

The Republican House controlled by the Republican Party voted at the end of April to raise the country's debt limit, but the Republicans seemed to seek and spread their cards for their consideration of excessive expenditure. This bill also combined with a large reduction of expenses.

However, under the opposition of the Federal Senate and the Democratic Party of the White House, the bill is destined to be a law.

The possibility of improving the first debt defaults in the United States in this urgency may have a profound impact on the United States and the global economy.

According to China CCTV News, on the 8th, on May 8, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with the US ambassador to China in Beijing.

Qin Gang said that Sino -US relations are not only of great significance to China and the United States and the world. In November last year, President Xi Jinping met with President Biden in Bali and reached important consensus. However, since then, a series of wrong words and deeds in the United States have destroyed the hard -won positive momentum of Sino -US relations. The dialogue and cooperation agenda agreed by the two parties have been disturbed, and relations between the two countries encounter ice again. The priority is to stabilize Sino -US relations and avoid spiral declines, and prevent accidents between China and the United States. This should be the most basic consensus between China and the United States. It is also the bottom line that the country and the country, and especially the two major powers must be kept. China will adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping. It is hoped that the United States will reflect on it and go with China to promote Sino -US relations out of trouble and return to the right track.

Qin Gang said that the United States should "correctly understand China", return to rationality, and deduct the first buttons of Sino -US relations, and achieve each other in the better development of the two countries. On the one hand, we cannot talk about communication, but on the other hand, it is constantly suppressing and curbing China. Can't say one set. It is necessary to respect the red line of the bottom line of China, stop damage to China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits. In particular, we must "properly handle Taiwan issues", stop continuing to hollow out a Chinese principle, and stop supporting the "Taiwan independence" split forces. We must adhere to the accidental occasional incidents in the relationship between the two countries with calmness, "professional", and pragmatic attitude to avoid being impacted by Sino -US relations. Promote dialogue cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, peer -to -peer and mutual benefit. With different, harmonious coexistence, "beauty and beauty" and "beauty and the United States", this is the Sino -US relations and world we should work together. Qin Gang said that he hoped that Ambassador Bernus had more contact, exchanging, and "thinking more" in China to make a bridge between China and the United States and made constructive efforts.

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday (May 7) that some US and European officials believe that Ukraine's upcoming spring offensive is expected to pave the way for Kiev and Moscow's negotiations before the end of the year, and China can assist in helping Bring Russia to the negotiating table.

The report pointed out that the Western world has begun to encourage Russia to start negotiations and expect China to play a role in negotiations, representing the transformation of its thinking, especially in the United States, in view of China's long -term support for Moscow, the United States has always maintained high doubts about Beijing's participation. However, US Secretary of State Antonyblinken recently expressed a cautious and optimistic attitude in recent times, and believes that Beijing can help resolve the conflict.

These officials believe that this approach is based on a belief, that is, both sides have no ability to continue to fight endlessly, and the plans that Beijing intends to play a role in international peaceful negotiations should be tested. However, they are still not sure if Russia is willing to stop fire negotiations under the leadership of its President Vladimirputin.

### Different opinion in the United States

The United States and some European countries believe that after Ukraine ended the spring offensive, the country can promote negotiations with Russia.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马克龙计划联手中国-推动俄乌和平峰会/a-65440060)The White House and the State Department officials believe that this requires Russia to show sincerity; they will continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine to help Kiev in a stronger position.

Several anonymous French and German officials revealed to the Wall Street Journal that their national leaders and US President Biden discussed the matter. They expect the White House to try to promote negotiations after the expected results of the spring offensive in Ukraine in order to allow Ukraine to recover important territories in the south.

At the same time, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is expected to meet with President Volodymyrzlensky in Berlin this month. European officials said that although Shulz would not put pressure on Salensky for negotiations, Biden would send a signal to Zelenezki, that is, seeking ceasefire negotiations in the next few months is a suitable time.

### How can the German Foreign Minister visit China for "correction" for Macron?

However, the Wall Street Journal quoted European officials that the US government had different opinions on the matter -the main officials of the National Security Council in favor of negotiations, while the State Council and the Central Intelligence Agency and other departments were suspicious of this.

A spokesman for the National Security Council denied this statement to the Wall Street Journal, while the State Council and the Central Intelligence Agency did not respond to the request for comment.

### Obstacles to promote negotiations

During the negotiation process, European and American countries are worried that if the war is in a deadlock, it may be difficult to maintain the scale of support for Ukraine, because the high loss rate of Ukraine forces and supplies. Some officials and industry sources told the Wall Street Journal that ammunition supply is a key issue because it turns out that the West cannot support Ukraine while also meets its own needs.

In addition, promoting Russia and Ukraine negotiations is not the consensus of European countries. The British, Poland, Baltic regions and other small countries believe that the upcoming spring offensive cannot reshape the war situation, and it should give Ukraine more "achieved results".

On May 4th, Avrilhaines, director of the National Intelligence Agency, said in Congress Mountain that Putin was not interested in conflict with negotiations, and believed that Western willingness to support Ukraine would weaken over time. "Putin is likely to know that time is good for him," she said.

Heines added that Putin may have reduced his recent goal in Ukraine, that is, consolidating control over the eastern and southern parts of the country, and ensuring that Kiev will never join the North Atlantic Convention. She said that if Putin agrees to "suspend conflicts through negotiations", its goal may be to use this time to rebuild the Russian forces and prepare for future offensive operations.

### Chinese character

The Wall Street Journal reports that some French and German officials believe that China may become a guarantor in Russia and Ukraine.

In February this year, China called for a peaceful negotiation to end the Ukrainian war, and outlined its plan in a 12 -point document to set China as a neutral mediation person. In the same month, Macron proposed to Zeroski privately that when Kiev believed that the time was ripe, he hosted a ceasefire agreement in Paris. Zenoski said at the time that he would only participate in Byendon and Xi Jinping.

Since then, Macron has continuously urged Beijing to play a constructive role in diplomacy, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专家们如何看中乌领导人26日的通话/a-65452567)However, according to the officials who understand the conversation, the call has made people hope for Xi Jinping's hope of supporting Russia, because the content does not mention specific support for Ukraine.

A Ukrainian official said, "It's too early to say that everything is said, we are waiting for the (China) representative to arrive at Kiev." Ukraine's ambassador to the United States Oksanamarkarova said that Kiev welcomes any pursuit of peace in them In the process of playing a constructive role, it is not considered Beijing to be the key.

Nevertheless, several European officials said that leaders of major European countries believe that China is eager to participate in the final ceasefire negotiations.

### Russia and Ukraine The current battle situation

On May 7, Russia's Wagner's mercenary organization, the head of the mercenaries, said that after the lack of support from Moscow on the 5th, his troops announced their wanting to withdraw from Bakhmut due to lack of support from Moscow on the 5th. Now that the authorities have been promised to get more ammunition.

The statement hinted that Wagner may not perform his previous operations, that is, withdrawing from Bachmut on May 10. The city has become a long -term battle between Wagner and the Ukrainian army, and both sides have suffered heavy losses. Because thousands of fireworks were launched every day, the battle exhausted the artillery reserves of both sides.

At the same time, Russia appointed Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Governor of Crimean Peninsula, said on Sunday that a series of drone attacks in Ukraine were repelled overnight.Last week, the Russian authorities claimed that they shot down the drone who wanted to attack Putin and said the operation was from Ukraine. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄國自導自演烏克蘭否認以無人機襲克宮/a-65509455)It also said that Moscow may be preparing to launch the next wave of violent offensive against Ukraine.

(Voice of Germany) is located in the Shangshui border between Shangshui, northern Hong Kong. It is not only a hotspot of tourists in mainland China, but also a "parallelist" town. The new crown epidemic has made them extinct for three years. Since [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港与内地2月6日开始无检疫无上限通关/a-64604713)Later, the drugstore once again stood on both sides of the street, and customers dragged their luggage to buy and packed on the spot. The crowd is not as crowded as before the epidemic, but the influence of passengers is obviously easy to see.

Ms. Bai, a mainland man, just leased the new store on Shangshui, and planned to decorate to open cosmetics stores, do parallel imports and purchasing business. She said to Germany's voice: "Mainland cosmetics (parallel imports) are relatively strict, and often check it. After all, doing this in Hong Kong is a legitimate operation, which is more advantageous." The store is concentrated. The predecessor was a "parallel import shop" specializing in the grocery of Hong Kong -made goods. It was originally opened by Hong Kong people in the epidemic.

Now on the streets of Shangshui, it is not difficult to find a drugstore named after Putonghua Pinyin, which is less common in the past. Ms. Bai, who had been in business in Shenzhen for the first time, came to Hong Kong to open a store, and several mainland friends around her went to Shangshui to open a physical store. She described this as an industry trend, but frankly said that the rent was higher than that of the budget, and the people in the market did not reach expectations. "It may have just cleared the customs, and the customs are too strict, so no many people have come to buy a large number of purchases." However, she is still optimistic about the prospects: "Although the three -year epidemic crack down on the economic capabilities of many people in China, I think they have the ability to consume frequently. The desire to consume is still there. "

Shortly after the customs clearance, the residents of Shangshui had felt the changes in the community. Miss Liao told Germany: "Many of the well -made small shops can't hold the rent increase, and the environment is relatively comfortable during the epidemic, and now everything is returned to the original shape." She said that when the government announced the switch, most of the vacant shops immediately immediately closed the shops immediately. Change the drugstore, as a resident, "unable to change and was forced to accept." Mr. Tan also has a similar experience. In an interview with the Voice of Germany, he said: "A lot of local shops have closed. The usual night food shops and stationery stores are gone. Worried about the load capacity of public transportation: "After the customs clearance, take the train to the city, and the carriage will be a lot crowded.

### China Switch: Vaccine Tourism has become popular in Hong Kong

###?

Mainland ’s labor season leave is the peak season of traditional tourism. During the five -day“ Golden Week ”of the Hong Kong Government, 625,000 in the Mainland visit Hong Kong, which was slightly exceeded by the authorities expectations, but resumed only 60 % of the same period in the same period in 2019. Long -dragon dragon emerged in the stars, and the ticket lobby was full of mainland passengers who scrambled to buy tickets to cross the sea. During the epidemic, the Hong Kong Palace Museum and M+Museums, which were opened during the epidemic, all recorded the highest number of entrants since the opening of the museum.

However, in the water -this mainland tourist hotspot, the merchant has gone through the "abnormal" golden week. Jewelry store clerk, Miss Wang pointed out that the store did not have mainland customers to patronize during the May Day holiday, and the business amount was 40%worse than expected, and the nearby drugstores were also very deserted. She told Germany's voice: "It is completely unexpected, we originally hoped that the business would be good and prepared a lot of special products. Unexpectedly, even if the price was set very low, there were still no guests." When the epidemic was the worst, she said After the customs clearance, the business volume was only more than 20 %, and it was pessimistic that "it is impossible to reply to the level of 2018."

Miss Wang has been engaged in jewelry retail for many years. The client group of the store is a passenger in Guangdong Province. Jewelry stores are a must -have where many mainland passengers come to Hong Kong, but she observed the change after the epidemic: "The guests are more cautious. If they feel beautiful a few years ago, it is common for them to buy a ring tens of thousands. I will be reluctant. "Therefore, her shop dare not enter too much valuable products, and she has to study a special style to cater to the new taste. "The consumption model has changed. They paid attention to shopping in the past, and now they pay more attention to the tourism experience.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T04-06-00Z/65545365_401.jpg)During the Golden Week, there were crowds of popular attractions in Hong Kong, but it only returned to 60 % of the same period in 2019.

###

Not only the consumption model, but also travel habits. During the Golden Week, traditional attractions such as Victoria Harbor, Daodian Street in Guangdong, and famous milk tea stalls in Central, still have mainland tourists. At the same time, many Hong Kong "check -in" hot spots can be seen on the mainland social media small red book. Some mainland passengers eat McDonald's fast food under the McDonald's road sign of Hong Kong Island, and take photos to the Land Police Station of the Landmark of the Hong Kong -made film. There are even posts on Xiaohong's book about alternative travel strategies and private room attractions to do medical examinations and bank accounts as "tourist strokes."

Miss Li Li, a free travel tourist from mainland China, visited Hong Kong last week. She said to Germany: "This trip mainly went to Hong Kong tea restaurant to eat food, and came to visit with friends for four weeks. I felt that there were more Macau passengers in Hong Kong. She said that she was different from the past. She did not arrange a luxury shopping itinerary, but just bought some snacks and daily necessities. "Because I think Hong Kong is similar to the mainland, and many products have been on the mainland, so I buy it in Hong Kong."

Hong Kong's economic growth in the first quarter of this year was 2.7%, reversing the disadvantages of economic shrinkage for four consecutive seasons last year. Due to the low base effect during the epidemic period, private consumption expenditure in the first quarter increased by 12%. The Hong Kong Government and the business community hope that the tourism industry will become this year after switching [] [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港千億赤字創史上第二高-學者預算案缺乏遠見/a-64785613)One of the main motivation. Li Zhaobo, a honorary teaching and researcher at the Institute of Asia -Pacific Business Institute of CUHK, analyzed that the latest data reflects the average value before the private consumption power does not meet the epidemic. Looking at the May Day holiday market, he is not optimistic about the speed of recovering the tourism industry. He said to Germany: "The epidemic is like a reshuffle. Mainland passengers replaced other channels for shopping in Hong Kong. This habit can be permanent."

Li Zhaobo believes that mainland tourists in Hong Kong have a peak of consumption -oriented travel models. "The situation will not be as beautiful as before the epidemic. The most capable group will choose to go shopping in other countries. After all, Hong Kong is not a product of the product. More people are pursuing an authentic culture, not simply rushing to famous stores." Under the influence of social media and the change of economic conditions and shopping models after the epidemic, the authorities and the industry must think about the new way. He warned: "Hong Kong's tourism industry is still dreaming, thinking about relying on the past. The reality is that the tourism industry alone (Agent) is not sustainable. You need to meet the transformation at any time."

In the past, we should not have been When we are so close to China, when China needs in the past, our funds and technology have been invested in. Now China is strong and is a permanent member of the Security Council. ","

Li Zhengxun further believes that China hopes that there is no nuclearization of the peninsula, but its true idea is that North Korea in the north should not conduct nuclear tests. South Korea in the south should not hold a joint military exercise with the United States to maintain the current division. The willingness.

In response to Nevada, at most, it can only be used to use the total amount of water in Coloradoriver 2%, and Las Vegas takes strict measures such as banning lawns and restricting swimming pools. Therefore The amount is reduced by nearly 1/3.

Southern Nevada Water Authority spokesman Bronsonmack said: "On the surface, Las Vegas seems to be wasteful and indulgent, but our community is actually very water."

This is due to the severe drought period in the early 2000s, a set of strict laws, financial incentives and educational measures formulated by Nevada.

Now, when federal officials consider for mandatory water -limiting measures across the United States, Las Vegas, which has a successful water saving, suddenly became "water -saving stars" and "model cities".

On Las Vegasstrip, famous casino scenic spots, such as Bellagio's fountains and canal at Venetian (Venetian), all use non -drinking water from private wells.

In the wide suburbs, early in the morning, the "water patrol" car flashed around the street with lights, check whether the resident's water sprinkler was damaged, or whether the water pipe ruptured and leaked.

Investigators will record illegal acts. If they are first offenders, they will set up a warning flag on the grass, and those who repeatedly officers will directly issue a penalty.

Cameron Donnarumma, an investigation, said that some homeowners felt "helpless" about the "watery watch police" in the early morning, but most people cooperated.

In fact, the "Water Watch Police" also has to rely on residents to report to waste water through the application (APP). They have an average of 20 to 50 times a day because they receive APP reports and go on the door to check the water meter.

By 2027, in addition to through the sky, Las Vegas will fully ban "non -functional" grass leather water that is purely beautifully set.

The Las Vegas government provides a subsidy for homeowners per square foot, encouraging them to remove more water -saving alternatives such as garries and paving dripping.

The border city of Cosas, the border city of Texas, had a car crashing bus station in a car crash station in Brownsville, causing seven people to die, multiple people injured, and a male driver was arrested.

Reuters reported that the incident occurred at around 8:30 am on Sunday time (May 7) in central United States (around 9:30 pm Singapore time).

Police and the fire department said a sport -type multi -functional car rushed into the bus station. In addition to being charged with reckless driving, the driver of the accident may also face additional control.

Brownwell is located near the southeast of Texas, the United States and Mexico border. Local police officer San Dorvar said that the collided bus station was close to a shelter that provided temporary accommodation to Vietnam immigrants, and the deceased included some immigrants.

There are still no details of the number of injuries or the situation of the injured.

According to the New York Times, Trevino, Judge of Cameron County, is not yet clear whether the male driving deliberately hit the crowd or lost his control of the vehicle.

According to US media reports, the man driving the car was also injured in the incident. After being arrested by the police, he received alcohol and drug tests.

This policy is about to end on May 11 this year. Recently, the U.S. -Mexico border has once again emerged from the wave of immigration, and the number of illegal entry has continued to increase.

(Voice of German in China) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced on Monday (May 8) that Chinese President Xi Jinping will personally host the first "China -Central Asian Summit" on May 18 and 19, on May 18th and 19th. President of Kazakh, Gilgis, Tajik, Turkan, and Uzbeki will be invited to the meeting. At the same time, the President of the Four Kingdoms in addition to Turkmen will also visit China from May 16th to 20th.

Shi Jianyu, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Guoan Research Institute and Secretary -General of the Taiwan Central Asia Society, pointed out that China is very important to the summit. This is also after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. To DW, this shows that "(China) has begun to replace Russia's status. Although it will not be achieved in the short period of time, it starts to do this."

### Xi Jinping consolidated Central Asia

Central Asia has traditionally been regarded as the scope of Russian forces. In the past few decades, Beijing has continued to deepen its influence in the area. Last fall, Xi Jinping 3 years later in the new crown epidemic [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/疫情後首出關-習近平為何出訪中亞/a-63100583)Essence In 2013, Xi Jinping proposed the "Belt and Road" initiative, and Central Asia was a key area. This year's initiative also coincided with the 10th anniversary.

Central Asian experts Shi Jianyu told DW that China is almost equal to "all aspects of the local political and economic links." At present, a puzzle that is still worse is only a military security level.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T07-28-00Z/63114545_401.jpg)In September last year, Xi Jinping visited Kazakhstan.

"In the past, China was afraid of Russia and believed that Central Asia was the back garden of Russia, but Russia wanted to cope with the Ukrainian war and asked China for help." He told DW that China took the opportunity at this moment. Military levels, such as selling weapons, providing military training, or more places to study in Chinese military colleges. "As for the economic level, he pointed out that there are also problems in China's current economy. Further expansion, I am afraid that "there is no time to manage."

Chinese official media reported that the first China -Central Asian Summit will focus on strengthening the economic and diplomatic relations between Beijing and Central Asian countries. According to data released by the Ministry of Commerce last month, China ’s exports to Central Asia in 2022 increased by 60%year -on -year to $ 1.4 billion. In addition, China, as the world's second largest energy consumer, has invested billions of dollars to develop natural gas reserves in Central Asia.

In April of this year, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said in a meeting with the Central Asian State Foreign Minister that Beijing insisted on "good -neighborly and friendly" policies for Central Asia. The Global Times reported at the time that Qin Gang said that China and Central Asian countries were "good neighbors, good friends, good partners, and good brothers of fate". Essence

Professor Zhu Yongbiao of the "Belt and Road" research center of Lanzhou University told Global Times last month, especially [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/秦刚呼吁塔利班打击恐怖势力/a-65542377), China and Central Asia have more space for cooperation than before. On the other hand, with the decline in the status of Central Asian countries in the US geographical strategic orbit, and the importance of Central Asian countries aware of the importance of diversified balance of diplomacy, the willingness of Central Asian countries and China to cooperate with China has also increased.

Since February 24, 2022, the Chinese President Xi Jinping did not contact the Ukrainian President Zeelianzki. Until the spring of this year, Ukraine was preparing to counterattack. After the war of the war, the two called for the first time after the war; China insisted on persuading and promoting talks, and sent representatives to visit countries such as Ukraine to visit in -depth communication with all parties. On the day of Xi Ze's call, a proposal of the United Nations General Assembly mentioned "Russia's invasion of Ukraine", and China still voted in favor of the voting in the whole case. This made the outside world speculate that China's attitude towards the Russian and Ukraine War changed.

In the past year, the United States and other Western countries have continued to condemn Russia to invade Ukraine, and China, which is "friendly" with Russia, has always claimed to maintain a neutrality against Russia and Ukraine. The government and its control of public opinion have actually assisted in preaching Russia's arguments on war.

Recently, the Asian Facts Research Lab and Taiwan Democratic Laboratory (Doublethink Lab), Ukrainian Citizen Organization Detector Media and research institutions Iri BeaconProject jointly released a research- [] [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-05082023081536.html/first-100-days-full-report-chn-simplified.pdf)Essence The research report shows that within 100 days after the Russian army invaded Ukraine, the narrative of Chinese information space repeats the Russian narrative in a low cost manner, and the common theme can be observed in the two information spaces of China and Russia: anti -American and anti -Western mood, It is determined that Russia is a victim and hero.

In the second year of the Russian war, similar communication phenomena are still continuing. Asian facts check the laboratory to observe China's narrative of Russia and Ukraine's conflict, and find that the Chinese media often reproduce Russian arguments, but the publicity focus has been adjusted. "Heroes", the United States is the "villain" for "arch fire".

** Research: During the Russian and Ukraine War, China Copy Russian narrative **

The above report collected narratives from February 12 to May 31, 2022, and chose three topics to analyze: the theory of the biological weapon laboratory, the Bucha Massacre, and sanction Russia. Based on character, story meaning and manipulation techniques analysis of narratives, the characters of Western countries, Russia, Ukraine and other countries are further subdivided into heroes, villains, victims, and chess pieces.

Narrative analysis shows that Chinese narrative repeats Russian narrative in a low cost manner in Mandarin information space. One way is to induce or directly quote Russian officials or media in the middle of the Chinese context. In the conspiracy theory of the Biotechnology Laboratory, Russia plays the dual identity of heroes and victims in both information spaces. Sino -Russian propaganda aims to promote a narrative, that is, the United States and Ukraine are cooperating to attack Russia.

In narratives against Russian sanctions, Russia is usually depicted as victims, and narratives observed in the two information spaces of China and Russia have highlighted western institutions and international communities in Russia's sanctions. For example, in the narrative of the Buzha Massacre, many media reports described Western society as villains, while Russia was depicted as victims. These narratives pay special attention to the responsibility of the Buzha Massacre to Ukraine and the West.

Other agencies have also found that the main narrative of the use of false information in Russia continued during the Russian and Ukraine War. In order to expose and combat foreign publicity and false information, the "Global participation center" (GEC) was established on the occasion of the anniversary of the Russia and Ukraine [] [] [](https://www.state.gov/disarming-disinformation/%E8%99%9A%E5%81%87%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E8%BD%AE%E7%9B%98%E8%B5%8C%E5%8D%9A%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%8B%E9%87%8C%E5%A7%86%E6%9E%97%E5%AE%AB%E4%B8%BA%E6%97%A0%E7%90%86%E6%88%98%E4%BA%89%E8%AF%A1%E8%BE%A9%E7%9A%84/)Report, the five most important false remarks used in Russia's false information and publicity ecosystems: 1)NATO's siege to Russia and Russia "not an invaders"; 2)"Ukrainian provocation" and "racial extinction to Donbas"; 3)Naziization and de -militaryization; 4)Re -describe the war from "de -Nazi" to "Satanhua"; 5)"Defend Russia's sovereignty" against the West.

"Global Participation Center" special envoy and coordinator James Rubin recently accepted [](https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1629040287212269570)It was said that China repeated Russia's lies on this war over and over again, repeating Russia's lies in biological weapons claims, and also said that the United States promoted the war, which was their false statement. According to [](https://www.dw.com/zh/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%9B%BD%E5%8A%A1%E9%99%A2%E7%89%B9%E4%BD%BF%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%A8%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E8%8A%B1%E8%B4%B9%E6%95%B0%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%BF%E4%BC%A0%E6%92%AD%E8%99%9A%E5%81%87%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF/a-64852300)Rubin said that China spent billions of spreading false information worldwide, including false information that is completely consistent with Russia on the Ukraine issue.

** Chinese propaganda theme persuasion and vs arch fire **

Russia has invaded Ukraine for more than 14 months. According to the future media and false information research centers set up by the Taiwan Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (TAIWAN AILABS). The decrease after month, from February to April this year, significantly increased.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-08T08-30-38-04-00/000001.png)

Many major events occurred from February to April this year, including the anniversary of the Russian and Ukraine War, Xi Jinping visited Russia, Finland to join NATO, etc.; Asian facts investigated the laboratory to review Chinese diplomats recently about Russia and Ukraine's conflict, and found that they often mentioned China " Persuading and talking "," arch fire "in the United States. The views of these high -level officials have also been further spread and amplified through domestic media.

But the peak of use occurred from from February to April this year. It should be noted that China often uses these two words to respond to the issue of Russia and Ukraine, but when talking about the situation of the Taiwan Strait, it will also accuse the American arch fire.

The Chinese statement after the call of Xi Jinping and Zeelianzki made it clear that "the core position is to persuade and promote talks", "China will persist in persuasion and talk, and make its own efforts to stop the fire and restore peace as soon as possible." If the set is listed at the beginning of this article, according to the character category defined in the report, China is shaping itself as a "hero".

Faced with Western countries such as the United States accusing China of might help Russia, China has denied that any of the conflict provides weapons and shaped its "victims" to be discredited.

Regarding military aid disputes, China clarified on the one hand, on the one hand, it takes the opportunity to spread the United States and other Western countries as the "arched fire" anti -decent to transport deadly weapons to the Ukraine battlefield and the fortune of war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mao Ning said on April 6. "There are military groups such as NATO in the United States that have unprecedented responsibilities for the Ukrainian crisis." Xinhuanet [](http://www.xinhuanet.com/mil/2023-02/22/c_1211731674.htm), China News Service [](https://www.chinanews.com.cn/gj/2023/03-03/9964952.shtml)wait.

** The media played the problem and enlarge the false narrative **

Asian facts investigated the laboratory observed that in the Russia and Ukraine War, China stood criticized the United States and NATO, but when foreign officials spoke in formal occasions, they were relatively restrained on certain sensitive issues. However, many official background media will further interpret and add misleading and false details on the basis of official statements (Reference: [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-03232023132923.html)); In view of view reviews, Chinese media often unilaterally quote the comments from Russian media and experts.

For example, when Bayeng visited Ukraine in February, [](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/202302/t20230221_11028718.shtml)Only a brief response: "All parties, especially large powers, should adopt a responsible attitude to create conditions for persuasion and talks, and do more things that are conducive to politics, and should not be poured on the fire, let alone profit."

From February 20th to 21st, the Global Network issued many targeted reports on Biden's visit to Ukraine. The following three are listed:

[](https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4Bme6NdOHID)It is pointed out that Medvedev, vice chairman of the Russian Federal Security Conference, issued a post in a social media, saying that Kiev, the west direction, provides a large number of weapons and funds, allows NATO countries to earn a lot of funds and "hide" weapons to sell Give terrorists from all over the world.

[ ](https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4BnCpMdCqsq) [](https://m.huanqiu.com/article/4BnCpMdCqsq)"One article quoted a large number of Twitter netizens and questioned why Biden did not go to Ohio, who had not recently occurred in the" poison train incident ", and mocked Biden's comics, photos, etc., and this article also appeared Russian scholars quoted by the above reports. Gu Xiefu and Zalin.

Some of the previous news, some only reported a single Russian official statement. Although some quoted the contents of British and American media such as the Guardian and New Year, the content of the British and American media reports, but in terms of views, it is obvious that the Russian scholars interviewed by Russian media reports are obviously reported by Russian media reports. Mainly.

Another case is Finland's joining NATO. Chinese diplomats have repeatedly criticized NATO's eastward expansion in the past, but in May last year, when talking about Finland's application to join NATO, the Chinese side called "major progress" and said that it would bring new factors to China and Fen relations. It was officially joined in NATO in April, and the official Chinese official did not make a statement.

Asian facts investigation of the laboratory noticed that Chinese officials dealt with Finland's entry into NATO relatively cold, but China Daily, CCTV and other media reported [](https://cn.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202304/05/WS642cae03a3102ada8b236dff.html) ，[ ](https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20230405/1049292973.html)It also quoted the analysis of the so -called Chinese experts, saying that Finland's joining NATO will damage European security.

From the above reports, we can see that Chinese official media continue to quote the remarks of Russian officials or media, as well as traces of China -Russia propaganda and cooperation; on the other hand, it also shows the role and division of labor in propaganda work by Chinese officials and official media.

**in conclusion**

Through the above -mentioned research, the data of the Future Media and False Information Research Center, and the in -depth analysis of the main points of China and Ukraine's conflict on Russia and Ukraine, we have found that since the war, China has a narrative on this war. Its changes and unchanged. It is unchanged that the war narrative of the Chinese media has always maintained a certain degree of consistency with the public opinion of the Russian media; what changes is that in the war narrative of Chinese media and official speeches, China has a subtle change in its own role positioning. From the beginning of the war, from the early stage The official surface maintains neutrality, and if he wants to put himself out of the event, it will become a "person" that actively builds peaceful maintenanceers in the later period.

Asian facts check the laboratory summary observed phenomenon: 1)Since the Kaijie War of Russia and Ukraine, China has been assisting Russia to propaganda through quotation, reprinting, etc., and has continued to blame the United States and the West; 2)China particularly spread its "persuasion and talk" in particular this year, accusing the United States of "arch fire pouring fuel", including the Chinese statement after Xi Jinping and Zellegiski called, and also used these two words; 3)It involves more sensitive issues such as US leaders' visits and specific countries joining NATO. The official official speech is relatively restrained. The official media quoted Russian officials, media statements, or so -called international expert analysis to achieve critical purposes.

The Australian government announced on Monday (May 8) that in the next four years, it will be included in the federal budget of $ 14.6 billion (about S $ 13 billion) as a bailout for families and enterprises to deal with the cost of living, and promise that it will not cause nomination Expansion.

Reuters reports that the Australian government said the plan will directly alleviate the pressure brought by prices and inflation. Although the inflation rate in the first quarter of Australia has slowed down, it is still close to 7.0%of the 30 -year high.

The Australian Minister of Finance Chammer said: "The core of the fiscal budget ... is to ensure that the cost of alleviating the cost of living will not exacerbate inflation."

Chammer will announce the federal budget on Tuesday (9th).

It is reported that the Australian government will provide financial assistance for more than 5 million low -income families, small enterprises and pensions to assist them in responding high electricity bills.

Charmers has repeatedly emphasized that his budget will limit expenditure to avoid increasing inflation pressure. The Australian Reserve Bank suddenly announced the interest rate hike last week, causing the market to shock.

Australian Federal Reserve Bank warned last Friday (5th) that considering that productivity growth was slow, energy prices rose and rents soared, inflation was facing upward risk.

(Voice of Germany) in the Ningde Times (CATL), which controls 37%of the global battery market, was officially put into production in the factory in Turinen, Germany in January this year. and [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/宁德时代在欧美投资遭遇阻力/a-64944983)It occupies an important proportion of China's investment in Turinen.

According to Deguanglian, the investment ratio of Turus from China has increased from less than 10%in 2019 to 14.4%in 2020, and then reached 18.6%in 2021, and rose to 27.3%in 2022. The value and services imported from China are nearly 5 billion euros. Among them, when Ningde Times started construction in Turinen in October 2019, he promised to invest 1.8 billion euros. In addition, the manufacturer providing batteries for BMW, Audi and other car dealers also promised to create about 2,000 jobs there.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不忧欧中关系-中国电池厂商正式在德国量产/a-64539329)The factory said that about 400 of more than 800 workers during the trial period were Chinese.

### Economic dependence and technology dependence

Nonetheless, AndreasFreytag, a professor of economic policy at Yaa University, still warned that in the industrial field cooperation, if technology flows to China, it is what China is happy. He told Deguang Lian: "Ningde Times is now inseparable from many auto manufacturers." He said that China's policy is to make the West more dependent on Chinese technology.

There are also companies in Turinen to set up factories in China, such as Ruhlamat, a mechanical manufacturer. The company has 300 employees in Turinen and 800 employees in China. Chief Operating Officer Tipestca(ChristianTipecska)To Deguang Lian, "Of course, we must also maintain a good relationship with the local party organizations in China." He said that we must know that China is an authoritarian government, and the policy during the new crown epidemic shows what this means. "Sometimes it is closed around the port." Tipuska said that if Germany depends on Chinese supply, it will be a problem. But if you want to sell in China, you need to be produced locally. "The important thing is cross -cultural training." Then the communication with Chinese employees was very good.

###: Investment is a good thing

Deduanglian reporter also interviewed WolfgangtieFensee, Minister of Economic Minister of Economy. He believes that China's interests are also selling its products in Germany and European markets for a long time, so China must show a responsible partner image. He said that it is beneficial to get new technologies and new employment positions. Tigzawa said that China has 30 companies or participating projects in Turinen, and there is no obvious problem. However, he also said that the entire supply network needs to be examined. If the overall system is unbalanced, it will bring losses to all parties.

In addition, the settlement of Ningde Times in Turinen also brought hope to other local related suppliers: maybe they can also get some production contracts. However, another worry is that in the Ningde era, it may give priority to the suppliers who are familiar with their products and can quickly mass -produce. Deguang Lian said that KDL, a Chinese manufacturer produced by a battery shell, settled near the Turinen Factory in Ningde Times, and hired about 100 employees. Ningde Times responded that the company cooperated with many companies in Germany, such as dust -free workshop or laser technology to cooperate with Baden Fuetteburg.

After Cheng Lei was arrested, contact the outside world was almost cut off, and only the Australian Embassy Consul of the Australian Embassy went to visit the prison every month.

(Voice of German in Germany) Analysts believe that China ’s increasing attention to national security and exacerbate competition with the United States may transform its efforts to re -contact with the world after the three -year epidemic blockade.

Since the cancellation of the epidemic control measures that have actually closed the border since 2020, Beijing has adopted a series of contradictory diplomatic and business actions in recent months, which has made many observers doubt their motivations. These include: while holding talks with the invaders Russia, it is declared to promote the peace of Ukraine, spread the red carpet to Western leaders while upgrading its military threat to democratic Taiwan. Wake foreign enterprise leaders.

Analysts say that the information that looks uncertain may be the result of President Xi Jinping's strong strengthening of national security. The relationship with the American superpowers in the United States has fallen to the trough, and it is also causal and effect with the strengthening of national security.

Alfred Wu, an associate professor of the School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore, said: "The harsh reality of China ... is the security of security now, from economy to diplomacy,"

Wu Muyu said that the overwhelming consideration of security is being harmed by some diplomatic relations in China and the plan of its world -largest economy in the world, even if it tries to consolidate its authority on key geopolitical issues including the Ukraine crisis.

He said: "Although Chinese vocalists are about to be open to the public, it has gradually closed."

### ** From domestic problems to foreign threats **

Xi Jinping specifically mentioned national security in a speech that broke the convention over the years last October to continue the third term. It is a extensive concept, covering various issues such as politics and economy to technology and territorial disputes.

Subsequently, his speech delivered at the National People's Congress in March this year was even more acute, saying that China's security is being challenged by the United States attempting to curb its rise.

Since taking office in 2012, national security has been one of Xi Jinping's most concerned issue. His first two -term term pays more attention to domestic issues, such as different politicians, rights protection, and Muslim groups in Xinjiang.

In his speech in October last year, he emphasized "external security" and "international security". Analysts say that this marks its new focus to deal with foreign threats from Washington.

When asked about a series of issues raised by this report, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said "do not understand the situation."

Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China have repeatedly claimed that China is a responsible major country, supports multilateralism and globalization, and accuses other countries of speculation in "Chinese threat theory".

### No longer "to keep the light"

In recent years, Beijing has changed Deng Xiaoping's tone to keep the tone. CNN has reported that compared with Chinese diplomats who have been gentle in the past few decades, "Wolf Diplomacy" is a completely different type. These Chinese diplomats will not issue a lengthy statement, but on Twitter and other social media platforms to directly attack any criticism of China or the Communist Party.

### There are wolves in the wolf?

The "Wolf Diplomacy" statement is taken from the successful movie "War Wolf", which was released in China in 2015 and has been successfully released in 2015. The nationalist emotions of the film are quite strong. Chinese diplomats did not deny this expression at first. According to the Chinese official media CCTV, in May 2020, then the then Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming once said that China insists on taking the peace route. However, because there is a "wolf" in the world, China needs "wolf warfare" to defend national dignity. The picture shows the stills of "War Wolf 2".

### China Foreign Ministry is unhappy

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not agree with the statement of "wolf diplomacy". In December 2020, Le Yucheng, then deputy minister of Foreign Affairs, said in a forum that the label of the "War Wolf Diplomacy" was at least misunderstanding of Chinese diplomacy. He said that China has always been the state of etiquette and is expensive, and has never taken the initiative to provoke others; "Wolf Diplomacy" is actually another copy of "Chinese threat theory", and another "discourse trap". Let's not fight back, scold and give up, and give up fighting. I suspect that these people have not woke up from the old dreams 100 years ago. "

### Wolf spokesman

One of the representatives of the "War Wolf Diplomacy" was Zhao Lijian, a former Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, and his remarks have caused controversy many times. For example, in March 2020, he said on Twitter that the U.S. military may bring the new crown epidemic to Wuhan. After the Foreign Minister of the Five Eyes Alliance issued a statement on the issue of Hong Kong, he responded at a routine conference that whether they had "five eyes" or "ten eyes", as long as they dare to damage China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits, Be careful of their eyes being blinded. He also released a tweet and false pictures that criticized Australian soldiers in the so -called war crimes in Afghanistan. Australian Prime Minister Morrison said that the Chinese government should be ashamed of this tweet.

### Farewell to the "War Wolf" style?

In January 2023, 50 -year -old Zhao Lijian unloaded the position of spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was transferred to the deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Marine Affairs. Almost at the same time, the former ambassador to the United States Qin Gang (pictured) replaced Wang Yi as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Some political analysts believe that these personnel changes means that China has intended to change the "wolf war" diplomatic image established in the past few years. However, after the new foreign minister took office, the edge did not lose his predecessor. The spokesman's attitude faced the international media without any ease.

####  Where is the "Wolf Diplomacy"?

### The rhythm is a bit messy

Reuters reports that Chinese diplomats have increasingly criticized human rights in the United States and Western countries in public comments. The information passed is that Western countries are not qualified to criticize China, and China has been attacked by more Western countries. The report quoted Western diplomats that China's war wolf diplomacy "has strong defensive and urgent", but the effect is counterproductive, and the audience of information transmission is not clear, and it is a bit "chaotic."

[](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);) [ ](javascript:void\(0\);)### ** The success and defeat of diplomatic shuttles **

Analysts said that China affects the recent foreign operations on security magic.

For example, due to rejection of condemning its intimate ally and the largest oil supply country, Russia, China has been questioned.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中烏領袖通話-美國促和效果有待觀察/a-65443720)\-The purpose is to emphasize that Beijing does not favor any party-after the Chinese ambassador to France questioned Ukraine's sovereignty, some analysts called "harmful control".

Charles Parton, a researcher at the British Think Tank Geopark Strategy Commission, said that China calls on Ukraine to achieve peace with its own struggle with the United States.

He said, "Beijing does not care whether its mediation works ... It is important that this is an opportunity to damage the reputation of the United States." He pointed out that China claims that the United States and its allies provide weapons for Ukraine to pour fuel for the war.

Associate Professor of Political Science, Clark University in Boston(Michael Butler)It is said that the Ukrainian war is the test of the US determination to test the United States.

He said: "Xi Jinping is particularly concerned about whether the United States will or to defend Ukraine to help it to resist Russia's aggression. At the same time, it will publicly shape China as a sober and rational voice and shape the United States as an invaders who are in control. "

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-08T12-45-00Z/65248957_401.jpg)Xi Jinping visited French President Macron, which was visited in Beijing on April 6

Analysts said that China's attempt to win the United States' allies in Europe is also part of its influence strategy against Washington, but the results achieved are half -mixed.

They mentioned the meeting between Xi Jinping and French President Macron last month in China. This seems to be a friendly and constructive meeting, but its beautiful impression allows China to begin after Macron left for a few hours [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制措施来了中国军演-台回应蓄意制造紧张关系/a-65262404)Destroyed.

Together with Macron's weakness on the weak Taiwan issue, it has caused public opinion to please China to please China. EU officials subsequently took a stronger position on China.

### ** The joy and worry of business revitalization **

China's security emphasis may also cause it to fall into isolation in economics.

At the two high -profile business summits held in China in March this year, Chinese officials have worked hard to emphasize that the country will be able to restart business after the epidemic.

However, in recent weeks, China has adopted a wide range of anti -spy laws, and has adopted a "punishment" operation for some overseas companies in China.

Lester Ross, chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce China Policy Committee, told Reuters that "while seeking to attract more foreign investment in China, the security department seems to be even more unscrupulous."

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials have previously stated that Beijing welcomes foreign companies that comply with Chinese law.

Foreign investors have not been optimistic about China's re -opening up, but the rise in China's capital market for decades is also falling. Competition between China and the United States has become the most worrying issue for investors.

Among them, the founder of the world's largest hedging base, one of the world's largest hedging base, Delio(Ray Dalio)He used to be a highly anticipated foreign investor in China.

Dalio, who retired earlier this year, recently wrote on his personal LinkedIn account.(Reuters)

U.S. President Biden is expected to announce a new rule on Monday (May 8) that requires US Airlines to provide compensation for passengers when major flight delays or cancellations.

According to Bloomberg and Reuters, the Minister of Transport Pete Buttigieg issued a statement saying: "When the airline causes flight cancellation or delay, passengers should not pay."

The statement pointed out that the Ministry of Communications plans to write regulations that require airlines and other carriers to be responsible for retention passengers, including dining and hotels.

An anonymous White House official said that the government will also launch a new version of the Ministry of Communications official website to show which airlines have provided compensation for passengers who have encountered delays and cancellations. He said that the White House hopes to promote the existing benefits of airlines, saying that almost no airlines provide passengers with compensation except for refund.

The US Transport Safety Administration predicts that flight demand this summer will exceed the level before the crown disease. In order to protect the rights and interests of passengers, the Bayeng government planned to promote the corresponding regulatory measures.

In the summer of 2022, U.S. airlines could not quickly increase flights, prompting tens of thousands of flight delays and cancellation. In the winter, Southwest Airlines had technical system problems, and hundreds of thousands of passengers were affected.

The American Aviation Association said: "There is no motivation to postpone or cancel the flight, and do its best to ensure that the flight takes off and arrives on time, but security is always the first task."

The US Airlines Association believes that flight delays or cancellations are related to the pressure of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce system pressure and reduce flight. FAA has pointed out that due to the lack of air traffic control personnel, some flights will be reduced.

The aging of the Japanese population has led to a reduction in labor force. According to the latest data released by the Japanese government, the Japanese high -necked employment population has increased by 50%in the past ten years.

Kyodo News reported that the results of the labor force of the Ministry of General Affairs in Japan showed that the employment population over 65 years old reached an average of 9.12 million in 2022, about 1.5 times higher than the 5.96 million in 2012.

The rise in the elderly employment population is related to the "healthy longevity" of the Japanese people. In addition, many elderly people cannot live in pensions and have to go out to work; and the crown disease epidemic that outbreaks in 2020 is also one of the background causes of the increase in the increase of the elderly employment population.

According to the Ministry of Labor and Labor, the Ministry of Labor and Labor said that after comparing the health life of 2010 and 2019, they found that men's age has been extended from 70.42 to 72.68 years old, and women have also extended from 73.62 to 75.38 years. Compared with the past, physical and physical abilities have been improved. Essence

Japan currently has a population of about 36.236665 years old, an increase of 1.2 times compared with 2012.

According to a survey report conducted by the "labor policy research and training institutions" in 2020, up to 76.4%of the respondents were forced to work for "economic reasons"; 33.4%of them "in order to reflect their own survival Value and participation in society "; 22.6%are willing to work because of their free time.

Japan's younger son's aging problem is becoming increasingly serious. With the decrease in working people that support social security and economic activities, in order to solve this problem, the Japanese government requires enterprises to allow those who are willing to work to 70 years old. Some analysts also pointed out that the government may have to have the operation of reform methods such as further tax increases, increasing social insurance rates, and suppressing various social welfare expenditures in the future to maintain the operation of the social security system.

Rafiz added: "If Malaysia does not conform to the world market to adjust overnight interest rates, it will cause other impacts, such as the risk of funds or investment portfolios, which will eventually weaken national currency and lose investment."
