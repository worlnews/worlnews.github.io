<p><strong> On June 8th, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted through a bill called the Ending China's Developing National Act, which paved the way for all the US Senate's voting. </strong></p>
<p>At the end of this year, the House of Representatives in the United States also passed a similar bill. According to the legislative process of the United States, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed them, and then signed by the US President, and the law will officially take effect. There is no news when the US Senate will vote on the bill.</p>
<p>This bill requires the US administrative department to take measures to promote international organizations to terminate China's "developing countries" and change China's status to "developed countries".</p>
<p>Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded that "the United States wants to impose the hat of the" developed country 'to China, not because of appreciation of China's development achievements, but the intention of drunkhs is not wine. China's status is a card for curbing China's development. "</p>

<h3>The benefit -Why don't China want to be a "developed country"?</h3>
<p>In the long run, of course, China wants to be a "developed country", and this concept was proposed as early as the 1980s, the so -called "three steps" strategy, the third step was in the middle of 2049 During the 100th anniversary of the co -construction, the per capita GDP reaches the level of medium -developed countries. The people's lives are wealthy and basically realize modernization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65915282">Why do the United States end China's "developing country" status</a>"Now (abandoning the status of developing countries) is not the time. When it is a developing country, it has both political interests and economic benefits." An international relationship in Hong Kong said to BBC.</p>
<p>For example, in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement, more than 150 terms have clearly specified that developing countries enjoy "Special and DifferentialTreatment", and members of developing countries can be degraded in tariffs, extended negotiations, and non -tariff barriers. Enjoy more preferential treatment.</p>
<p>However, in bilateral trade, many developed countries will decide whether to give another country's developing countries according to the actual situation. For example, in February 2020, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced the cancellation of preferential treatment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) developing countries of 25 economies, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, China, which is higher than China, and China, China, China, China, China, China, China, and China, China, China, China, China, China, and China, China, China, China, and China, China, China, and China, China, and China, China, and China, China, and China, which is higher than China. South Korea, even Albania, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Ukraine and Vietnam, which are lower economic levels.</p>
<p>However, in other international treaties, developing countries can also enjoy the treatment, especially the field of environmental protection. The Manifesto of Human Environment in 1972, the "Montreal Protocol" in 1987, the "Framework of the United Nations Climate Change" in 1992, the "Kyoto Protocol" in 1997, and the Paris Agreement in 2015 to varying degrees to varying degrees It is recognized that developed countries should take care of developing countries, and allow the latter to suspend the implementation of emission reduction measures and more loose emission reduction obligations. It also requires developed countries to provide funds and technologies to developing countries.</p>
<p>The logic behind it is that developed countries have been the main emission country of greenhouse gases in the past few hundred years, so they should now bear more discharge obligations than developing countries.</p>

<p>Politically, China has long defined itself as a "biggest developing country". As early as the Mao Zedong era, the concept of "third world" was proposed. From the international strategy, it was selected from the United States and the Soviet Union to the United States and the Soviet Union. brother".</p>
<p>"Almost no exceptional political interests are developed countries in Europe and the United States. They are deeply embedded in Western political systems, discourse systems, and international governance systems. Developing its own status in developing countries, or in emerging nation -states, China is often said to be carried into the "United Nations, the concepts of the third world, Asia, Africa and La La, etc. are familiar in China. The five -country brick country and the Asia Bank are all efforts to build a multi -polarized world order through "developing countries".</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that at a China -Africa cooperation forum, Chinese leaders called China "the biggest developing country" as usual, and a number of African leaders under the stage laughed and believed that China was too humble. China and Africa Africa were too humble. China and Africa Africa The country is obviously not a type of country. This scene was widely spread on Chinese social media.</p>
<h3>Standard -How can I be a developing country?</h3>
<p>In response to the relevant bills of the United States Congress, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "China, as the world's largest developing country, has sufficient factual basis and a solid foundation for international law. of."</p>
<p>So is there any exact standard, can China be judged whether China is a developing country?</p>

<p>separation</p>
<p>End of podcast</p>
<p>The clearest standard comes from the United Nations Department of Statistics (UNSD). In a regional and national classification standards called M49, the agency clearly distinguishes from developed countries and developing countries -Japan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand And the entire European identification as a developed country; in the process of trade statistics, some islands and regions such as Israel, Cyprus, Bermud, Greenland, St. Pierre, and Miton are developed as developing countries; the rest are developing countries. China is naturally listed.</p>
<p>However, the United Nations website shows that the current version of M49 is formulated in 1999. It also specifically stated that there is no definition of developing countries and developed countries (or regions) in the United Nations system. However, in 1996, the distinction between "developed regions" and "developing regions" was introduced to statistical standard countries or regional code (ie M49). These groups were just for statistics at the time, and it did not represent the judgment of the development stage of any country or region.</p>
<p>The comprehensive and higher division standard comes from the United Nations Development Planning Department (UNDP), which comprehensively considers the health, education, economy and inequality dimension to evaluate a human development index (HDI) for countries with different levels of development worldwide, and it is extremely divided into extremely extremely divided into extremes. The high, high, medium, and low levels are only the first countries in developed countries, and the other three files are developing countries.</p>
<p>According to this standard, China ’s human development index was 0.768 in 2022, ranking 79th in the world, and belongs to the High HDI group, so it belongs to developing countries. However, there are 66 countries with high HDI, and China's ranking is relatively close.</p>
<p>WorldBank divides each economy into four categories: high -income, medium high income, low -income and low -income in accordance with total national income (GNI). Similarly, high -income economies are developed countries, and the remaining three categories are developing countries.</p>
<p>The World Bank will announce a standard in July each year. The current standard for entering the ranks of high -income countries is that the per capita GNI exceeds $ 13,205. According to the data released by China in February, the total national income (GNI) of China last year was $ 12,608, but it had reached 95%of the above standards.</p>
<p>The WTO (WTO) generally accepts the claim that any country claims to be a "developing country". Therefore, some countries and regions that are in line with "developed countries" will also choose to adhere to their "developing countries", so as to enjoy preferential treatment in the WTO.</p>
<p>In this system, few countries will take the initiative to abandon their "developing countries". One of them is South Korea -October 25, 2019, the South Korean government decided to automatically abandon the "development country treatment" in the WTO status. But at that time, the South Korean human development index ranked as high as 22, higher than France, Spain, and Italy. The total national revenue of South Korea announced by the World Bank at that time also reached 43,000 US dollars, which is the same as Japan, which is nearly three times that of China.</p>

<h3>Controversy -China and the United States each hold the word</h3>
<p>The above -mentioned scholars said that in almost all international standards, China is still counted as a "developing country", but there are two facts that cannot be ignored:</p>
<p>I. Developing countries cover a wide range. Compared with Yemen, Rwanda and other countries, China is obviously closer to the level of developed countries. Even if the renminbi appreciates this year, China will enter the threshold of developed countries in the WTO.</p>
<p>Second, this is still discussing in the per capita category. If this multiplied by 1.4 billion, China's huge volume and international political and economic influence, only the United States and the entire European Union can match, so it is very different from the impression of "developing countries". big.</p>
<p>The per capita VS is the core argument of China and the United States on this issue.</p>
<p>In China, from the media to diplomats, the arguments on this issue are focused on -although China's economic development is fast, the domestic development is unbalanced, and the per capita has not reached the level of developed countries. The economy should consider society and medical care.</p>
<p>In the United States, regardless of the Senate or House of Representatives, they focus on China's huge volume -China has become the world's largest exporter and the second largest economy, and it is no longer in line with the standards of developing countries. Essence</p>
<p>"From the economic and military scale to the large -scale investment in countries around the world, it is clear that China is no longer a 'developing country'," "Chris Vanhollen, a member of Maryland, said in a written statement. "For a long time, China has been using this status to obtain unfair advantages in the multilateral agreement."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-16T01-47-07.000Z/_117675361_066283134.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Mittromney, Republican of Utah, also issued a statement saying, "China has the world's second largest economy and is expected to surpass the United States economy ... China continues to be seen on the global stage. It is ridiculous for developing countries. "</p>
<p>Earlier in the House of Representatives voting a similar bill, Member Youngkim also said that China is the second largest economy in the world, accounting for 18.6%of the global economy. Their economy is second only to the United States. The United States is regarded as developed countries. China should be the same.</p>
<p>The speeches of these members also revealed the purpose of the United States to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In this regard, Zhang Zhixin, an associate researcher at the American Institute of the Chinese Institute of Modern International Relations, said that the United States is actually doing so to ensure its advantageous position in economics, trade, technology, finance and other fields, and re -build an international internationally conducive to safeguarding the US hegemony. New political and economic order.</p>
<p>"When the competition between China and the United States is increasingly intensified, the US Congress moves on the one hand to ensure that it can get more favorable chips in economic and trade negotiations, and on the other hand, it is fundamentally hoping to decompose chain with China 'to China, so as to thus Containment or delay China's rise. "Zhang Zhixin said.</p>
<p>Can the United States succeed? The answer given by the above scholars is that "it can be successful within a certain range, but the impact will not be too great."</p>
<p>She said that the World Bank, World Trade Organization, IMF and other international organizations. As the main contractor, the United States, the United States has a great influence. If there is a two -party full vote bill support, it will effectively affect these organizations. However, in the context of the confrontation between China and the United States, these international organizations are facing the dilemma of failure, and in real trade, the US tariffs on China continue to trade during the trade war, far higher than the tariffs set by developed countries under the WTO framework. Therefore, it will not change the current situation of both parties.</p>
<p>"It should be noted that China's negotiation capabilities are also strengthening, and the United States will not want to be under pressure, forcing China to withdraw from international organizations and start another stove. Different points of focusing, the United States hopes to reduce China's economic interests among international organizations; what China is more valued is international politics, that is, unite the third world country, to form another polarity different from the West. China China. China. China. You can adhere to the positioning of developing countries on the diplomatic field, and at the same time make some compromises in international organizations. "</p>

<p>Everyone who heard the financial background of the financial background establishes a collection or opening of an art foundation, it is difficult to make people not link it to speculative, tax avoidance, etc., and the collection list -like collection lists also make many pure collectors snoring. Before having the opportunity to learn more about the French financial leader and the founder of the Kalmne Foundation Edouardcarmignac, many people kept his preconceived judgment, but the facts were not exactly the case.</p>
<p>As the founder of the famous French Investment Fund Carmignac Gestion, EdouardCarmignac is similar to many financial giants and a large number of blue -chip -level art works collected by the foundation. The romantic feelings of serving Maxernst's works and laughing for Bo Bei made me feel that the collection story of the colleagues who were named Artnews "TOP 200 Collectors" may be a bit different.</p>

Because the Chinese ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming and the largest opposition party leader in South Korea explained the relevant diplomatic positions of China, leading the current Korean government from President Yin Xiyue, Foreign Minister and Senior Foreign Minister, to South Korean Guoan officials and the ruling party, Congress, Congress, Congress, Congress Members, almost strictly criticized China. In view of the huge dependence on the Chinese market and raw materials in South Korea, and the huge security issues caused by the Nuclear Nuclear to South Korea, all the reasons have caused a problem, that is, where is the way out of South Korean diplomacy?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the author, in terms of factors such as South Korea's geopolitical environment and its comprehensive strength, leaving the word balance, South Korean diplomacy will never go out.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-16T07-22-23-00-00/000184012_piclink.jpg" />Recently, the movie "Little Mermaid" starring American singer and actor Halle Bailey has gained a good box office after its release. According to the data of Box Officemojo, the film's total global box office is currently US $ 425 million, ranking fifth in the movie that has been released in 2023, and is expected to maintain the top ten in the year. The production cost of this film is revealed that it is $ 250 million. The usual experience is that the box office of such scale movies must reach twice the production cost to achieve balance of revenue and expenditure. If the film finally reaches about 500 million US dollars in the global box office, it can be roughly estimated to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. The so -called box office failure or even collapse is too.</p>
<p>The film is bleak in China's box office (South Korea and Japan are not ideal), and it is far lower than that of the same type of Disney movies in China, which has also aroused controversy on racial discrimination on the Internet. Some netizens said that they were not the skin tone of discrimination, but they were not satisfied with their appearance, or they believed that their appearance did not meet the Chinese aesthetic standards. However, no matter how the two sides argue, the many irony and negative evaluations of the netizens are indeed aimed at the skin color and ethnic identity of the starring actors, such as "black fish", "marine pollution", "Qing Daofu" and so on. Although it is the freedom of watching movies, it is not wrong to have warning racial discrimination on racial discrimination. It is worth noting that Disney officials have not accused racial discrimination because the film is not good in China, mainly because the international media mentioned this and believed that there were racial discrimination factor behind it. This is not a accusation for Chinese audiences, but an objective report. The content of the report is the objective racial discrimination language and trend on the Chinese network. From the principle of news reports, this approach is not wrong.</p>

"In the worse, in more than one -third of the poorest countries, the per capita income of 2024 will be lower than the level of 2019. This will have a profound impact: people who are poor but not guaranteed will find it difficult to improve the human capital of themselves or children.

Intersection</p>
<p><a href="http://www.szsuccess.com.cn/yxwl/index_13.aspx">Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd.</a>Established in 2004 and listed in 2009.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">In 2019, Yushun Plant received a written notice from the Changzhen Community</a>, Make a relocation within 3 years. Three years later, in February last year, the company received a written notice from the Changzhen community, requiring the lease relationship before May 31 last year, and August 10th. The lease of Yushun Factory's plant did not expire until July 2024.</p>
<p>So, for the first time in 2019, the company has received the community relocation notice for almost 4 years. Has the Yushun Factory Trade Union conducted negotiations on the compensation plan on behalf of the employee?</p>
<p>In addition, the factories were relocated to the Changzhen community, and the Changzhen Community Trade Union Service Center worked with the Community Party and Mass Service Center. So, is the Changzhen Community Trade Union on the relocation plan that may affect the rights and interests of the workers, and negotiate with the community service center to ensure that the interests of employees can be guaranteed during the relocation process?</p>
<p>In particular, the Changzhen community requires the Yushun plant to relocate before the lease expires, which will inevitably affect the factory's operation, thereby affecting the company's ability to make reasonable compensation for workers. Does the Changzhen Community Trade Union participate in the negotiation of the company's participation in the enterprise and the Changzhen community on behalf of Yushun Factory. It is suggested that the Changzhen Community suspend the lease early to make additional compensation to the enterprise to ensure that the company has the ability to make reasonable compensation for workers?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the workers have gathered in the Changzhen Community Party and Mass Service Center (office with the Changzhen Community Trade Union) for help, do the community unions come forward to represent the workers and negotiate with the community and the factory?</p>
<p>Half a year ago, on December 13, 2022, Yushun Co., Ltd. issued the relocation <a href="https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H2_AN202212121581022248_1.pdf?1670882016000.pdf">Announcement</a>It is mentioned that employees will follow the factory area to relocate and fail to follow the factory area relocation personnel. The company will legally terminate labor relations in accordance with the relevant provisions of the labor law.</p>
<p>So, in the next half of the year, the Changzhen Community Trade Unions, Yutang Street Trade Unions, Guangming District Trade Unions, and the Shenzhen Federation of Trade Unions, each to avoid the intensification of the situation?</p>
<p>According to the data, the Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions announced a legal service that cost 170,000 yuan last year <a href="http://www.szgm.gov.cn/xxgk/xqgwhxxgkml/gzgg/content/post_10136621.html">work plan</a>Essence This plan was announced in September, and in October, the goal was that by the end of 2022, the coverage rate of legal consultants in the first and secondary community trade unions in the street reached 100%. Level -level labor communication and negotiation mechanism.</p>
<p>So, did Yutang Street Federation of Trade Unions assist Yushun Electronics Co., Ltd. to negotiate the relocation compensation plan in accordance with the work plan that he formulated and announced?</p>
<p>There is another thing. In June last year, <a href="https://guba.eastmoney.com/o/news,qa,1202796272.html">more than 50 workers in Yushun plant have complained</a>At the Shenzhen Housing Provident Fund Management Center, the factory said that the factory had not paid the housing provident fund for front -line production workers.

<p>Description: In order to compete for the expansion of China and Russia, NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg hopes to strengthen the partnership between NATO and the Indo -Pacific countries as soon as possible. But in addition to the dissatisfaction between Moscow and Beijing, this plan has at least one European allies also whispered the plan.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65941895/65907484"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-16T13-37-00Z/65907484_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) "Air Guard 23" Air Force Exercise is currently being held in NATO. This is the largest air force joint exercise in NATO history so far. In addition to NATO member states, Sweden and Japan's two non -member states were also invited to participate in military exercises. Among them, the participation of Japan looks particularly extraordinary.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/日媒北約擬藉東京辦事處-升級印太合作/a-65907575">Japan's cooperation with NATO has been quite hot</a>Essence NATO Secretary -General Jensstoltenberg called on NATO and Japan to strengthen close cooperative relations when he visited Tokyo this year. After Russia launched the Whaled War, the Japanese government announced extensive sanctions on Russia and provided humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, which suffered war.</p>
<p>The reason why Tokyo does this is not a consideration without its own interests. As Stoltenberg warned: "What happened in Europe today may be repeated in East Asia tomorrow." Japanese officials also explained to the people of the country with the same word to strengthen cooperation with NATO in Tokyo.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-16T13-37-00Z/65891798_401.jpg" />The largest air force exercise in NATO: Air Force 23</p>
<p>NATO's establishment of Tokyo Liaison Office plans to encounter obstacles</p>
<p>However, NATO and Japan's substantial steps have encountered problems: NATO plans to cooperate in the first contact place in Asia in Tokyo to coordinate the cooperation with Indian partners such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>However, before the plan was officially announced, it was unexpectedly criticized by Beijing, but unexpectedly, French President Macron also objected to the plan.</p>
<p>According to the "Financial Times", Macron said in a public speech in Slovakia that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英媒馬克宏反對北約在日本設辦事處/a-65834394">NATO must stay in the category of the North Atlantic, "If we try to expand the geographical category of NATO, it will be a great mistake."</a>Patrick Cronin, head of the Asia -Pacific Affairs Institute of Washington Think Tank Hudson Institute, told Germany that French President Macron's rejection of Japan "shocked the Japanese."</p>
<p>Cronin said that Macron will set up a small problem such as the Tokyo contact office, which is deemed to be a major foreign policy change. This approach is "very ridiculous". He added that Macron did this likely to protect the business interests of France and Beijing, and at the same time to create a European protector image that avoids Europe's involving Sino -US conflict.</p>
<p>Cronin said, in this way, Macron can sell himself from China: "You see, I am trying to keep Europe and the United States independent and avoid European affairs in Europe."</p>
<h3>as an intermediary of China -Europe relations</h3>
<p>Janneleino, an expert in diplomatic and security affairs, has lived in China for many years. He partially agreed with Croonin's point of view, but he also said that Macron's behavior has another explanation. Renault said: "At that time, the affairs involved in European -China relations, China would find former German Prime Minister Merkel to coordinate. I think Macron wants to pick up Merkel's class and act as a middleman role."</p>
<p>Renault said: "France actually hopes that Europe can get involved in Indo -Pacific affairs, but does not want to appear there as a NATO partner. If the European Union participates in the Indo -Pacific Affairs, then France as the EU country, of course It's important. "</p>
<h3>China Warning: NATO should stay away from Asia</h3>
<p>No matter what Macron's motivation is, he is welcomed by Beijing's position to open the Tokyo contact office. On June 6, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, responded to Macron's related statement: "Asia is not the geographical category of North Atlantic, nor does it need to establish the so -called" Asia -Pacific version of NATO ' What does it mean for transactions and provocative camp confrontation? "</p>
<p>Wang Wenbin said that the attitudes of most regions on the relevant issues are very clear: "Oppose to put together various military groups in the region. Re -acting in Asia. "</p>
<p>In the end, Wang Wenbin also issued a direct warning to Japan: "Japan should also make a correct judgment that meets regional stability and development benefits. Do not do things that destroy the mutual trust between countries and damage the regional peace and stability."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-16T13-37-00Z/64567580_401.jpg" />On January 31st, NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg held a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Kishita.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, at a press conference held before the NATO Minister of Defense, a reporter from a Chinese media group asked whether NATO had an intention to enter Asia in the east, and Stoltenberg refuted this speculation. He said: "No one has such a plan."</p>
<p>But Stoltenberg also expressed the need to strengthen cooperation with the Pacific region: "China has enhanced military reserve and threatened to neighboring countries."</p>
<p>For this purpose, the upcoming NATO summit will also issue invitations to Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Last summer, the leader of the above country attended the NATO summit for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition, NATO is still being discussed alone with the above -mentioned four countries, hoping to upgrade the current "global partner" of the four countries to the "tailor -made partnership" (ITTP), so that NATO and these countries will carry out network security in network security in network security in network security , New Technology, Climate Protection, and bilateral cooperation in the national defense industry.</p>
<h3>动 Passive is active</h3>
<p>Regarding China's position in the establishment of a liaison office in Tokyo, Renault made different suggestions. He said: "Since Macron believes that we should not set up a liaison office in Tokyo, because this will annoy China. So why do we talk about direct talks on this issue on this issue?"</p>
<p>Renault believes that whether it is NATO or Beijing, they have publicly expressed their willingness to conduct dialogue. "Both parties continue to reiterate the willingness to carry out dialogue in public, so why don't we try?"</p>
<p>Renault said that if Beijing rejected NATO's conversation suggestions, then China is not so straightforward to oppose India -Pacific countries with NATO.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) This weekend, US Secretary of State Brills will go to Beijing to start his since taking office <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯预计18日访华-着眼管控风险/a-65878688">First China Journey</a>Essence The commentator of the "South German will" believes that the US Secretary of State Brills has a simple goal when visiting Huai Huai: <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/usa-china-tony-blinken-supermaechte-diplomatie-spionageballon-1.5937299">He is just "Er Will Ja Nur Reden"</a>However, this move will break the current deadlock of Sino -US relations, start a series of bilateral ministerial meetings, and lay the foundation for the direct meeting of leaders of the two countries in November this year.</p>
<p>The author pointed out that the White House hopes to re -lead Sino -US relations to the diplomatic track and think of it as the focus of its foreign policy:</p>
<p>"In the complex process of approaching each other, at least the United States has a relatively simple view that if you don't want to make your mind a simple eagle, and cause war, even if it is completely accidental, then Beijing and Washington must use a foreign language tone as soon as possible as soon as possible Talking. Political management of bilateral relations and returning to the Internet of Diplomacy are the central content of the White House policy. In this regard, Beijing knows that if the world is divided into two major camps that are not compatible with water and fire, it will have to suffer huge economic losses. "</p>
<p>"The idea of being out of the United States and the influence between two camps has been proven to be disconnected from reality. On the contrary, Western investors hurriedly left China in a batch of political ice. Ryan's concept of "lowering risk 'instead of" decoustile' is not only guiding the European strategy, but also to point the direction for the US strategy.</p>
<p>Looking at this way, the mission of visiting China is actually so simple: the United States hopes to enter the dialogue level with China. Careful dialogue on military reserve control can be tentative as the first step. In order to achieve this goal, even if the Bayeng government ushered in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美外长通话-秦刚暗指双边关系困难责任在美方/a-65910231">the opponent's oral stew to drink</a>Will not resign.

<h3>upgrade</h3>
<p>After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards.

<p>"#Extreme" is becoming a new slogan in China. The General Secretary of the Communist Party of China#Xi Jinping recently proposed "#Extreme Thinking", "#Extreme Conditions" and "#中 中 中#", which caused speculation. According to media analysis, these words suggest that the tension may be upgraded, and it means that Xi Jinping is stepping up to plan a conflict for China. Current political critic #时 时 时, director of the New Economic Policy Research Center of Taiwan Donghua University, #时 时 时 said that Xi Jinping pushed the international environment to lead to "extreme conditions", which may include war, economy, food, and social turmoil. It is really a rolling of the wrong decision. China's economy is serious, and the unemployment rate of youth has reached 20.8%. Young people#lying flat on the scene beyond imagination. The Chinese economy is not a "small cold". It has entered the intensive care unit and has been accumulated for decades. Foreign capital withdrawal is difficult to turn back, and social problems may erupt in three to five years.</p>

People who knew the situation of the couple had now confirmed that they died in prison during his sentence. In addition, according to the US prohibition of imports related to slavery, the French Senate recently approved a bill of seeking the EU version. The US Congress proposed a two -party bill, giving priority to the Uyghur refugee status. A supporter said that "the United States cannot refuse those who escape from this persecution." In this episode, we will learn about the relevant situation together. The conversation of relevant people was recorded by Anke.</p>
<p>According to sources, Hagi Ahong and his wife bought Hepipiham as a resident in Bachu County, Kashgar. The authorities arrested them on the grounds of "illegal" religious activities in 2017. They were sentenced to 10 years in 2019 in Tumutuk Prison.</p>
<p>The prison is imprisoned for other people who have been arrested at the famous Uighurs and ordinary Uighurs in 2017. The authorities have detained them in the "re -education" camp and prison. Discover in religious activities abroad.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has been severely criticized by the international community for seriously infringement of Muslims' rights (including forced labor).</p>
<p>Several Western Parliament, including the German Federal House, has announced that these infringements have constituted racial extinction or harm to human beings.</p>
<p>According to an exile from Tumutuk in Radio Asia's earlier report, the Tumutuk prison authorities released several detained Uyghur bodies. A week secretly died in prison.</p>
<p>Based on this information, Radio Free Asia confirmed that the body of the Uyghur motorcycle repairman bought the Memettursun Metniyaz belongs to one of the remains returned to his relatives. The resident of Bachu County went to the Micathards in Saudi Arabia many years ago. In early 2017, he was imprisoned for completing the Micia's pilgrimage journey.</p>
<p>The Bachu County Police, which was contacted by Radio Free Asia, also confirmed that one week before the Eid holiday, the body of the death prisoner had returned to their family, but they said they did not know the exact number or cause of death.</p>
<p>A staff member of the Bachu County Police Department demanded anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. He told Radio Liberty Radio in Tumukuk's prisoner who had died in prison. One of the family.</p>
<p>The staff member also said that there have been rumors that the prisoners who died before the holiday had eaten contaminated food in prison, but Radio Free Asia could not determine the authenticity of the news.</p>
<p>Another employee of the Bachu County Police Department confirmed that Harji Ahong, who was in his 70s, and his 60 -year -old wife have been serving in prison since 2019. she says,</p>
<p>"They are old couples. Both died."</p>
<p>In addition, a recently submitted to the US Senate will force enterprises to disclose the connection between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the forced Uighurs to work, and provide funds for those who escape from Xinjiang to counterattack the Chinese government's propaganda.</p>
<p>Earlier, the French Senate passed a bill, which urged the European Union to follow the ban on the United States prohibiting the import of goods related to Uighur labor. French legislators said that the ban has entered the European single market for many such commodities.</p>
<p>According to a press release, in addition to the request to submit documents to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the new bill of the US Senate will also expand existing travel restrictions on Chinese officials related to ethnic extinction, and will "counterattack the broadcast plan for China to propagate". Provide further funds.</p>
<p>The Uyghur racial extinction accountability and sanctions bill proposed by the Florida Republican Senator Mark Rubio and the Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merckley will also provide funds for the ongoing Uyghur culture and language protection projects.</p>
<p>Rubio said in the press release: "On the basis of the current legislation, the two -hospital bill aims to strengthen the second -level sanctions that provide assistance to Uighurs for the Communist Party of China to the Communist Party of China."</p>
<p>Rubio and Merckley said that if the draft of the bill is passed, it will help fill the loopholes in the 2021 "Uighurs Forced Labor Prevention Law" and further punish those who profit from Uyghur slave labor.</p>
<p>However, to be a law, it must first be approved by the Senate's committee, then vote in the Senate, and then obtained the House of Representatives.(ChrisSmith)support.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, French Senator approved a resolution on May 31, calling on the European version of the "Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Law" to prohibit imports related to slavery.</p>
<p>Mélanie Vogel, the European Ecological -Green Party, representatives living abroad, told Liberty Radio that her party proposed to put legislation to pressure EU officials.</p>
<p>In the single market in Europe, 27 EU member states have no right to unilaterally change trade policies, and the EU unified import and export laws. Vogel said,</p>
<p>"This resolution is basically required to introduce a very effective mechanism in the EU. It is forbidden to use the level of forced labor manufacturing. Basically, it requires the French government to promote this position in the European Union.</p>
<p>Vogle said that the EU's existing proposal on this issue only proves that the goods are related to slavery in a wide range of legal procedures, and then seek to prohibit imported goods. However, she said that the French Senate tended to implement the ban on the "mechanism introduced by the United States". The ban assumes that the commodities made in Xinjiang involve slave labor. Vogel said,</p>
<p>"Therefore, the responsibility for proof is on the company who wants to export goods to the EU market, rather than human rights activists to prove that there is indeed a violation of human rights. They must prove that they have not used forced labor.""Products made by Uyghur forced labor that cannot enter the United States are entering the European market. This is why it is extremely important to pass such legislation in Europe. Pressure is very important. In order to have a real impact, all 27 EU members need to pass a unified legislation. "</p>
<p>It is also reported that the US Congress has recently proposed a two -party bill in Congress, which will give priority to the Uighurs who have escaped the persecution of China.</p>
<p>The bill will designate Uighurs and other ethnic groups persecuted by the Chinese government as a second priority or P-2, and speed up their ability to apply for shelter in the United States.</p>
<p>One of the sponsor of the Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act, from the Virginia Democratic Representative, Jenniferwkson, said, "The Uyghur and other ethnic minorities faced in the hands of the Chinese government. The persecution ignores it. "</p>
<p>In addition to Wickston, the Florida Republicans Maria Elvila Saracha, New York Democratic Democratic Personal Reagoli Micks, Virginia Democratic Democratic Democratic Democrat Representatives proposed the bill on June 7.</p>
<p>The title of P-2 is a Uyghur who has been oppressed by China for expressing political views and religious beliefs or participating in political, religious and cultural activities. Those who are designated will receive special humanitarian help and will be re -resettled and the US asylum procedures.</p>
<p>The bill also sought to protect Uyghur refugees from countries outside the United States, and preferentially considers the diplomatic efforts of the United States in countries that usually face huge pressure from the Chinese government to extradite Uighurs back to China.</p>
<p>On the occasion of this move, the Uyghur Human Rights Organization called on the international community to take specific actions to oppose the right to seriously violate the Muslim group of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>China's suppression of Xinjiang Uyghur and other Turkic minorities can be investigated. The Uighurs are detained, torture, sexual assault, forced labor, and the separation of Uyghur children from the parents from the prison in the "re -education" camp. It is reported by hand report.</p>
<p>In the statement, Micks said: "The United States cannot simply condemn Beijing's ethnic extinction and pat their backs." "We are responsible for morality and international responsibilities to provide those who try to escape from the Chinese government's atrocities in Xinjiang assistance.</p>
<p>"It is the right way to provide expanded refugee protection to Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, and it is also a clear way to prove that the United States is consistent with human rights and deeds on human rights issues."</p>
<p>Ruxian Abbas, director of the Uyghur Movement Executive of Human Rights Organization, said that the introduction of the bill is a key step in solving the dilemma of the Uyghur.</p>
<p>"As early as 2020, when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged that China was extinct for the Uighurs and committed harm to human beings, it should have happened. At least, the most important thing is to formulate a bill to help speed up to speed up it. Uyghur asylum cases that have lived in the United States for many years and have been waiting for case resolution for a long time. "</p>
<p>The President of the World Uyghur Congress Dorin Aisha said that the passage of the bill will be the "important milestone" of the Canadian government after accepting 10,000 Uighur refugees, and provides encouragement for Uighurs who escape from China to other countries.</p>
<p>In February of this year, the Canadian Parliament unanimously adopted a motion for the reorganization of Uighur refugees in Canada to respond to the Chinese government forcibly repatriated the Muslim group members to repatriate China because they may be persecuted in China.</p>
<p>The Canadian government re -resettlement with Uyghur from other countries, not directly from China, and the plan is expected to begin in 2024.</p>

The "Daily Mail" of the right tilt today immediately announced that Johnson &amp; Johnson will write a column for newspapers every Saturday.</p>

"We have written to ask Johnson &amp; Johnson to explain and will publish the content of the letter in a timely manner according to our transparent policy." However, the business appointment consultation committee cannot force politicians to refuse an external work invitation, and Johnson &amp; Johnson often ignores the rules. It has been displayed in the report of the Privilege Committee of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 16th) A 37 -year study pointed out today that people who are accustomed to staying up late will not be short -lived than those who are accustomed to getting up early and getting up early -as long as they do not drink and smoke in the long night.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-17T-20-32-07-00-00/000000.png" />In the past, research showed that people who stay up late and it is difficult to get up early is more likely to suffer from a series of health problems.</p>
<p>In 2018, a large -scale study in the UK found that in 6 and a half years, night people have a 10%risk of death than morning people.</p>
<p>Although this may be a worrying news for the night owls in the world, this research does not take into account the factors that may cause these deaths, such as alcohol intake.</p>
<p>Therefore, Finland researchers published a research on the journal "International Time Biology" reviewed by colleagues, which further discussed this issue.</p>
<p>This study tracks the 24,000 homosexual twins in Finland, and in 1981, they asked them to answer themselves as morning people or night people.</p>
<p>One -third of them said that they were night -type people, 10%said they were definitely night -type people, and the rest were morning people.</p>
<p>Night -type people are often younger, and they also have more tendency to drink and smoke.</p>
<p>When the researchers conducted a follow -up study in 2018, more than 8700 of these twins had died.</p>
<p>During these 37 years, researchers found that the risk of death was 9%higher than that of various factors due to various factors. This number was similar to the results of the 2018 research.</p>
<p>However, the research published today states that the difference is "mainly derived from smoking and alcohol." For example, night owls with less drinking and smoking will not die earlier than morning people.</p>
<p>The first author of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, studying the first author of the Finnish Vocational Health Research Institute, told Agence France -Presse that the research results showed that night owls could take action to reduce their risk of premature death.</p>
<p>Heblin said: "Obviously, night -type people should think more carefully about their intake of alcohol and tobacco."</p>
<p>Heblin mentioned that without considering other factors, people's sleep time preferences, also known as "current types", have "rarely or almost no" their mortality.</p>
<p>Jeevan Fernando, a current scientist from Cambridge and has not participated in research, told AFP that although the research results were reasonable, there were also limitations.</p>
<p>Feinan Du said that the experimental participants were identified as morning or night -type people. This approach "not satisfactory because it does not include any objective information", which is different from modern research methods.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-17T-8-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />The temperature of Mexico's capital, Mexico City, came to 35 degrees Celsius this week, a record high.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health of Mexico stated in a statement that from April 14th to June 12th, 7 people died of heat stroke, and 1 person died of dehydration.</p>
<p>In Monterrey in the northeast city, the temperature exceeded 40 degrees Celsius. At the same time, the water supply demand, including air conditioners, increased power outages.</p>
<p>Wendy Tijerna, the resident of Monterey, said that as the city is located in the industrial zone, the weather is hotter.</p>
<p>Dihrina told AFP: "Now that you are short of water, you can't help your child take a bath or even use a fan because they cut off the power."</p>
<p>She said that she and her family tried to drink more water to avoid heat stroke.</p>
<p>The Nuevo Leon government where Montere is located has restricted the time of children to school daily to 2 hours to avoid sunlight.</p>
<p>Last year, some parts of Mexico announced their entry into an emergency in drought because the heat waves and rain lacking caused the reservoir to dry up.</p>
<p>In some cities including Montere, the director only allows the family to use tap water for several hours a day.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brillings will visit China from 18th to 19th of this month. He will be the first highest US official to visit China in five years.</p>
<p><strong> In January of this year, the US media revealed that Anthonyblinken, Secretary of State, will visit China in early February. It is his first trip to visit China for his position, but was immediately claimed to be "Chinese spy in the United States in February in February "The accident of flying into the United States was interrupted. At that time, Joebiden ordered the balloon to hit the balloon, and the relationship between the United States and China fell to the freezing point. </strong></p>
<p>After a few months, Brinken was ready to try again, and will fly to Beijing on June 18 to start a two -day visit. Many analysts believe that the White House hopes to re -stable relations with Beijing through this trip. However, the mutual trust foundation between the two sides is weak and the differences in many issues are great.</p>
<p>Can the wish of the White House realize this time? Will Brinken meet Xi Jinping? Beijing Zhongnanhai finally agreed to let Brinken come to Beijing at this moment. What do you want to get?</p>
<p>Song Wendi, a lecturer at the Asia -Pacific College of the National University of Australia, told BBC in Chinese that Brinken's trip was to reassure Beijing, "more importantly, to rest assured that other American allies." He believes that the United States has not held high expectations for this trip because during the days of Beijing, it has adopted a tough confrontation attitude towards the United States and has no intention of softening the diplomatic relations between the two parties.</p>
<p>For example, he said that not long ago, Beijing did not agree to let the National Defense Minister held talks at the Shangri -La dialogue held in Singapore. Therefore, he believes that for Washington, "if it is necessary to revise the US -China relations, China will inevitably need a large compromise in the United States. The political cost of this move is too high, and the White House has no wishes and will not happen."</p>
<p>Professor Elizabeth Freundlarus, Professor of Pacific FORUM, also holds similar views. She told the BBC Chinese that there are too many things in the United States and China in many things such as the Taiwan issue, the US -China trade and the Ukrainian war. This time, it is difficult for the two parties to talk about any big agreement, or the relationship is very large. Breakthrough.</p>
<p>However, she emphasized that based on the tension of the Taiwan Strait, in order to avoid military misjudgment in military affairs, the two countries resumed regular face -to -face meetings to maintain smooth dialogue channels.</p>

<p>As Brinken took office, US -China relations have fallen to the freezing point. After he took office, the United States continued his former President Donaldtrump (Trump) to compete with China. The difference is that Biden's allies alliances alliances are trying to regulate the global expansion of China in all aspects. Therefore, after taking office, the first visit to China has attracted worldwide attention.</p>
<p>After the first visit to China after the State of the State, Brinken can be said to be a wave of twists and turns. It was finalized in the second half of Bayeng's term of office. Some analysts also said that this also reflects how uncomfortable US -China relations are.</p>

<p>Is there a Chinese spy station in Cuba's secret base?</p>
<p>In fact, since the outbreak of the "Spy Balloon Incident" in February, Broske's trip to China has been canceled unexpectedly. The two countries have continued to be tattooed in many diplomatic incidents, including in Singapore. meeting. At the end of May, the U.S. Indian Command issued a statement that criticized the Chinese PLA-16 fighter aircraft intentionally approaching the US military reconnaissance aircraft to create danger, and Beijing responded strongly to criticize.</p>

<p>In fact, after the United States and China successively confirmed that Brinkens' visits to China have been confirmed, Daniel Josephkritenbrink, the assistant to the Beijing visit, once said at a press conference that Brinken's trip is not a way to get along in the United States and China. Seeking a breakthrough or change, "but with a realistic, self -confidence attitude and sincere hope to manage the competition between the United States and China in the most responsible way."</p>
<p>Kangda, who is responsible for the Asia -Pacific Affairs in the US State Department, also said that the United States will not expect that this visit can surrender many diplomatic results, but at least it can reduce the risk of misjudgment and avoid the conflict between the United States and China.

<p>He said that the United States first hopes to establish "communication channels for opening up and gain full authorization to discuss important challenges, solve misunderstandings, and prevent misjudgment."

<p>The Taiwan issue has continued to become a contradiction in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>Song Wendili said that when it is expected to visit China, Brincken is expected to guarantee that the United States will unintentionally challenge China to think of its core interests, such as sovereignty, security and development benefits.</p>
<p>However, Song Wendi emphasized that more importantly, "this helps enhance the cohesion between American allies, partners and friends. Brincken's trip is to tell allies that the cost of forming an alliance with the United States is appropriate. It is not conflict, but competition, but a selective risk, not a de-countling. "</p>
<h3>What do you want to get?</h3>
<p>Although Beijing's strategy of tough response or offensive for US diplomacy has not changed, Beijing's meeting with Brosky this time is not only to show the attitude of diplomatic diplomacy. External analysis said that business issues or the most willing areas of Beijing to negotiate in the trip to Blink.</p>
<p>This table is now. On Tuesday (June 13) US Treasury Minister Janet Yellen Ye Lun, after attending the U.S. Congress hearing, it will be a "huge mistake" with China. Obtained Beijing confirmation.</p>
<p>At that time, Yellen said that the American people benefited from the US -China trade, and the Chinese people also benefited, and the trade with China had a positive impact on the US economy.</p>
<p>In addition, the day before Yellen's conversation, the Wall Street Journal published an article reported that the US Department of Commerce plans to allow top semiconductor manufacturers such as Samsung and TSMC in Taiwan to maintain and expand these companies in the case of not being retaliated with the United States. China's existing chip foundry business.</p>
<p>Last October, the US Department of Commerce restricted the Chinese semiconductor industry, but also provided a one -year exemption period for several Taiwanese and Korean companies. This time it was reported that Biden may agree to extend the exemption period, and the analysis stated that it can slow down US export control over Chinese technology.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Department of Commerce refused to comment on this, the analysis believed that the United States was softer on the issue of Chinese trade, opened the door to Beijing's visit to Beijing, and was also an important focus of the two parties.</p>
<p>Ivankanapathy, the former director of the National Security Association of the United States, China, and Mongolia, told the US media that "Beijing 'to tolerate' Brinkee visits to promote the meeting with the Minister of Finance because Beijing believes that Yellen is more in line with their interests. "" ".</p>

<p>Biden announced the first national security strategy in his tenure in October last year. Named that China and Russia are the primary challenges, saying that China is "the largest competitor in the United States."</p>
<p>Lan Ruisi also told the BBC Chinese that Beijing hopes that the United States has some concessions in trade and Taiwan issues. This is a field that Beijing is willing to negotiate with the United States in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>However, Shi Yinhong, a professor at the School of International Relations of Renmin University of China, told AFP that neither the United States and China have not showed any major and long -lasting concessions. Its strategic or technical security.Shen Xuhui approved the comments. Therefore, Bollingin's visit to Beijing is a "punch card" line. It is the United States and China. "The dramas required for each needed to take are basically nothing to do. Everything can be changed. It can be seen that the current U.S. government has no long -term strategy to China at all.</p>

The field is qualified to compete for personal awards such as the most valuable player (MVP).</p>
<p>NBA President Adam Silver said in a statement that Monte's suspension will convey a message that the alliance will strongly crack down on the "reckless behavior" to use guns.</p>
<p>Xi Fo said: "Morant's decision to wave his gun again on social media is shocking and uneasy, because he has been banned 8 games for similar behaviors in March."</p>
<p>"The possibility of other young people imitating his behavior is particularly worrying.

<p>(Voice of Germany) The Chinese economy rebounded in early 2023, but after the good performance of the first quarter, the output and consumption expenditure of factory was weakening. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/出人意料中国经济指数四月出现滑坡/a-65475440">April</a>A official investigation found that [young labor unemployment rate creates green] in the city(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338)Every five people are unemployed.</p>
<p>China ended at the end of last year <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/一刀切和层层加码下的中国防疫/a-63678043">After a strict epidemic prevention policy</a>The sales of garbage trucks in Hubei Yi special car manufacturing Co., Ltd. have rebounded. Although management is trying to regain the business that is lost during the epidemic, the business growth rate is still relatively slow.</p>
<p>According to Yu Xiongli, the deputy general manager of a special car, its sales have only increased by single digits compared to last year. The company with 300 employees is located in Hubei Province. The first new crown virus case at the end of 2019 was discovered in the province. Yu Xiongli said: "It is still in the process of recovery. The growth is quite slow."</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2023, China's economy increased by 4.5%year -on -year, higher than the 2.9%of the previous quarter, but analysts predict that the peak of recovery may have passed. In order to achieve the "about 5%" GDP target set by the Communist Party of China in 2023, economic growth needs to be further accelerated.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/59951879_401.jpg" />After the epidemic, the Chinese people did not restore consumer enthusiasm (information picture)</p>
<h3>UBS: The situation is "not so optimistic"</h3>
<p>Zhang Ning, a UBS Chinese economist, said: "At present, the continuous momentum seems not so optimistic." He believes that the economy needs the "domestic demand rebound" by the government to boost corporate and consumer confidence.</p>
<p>With the end of the new crown epidemic prevention policy, urban measures and most international travel restrictions, people have hope for consumption prosperity. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消费疲软-中国经济面临通缩风险/a-65868466">But the retail industry sales are still weak</a>Essence The anxiety of economic prospects and unemployment reduces the willingness to consume consumers with large amounts of consumption.</p>
<p>The retail sales in April increased by 18.4%year -on -year, but this was only half of the 35%increased by the private sector. Compared with March, factory output decreased by 0.5%, and investment growth slowed down.</p>
<p>Xue Liang (Yin), who is engaged in information technology in Beijing, said: "I have doubts about spending money. New crowns and changes in the international situation make us very worried."</p>
<h3>Internal and external influence</h3>
<p>According to the China National Bureau of Statistics and Industry Organization, the manufacturing shrinkage accelerated in May, and the new orders and export orders declined. Affected by the Federal Reserve and the central banks of Europe and Asia to suppress inflation, global consumer demand declined, leading to 7.5%year -on -year exports in China. Exports to the United States plummeted 18.2%.</p>
<p>This is a big challenge for automakers and other manufacturers who have tried to make up for weak domestic demand to make up for the weak domestic demand. Tenglong Automobile Co., Ltd. is an electric bus manufacturer located in Xiangyang, Hubei. After the travel restrictions are lifted, they immediately sent sales staff to Russia, South Korea and Southeast Asia, with a view to the three -year interval.</p>
<p>After the tourist restrictions, the electric bus manufacturer Xiangyang Tatong Automobile immediately dispatched sales staff to Russia, South Korea and Southeast Asia to try to restore orders after the three -year empty window period.</p>
<p>Zhou Shengming, deputy general manager of Tenglong Automobile, said: "Last year our foreign customers have not appeared. But this year we already have several batches. There are three batches in May."</p>
<p>A special car located in Shiyan City, Hubei also sells sanitation vehicles, cargo vehicles and dump trucks to the municipal government, and stated that the company exports vehicles worth about $ 20 million in Russia and Southeast Asia each year.</p>
<p>Li Yichun, who operates a bodyguard business in Beijing, said that customers are not willing to consume. "From my business point of view, the economy is not very good. Many boss -level customers do not intend to spend money as before."</p>

<h3>to "negative clear zero"</h3>
<p>After relaxing the epidemic prevention policy in early December, the number of infections showed an explosive growth. According to the "Minutes of the National Health and Health Committee Meeting on December 21", in just 20 days, China has accumulated a total of 248 million infections. On December 20, about 37 million infection cases were added nationwide. Bloomberg and the Financial Times confirmed the authenticity of the Minutes of the meeting from the participants. Many Chinese people's intuitive feelings are: the people around them are Yang. The canned yellow peach is also tight.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/64085226_303.jpg" />#####</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Along with this wave of infection, people across China crazy look for drugs, snapped drugs and blood oxygen instruments. In many places in China, there is a case of cold, antipyretic drugs, and shortages, and some cities have implemented drug restrictions. This has also caused some doubts: Why did the government prepare accordingly in advance? At the same time, Paxlovid, the new crown oral special effects drugs developed by Pfizer, is difficult to find. The Indian version of the generic drugs are also hot. The familiar bridge in God staged again. "</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/64192515_303.jpg" />#####</p>
<h3>Medical system is full of official data completely distorted</h3>
<p>The infected tsunami also puts tremendous pressure on the Chinese health medical system. Hospitals, patients with dying in life, exhausted medical staff, funeral home and the crematorium are arranged by long teams -such pictures are everywhere. The new crown infection and death data released by China has been completely disconnected from the real situation. According to the official figures, only a dozen people have died in the new crowns since December in early December.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/64272488_303.jpg" /></p>
<h3>The most injured by the elderly</h3>
<p>Many media and public articles pointed out that Chinese hospitals and clinics are full of elderly people (the picture shows Shanghai Tongren Hospital on January 3). As early as mid -December, foreign media reported that funeral parlor and crematorium in Beijing and other cities were abnormally crowded. Since mid -to -late December, many people have posted news about the death of elders at home in the social media, and even the Chinese media have reported the news that "6 days, the Republic lost 16 academicians". However, Chinese reports did not know the cause of the death of these elderly academicians. Some Netease Public Article Articles said on December 24: "9 days of 9 academicians died in 3 days. They could not hold on to medical care, let alone ordinary elderly people."</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/64272396_303.jpg" />#####</p>
<h3>The spread of infection from the city to the countryside</h3>
<p>Zeng Guang, the chief scientist of the former Chinese disease control epidemiology, said at the Phoenix Finance Association at the end of December that he estimated that Beijing's infection rate may have exceeded 80%or even higher. Zhang Wenhong, director of the China National Infectious Disease Medical Center, also said at the end of December that the infection rate of this wave of epidemic in China has been very high, many large cities have exceeded 50%, and the Lunar New Year will reach 80%. The research of Shanghai Jiaotong University and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center recently made a preliminary judgment on research. This wave of new crown infection has crossed the peak before and after the New Year's Day in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou in 2023. Rural areas will usher in a peak in January. Compared with urban areas, medical resources in rural areas in China are more scarce (the picture shows a sick elderly in Ziyang, Sichuan).</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/64272372_303.jpg" />#####</p>
<h3>Data analysis: Infected death will reach the peak on January 23</h3>
<p>According to British Health Information Analysis Company Airfinity in late December estimates that thousands of people in China currently die every day, and millions of people may die in the new crown (the picture shows a crematorium on December 18). The company also predicts that the death of Chinese infection will reach its peak on January 23, 2023, and the single -day death case will rise to about 25,000. And January 23 is the second day of the Chinese New Year of the Chinese Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T07-31-00Z/64259123_303.jpg" />#####</p>
<h3>China announced that "0+0" countries have begun to quarantine China</h3>
<p>Chinese officials announced on December 26 that from January 8, 2023, the detection and centralized isolation of nucleic acid testing and centralized infected infected people in China will no longer be isolated. At the same time, after the entry restrictions are relaxed, it will further optimize foreign people to come to China to arrange in China, and "orderly restore" Chinese citizens' outbound travel in the future. This has caused some countries to worry about the input of viruses from China and possible virus mutation. Japan, the United States, France (pictured) and other countries have first announced that they have implemented entry restrictions such as isolation or nucleic acid detection from entryrs from China.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-17T09-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />In a semi -annual exchange rate policy report submitted to Congress, the US Treasury Department said that China is also worthy of close attention because China failed to publish information about foreign exchange intervention, and "the key features of its exchange rate mechanism generally lack transparency."</p>
<p>This report focuses on countries with a huge trade surplus, which actively intervene in the foreign exchange market to gain trade advantages.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement: "Most of the foreign exchange interventions of the US trading partner last year were carried out in the form of selling the US dollar. These actions helped to strengthen their currency."</p>
<p>She also said that although the global economy is stronger than many people expect, the Russian and Ukraine War put pressure on the prospects and exacerbates the unsafe situation of energy and food. In the latest report, there are 7 economies in the list of major trading partners of the US Ministry of Finance, namely China, South Korea, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, and Taiwan, which will pay close attention to their currency practices and policies. Switzerland was listed as a exchange rate manipulation in December 2020 and became the object of "strengthening" discussions, but it was deleted from the observation list last year. An official of the Ministry of Finance said that the trade imbalance between China and the United States is another factor in China staying on the list. But Japan was eliminated in the latest report.</p>
<p>The standards measured by the US Department of Finance are the huge trade surplus in the United States, a large number of frequent account surplus, and evidence of "continuous and unilateral intervention" of the foreign exchange market.</p>

Essence A source told Reuters that Torgan's meeting with Tang Feng was for "common security interests."</p>
<p>China, which is actually democratic, is a part of its territory and strongly opposes foreign interference in Taiwan affairs. Britain has only established formal diplomatic relations with China, but still has offices with the functions of actual motion halls in Taipei. Although the British Primary Minister will hold talks with officials at the same level in Taiwan, the British Minister does not meet with Taiwanese officials in accordance with the convention.</p>
<p>Togenhart was not the official minister of the British Cabinet, but attended the cabinet meeting as a security minister and was responsible for cracking down on terrorism, domestic national threats and economic crimes. Two years ago, Togenhart was sanctioned by Chinese sanctions for publicly issuing remarks on human rights in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>Pei Londe pointed out: "Security affairs ministers against the pressure of other departments have established a precedent that all ministers can follow, which is worthy of appreciation."</p>
<p>Reuters reports that bilateral officials are unwilling to talk about this, which shows the sensitivity of the meeting.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the British Ministry of Political Affairs said: "We do not often comment on the ministers' private conferences."</p>
<p>Tang Feng's office also refused to comment.</p>
<p>Tang Feng released a photo she was reading on Twitter on Thursday, the title of "New Technology: How Our Dreams Become a Social Nightmare and what we can do." Became Societal Nightmares -And what we can doabout it). This is a book that is about to publish, and its author Bill Raduchel said that the book originated from Togenhardt in 2019.</p>
<p>Tang Feng wrote in the tweet: "Learning from Tonenhart can bring a return. I look forward to reading the minister's digital insight. I also look forward to deepening the relationship between Taiwan and the United Kingdom and more cooperation in the field of science and technology. Let us</p>

<p>Tang Feng was conducting a rare high -level minister in the UK. Her office only revealed that she would visit government departments and a company that specializes in developing low -oriented satellites on the earth.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Taiwan's ministerial officials who visited the UK last time were Deng Zhenzhong, a chief trade negotiation representative. He visited London last June.</p>
<p>In November last year, Greg Hands, then deputy minister of the British Ministry of International Trade, went to Taiwan and met Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen, causing dissatisfaction in China.</p>

<h3>launched missile protests to the US and Korean military exercises</h3>
<p>In recent months, North Korea has increased the testing of nuclear capacity missiles. On Friday, the day before the US Navy Michigan's submarine arrived in Busan, South Korea, North Korea launched two short -range ballistic missiles to its eastern waters to respond to the US -South Korea -South -South Korea -and -South Real shot firing exercise held near the North Korean border this week.</p>

<p>The US military's deployment of Michigan echoed the exercise conducted by the United States and South Korea's navy in the plan, focusing on strengthening their special actions and joint combat capabilities.

<h3>Economy is worrying</h3>
<p>Experts believe that Kim Jong -un has actively promoted the research and development of nuclear weapons to the North Korean economy.

But China is becoming more and more tough -sometimes completely hostile -show that the theme of his trip is not only to ease, but also in confrontation.</p>
<p>According to China, the United States is a hegemonic country that is declining. It is seeking to consolidate its dominant position in the backyard of China, and anger China with its claims on Taiwan. Taiwan is an autonomous democratic island. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has accused the United States of leading other countries to jointly conduct actions to curb China in military, diplomacy and technology. Although China agrees to make a dialogue, it still shows that it is ready to deal with conflicts, and it does not expect much about the possibility and role of really thawing the relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>"China is indeed, discarding fantasy," said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University. "It may become more and less confident in the hard work of Sino -US relations in China."</p>
<p>Xi Jinping recently warned officials to prepare for the "extreme situation", indicating that China's external threats are increasing sharply. The Chinese warships deliberately approached the US warships and aircraft, and were called unnecessary provocations by American officials. In this week's call, Chinese Foreign Minister told Brinken that the "responsibility is clear" of the deterioration of the relationship between the relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>At a wider level, Xi Jinping paid particular attention to national security in the ten years of ruling. He emphasized the necessity of self -reliance and stated that the crisis of the Chinese Communist Party's existence was ubiquitous. In China, the nationalist emotions incted by the authorities have become increasingly rising, cheering for Beijing's tough foreign policy.</p>
<p>The United States is also facing domestic pressure that cannot show weakness; taking a stronger attitude towards China has become a rare consensus between the two parties. While President Biden showed his hopes for dialogue, he still described China as the largest geographical challenge in the United States. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions on Chinese officials and enterprises, and tried to cut off the channels for China to obtain key technologies worldwide. There are still parliament members who accused the government of overwhelming China, for example, trying to dilute the recently about China in Cuba <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230612/china-spy-base-cuba/">Establishing a Spy Base</a>Report.</p>

<p>Because both sides have a seemingly irreconcilable position, there are basically no officials and experts' visits to Blinks to obtain major breakthroughs in hope. This will be the first visit to China since 2018. It is unclear whether he will meet with Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for China to visit China is cold. The root cause is that it claims that the American gesture is not sincere, and the treatment to China is not fair. When Brintken was postponed due to the Chinese monitoring balloon incident, Beijing claimed that its reaction was excessive. China has also accused the United States of considering its war in Russia in Ukraine <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230220/us-china-weapons-russia-ukraine/">Provide weapons</a>Refucaries and the United States <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221014/biden-china-technology-semiconductors/">calling on allies</a>Restrictions on export technology to China are regarded as evidence of its containment.</p>

<p>"Global Times" last Monday <a href="https://opinion.huanqiu.com/article/4DDRVXKMUeg">Social Review</a>China said that the United States made a dialogue request "just acting."</p>
<p>"Not only can we not cooperate with their performance, we must also be vigilant about the real intentions behind the acting," the article wrote.</p>
<p>Singapore Liney Yew Public Policy College High -level Researcher Tang Anzhu(DrewThompson)It is said that China ’s claim to restore the relationship between the two countries is in the United States, indicating that it is increasingly unwilling to compromise. Xi Jinping is highly vigilant about risks, which means that he only wants to see the United States to make significant concessions, such as reducing the existence of the United States in the Indo -Pacific region, which is unwilling to accept the United States.</p>
<p>"Brinton's interview is obviously not a consultation," said Tang Anzhu, who had studied Chinese issues in the US Department of Defense. "The two sides will exchange opinions in order to better understand their positions and understand their bottom lines more."</p>
<p>But even such communication may be limited. Although the Biden government insisted that the contact with the Chinese senior executives is critical to preventing the upgrading of competition into a military conflict, in some people's opinion, China has shown increasingly strong willingness to confront.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said that in the Taiwan Strait this month, a Chinese warship was close to the US destroyer, and the two sides were less than 140 meters. In May, a Chinese fighter flew directly to the front of the US reconnaissance aircraft over the South China Sea in May. The United States calls unsafe movements, and China has countered it as a response to the United States.</p>
<p>China's military forces also disturbed American allies in the region. During the joint exercise with Russia this month, the Chinese fighter aircraft flew near the South Korean aim, forcing South Korean fighters to take off urgently to respond.</p>

<p>Tang Anzhu said that Beijing may want other countries to be unable to determine how it will react in some cases, so it will be more careful.</p>
<p>"This is part of the reason for China to restrict contact, because they think that the opponent's hesitant mentality is good for them," he said.Both governments hope that after the visit to China, other US senior officials such as the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Commerce Raymond Doro, and the Climate Special Envoy Kerry can also achieve it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing is that during the November Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders Summit, Xi Jinping and Biden may meet in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Professor Zhu Feng of Nanjing said that China does not refuse dialogue, but just wants to ensure that the United States can hear the concerns of Chinese side, such as the problem of semiconductor chip acquisition. "China's most important thing now is that the topic cannot be determined by the United States."</p>

<p>Kangda, the top official of the State Council responsible for East Asian affairs(Daniel J.Kritenbrink)Tell reporters on Wednesday that Brins are expected to hear Chinese officials on a strong statement on Taiwan's issues. He will also be prepared to face the China ’s recently prohibiting some of the advanced semiconductor chips and manufacturing equipment for its exports to the Biden government.</p>
<p>Although the possibility of reaching a major agreement is unlikely, some analysts said that US -China relations have been at the lowest point in the past decades, and restarting substantial diplomacy at this time is already a target worthy of winning.</p>
<p>Mai Aiwen, a professor of Georgetown University, who serves as the senior director of Asian Affairs of the National Security Council in the Obama administration(Evanmedeiros)It is said that during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union also achieved consensus at least expected and behavioral specifications, thereby constituing the basis of competition between the two countries. He said that there is no such consensus between the United States and China.</p>
<p>"Brinken's visit to China is facing a strategic unknown place," Mai Aven said. "This is a new situation."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) is responsible for BYD's sales business in the German market(Lars Pauly)A few days ago, it was stated to the outside world that it is planned to occupy Germany in the medium term <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/电动汽车/t-41781394">electric vehicle</a>5%to 10%of the market. Pauli did not disclose when the "mid -term" was when.</p>
<p>At present, Pauli is busy building BYD's sales system in the German market. The consumer business of this Chinese car company in Germany has just started earlier this year. According to data from the German Federal Motor Automotive Administration, in the first five months of this year, there were nearly 1.12 million new vehicles in Germany, of which only 165 were BYD.</p>
<p>In 2022, BYD's total global sales were 550,000, of which 440,000 were sold in the Chinese local market. As a result, BYD squeezed the German public in the Chinese market. Earlier, the German Volkswagen has been in the Chinese market for fifteen years.</p>
<p>Industry insiders pointed out that Chinese car companies have a leading position in battery technology and autonomous driving technology. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国电动汽车能在欧洲市场站稳脚跟吗/a-63452410">However, whether these emerging manufacturers can gain a foothold in mature markets such as Germany, there are still questions</a>Essence In 2022, Chinese manufacturers such as Weilai and Roewe <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国电动车在中国市场步履蹒跚/a-65359971">The total market share in Germany is only 0.9%</a>Essence</p>
<p>BYD is mainly for consumers who are sensitive to price in the German market. Sales executive Paoli pointed out that BYD is committed to providing "the electric models that can be obtained" and in the "other manufacturers will not be active in the middle and long -term price interval. He revealed that BYD's sales in the German market mainly rely on local dealer networks so that consumers can directly obtain after -sales service from dealers.</p>
<p>Before joining BYD, Paoli once worked in Germany for nearly 30 years. He told the media that BYD, which has begun to produce batteries since 1995, has been seriously treated. "The era when Chinese car companies have been laughed at because of safety testing or poor quality."</p>

The German Government has said in February this year that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国萨尔州-不会阻止比亚迪收购福特工厂/a-64673183">does not oppose BYD as one of the potential acquisitioners of the Ford Motor Factory in the state</a>Essence The factory plans to announce new investors at a meeting on June 23. BYD has strived to finalize or acquisition plan for European factories by the end of this year to achieve a plan to start mass production in Europe in 2025.</p>
<p>In addition to BYD, other Chinese manufacturers are also actively expanding the German and European markets. Just last October, electric vehicle manufacturer Weilai began to sell in Europe, and its Hungarian factory was put into operation in September. Its opponent Xiaopeng Automobile also landed earlier in Nordic countries with greater support for the electric vehicle industry in Danish, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway. According to data from the German Federal Motor Automobile Administration, the Roewe Motors under SAIC Group has licensed 6,766 vehicles in the first five months of this year, which is more than doubled compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>Industry analysts pointed out that nearly 20 Chinese auto brands may soon enter Europe. Their advantage is that they have launched a variety of price -level electric models, and large car manufacturers in Europe, including German car manufacturers, usually only provide high -end electric vehicles, and also faces bottlenecks such as lack of components or chips.</p>
<p>In addition to vehicle manufacturers, Chinese battery manufacturers have also actively deployed in Europe recently. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/电池的副作用宁德时代在德投资受审视/a-65549438">Industry Giant Ningde Times</a>Factory in Germany <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不忧欧中关系-中国电池厂商正式在德国量产/a-64539329">has been completed and put into production</a>, Another factory in Hungary is also under construction.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) June 12, 2019 is an important node of the Hong Kong's anti -repair campaign. On the same day, a large number of citizens occupied the roads near the Golden Bell Legislative Council and the government headquarters, intending to stop the second reading of the revised draft. The outbreak of police and civilians was fiercely conflict, which was regarded as a sign of the official upgrade of the movement. By 2023, four years have passed. How many people remember this vigorous exercise?</p>
<p>At least, Christine UMPFENBACH has been thinking about it. She is the director of the Cultural Activity Department of "Bellevue Dimonaco". This is a comprehensive community for immigrants and refugees to provide residence and cultural activities. It is located in the golden area of the center of Munich. Its birth is a series of "PEGIDA" ("European Patriot Anti -Western Islamic" campaign). Results of citizen movement.</p>
<p>Based on a cultural center positioning with immigrants and refugees, Wufenbah has always paid attention to social and political issues, including Hong Kong. However, since 2020, because of the epidemic and other domestic and domestic incidents, she feels that German media has paid less attention to Hong Kong, so she wants to re -attract everyone's attention and discussion by holding cultural activities.</p>
<p>I believe the film has a strong appeal. The event planning team has selected two Hong Kong independent films. One is to hope that the audience can understand the historical background and complexity of more Hong Kong social movements. Mentality to better connect Europe and Germany. At the event site, some small magazines made by the resistance of the Hong Kong anti -repairs during the 2019 Hong Kong Repairing Movement provided an online exhibition including the sports scene photos and the audio materials of the resistance of the year, and a performance art performance was also arranged. After each movie, the organizer invited several scholars, artists and NGO workers who had left or stayed in Hong Kong for discussions and communicated with the audience.</p>

<h3>"The Island of Melancholy": Social movement, historical scar and fate of Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The movie "The Island of Melancholy" tells the true story of three different generations of Hong Kong people: the fugitives who swimmed in the Cultural Revolution during the Cultural Revolution, Hong Kong students who were in the June 4th incident in Beijing during the 19th and nine -nine democratic movements, and participated in the June 7 riots Junior prisoner (YP, Youngprisoner). The film uses the method of pseudo -documentary, allowing the Hong Kong school movement participants of the umbrella to play the role of these predecessors when they are young, and express their personal views. The film is flowing between documentary and fiction, and people of different generations are connected in series of social events of various major eras, reflecting the value of the times in the eyes of the resistance and Hong Kong in different periods of major eras.</p>
<p>Guests participating in the discussion include Wanho, a scholar who engaged in historical research in Germany, JM, who currently lives in Germany and has actively participated in the academic movement and workers, and Australian Paul, a Australian Paul, who has lived in Hong Kong for more than 20 years and has worked in NGOs in Hong Kong and has worked in NGOs in Hong Kong, Essence</p>
<h3>controversy: Liuqi riots</h3>
<p>As a scholar, WANHO's research direction is Chinese history, literature, culture, and media research, including the role of the CCP ’s official media during the major events of British colonial Hong Kong during the Cold War. She pointed out that the third part of the film will compare the six -seven riots with the 2019 anti -repair movement, which is dangerous, and it is easy to cause misunderstandings, because the nature of the two is completely different: the movement of 2019 is spontaneous by the people, " There is no big platform. "It is not controlled by the behind -the -scenes interest group; the June 7 riots are organized by the Chinese Communist Party's Hong Kong agent Xinhua News Agency to organize and make up the Hong Kong British government for violence. This can also be confirmed by the CCP's official media "Dago" in Hong Kong's official media "Dagao" in 1966 and 67. She expressed doubts about whether the motivation of these Jiu -seven riot participants was out of faith or because of benefits.</p>
<p>In response to this question, Paul felt that the film was compared with the emotional differences between the Hong Kong people during the six -seven riots during the six -seven riots, not comparing the two events. JM also expresses the method of the film. He believes that during the June 7 riot, Hong Kong was under colonial rule, and there was an idealistic idea in society, and some people were willing to believe. It was just that the situation was completely reversed.</p>

<h3>2014 and 2019, about the memories of umbrellas and counterattacks</h3>
<p>All three guests agreed that the film was very shocking, and they all thought of their own experience.</p>
<p>At 2014 and 2019, Paul himself was not in Hong Kong. But for him for more than 20 years in Hong Kong, Hong Kong is his home. Due to the work experience of the Hong Kong NGO, he knew many ethnic groups, such as South Asian and Philippine people. Although they don't look like Hong Kong people, they were born in Hong Kong and have a strong sense of belonging in Hong Kong. This is particularly reflected during the social movement, which impressed him. He believes that the identity of these people is ignored.</p>
<p>JM went to the umbrella movement in 2014, and then went to study and work in foreign countries. By 2019, when he saw the Hong Kong movement, he returned without hesitation. He agreed that the social participation of the two exercise was very wide. In his opinion, Hong Kong people are actually not sensitive to politics. It is that Beijing has implemented more and more control in Hong Kong to cause general awakening of all sectors of society. In 1997, his family had the opportunity to immigrate to the UK, but he did not leave. For the so -called patriotic narrative and one country, he cannot believe: "How can I believe that this regime will change? They do not fulfill their promises at all. We have always asked for rehabilitation of 89 June, but it is useless at all."</p>
<p>Wanho, who is also in Hong Kong in 2014 and 2019. During the umbrella movement, she served as a volunteer teacher in Zhanzhong Movement, provided free tuition for her classmates, and returned to the office to work overtime after class. In 2019, she interrupted Germany's research back to Hong Kong. One was because of supporting campaigns, and the other was to take care of the sick family. In 2020, the epidemic broke out. She returned to Germany to continue his research. She did not go back for more than three years until March this year. I didn't feel when I was busy studying before, but when she returned to Hong Kong, the memories of those years suddenly returned. She felt that she became a stranger in Hong Kong. I used to talk about psychological trauma with friends in the past on June 4th. Now she also has a personal experience, so that she does not want to review the relevant images of the year to avoid excessive psychological burden.</p>
<p>Later, some audiences talked about the past that Hong Kong people supported the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, vigorously donated the past to the Wenchuan earthquake disaster relief, and the psychological transformation of Hong Kong people in mainland China after Xi Jinping took office and the Hong Kong anti -national education campaign in 2012. Paul agreed to his point of view, and also believed that Xi Jinping was very different from the previous leaders of the Communist Party of China. Many Hong Kong people's departure was after he came to power, including "Blue Silk" and the mainlanders.The documentary "Weeds Endless" tells the story of the people who move the Hong Kong -Hong Kong people. From the perspective of the amateur, the dialogue is the main axis, and two are tracking two in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港移民潮為何親中藍絲也撤離/a-61475091">2020 political immigration wave</a>The Hong Kong people who left decisively showed the abandonment and confusion they faced in the process of migration: a young father chased his new identity for the sake of his son, but he was trapped in his homeland. The argument of identity; a young man bid farewell to his friends, lived a different life from a friend who was sentenced to prison in Hong Kong, and was in the role of overseas Hong Kong people.</p>
<p>The guests participating in the discussion are the drama workers who currently live in Hong Kong. They have an independent studio, HG, who walks in Germany and Hong Kong. Essence</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T11-42-00Z/65947692_401.jpg" />Movie screening scene</p>
<h3>Leaving, meaning betrayal?</h3>
<p>G is a firm left -over. He introduced that Hong Kong's recent daily life is like this: friends meet, say hello to say for a long time, most of the next words are: "Have you ever thought about going?" G's parents and younger brother have immigrated to the UK, but he himself himself, but he himself himself, but he himself himself, but he himself Persist in being a person who stays.</p>
<p>He can actually understand the reason for leaving. As the protagonist mentioned in the film, people without children may not want to give birth at all. People with children do not want their children to speak Mandarin. But there are also difficulties to leave. After leaving, consider what conditions for life, and what class you are in. His brother could not find a job after a few months in the UK.</p>
<p>For himself, there are more important reasons for him. If no one is left, will the culture be gradually annihilated? In addition, there are still many people who can't go in Hong Kong. Many of the hands and feet expressing their opinions are still in prison now, and they cannot give up them. In terms of work, although more and more censorship hinders creation, it is a greater challenge for him to use Cantonese. Some people often say that many of his memory, feelings, and emotions remain in 2019, but he thinks is not that-but those who are in prisoners are the responsibility they need to bear. Extremely important emotions.</p>

<h3>Between stay</h3>
<p>HG's choice is similar to G, and there are differences. He saw that many Hong Kong people currently immigrate to nearby Taiwan, Japan and Thailand; many people have gone to Britain because their system is in line and can maintain their original work. As the film tells, the young man as the protagonist has gone, but most of his friends are still there. After all, the immigrants have left a few, and most people still stay in Hong Kong. In fact, the tide of immigration in Hong Kong has a long history. When 1997 approached, many Hong Kong people immigrated to Canada. Now that under this wave of immigration, many people immigrate to find a job and return to Hong Kong. Although the two new immigrants in the film are confused, they are in a good state -he heard that immigrants have committed suicide due to uncomfortable life.</p>
<p>HG doesn't like the second choice. He chose the third one and walks between the two places. Whether in Germany or in Hong Kong, it feels different from the past. He has not yet figured out. He felt as if he had returned to a state of primitive society, like a hunter, and there was no fixed residence.</p>
<p>In HG's view, the exile during the Cold War may mean forever. But in the 21st century, the times are different. He knows some African friends in Germany and is also exiled, but they have the freedom to choose from and can go home. In our era, flowing is relatively easy, can we be in exile and discrete(Diaspora)Create a way of our own lifestyle, rather than being impressed with the spiritual shackles of betrayal? HG calls this state of life as "Newform of Exile". And people outside should try their best to help the people staying.</p>
<h3>Discrete and scars</h3>
<p>Anam has the same feelings about the choice of transfers in the film when registering the identity registration. Holding a Chinese passport and a free art worker, she is almost difficult to get foreign visas. During the new crown epidemic, her passport expired, but the authorities refused to send her a new passport to let her stay in China. Helplessly, she chose to enter Hong Kong and obtain the freedom of entry with Hong Kong passports, otherwise she could not participate in this event -and this freedom was unable to enjoy the Chinese mainland passport.</p>
<p>In the film, the new dad impressed immigration such as divorce, which impressed Anam. For her, it felt like the "drinking victory" that she shouted when toast -divorce means marrying democracy.</p>
<p>As a new Hong Kong people participating in the fighting movement, Anam has a lot of confusion about identity. Even for ten years in Hong Kong, she feels difficult to call herself as Hong Kong people. Due to the origin of the mainland, she often face some doubts, and sometimes even from friends. Although she supports Hong Kong's fighting movement, she is alienated by some emotions revealed in the movement, and the deepening of the contradiction between China and Hong Kong also embarrassed her.</p>
<p>During the anti -repair campaign, many young Hong Kong fighters and their families had a fierce conflict. Some fighters conceal the facts of their family members, so even if they are injured, they cannot get the support of the family. This family contradiction is even more sharp for Anam. Her parents were all patriotic Communists. They all believed that she was brainwashed after going to Hong Kong. She was even more thunderous about her citizenship in Hong Kong. The two generations could not communicate. Later, because the friends around became a novice parent, Anam saw the hardships of raising friends to raise a baby, and then gave birth to a mood of gratitude and guilt.</p>
<h3>Anti -Qing Zero "White Paper Protest" appeared in Hong Kong's troubles</h3>
<p>Different audiences also shared the intergenerational contradictions similar to Anam, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反封控抗議蔓延海外-多地響應白紙運動/a-63921836">One of the white paper campaigns participating in Urumqi fire last year. Her parents knew nothing about her participation in the protest. After learning that she was furious and asked her why she was not frank to them. </a>Parents were all come over. When they were young, they had seen someone destroyed for a lifetime because of saying something wrong. At this time, she realized that her parents' reprimand of her was not because they loved the party and loved the party, but because of their concerns about her safety. It was also the attitude of her friend that hurt her. A friend who protested with her once inserted a knife and worked hard to organize rescue after she was arrested. But after she came to Europe, those friends were alienated to her -they were warned that they could not contact people in exile, but she did not expect.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) in the Taipei Shopping Park, because of the joy of the pangolin family not long ago, a male baby wearing a male baby, and another mother -in -law with six armored mothers is about to come. Essence</p>
<p>In 2014, Yamagrazai was being conserved by the International Nature Protection Alliance(International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN)Evaluated as "extreme endangered" species. Fortunately, there have been major breakthroughs in the illustrations and reproduction of pangolin in the Taipei Zoo for more than 20 years, so that there have been birth in the park in the park. And 8 female pangolin. Nowadays, the mountains and Jiajia family in the zoo are leafy, and the people are strong. The continuation of the species of pangolins is now strongly supported.</p>
<h3>Human pitying leads to endangered</h3>
<p>Luo Yaoyi, the director of the Taiwan Animal Area in Taipei City, said in a DW interview that the number of wild pushed by wild pangles in Taiwan decreased sharply, less than 10,000. The biggest survival threat facing the armor comes from the poaching of human beings. In Asia, pangolin meat is often regarded as spectacular treasures, and scales are considered to have the effects of stopping hemostasis and milk. Therefore, wild pangolins are often hunting by humans and become the most often smuggled mammals in the world. Introduction to pangolin is naturally hobbies, no aggressiveness, poor escape ability, and slow movements, so it is easy to be hunt by humans or dogs. Coupled with the low reproductive ability of pangolin, one child is longer than many other animals, which leads to the danger of this species facing death.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T11-43-00Z/65947983_401.jpg" />The "water" of the Laipzig Zoo in the mountain armor</p>
<h3>Move to Leipzig and Prague</h3>
<p>The Taipei City Zoo started the conservation of pangolins as early as two or 30 years ago. In 1997, it became the first zoo in the world to successfully breed pangolins. In 2007, the Taipei City Zoo first gave a male pangolin "head" to the Leipzig Zoo in Germany. Specific ethnic groups. Although such expectations have not been realized, these two pangolins still live in the Leipzig Zoo healthy. In 2007, the "first portion" flew to the German Ryzig Zoo on Christmas Eve, which caused a sensation. After all, it can only be seen in the Laiphzha Zoo in Europe that year.</p>
<p>Following the "head" and "Guishan", in 2016, Taipei gave the two pangolins "Water" and "Piercing Xiong" in the Lepi Zoo. Unfortunately, the two pangolin died in 2018 and 2019. Over the years, the Taipei Zoo and the Leipzig Zoo have communicated with personnel and information, and the two sides have achieved great achievements in the management, conservation and reproduction, artificial feed, and environmental planning of pangolins.</p>
<p>Although Rypzh's "head" and "Guishan" failed to reproduce the next generation, the breeding plan of the Outdoor Breed in the Laoshan Park of Taipei City Zoo blooms in Prague. In 2020, Taipei City and Prague in the Czech Republic were concluded as sisters. In April 2022, the Taipei Shoppy Park borrowed a pair of pangolin "fruit treasures" and "throat sugar" to Prague Zoo as a friendly symbol of the sister city. On February 2, 2023, the "Moisturizing Sugar" successfully gave birth to a female baby, named "pine cones"; this is the first case in Europe to successfully breed pangolins in Europe. Because the armor is mainly distributed in warm places such as Asia and Africa, the cold and dry climate environment in Europe is actually not suitable for its survival. Therefore, the birth of "pine cones" is even more pleased and excited.</p>
<h3>There is no "pangolin diplomacy"</h3>
<p>There is a newly built pangolin in Taipei Zoo in Taipei Zoo, imitating the complex system of tropical rain forests, so that the world knows the original living field of pangolin. Experts and caregivers in the park have made great progress in the mortine -paging, research and medical technology for many years, but also work hard under the diet of pangolin. Originally, pangolin was used to finding ants and termites in the wild, but the zoo could not provide enough and highly diverse ants and termites for their food. The garden had to continuously improve the recipes of pangolin. The species of materials have finally successfully developed artificial formula feeds that are in the flavor of mountain armor, which not only allows the pangolin to eat nails, but also healthy and lively.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that the conservation performance of the Taipei Zoo in the pangolin is the world's number one. Then Taipei City Zoo will be like mainland China <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/大熊猫的王牌外交官之路/a-39563989">"Panda Diplomacy"</a>Similarly, is the so -called "pangolin diplomacy" by pangolin? The spokesman of the Taipei Zoo Cao Xianshao told DW; the Taipei City Zoo has not carried out "pangolin diplomacy", but is committed to the preservation of species. Essence Taipei City Zoo not only successfully supports Taiwan's pangolin, but also shares the support technology with the German Leipzig Zoo and the Czech Praga Zoo, allowing Taiwan to successfully go to Europe as a conservation ambassador, so that more people in the world know the pangolin, and support the pangolin. Conservation work.</p>

<h3>"Animal Immigration" in Germany is rooted in Taipei</h3>
<p>Some animals from Germany can also be seen in the Taipei Zoo, such as the oldest gibbon "Taishan" in the park. "Taishan" is currently about 56 years old and belongs to ultra -age, because the average life expectancy of large galaxies is 30 years old. In 1998, it came from the Frankfurt Zoo to Taipei Zoo, and formed a family with the only female individual in the garden at that time. Because both individuals were around 30 years old, they almost came to the end of their lives. The garden had only wanted them to be accompanied by the old age. "Taishan" is now open in Taiwan. It usually has its own activities with his son, but occasionally gathering for a while after meals. "After the long" died in 2009, and its children were still alive.</p>

<h3>More cooperation projects for different species</h3>
<p>Taipei City Zoo in the European Zoo and Aquarium Association(European Association of Zoo and Aquaria EAZA)Under the suggestions, fully develop the Malaysian breeding plan, so it is coordinator of EEP, the EEP of the EEP in the Malaysian Endangered Species, which is the Nuremberg Zoo. It may be scheduled to the European zoo. As far as the giraffe cooperation case is concerned, Taipei is closely cooperating with the German Opel Zoo to promote the scheduling of the giraffe. At the same time, Taipei Zoo also maintains good partnership with multiple other German zoo.</p>
<p>Over the years, Taiwan has also held many popular animal exhibitions in Germany -it is particularly worth mentioning that from the end of 2004 to the end of March 2005, the Taipei Zoo was transported to 13 species of about 900 species of bullets to the Munich Botanical Garden in Germany to allow it After the pupa was hatched into a beautiful butterfly, flying in the sky in Munich achieve a beautiful and romantic story. Such a "exotic butterfly exhibition" has been held 4 times in different places in Germany. From the beginning of March 2012 to the end of May, many units and institutions in Taiwan cooperated together to host the "Taiwan Worm Exhibition" in Munich, Germany. These exhibitions have received great praise.</p>
<h3>Disappearing Taiwan "Cloud Leopard" German "Fog Leopard" played on behalf of</h3>
<p>Latin's cat named Neofelisnebulosa is mainly distributed in southeastern Asia. It is called Nebelpardar in Germany, and it is directly translated into Chinese as a "fog leopard"; in Taiwan, it is called "cloud leopard". But whether it is a cloud leopard or a fog leopard, the naming of this animal should be related to its epidermis with "cloud -like spots". The number of cloud leopards living in the world may currently be less than 10,000.</p>
<p>According to the footprint of Taiwan Yunbao, it has been in the mountains in southern Taiwan. Although no one has seen it in the past two decades, its beautiful figure has always stayed in people's memory, especially in Paiwan and Lukai people. Essence According to legend, the ancestral spirit of the Paiwan tribe often appeared in the dream of the wizard with the image of the leopard, conveying the prophecy or warning to their clan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T11-43-00Z/65947963_401.jpg" />The cloud leopard of Taipei Zoo is called Suki.</p>
<p>Since the Taiwan Cloud Leopard has disappeared for many years, why can I see the leopard in the Taipei Zoo? This female cloud leopard is called suki. In 2016, it came to Taiwan from the Wood Perthape Zoo in 2016 instead of from its native land - -Southeast Asia. Yu Shi Xuan, director of the Taiwan Cloud Leopard Rehabilitation Research Association, told DW that in fact, the main countries currently participating in the Yunban Circle's breeding plan are mostly British, the United States, and European countries. Sponsorship. Suki should be exchanged through the European Zoo and Aquarium Association system EAZA.</p>
<h3>Seeing Taiwan animal specimen in Germany</h3>
<p>German zoologist Slug Hansauter(1871-1944)Arrived in Taiwan for the first time in the 1920s. He first served as a high school instructor in Okayama. In his spare time, he collected half -winged insects such as Ts. Tsubaki and aphids. In 1905, he came to Taiwan twice, lived in Kaohsiung and other places, collecting moths and butterflies based on Puli as the base, and hired dozens of helpers to assist him in animal collection. His footprints are almost all over the island. He made a large number of animals collected into specimens or sold to many museums and research institutions in Europe and the United States; many scholars have completed a number of studies based on Specifications provided by Souide for many years and published more than 300 papers. In 1912, Soundi went north to Taipei, and he continued his collection of specimens and research. Later, he served as a faculty in Taipei High School and Governor's House Medical School. He lived in Taipei's Dadaocheng. He died in 1944 and was buried in Taiwan.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the contributions of Tude's collection and production of insects and animal specimens, several kinds of Taiwanese insects and animals are named after his name, such as the Cunbaic frog, the Sulhar's grass lizard, the Schord lizard The aunt of the deer snake, the Thin -winged Tianshu of the Sulong, and so on. Some animal specimens sent by Solid that year were now visible at the "Berlin Natural History Museum in Germany" and some other animal museums or research institutions.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-17T11-50-00-04-00/000000.png" />Students from a university in Nanchang ate a suspected "mouse head" at the campus restaurant last month, and the official insisted that it was a duck neck. China's official released the latest survey results on the 17th confirmed that foreign bodies were mice and non -duck necks. Network screenshot/RFA information</p>
<p>Recently, a Jiangxi college student suspected to have "mice" in the cafeteria, but the school and the Market Supervision and Administration Bureau claimed that they were "duck necks", and students were forced to change their mouths. After this "referring to the mouse as a duck", it was fermented on the Internet after the incident, and set off a down -to -face sound in China. Related images and audio -visuals widely passed Weibo and Twitter.</p>
<p>However, China's official released the latest survey results on the 17th confirmed that foreign bodies were mice and non -duck necks. This incident caused the credibility of the government's functional departments to be questioned, and "referring to mice as a duck" also became a hot word in China.</p>
<p>According to Chinese official media reports, a joint investigation team composed of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Public Security Department, the SASAC and the Market Supervision and Administration Bureau reported on the 17th. The school restaurant ate a foreign body suspected of "rat head" and was discarded by the restaurant staff on the same day.</p>
<p>The joint investigation team checked the recording of the restaurant's back kitchen, checked the procurement list, and asked the person in charge of the restaurant involved, the relevant parties of the kitchen, the students of the parties, and the onlookers on the spot to determine that the foreign body was not a duck neck. According to authoritative animal experts, professional identification of the scenes and videos taken by the students in the person in charge is determined that foreign bodies are the heads of mouse rodents.</p>
<p>According to international media reports, many netizens believe that the mouse head and duck neck can be distinguished. "A simple thing requires the provincial departments to figure out. What does this mean?"</p>
<p>Some netizens on Weibo pointed out, "This is no longer as simple as food hygiene, it is also a big problem about credibility and work style." Some people say that the most ridiculous thing about this is that the students of the matter were forced to send a clarification video to clarify the video. I said that I did n’t see that I was eating duck neck and became a “second victim”.</p>
<p>The "rat head duck neck" incident also caused heated discussion on Twitter. Fang Zhouzi, a Chinese public figure, satirized on Twitter: "It's great. I dispatched 4 provincial departments and invited authoritative animal experts to identify it. Not a duck neck. Which authoritative animal expert is so idle? "</p>
<p>Some netizens commented on Twitter that this is "the issue of official credibility, one is a problem of non -black and white, and a question of whether we can still maintain confidence in this society."; "Many people still think that small questions are big. Now, take a look. This is really not a small question, and it really has to be done. After all, you see, the good news is that it is determined to be a rat head. The bad news is that you only find the mouse head. "</p>

<p>In 1971, the whistle of the inside of the Vietnam War, Daniel Elsberg, died on Friday (June 16) at the age of 92.</p>
<p>Daniel Ellsberg was originally a military analyst at the US Department of Defense. In 1971, he leaked the New York Times to the New York Times to reveal the truth of the US government. The "Pentagon File" exacerbated the wave of anti -war in the United States. The then President of the United States Ford eventually announced in 1975 that the Vietnam War was over.</p>
<p>Elsberg is also a firm anti -nuclear weapon activist. In 2017, he published a book about nuclear threats called "The DoomsDaymachine: Confestions of a Nuclear Planner".</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that Elsberg announced in March that the doctor told him on February 17 that he suffered from end -stage pancreatic cancer, leaving only about six months.</p>
<p>After illness, Elsberg continued to speak for anti -nuclear activities. In an interview with reporters, he talked about the continuous threat of the nuclear war, especially the threat caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Elsberg's wife and children issued a statement on Friday (16th) saying that Elsberg was accompanied by his family before his death and did not withstand any pain.</p>
<p>The statement said, "He is glad not to comply with the doctor's salt -free diet in the past five years. In the last few months of his life, hot chocolate, cakes, cakes, poppy seeds, and sampling salmon gave him more Happiness ".</p>
<p>Elsberg's wife Patricia, son Robert and Michael, and daughter Mary also said that Elsberg watched his favorite movies before his death.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese war continued from 1955 to 1975, and it lasted about 20 years before and after. It was the longest overseas war in American history.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, the Secretary of State of the British Security Affairs Togenhart met Tang Feng, the Minister of Development of Taiwan this week, and broke the traditional practice of British foreign policy. This may irritate Beijing.</p>
<p>Tomtugndhat met with Tang Feng, the Minister of Development of Taiwan in London on Wednesday (June 14) in London, breaking the traditional practice of high -level officials who did not contact each other. A source told Reuters that Torgan's meeting with Tang Feng was for "common security interests."</p>
<p>China, which is actually democratic, is a part of its territory and strongly opposes foreign interference in Taiwan affairs. The British and China established formal diplomatic relations, but still has offices with the functions of the actual motion hall in Taipei. Although the British Primary Minister will hold talks with officials at the same level in Taiwan, the British Minister does not meet with Taiwanese officials in accordance with the convention.</p>
<p>Tonanhart is not the official minister of the British Cabinet, but attended the cabinet meeting as a security minister and is responsible for cracking down on terrorism. Two years ago, Togenhart was sanctioned by Chinese sanctions for publicly issuing remarks on human rights in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Luke Depulford, Chief Executive CEO of the China Policy Council of China, said that according to him, this is the first time that the British Cabinet Conference members met with Taiwan Ministers. "This is worthy of welcome and sent the right information."</p>
<p>Pei Londe pointed out: "Security affairs ministers against the pressure of other departments have established a precedent that all ministers can follow, which is worthy of appreciation."</p>
<p>Reuters reported that bilateral officials were unwilling to talk about the matter, which shows the sensitivity of the meeting.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the British Ministry of Political Affairs said: "We do not often comment on the ministers' private conferences."</p>
<p>Tang Feng's office also refused to comment.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Taiwan's ministerial officials who visited the UK last time were Deng Zhenzhong, a chief trade negotiation representative. He visited London last June.</p>
<p>In November last year, Greg Hands, then deputy minister of the British Ministry of International Trade, went to Taiwan and met President Tsai Ing -wen in Taiwan, causing dissatisfaction in China.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-17T12-32-07-00-00/000000.png" />The British Congress announced yesterday's ruling report that Qiangsheng's violation of COVID-19 (2019 Coronary Virus Diseases) of the official residence party during his tenure of the Prime Minister's office was deliberately misleaded. The "Daily Mail" of the right tilt today immediately announced that Johnson &amp; Johnson will write a column for newspapers every Saturday.</p>
<p>In the film released by the "Daily Mail", Johnson &amp; Johnson, who was a journalist, said that he was "very happy" to contribute to the "outstanding appearance", and he said that he would provide "unreserved content".</p>
<p>For a long time, the "Daily Mail" of anti -immigrants, anti -awakening, and Brexit has been one of the most loyal support for Johnson &amp; Johnson and the Conservative Party. Johnson &amp; Johnson said that he only wrote political issues when he was "absolutely necessary." In the first column of preview on the Internet, Johnson &amp; Johnson described his endless weight loss fighting. Johnson &amp; Johnson was trying to try a appetite inhibitor to avoid the temptation of "raid the refrigerator at 11:30 pm, and use half a bottle of wine to rush into the belly with the Spanish sausage into the stomach." But if Johnson &amp; Johnson chose to return to a heavier political topic, he had a high -profile platform to retaliate against the current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. However, the controversial Johnson &amp; Johnson was condemned because he did not comply with the relevant regulations of the officer to accept external appointments.</p>
<p>The Business Appointment Consultation Committee (ACOBA) is responsible for reviewing all similar appointments within two years of departure from officials. A spokesman said that Johnson &amp; Johnson will notify the committee half an hour before the "Daily Mail" published a new column news before the news of the news of the new column. Essence</p>
<p>The spokesman said that this was a "obvious violation". "We have written to ask Johnson &amp; Johnson to explain and will publish the content of the letter in a timely manner according to our transparent policy." However, the business appointment consultation committee cannot force politicians to refuse an external work invitation, and Johnson &amp; Johnson often ignores the rules. It has been displayed in the report of the Privilege Committee of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The Australian government will spend 2 billion Australian dollars (about S $ 1.84 billion) to build thousands of economic affordable houses that have been subsidized by the government across the country.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg and Reuters, Australian Prime Minister Albanis said on Saturday (June 17) that the state and the territory government will obtain construction funds within two weeks and must be put into use before June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>The new measures are designed to solve the problem of tightness in Australian housing supply and slow down the time for the people to wait for buying a house. Housing supply tightening was blamed on the rise of real estate prices.</p>
<p>Albanis said in Melbourne: "The Labor government believes that every Australian should have his own security nest." He promised that the 2 billion Australian dollar "will be used to build public houses."</p>
<p>Housing problems have become a hot issue in Australia. Due to the serious shortage of supply and the rapid rebound of immigrants, when inflation has eroded people's purchasing power, the pressure of rising house prices and rents has further intensified social dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The Australian government just announced last month that it will allocate $ 14.6 billion in federal budgets in the next four years to reduce the burden of expenditure for families and enterprises.</p>
<p>Albanis said in a statement that providing more housing for Australians, "is the key priority of the country."</p>
<p>In addition, the Australian government also plans to set up a $ 10 billion housing fund to build at least 30,000 new economic affordable housing, but this plan has been opposed by minority senators in the parliament.</p>
<p>According to the Australian government data, in June 2021, a total of 417,800 households participated in large -scale social housing plans to participate in Australia, including public housing plans, which were 378,600 higher than June 2008.</p>

<p>Description: Recently, a Jiangxi college student suspected to have "mice" in the cafeteria, but the school and the Market Supervision and Administration Bureau claimed that they were "duck necks" and caused heated discussions on the Internet. The official release of the latest survey confirmed that foreign bodies were not duck necks. This incident caused the credibility of the government's functional departments to be questioned, and "referring to mice as a duck" also became a hot word in China.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Earlier this month, a video entitled "Eat Mouse Heads in Jiangxi University of Universities in Jiangxi" caused a heated discussion. A foreign body of a student in Jiangxi Industrial and Technical College of China in the cafeteria. After the school informed the Nanchang High -tech Zone Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, law enforcement officers rushed to the scene to compare repeatedly and confirmed that "not a mouse but a duck neck." The school reported on the official Weibo on June 3 that the parties invited the parties to compare the foreign body and confirmed that they were "duck necks". "The student had made a written explanation on the spot to clarify the video content.</p>
<p>However, the school and the regulatory bureau could not obtain the trust of the public. Netizens did not buy the "duck neck said", and the question and discussion of "referring to the mouse as a duck" appeared.</p>
<p>On June 10, in response to the "June · 1" food safety incident of Jiangxi Institute of Technology, the Provincial Department of Education, the Provincial Public Security Department, the Provincial SASAC, and the Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau formed a joint investigation team to conduct an investigation.</p>
<h3>Official certification "It's a rat head, not a duck neck"</h3>
<p>According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, the joint investigation team released the survey results on Saturday (June 17) that students who had eaten suspected "rat heads" in the cafeteria had been discarded by the canteen staff. Check the procurement list, ask the person in charge of the cafeteria, the relevant parties of the kitchen, the students of the person, and the onlookers at the scene, etc., and determine that the foreign body is not a duck neck. According to authoritative animal experts, the photos and videos taken by the students who were extracted were professional to determine that foreign bodies were the heads of mouse rodents.</p>
<p>The official report continued that the Changdong Branch of the Nanchang High -tech Zone Market Supervision and Administration Bureau and Jiangxi Industrial Vocational and Technical College did not carefully investigate and obtain evidence. "It is determined that Jiangxi Industrial and Technical College is responsible for the incident, the enterprises involved in the incident are directly responsible, and the market supervision and management department is responsible for supervision."</p>
<p>The investigation and handling report stated that in accordance with the "Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China" and the implementation regulations, the Nanchang Market Supervision and Administration Bureau has revoked the food business license of the cafeteria involved, and punished the enterprises and legal representatives. It will seriously handle relevant responsible units, enterprises and responsible persons involved in the Changdong Branch of the Changdong Branch of Jiangxi Industrial and Technical College, Nanchang High -tech Zone Market Supervision and Administration Bureau.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Institute of Technology has deleted the previous statement.</p>
<h3>Government departmental credibility is questioned</h3>
<p>The announcement of the survey was once again caused by public opinion, which also caused the credibility of the government's functional departments to be questioned. Many netizens believe that the mouse head and duck neck can be discerned. "One such simple thing requires alarm to the provincial department to figure out. What does this mean?"</p>
<p>Fang Zhouzi, a well -known public figure in China, sarcastically said: "It's great. He dispatched 4 provincial departments and invited authoritative animal experts to identify it. Finally, he proved that the mouse was not a duck neck. Which authoritative animal expert is so idle?"</p>
<p>Some netizens on Weibo pointed out, "This is no longer as simple as food hygiene, it is also a big problem about credibility and work style." Some people say that the most ridiculous thing about this is that the students of the matter were forced to send a clarification video to clarify the video. I said that I did n’t see that I was eating duck neck and became a “second victim”.</p>
<p>The "rat head duck neck" incident also caused heated discussions on Twitter. Some netizens commented that from the central government to the local level, the instructions of the superiors to the subordinates are "stabilizing". Unstable, "it shows that the Chinese Communist Party has a very lack of confidence in social stability from top to bottom."</p>
<p>There are also tweets that this is "the issue of official credibility, one is a question of right and non -black and white, and a question of whether we can still maintain confidence in this society."; "Many people still think that a small question is big. Now, look at it. The question, and it really has to be done. After all, you can see that the good news is that it is determined to be a rat head. The bad news is that you only find the rat head.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) This is probably one of the most shocking news in the near future: many German men think that domestic violence is "acceptable"; women cooking is considered to be righteous; in public places to show homosexual extraction, the will be attracted to the leadership. Universal dislike -this is the main conclusion of the latest questionnaire survey by the non -governmental organization of the International Organization of Planinternation.</p>
<p>According to the survey report, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/三成德国青年男子认为打老婆理所当然/a-65885221">One -third of the interviewed German men believe that occasionally doing it for women can be done</a>Essence 34%said that sometimes they would beat their spouse -the purpose was to "let them learn to respect". In March of this year, the International Pei Children's Association conducted a online questionnaire survey of 1,000 men and women (between 18 and 35 years of age (aged 18 to 35) in the "masculine stress field".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/收入不公德国女性比男性少赚18/a-64908737">Background Reading: Inaccurate income: Germany women earn 18%less than men</a>In addition to the violence of women, the respondents' answers on the other hand are also very disturbing. 48%of respondents said that if men show homosexuality in public, they will feel disgusted. The public figures who were regarded as a role model interviewed, including the billionaire Musk and the Internet celebrity Andrewtate, who claimed to be "Avengers," — the latter as "women are the ultimate symbols of the ultimate", "Men's life is the life of men is the life is "War" and other remarks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T14-12-00Z/64345721_401.jpg" />In January 2023, Andrew TATE was tried in Romania due to population trafficking and rape charges</p>
<p>After the results of this survey of the International Pei Young Association were announced, it set off a stir in the German public opinion community, and it also triggered fierce criticism. Many netizens questioned the representativeness of the survey on social media. Because the questionnaire was filled in online, the respondents may be the target group of the Internet.</p>
<p>Some people point out that the questionnaire is not specific enough. In fact, all the questions are around a question: Do you really think so much about young men in Germany?</p>
<h3>"This is absolutely not good"</h3>
<p>From the perspective of experts, this survey is defective. "I really want to know how this survey was designed; there are how the respondents answered, and the information in this area is not transparent enough." In an interview with Voice of Germany. The organization is a non -governmental organization with the main purpose of modern gender equality.</p>
<p>"However, aside from these defects: Even if we randomly find 1,000 men to ask them if we can imagine that in certain circumstances, one -third of these people answered. I want to say: beating people is absolutely impossible. "</p>
<p>Schurp continued: "From the perspective of our known family violence statistics, such a mentality exists objectively, and some people in the society are practicing this concept." The number can prove his point of view: According to his The Criminal Archives evaluation of the Federal Criminal Affairs Bureau has performed violence on spouses or predecessors in Germany in 2021.</p>
<p>In the above cases, about eight into women are female as the victims, and most of the perpetrators are men. Although this has declined slightly than the previous year, from the perspective of the number changes in the past five years, the overall trend is actually rising.</p>
<h3>prejudice for women</h3>
<p>But even if you focus on masculine and gender prejudice, there is a trend of disturbing. For example: A survey conducted by the German federal government's anti -discrimination office in 2017 showed that about 40%of the respondents said they were disgusted with the behavior of publicly showing homosexuality.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-17T14-12-00Z/62572624_401.jpg" />Berlin's United in LOVE Parade (July 2022)</p>
<p>In a "2023 Gender Social Norm Index" survey entrusted by the United Nations, about 90%of the respondents acknowledged their prejudice against women. Two -thirds of people believe that women are not suitable for political leaders.</p>
<p>In this survey, a quarter of the respondents believed that a man was acceptable to fight a woman. At the end of the survey, the conclusion was that although many campaigns aimed at promoting gender equality, the latest gender social norm index showed that "prejudice for women has not been reduced in the past ten years."</p>
<h3>pendulum fluctuation</h3>
<p>However, what caused <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/大男子主义充斥电子游戏产业/a-59910474">Great Masses</a>Is the mind even so popular? "There is a pendulum back and forth in this regard, and the results of many questionnaires are also reflected." Shulp analyzers, "For example, at least at least homosexuality and Kuaer, such as minority groups can be seen by the public more and more It is not just hidden in a closed corner. But if anyone can't get used to this, you will feel that you have been challenged, or even threatened. "</p>
<h3>"You shouldn't be ashamed of your daughter"</h3>
<p>Crisis also causes the rejuvenation of inherent gender characters -because people tend to find a sense of security by returning to tradition.</p>
<p>For example, during the epidemic, sociologists observed the retrospective of traditional gender characters: women undertake more and more housework, and the number of domestic violence cases has increased. "From the perspective of the world, we are facing a trend of overall backwardness, and the inherent rigid gender characters have returned to the tide." Schlope concluded.</p>
<p>The data mentioned above makes him feel long -term. "We need to conduct more extensive counseling for young and adult men. The community must take action to provide consultation services for men to make them part of public services. In this way, when they encounter problems, they will not go online to find online People like AndrewTate are soliciting opinions. "</p>

China's bureaucratic system can always find various methods to embarrass EU companies, and the European -China Investment Agreement cannot bring much improvement. "</p>
<p>"In this difficult period, China cautiously sent a signal to the EU, which is worthy of recognition from the perspective of diplomatic perspectives. But there are several reasons for heavyweights without approval of this agreement."</p>
<p>"China is trying to prevent the European Union from further closer to the United States. In this era when the conflict between the West and China, if the European side is eager to approve a bilateral investment agreement with China, it will be tantamount to provocations to the United States. Unlike the United States in the Trump period, the United States under Biden is looking for allies on multiple levels such as G7. If the European Union said to the European -China Investment Agreement, it does not mean that the French President Macron said 'reduction Class to the United States', but in implementing the European Union's own strategic interests. "</p>
<p>The article pointed out that, given that China is still maintaining "[Unlimited Friendship] with Russia(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国驻欧大使傅聪友谊无上限是一种修辞表达/a-65259688)", And continuously threatening to Taiwan, the European Union should continue to maintain dialogue with China on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is a strategic mistake to further pull closer relations with China." ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/调查德国对华投资不造成依赖/a-65389145)If the "European -China Investment Agreement" is approved, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧洲议员包瑞翰应当节制企业投资中国/a-64863137">their motivation to invest in China will be stronger</a>Essence At that time, the efforts of the European politics to promote the diversified operations of enterprises will make soup. "</p>
<p>The author believes that if Chinese officials have issued a clear signal to cancel sanctions on the European party, the European Union should seize the opportunity to re -negotiate some of the contents of the European -China Investment Agreement, because China's business environment has been further further after 2020 that China's business environment has further further further. deterioration. "China seems to invest a lot of political capital to fight for the European Union, which has allowed Europeans to grab the handle. However, the EU should use this handle in other ways instead of approved the European -China Investment Agreement."</p>
<p>"The role of China's mediationrs in the Russia and Ukraine still has a lot of room for improvement. The competitive distortion caused by China's industrial subsidy policy has also brought more and more troubles to Europe. Fix the better multilateral trade rules as soon as possible. The EU should promote China to participate in constructive negotiations as soon as possible. "</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) In the case of disagreement within the German United Government, when the "policy of China" is issued and what impact will it have on both parties. However, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs recently clarified that the country's guarantee has no restrictions on exports to China. According to the Agreement of the Ministry of Economic Affairs obtained from the Dielinke party group, the Ministry of Economic Affairs responded in the question of the Federal House of Dielinke: "Export guarantee policies for China are open."</p>
<p>At present, the joint ruling government composed of the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party is debating the correct way to deal with the Chinese issue.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国出台国安战略-对华关系定位语焉不详/a-65925314)Essence At the end of last year, Reuters had a draft German official confidential documents, which mentioned <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/路透德国计划收紧对高度依赖中国的企业的规定/a-63828801">to more strict regulations for companies that have deep exchanges with China, strictly review investment guarantees, and tighten export credit guarantees for sensitive technologies</a>However, these drafts have not been following.</p>
<h3>The attitude of the joint government is inconsistent</h3>
<p>Among the German ruling parties, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国总理撰文-呼吁勿孤立中国/a-63990656">Social Democratic Party ’s current German Chancellor Selz’ s attitude towards China is considered milder</a>He once wrote in the media: "The rise of China is neither the reason for isolation in China nor the excuse to restrict cooperation with China." On the other hand, the Green Party's attitude towards China is more tough. For the past few months, the Green Party's German Foreign Minister Berbak has also urged Germany to change its policy to China several times, and calls on European countries to reduce the degree of "unilateral dependence" to China.</p>
<h3>Export credit guarantee is not affected</h3>
<p>Regarding the current export policy of Germany to China, Christianleye, a spokesman for the federal House of House of Federal House, told Reuters: "Foreign Minister Berbak's saying on" export credit guarantee has already had the upper limit "and does not match the facts: The policy is still open, "he refers to Bellbak's speech during the Asian trip in April this year.</p>
<p>Lee commented that the German government is practicing "a strategic fuzzyness of dealing with China", and his words are becoming more and more sharp, but the practice of trade has not changed. He said that fortunately, the increasing confrontation between China and the West has not yet been reflected in the practice of export credit guarantees.</p>
<p>The full name of the export credit guarantee is "HermesDeckungungen", which is launched by the German government to protect the exporters and banks from economic and political reasons in export trade. This guarantee system dates back to 1949. The German government commissioned Eulermemes (now allianztrade, also known as Andlian Trade/Yulianyi) to provide export guarantees for companies that cannot obtain private guarantees to promote the development of the German export industry, increase corporate export exports Anti -risk ability.</p>

<p>According to Reuters from Tokyo on June 18th, US Secretary of State Brosky will arrive in Beijing on Sunday. This is the first American senior diplomat to visit China in five years. The current bilateral relations are cold. The two worlds in the United States and China The biggest economy between the largest economy has gained any breakthrough prospects.</p>
<p>After the suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States, Brincken postponed the visit in February this year, and he will become the highest -level U.S. government officials who have visited China since President Byphon in January 2021.</p>
<p>During his visit from June 18th to 19th, he is expected to meet with Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and the director of the Office of the China Central Foreign Affairs Committee, may also meet with Xi Jinping, President of China, and strive to establish open and long -lasting communication. Channels to ensure that the strategic competition between the two countries is relieved and will not fall into conflict.</p>
<p>The other parts of the world will also pay close attention to this trip. After all, the upgrade of any dispute between the two superpowers may have an impact on the financial market, trade and global supply chain aspects.</p>
<p>"Both parties realize that we do need to establish high -level communication channels," a senior official of the US State Council told reporters while cheering in Tokyo on the way to Beijing.</p>
<p>"We are at an important node in the relationship between the two parties. I think it is very important to reduce the risk of misjudgment, or as our Chinese friends often say, to prevent the spiral of the relationship from falling," said the official.</p>
<p>The total deterioration of the relationship between the United States and China has triggered people's concerns, that is, they may have a military conflict on the autonomous Taiwan Island one day. China claims that Taiwan is its own. There are also differences in issues such as trade, semiconductor industry, and Beijing's human rights records.</p>
<p>Especially for neighbors of China to worry that despite the United States repeatedly tried, China is still reluctant to have regular military dialogues with Washington.</p>
<p>Before going to Beijing this Friday, Brinken said at a press conference that there were three main goals in this trip: the establishment of crisis management mechanisms, promoting the interests of the United States and its allies, and directly talking about related issues, and exploring potential cooperation areas.</p>
<p>"If we want to ensure that our competition with China will not evolve into a conflict like what we do, then your starting point is to communicate." He said that he would also propose that because Washington believes that it is a political motivation because of the political motivation. The charges of American citizens who are detained in China.</p>
<p>However, US officials diluted any expectations for major progress at the call of this visit earlier this week. Officials said that although Brinton's main goal will be a discussion of "frank, direct and constructive", it is unlikely to make breakthroughs on any major issues, including the issue of Finnini and Americans detained in China.</p>
<p>However, it is expected that Brintken's visit will pave the way for more bilateral meetings in the next few months, including US Treasury Secretary Yellen and the Minister of Commerce Raymond. This may also lay the foundation for Xi Jinping and Biden at the multilateral summit later.</p>
<p>The U.S. official also said that efforts to ensure that China ’s cooperation in Fantney will become a key project on the agenda. US officials said that China has always been reluctant to cooperate on this issue.</p>
