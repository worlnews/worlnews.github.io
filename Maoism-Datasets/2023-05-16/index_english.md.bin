Obviously, it is obvious that the sumal of the sumal meeting in the Hiroshima of Japan. , Ocean countries, another China and Central Asia, are mainly authoritarian countries and land power countries. From the map, there is a feeling of the confrontation between marine countries and land power countries. "

Wang Weizheng analyzed that for China, Beijing also wanted to take advantage of Russia to take care of its influence in Central Asia while Russia was overwhelmed: "China hopes to stabilize a site, this site is Eurasia. People who have studied geopolitics in the past It is said that who can control the Eurasian mainland can control the world. I think China is from this focus. On the other hand, China's economic development is quite rapid, and it is always concerned about energy security. Land, do not through the ocean, you can buy oil in the inland, and even have oil pipes. "

** Scholars: Chinese foreign policy prompts South Korea to turn **

At the same time, South Korean President Yin Xiyue and US President Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida will also hold the Summit of the United States, Japan, and South Korea during the G7 meeting. Yin Xiyue visited Washington at the end of April. The outside world is concerned about frequent interaction between South Korea and the United States. Does it mean that South Korea has a trend of increasingly closer to the United States?

(Video screenshot/csis) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-05152023103400.html/capture2.jpg)Ramon Pachecopardo, a part -time researcher at the think tank, pointed out that when Yin Xiyue visited the United States, the joint statement between Biden and Yin Xiyue talked about Taiwan, the South China Sea, and China about South Korea's economic stress. South Korea's defense, diplomacy, and economic policies have publicly expressed criticism. Interestingly, China has expressed dissatisfaction with South Korea in the past, but now China has a very public criticism of South Korea. The same is true of attitude .... What is more interesting is that South Korea will attack China's criticism instead of bowing heads or apologies. "

Victorcha, senior vice president of Asian Affairs of Strategy and International Research Center, also said that because South Korea believes that Taiwan's issue is an international issue, this is a great difference with the Beijing authorities that Taiwan's problem belongs to the internal affairs: "China believes that South Korea thinks of Taiwan to Taiwan to Taiwan The issue of the issue offended to China, but South Korea's position in this matter is firm. "** Scholars: Chinese invasion ambitions cause Korean public opinion to cause disgusting **

Pado said at the meeting that South Korea's attitude towards China is becoming more tough because China is increasingly threatened and aggressive in the Indo -Pacific region: "China has made some territorial sovereignty claims, but these territories have long been owned by South Korea for a long time. This makes people from all generations of South Korea have a negative view of China. This is important because public opinion will affect the foreign policy of democratic countries. ... And many Koreans are worried about Taiwan. They are worried about what happened in Hong Kong. They are worried about what happened in Hong Kong. There will be an encounter with Hong Kong in Taiwan, so the public's impression of China is even more negative. "

In response to the prospects of Sino -South Korean relations, Pado believes that the foreign relations between the two countries will become more and more tight in the near future: "I don't think China will change diplomatic positions in the near future. All invited to participate. You will see that South Korea and other countries will issue more statements, which are likely to mention China or Taiwan. On May 22, South Korea and the European Union will also hold a summit. Ursulavon Der Leyen will visit South Korea. I'm not sure if they will name China, but economic and regional security will inevitably be the focus of discussion. "

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-16T-5-32-08-00-00/000000.png)Agence France -Presse reported that IEA, headquartered in Paris, said that Russia's export volume increased by 50,000 barrels a day last month reached 8.3 million barrels. It was judged that Moscow did not fully redeem the sharp reduction of production.

IEA stated in this month's oil market report that "Russia may be increasing production to make up for income loss."

Russia's oil export revenue increased by 1.7 billion to $ 15 billion in April. However, this number decreased by 27%from the same month in 2022. IEA also said that the taxes of Russian oil and natural gas industries were reduced by 64%compared with the same period last year.

Seven major industrial groups (G7) and Australia have coordinated with the European Union to set the upper limit of the price of Russian oil products and crude oil to compress the main funding sources of the Russian -U -U -wars. The European Union also embarked on Russia's key oil exports.

Moscow has threatened to disconnect countries and companies that implement the upper limit of the West.

Moscow announced that it reduced production by 500,000 barrels per day, while oil output national organizations and OPEC+, including the Saudi Arabian Arabia, also agreed to reduce production.

IEA said that the output of Russia's crude oil in April was "roughly stable" to maintain 9.6 million barrels per day. In May, Russia must reduce production by 300,000 barrels per day in order to reduce production to the standard.

IEA pointed out that China and India accounted for nearly 80%of Russian oil export destinations.

Ms. Li, who often travels to and from South Korea, Japan, and Thailand, continues to say that South Korea has not opened a number of entry visas for Chinese passport holders, but the entry visa for the Chinese is very strict: "They (Chinese) are being entry. The questioning is very careful. Thailand's original travel visa for the Chinese people is 30 days. Basically, few people have been kicked out of Thailand.

He said: "I am also helping others to apply for South Korean visas and US visas. The American visa B1 and B2 class abroad are much easier after late January this year, but it is strange that the tourist visa to South Korea is now. Now Very difficult. The procedures for their review are almost as tedious as the application for the US visa. "

The reporters of this station called the Beijing Visa Office of the South Korean Embassy in China and the Shenzhen Visa Center on Tuesday. They planned to further inquire, but as of the end of the draft, they could not contact the embassy staff. The visa consultation telephone of the Japanese embassy in China is automatically answered and there is no related inquiries.

After application, it is necessary to apply for review after 1 to 3 years. There will be social workers interviews and various courses in the middle. After entering the trial period of 6 months, it will not enter the final court to decide until the supervisory agency is also passed.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) "We have been adopted for more than 4 years and waited for a long time, but I still feel very grateful and moved." Lin Yiru, 35, told DW.

Yi Ru and his 43 -year -old wife Chen Yiling engaged in children's education in Kaohsiung. Before passing the 2019 marriage, Yiru adopted a 10 -month -old son Ayang. Since then, they are "Mom" of Ayang. It's "Mommy". Although the two were adopted after passing together, but because of the incomplete law, Yi Ling and her son had always been legal strangers.

Taiwan passed the same marriage law on May 17, 2019, but same -sex spouses cannot adopt their children together after marriage like a heterosexual spouse, or adopt their adopted children. In January 2022, the gay spouses and Meow Dad made adoption through the court and became the first case in Asia, but it was just a case.

The case of Yiru and Yiling was explained by the judge in May 2022. The two emphasized that although the legal guarantee seemed to have no effect on the daily childcare of the baby's childcare, if there is a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major disease or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major disease or a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness or even a major illness, It was not guaranteed when it was a temporary accident.

On May 16, 2023, the Legislative Yuan discussed the relevant legal amendments of the law. There was no objection to the legislators. When the three -reading amendment was "provided for adoption for adoption for the adoption of the same -sex spouse to adopt the children or jointly adopted by the same -sex spouse.

"I think the most exciting is to be recognized by the entire society." Yi Ling told DW that her relatives and friends were puzzled that she had no affinity of Ayang. "I think most people don't know this, and they will feel ridiculous."

The dad and Meow Dad also expressed their mood through Facebook PO text: "Congratulations!Comrades who adopt the family of the family!The country is finally willing to return you/your legal two mothers or two dads!" It means that this is late justice.

### Comrade Family Adoption Challenge

According to the information collected in Taiwan in 2022, there are 215 children who have successfully produced media and foreign media at home and abroad, and 533 are still waiting at home. Wait for comprehensive and complex factors.

After passing through the same marriage law, Taiwan society has increased support for comrades' various attitudes. According to the information released by the civilian group Rainbow Equivalence Platform in 2022, it supports 67.4%of the comrades and partners to adopt together, and there are still different voices in the society.

According to Yiru, some anti -groups will oppose their adoption with "the best interests of children": "There will also be another group of people's voices in Taiwan, especially for adoption without blood. Children, a gay family, will think the child is very pitiful. "

Yi Ling believes that the most important thing to raise children is "love". "We have been working hard to learn and do (this matter). In the process of raising children, we can also give the biggest feedback to the society. I love a child. . "They believe that if someone opposes comrades without blood adoption, the main source is the discrimination of comrades.

After adoption, Taiwan's gender group stated that it will continue to promote the relevant rights and interest bills of comrades, such as [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣跨國同婚獨漏中國-台陸伴侶有苦難言/a-64484094)The rights and interests of comrades include artificial reproduction, preparation of marriage and students, agent pregnant mothers, and other anti -discrimination policies and equality laws.

He believed that the incident reflected that Hong Kong could not take it lightly on national security risks. Observed people believe that Beijing hopes to issue warnings to Hong Kong people and the international community through rulings.

When was arrested in 2021, mainland Chinese authorities have reported to the SAR Government in accordance with the mutual notification mechanism.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao said on May 16 that Liang Chengyun was ropeed in the law, reflecting that Hong Kong could not take it lightly about national security risks.

Li Jiachao: "This incident tells us that in fact, national security risks are hidden in the society, so we have repeatedly emphasized that although Hong Kong is roughly stable now, we must not take it lightly and be vigilant about national security risks. The color revolution of violent 'and the Hong Kong version is a alarm. We must pay attention to the risks in this regard for a long time, so everyone should be careful to prevent some latent forces, including some soft confrontation. "

The reason why Liang Chengyun was repeatedly sentenced to speculation was that in addition to the background of his Hong Kong people, he was also an important factor in having frequent interaction with Chinese officials before his arrest.

Feng Chongyi, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Science and Technology, believes that Liang Chengyun was not only a judicial ruling for life imprisonment, but also included political calculations. One of the goals was to cause the cold effect of Hong Kong people.

Feng Chongyi: "Taking the law as a political tool. Who to find a crime, to what extent, they (Chinese authorities) are very particular about. Many people in Hong Kong now have a tendency to rebel. People who belong to the CCP's united front system can't stand it. Those who find this identity (guilty) are to kill chickens and monkeys and make a "role model" out. "

Lai Rongwei, assistant professor at the General Education Center of the Longhua University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, said that the promotion wave of Hong Kong's dedication has resonated with global democratic countries. He believes that the US Hong Kong people have a voice outside the string.

Lai Rongwei: "Hong Kong is a relatively different area in China. It is more open and more open. The so -called" Patriot Governing Hong Kong "is actually aimed at young people and middle generations of Hong Kong. The world's countries (use) penetrate China. This re -sentence (Liang Chengyun) obviously means intimidation, that is, to warn the world that you should not come to Hong Kong to engage in peaceful evolution and color revolution. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T06-24-00-04-00/000002.png)Lai Rongwei, a scholar of Taiwan Longhua University of Science and Technology, believes that the Chinese authorities have sentenced the Chinese Hong Kong people to the voices of the American Hong Kong people on the crime of spy. (Lai Rongwei is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf-05162023062342.html/m0516gf.jpg)Lai Rongwei believes that Beijing revised the "Anti -Spy Law" and expanded the scope of spy behavior to hold dual standards.

Lai Rongwei: "They (Beijing) also often communicate through all kinds of communication, whether politics or culturally, to penetrate the world. Because they have done this, they have the bottom of their hearts, so they are now" anti -"anti -" anti -"anti -anti -countermeasures now.

Lai Rongwei is worried that Beijing will expand the so -called "national security". Anyone who does not say that China may be illegal and will be used as a spy.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-16T06-43-00Z/57047533_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65632979/57047533)In the past few years, several LGBTQ groups have been announced by the government for pressure.

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Beijing Comrade Center" (north of the north), which was established for 15 years (north), issued a statement on its social media account on Monday (May 15th), announcing that the center will terminate the operation. After the news came out, many Chinese netizens left a message under their posts to contribute to the organization's contribution to the Chinese LGBTQ community in 2008, and also lamented that they would like group.

Andy (pseudonym), who has long promoted the LGBTQ community movement in China for a long time, said in an interview with DW that it was not surprising that Beitong announced the termination of operations, because in the past few years, several university LGBTQ communities or folk LGBTQ groups were received by the Chinese government After suppression, the LGBTQ society has "no room for doing things." He said: "The North Tong Center mentioned the" force majeure ", which must be the order of the Chinese government to make them unable to continue operation, so I was not surprised by this result."

In 2020, China's largest diversified gender activity "Shanghai Pride Festival" was announced to be suspended without warning on the official website. At that time, speculation was related to the Chinese government's pressure on the host team. 2021, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国高校lgbt帐号遭封-学者同志团体的致命一击/a-58198503)At that time, the accounts that shared the blocked list on WeChat were also stopped.

Andy told DW that he was recently found "drinking tea" by the local government for holding activities related to the LGBTQ community in the near future and asked him what activities he had done before, which made him feel that if he continued to do activities in a similar way to do activities In the case, maybe it will start [facing the interference of some government]()Essence He said: "If there are too many participants in the event, it may not work. Recently, I heard that the American consulate is going to do an event and want to invite comrades and friends to participate, but the local comrades did not send the relevant news to the public account of the social media. Because in addition to calling comrades and friends, the organizer of the event is the American consulate. These two factors are inappropriate in the eyes of the Chinese government. "

Lv Xinjie, the "Outright Operation" (OutrichtInformational), the development of the LGBTQ campaign in Asian countries for a long time, said in a DW interview that the various signs of China in the past few years have shown that the end operation of the North Tong Center is inevitable. Many Chinese LGBTQ athletes told her that when an organization cannot operate various activities or has no space to promote affairs, it is very difficult to continue operating. She said, "I feel regretful but not surprised by the news."

### 同 同: China LGBTQ "Safety Space"

Lu Xinjie told DW that for the Chinese LGBTQ athletes, the Beitong Center established in 2008 provided a safe space for the community, and had deep ink in terms of consulting, domestic violence and cross -sex equity advocacy. She said: "For the gay movement, it is important to have a safe space, because in the early days of China, when the LGBTQ community office activity, it was stressed in space issues The group can go, and when you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help. This is a very basic service in the gay movement. "

In addition to providing a safe space, Beitong is also a "very stable" role in China LGBTQ athletes. Lu Xinjie added: "When many groups may suffer different pressures, the North Tong Center has always been there, so for Chinese athletes, the North Tong Center stops operations and will make them feel more desperate."

She also mentioned that in the past few years, many Chinese LGBTQ groups, including Beitong Center, intend to terminate operations because they will be concerned as long as they do activities. However, when they want to terminate operations, the Chinese government has repeatedly stopped them from doing so. Lu Xinjie pointed out that the main reason is that the Chinese government believes that once these LGBTQ groups announce the termination of operations, related incidents will cause public discussion. She said: "This is very hard for operators. They can't do things and have to stay there. Now it seems that they have made a decision, but I believe they will find different spaces to continue to promote what they want to do. Work."

Andy also mentioned that because of the earliest establishment of the Beibei Center, the services it launched often promoted LGBTQ institutions in other regions to follow up. He told DW: "In recent years, they have turned to this piece of spiritual consultation, and this field should look very safe. They provide consulting services through friendly psychologists who are friendly to the LGBTQ community, so even if the North Tong Center is closed, these are The service should still exist. "

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-16T06-43-00Z/49864187_401.jpg)Both Andy and Lu Xinjie said that they believed that the Chinese LGBTQ athletes could finally find a way to break through the status quo after working hard for so long and advance the entire movement to the areas that the Chinese authorities are difficult to control.

### Where do you go from the Chinese gay movement?

The LGBTQ organizations across China have been under pressure to be put on pressure by the Chinese government. However, Andy believes that the communication of the LGBTQ community will not disappear because of this, and community members will come up with more and more new activities and communication forms. He said, "On the surface, it feels that the policy has tightened, but this development may be a good reminder for friends of the LGBTQ institution, that is, they need to change their ideas. When the policy has changed, it is more flexible. "

Lu Xinjie also believes that although the termination of the operation of the Beibei Center is a great impact for many people, and the space for LGBTQ exercise can also be more limited, from other perspectives, the LGBTQ movement of China now has lost one of one The clear land is not an absolute bad thing. She told DW: "Now the Chinese authorities are to monitor all kinds of roles they think they will cause social turmoil. Therefore, a specific space will allow the government . If this community becomes a relatively flowing state, I think that in the current atmosphere of China, the LGBTQ movement can produce more appearance, which may not necessarily be bad. "

Both Andy and Lu Xinjie said that they believed that the Chinese LGBTQ athletes could finally find a way to break through the status quo after working hard for so long and advance the entire movement to the areas that the Chinese authorities are difficult to control. Andy said: "There are so many comrades' communities, everyone must have different needs. These things will not continue to operate because of a government policy."

Japanese Prime Minister Kishita Kishita became the cover of the American "Time" magazine. Experts believe that through playing a more aggressive role on the global stage, Japan hopes to achieve "normal country", but it will never become a "military power."

The Voice of America reported on Tuesday (May 16) that Kishida Wenxiong became the cover character of the American "Times" magazine for the first time. The magazine's listing date is May 22 to 29. Some articles have been published on the Internet. However, relevant people from the Japanese government revealed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan believes that the title of the online version of the article is inconsistent with the content, and it has made opinions to the "Times" magazine.

On the afternoon of May 11th, "Time" magazine will be the title of the online article from the original "The Prime Minister Kishida Wenxiong has abandoned many years of peaceism, so that your country becomes a real military country", and change to "The Prime Minister Kishida Prime Minister Jean of Peacefulness Japan. "MINISTERFUMIO KISHIDA Is Giving A Once Pacifist Japan A More Assertive Role On theglobal Stage".

Hiroshishiratori, a professor at the Public Policy Research Division of Japan, said that the role of Japan on the international stage is definitely not military -oriented, but for economic support, disaster, humanitarian assistance, etc. Representative country of order.

He said to VOA: "Kishida Wenxiong advocates strengthening national defense, which is very different from the impression of Japan in the past. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the so -called 'military power'.

Xie Wensheng, an expert in Japan -China Relations and CEO of the Taiwan Oasis Cultural and Education Foundation, pointed out in an interview that "not only Kishida Wenxiong, but even the former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the main power of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party has tried to limit the defense capabilities by limiting the defense capabilities. The "constitutional amendment ', and the two levels of the" permanent member of the country' "in the United Nations Security Council to realize the" normalization of Japanese countries'. "

Former U.S. Marine Corps, Grantnewsham, senior researcher at the Japan Strategic Research Forum, believes that Japan should realize "normally nationally" as soon as possible and play its due role on the international stage because Japan has been in the past 75 years internationally internationally. The persistence of order is an important model of maintaining the entire Asian and even global peace and stability, and believes that Japan will become a "military power". It is nonsense.

He told the Voice of America: "Japan cannot hurt other countries with military power at all, and Japan does not have such an idea. On the contrary, Japan has already played an important model for the dictatorship of self -defense. Come out is not only for its own national interests, but also for the interests of the free world. "

New Onerum said the original title of "Time" magazine described the Kishida Cabinet as an aggressive "military power", and even chose a photo of Kishida Wenxiong as a cover like a underworld as a cover, which is very inconsistent. exist [](https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/qi-guo-ji-tuan)This online article was puzzling before the Hiroshima Summit.

He said that the G7 countries and most European countries identify Japan's efforts to maintain peace and alert China's threat in Asia. Therefore, NATO may set up the first office in Asia in Tokyo.

Newerm also believes that NATO's establishment of offices in Japan does not have a immediately military effect, but this measure will bring important political meanings.

He said: "This means NATO, that is, most European countries regard Japan as allies, and even democratic countries in other Pacific regions, especially South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, which have participated in the NATO summit last time. In the threat of autocratic regimes, the democratic countries in Europe and Asia first expressed their positions to be consistent. Next is to gradually increase defense cooperation that gradually increases the threat of the autocratic regime. "

Newer said that the current military strength that Britain, France, and Germany can provide in the Indo -Pacific region are very limited. Through the establishment of the office's political measures, the cooperation with the Indo -Pacific countries will be smoother in the future. He pointed out that China's protest just confirmed that NATO's idea of establishing a office in Japan is correct, because it indicates that China has been stressful.

China and the Soviet Union are the two neighbors in the world with the longest land border. In 1964, the first round of border negotiations in China and the Soviet Union failed. In June 1969, the Central and Soviet troops broke out in the Treasure Island of the Uranus River in the Jiehe River (the picture shows the Chinese defense of the Treasure Island), and both sides have casualties. In the same year, the two countries conflict again on Basai Island, Heilongjiang and Tielekti, Xinjiang. In September, the Chairman of the Soviet Minister's Meeting, Koshin, took the road to Beijing and met with Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai for 3 hours at the airport to achieve a consensus to maintain the status quo and avoid armed conflicts.

 After Brezhnev served as the leader of the CPSU, Sino -Soviet relations were still in a confrontation. After the Chinese Cultural Revolution began in 1966, almost all exchanges between the two countries. In 1967, the Red Guards hit the Soviet Embassy in Beijing.

### Resisting the Moscow Olympics

After entering the 1970s, China began to improve relations with Western countries led by the United States. In 1972, Nixon's visit to China opened the door to China's opening to the international community. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was severely sanctions and confrontation due to invasion of Afghanistan.

### From good neighbor to strategic partner

After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, China announced that Russia was the heirs of the Soviet Union. The highest levels of the two countries began to recover. In 1999, the "List of Two Sections on the East and West of the Sino -Russian Boundary Line" was signed. After Pujing came to power in 2001, Russia signed the "Treaty of China -Russia and Russia's Neighbors and Friendship Cooperation" to determine the strategic collaboration partnership of equal trust. In 2010, the two countries confirmed the "comprehensive strategic collaboration partnership".

After entering the new thousand years, with the increase in economic strength, Beijing and Moscow intend to play a more active role on the international stage. The multilateral platforms such as the BRICS Summit and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (established in 2002) provided opportunities for this.

### Friendship of Political Strong Man

Xi Jinping and Putin, the two authoritative authoritarian leaders, have similar political beliefs of a large country. While firmly consolidating its own power, they also hope to break the existing international order led by the United States.

### is not an ally, it looks like an ally

Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war in February 2022, Russia has been sanctioned and isolated internationally. However, China has always refused to condemn Russia's aggression, and accusing the United States and NATO in charge of conflict, opposing sanctions, and calling on the "security concerns" of Russia. At the same time, China has greatly expanded imports from Russia, especially energy imports. In March 2023, Xi Jinping visited Moscow and became the first head of head of the Ukrainian war since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war.

After flying over 8,000 kilometers, he packed the bullet -proof helmet, bullet -resistant and vest bands in the bag. Taiwan Youth Yao Guan came to Ukraine under the beacon and joined the ranks of the International Volunteer Army. This is his first visit to Europe. The shocking sound and killing blood were filled with memory. As soon as he was free, he wrote down the battlefield diary. The dense text made people have a sense of urgency.

"When I got up, I found that the chest pain was serious. By yesterday, there was no explosion, but there were sporadic attacks." He wrote so when the army resting in April last year, "I can also take a short break." Although People have returned to Taiwan, and his mobile phone tablecloth still has a photo of team members. The conversation with each other is always inseparable from the war.

Dawn on February 24, 2022, Russian President Putin ordered the army to attack Ukraine. For more than this year, volunteers from all over the world have been fighting side by side with the Ukraine. About ten volunteers in Taiwan have embarked on the front line. Set off for half a month of the war, and set off at the helmet, with a striking "Taiwan Willhelp", which illustrates his original intention: "If such a thing happened today, I hope that people can do something before, what can we do, what can we do? Prove that we are worthy of help, or we are willing to help others. "

After the 80s, Lu Zihao and Li Chengli also chose to take the opposite direction of escape. Lu Zihao brought materials from Taiwan to refugee camps. "I didn't think so much, but in the past. There will be a voice of Taiwanese people in the corners. "He noticed that the front line needed to help, and instead applied to join the Volunteer Army. Li Chenglong submitted an application for the early days of the war. The awareness of crisis strengthened his decision. "Ukraine's combat experience is valuable for Taiwan because Taiwan has no combat experience for 50 years."

The Taiwanese fought for Ukraine. Zeng Shengguang in the post -90s gave a clear answer. "I came here because I want to bring some experience back to Taiwan and defend my country, but I must help Ukraine first." Answer his comrades, and he was curious to ask what happened in Taiwan? He saw the threat of scared by the opposite shore, "China wants to invade Taiwan."

Zeng Shengguang's mother, Su Yurou, red eyes and eyes watched this video repeatedly. "He slid his phone to see me, he said, Mom, you see that they are innocent people." She talked about the mother and son's conversation. If you come over, he said, we are in other thoughts, then you are also innocent people. "

"People need help, do I say that there is one of you? We have a little dispute." Su Yurou didn't want his son to go to the battlefield on the battlefield, "I am just a ordinary mother, ordinary mother." She just finished speaking. Tears couldn't stop slipping.

This group of international volunteers who assisted Ukraine came from all walks of life. Just like after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the Ukrainian recruitment propaganda film confession was confession. The soldiers hiding in the trenches said: "I am a young son at home." Then a soldier in the camp said: "I am a bus driver." Then a young man who was about to join the army said, "I'm about to get married" Essence They did not make an appointment to protect their love and home.

The fluorescent light and strong toughness of the civilians deeply hit Lu Zihao's heart. He helped in the vegetable market since he was a child, cut pork and sell pork, and later went to work in the Australian farm. Occasionally, he had the opportunity to pick up a shotgun. Yao Guanjun was born in a Chinese medicine family. He has been engaged in the coffee industry for nearly ten years and is also a member of the reserve soldier counseling center. Before Li Chengli went to Ukraine, he was a Uber dealer. However, he used to be a professional soldier. He served as a shooter of a 40 dotooing shotgun in the Marine Corps and also joined the French foreign corps. They were assigned to different theater, from Kharkiv, Izium, Lyman to Kherson, the front was thousands of kilometers long.

The International Corps of the International Corps of Lu Zihao belongs to the 49th Camp of the Ukrainian Army Karlba. He trained with the volunteers of various countries in Kyiv. Because the military base was blown up, he had to learn various guns and disassembled groups in private houses. And battlefield medical care. "Every day, the enemy is constantly firing artillery shells, even if he sleeps, there will be artillery." He still remembers the violent line of fire in eastern Ukraine. "The missile was exploded in front of us.

"I don't think I'm afraid to be deceiving." Lu Zihao admitted, "Everyone is scared, but we will still go to the front line to help." He took a sunrise photo in the Wudong area. Live, "Every day, we all hope to have a ceasefire day."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T08-55-00-04-00/000003.png)After the outbreak of the war, Lu Zihao (first from the right) purchased the supplies to the refugee camp, and later joined the ranks of the International Volunteer Army. (Provided by Lu Zihao) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/tebiejiemu/tw-05152023164505.html/3-1.jpg)This is the desire of peace in the battlefield, and it is also the earnest expectation of waiting for the return of the family back. "This is the bullet holes." Su Yurou couldn't hide the trembling tone, and the bullet wiped the battle backpack of Zeng Shengguang. "When we received a call from him, it was either the sound of the air defense (air strike alert), or the sound of guns, the sound of the agency, I would Will be nervous, what's the sound of Shengguang? He said shells. "Kupiansk, the front -line city of Ukraine, is a strategic hub locked by the Russian army. The International Corps of Li Chengli has been stationed here to counterattack. "One Aber will drive. Killing him on the fire. "He witnessed the people who were not inchless and killed on the spot." A car was full of bouncing holes, and a pool of blood flowed on the ground. "

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T08-55-00-04-00/000004.png)Li Chengli, who was born in a professional soldier, was assigned to Wudong front line to assist regular army operations. (Provided by Li Chengli) [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/tebiejiemu/tw-05152023164505.html/4.jpg)In the blink of an eye, it was spring, and the war was still continuing. According to the statistics of the UN High Commissioner's Office (Ohchr), from February 24, 2022 to April 9, 2023, Russia's invasion of Ukraine had killed 8,490 civilians and 14,244 injuries. This Number of dead injuries is just the tip of the iceberg because the organization has limited channels entering the theater.

The anger was also burning. On the occasion of the anniversary of the war of the Russian and Ukrainian war, people from all over the country took the streets to ask Russia to stop war, hold up the Avatar of Putin's war criminals, and complain about the atrocities of invading the door. In late March, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia at a high profile. When he talks with Putin at the Kremlin, he said that "the towering trees of Sino -Russian relations will be more leafy." To solve the Ukraine crisis through peace talks, one month later, Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Zelei Call also showed "persuasion and talk." Instead of invasion, adopt a vague "neutral" strategy.

** The national flag resolves spy storm **

For the Taiwan Volunteer Army, Chinese factor is a topic that they cannot dodge. "I encountered political problems over there, greater than the issue of our military (skills)." Do you support the Communist Party of China? Do you know the relationship between China and Putin? "Before the review passed, he was once suspected that it was a spy, and the national flag he carried with him finally resolved his doubts that he was" Russia ".

The Chinese and international students living in Ukraine also noticed the complicated pressure of public opinion. "Their reaction is the most real." Yao Guanjun mentioned his own experience. "I even encountered that I dare not say that I am Chinese, saying that I am Japanese or South Korea. people."

Volunteers of various countries are also curious about the situation and current situation of Taiwan. "Taiwan has been suppressed by China for a long time." Lu Zihao has repeatedly obstructed Taiwan's participation from international beauty pageants and sports events to the World Health Organization. They are bullied by big powers "and" If China invades Taiwan, we will fight side by side with you. "

In August 2022, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Perosi visited Taiwan, and China moved to the liver. Lu Zihao returned to Taiwan from Ukraine, and his mobile phone jumped out of the message of his comrades -in -arms. Zero is still on the front line. He noticed that the Chinese Communist Party of China has occupied the local major media sections of Taiwan's military exercises. "Ukrainians know that Taiwan's situation is similar to them."

However, there were more than half a year. In April this year, Taiwan President Cai Yingwen visited the United States and met with the new House of Representatives McCarthy. China once again fought for military aircraft, destroyers and aircraft carriers to provoke the Taiwan Strait exercises, and geopolitical risks continued to heat up.

Yao Guanjun's volunteer army also asked him to go back to protect his homeland. "Old Communist plane comes. They think that this is an invasion, which is exactly the same as Russia put troops on the Ukrainian border." 'Today Hong Kong, Tomorrow, Taiwan', or "Today's Ukraine Tomorrow, Taiwan ', they are aware of this."

Not only did the military uniform stick to the Taiwan flag, Yao Guanjun also put three national flags in the military backpack. "If I hang it, I have at least one national flag can be covered on the coffin." I do n’t want to die unknown. No one knows who I am. When I die, people are said to be the CCP. "

There is a national flag wall in front of Kiev's Independence Square. Ryanrouth from the United States hangs the national flags participating in the International Corps on the wall. "He asked me if I had the Taiwan flag, I said yes, he said he wanted it. "Li Chengli said the flag without saying a word, and at the same time helped to nail. This wall represents the volunteers of more than 50 countries and Ukraine standing on the same front. The national flag also records the number of participating and deaths. Behind the numbers is respectful and regrettable.

On November 2, 2022, Zeng Shengguang was injured and killed while fighting with the Russian army in the Wudong area. He asked his mother to say sorry to his mother. Su Yurou rushed to Ukraine to send his son for the last journey. "I don't blame you, I really feel proud of you."

"A local mother in Ukraine, she kept saying thank you, she said that my son was brave, thank you for helping him to help and protect their children." At this moment, Su Yurou deeply realized why the Ukraine people must resolutely resist. "They can't always keep it all the time In a state of being oppressed, they must stand up to protect their country. "

Su Yurou put his son's frontline equipment and photos full of the house, and still stabbed his son's portrait on his arm. She often asked him if he often asked him? Do you think mom? The pain of the heart of heartbreaking and lungs made her realize the cruelty of the war. "For every mother, this is a fatal blow, so I really don't want war."

To her, the conflict between the Taiwan Strait is no longer a matter of incident. Said, "I don't want us to go to the situation of Ukraine."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T08-55-00-04-00/000006.png)At the end of last year, the Taiwan Volunteer Army had sacrificed during the battle with the Russian army.

The Russian and Ukraine War began to awaken the awareness of the crisis of Taiwanese. Civil groups were in full swing to promote defense courses. After returning to Taiwan, the Volunteer Army also actively participated in civil defense activities.On this day, Lu Zihao and Li Chenglong participated in the folk defense lectures. Not only Taiwanese, the Ukraine also came to exchange. Lai Jiashan, a Ukrainian who lived in Taiwan, was moved to watch the Taiwanese defending her hometown of Halkef. She said in fluent Chinese. "After the war, most Ukraines began to resist China, and many people began to say that they would not buy Chinese products anymore."

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T08-55-00-04-00/000007.png)Returning from the battlefield, the Taiwan Volunteer Army continued to participate in the support of Ukraine. (Agencelet) [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/duomeiti/tebiejiemu/tw-05152023164505.html/7.jpg)In fact, this war was a confrontation between totalitarian and democratic camps. Li Chengli talked a robe from Xinjiang. He was detained in a concentration camp. Later, he fled China and settled in Europe. "In fact, there are also Russians in us. Many Russians help Ukraine because this is not the war they want." Lu Zihao said, "Everyone said that this is a war of Putin alone."

What do Taiwan want to learn from Ukraine? "Whether the People's Liberation Army dares to come today depends on whether we are prepared. Our army's preparations and national defense awareness are not strong enough and thick enough." Yao Guanjun reminded, "Like we were trained for two weeks when we were in the battle of Kiev, When you go to the battlefield, you will still be afraid. You will feel that these training is not enough. Taiwan does have a relationship with the rise of the enemy's situation. You must step up to prepare. "

Yao Guan took out a small Bible with blood from his pocket. This Bible accompanied him through the smoke and warfare. "I don't know whose blood has been stained. I am lucky to survive. Staying my life, I must hope that I can help more people. "He felt a lot and said," Your own country does not save it by himself, who will save you? "

Me: I have known this incident on April 9th. I have been thinking about these every day. I read an article written by Slavoj žIžek today ("[](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/dalai-lama-tongue-controversy-cultural-confusions-by-slavoj-zizek-2023-04?barrier=accesspaylog)"), I will send you the link, maybe you have read it. Zizek is a very important intellectual in the world today. He mentioned the perspective of orientalism in the article, talked about cultural differences, etc. He said such a paragraph: "Now we have seen the Dalai Lama as a '" Other ". He cannot be simplified into a person like us. His highly sexual interpretation of his funny moves reflects the insurmountable gap in cultural understanding. "(Another translation" Another translation "I give you everything, left the tongue for you". It was simplified to the same 'other ", and he was separated from us with an unable to cross the abyss. Western observer adopted a highly' sexual" explanation of him, reflecting the insurmountable cultural understanding of the cultural understanding. ")

This is one of the personal translations on Twitter, and I also commented on this. I said: This comments on "Others" make me think of the significance of the Dalai Lama for "internal", including this incident, because "internal" or "internal" "internal", I mean The feelings of the people in the domestic people are completely different. Instead, they think that they are "very good". They do not see the fate of the His Holiness, but they see a lot of laws from the Chinese network that attacked His Holiness. Therefore It is regarded as "our blessing" and is a certain kind of profound auspiciousness.

** (I send a picture to my friend, the Tibetan text above is a Tibetan teacher in the Andad area recently. Huang Yicheng, who studied for a master's degree and the participants of the "White Paper Movement" ****/Karma Sittacin, wrote: "On April 10, a middle school in Aba Prefecture was in the early class in Aba Prefecture. Where all teachers and students gathered, a Tibetan teacher said that recent photos of the Dalai Lama can often be seen on the Chinese Internet. This is the "very good origin ', so he was arrested and persecuted." The teacher said: "Recently, a short video of His Holiness Dalai Lama and a little Indian boy appeared on the Internet in China. Seeing his photos, this is also our blessing. This is a good sign of His Holiness Dalai Lama who can return to Tibet quickly. Please ask all teachers and students to make good wishes and pray to see the His Holiness. Originally, his original. The short video is made by people who don't like him in his heart, but he is a Buddha, so he will not be contaminated. "According to media reports, the teacher was detained for two weeks and was released but was expelled.) **

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T09-00-00-04-00/000001.png)Tibetan talked about a Tibetan teacher in the territory because of the arrest of the Dalai Lama. (The picture is taken from Twitter) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023135426.html/56708rfa535a5ba22-002.jpeg)Friends: Yes, what you said is very right. We must look at it from two levels, on the one hand, the West, on the one hand, China. In fact, the thinking of the nationalism of the Han Dynasty is not surprising. Although many Chinese people also talk about democracy, freedom and equality, they are the Han nationalists. I have met such Chinese people in China and Europe. They oppose the Communist Party against totalitarian, but they are very narrow nationalists. The democracy and freedom they want are considered from the positions of the Han people without considering other ethnic groups. This is contrary to the concept of the "Republic" they claim. Since it is claimed to be "republic," all nations should be equal, and equality is universal value and is pursued by the world. If you do n’t need to “republic”, then you are you and me, this is the path of nationalism. If you are more excessive, it is the road of racism.

In India, I think it is the cause of sexual system. caste systemm(Caste System)Essence In India, the Dalai Lama has a great impact. So the nationalists in Indian denominations do not like His Holiness. However, in the religions of India, there are almost no people like the Dalai Lama, so they will have some jealousy and have no sense of culture. There are too many nations in India and a lot of religion. The relationship between each other is complicated, but I don't think there are much problems. They are just a system of surnames.

I emphasize it again: The Dalai Lama has a great influence and is a world -class influence. If it is an Iranian politician, he will not have any response or discussion. But the Dalai Lama will attract the attention of the world and become a cultural phenomenon. Of course, it is not only this incident to become a cultural phenomenon. The previous things related to the Dalai Lama will become a cultural phenomenon. The Dalai Lama's actions are often a topic of global discussions. The Pope of Roman can't do it, and the news of the Pope of Roman is only a local news rather than the world.

In general, in this incident, there are two critics in the West, one is right, like Trump's supporters, they are real racists. They do not like other religious and other ethnic groups. They only have one Christian And a white person; one is the left and does not like religious leaders. Their thought is very close to communism. But for most people, especially those who like, understand, and support the respect of the respects have not changed. They may not understand at first, and they are not understood by culture, but they understand after explaining. So this incident is a cultural phenomenon.

Why do I think this incident is good? This is because many Tibetans actually live in a bubble, thinking that they support us all over the world, which is actually not like this. After living in the West for a long time, you will know that supporters are just part. This time it is even more clear: those who support will be supported as always, and what people who do not support it will be exposed, so we are no longer a virgin virgin, we are mature, Innocentis Lost!(Lost innocence), I think this is the meaning of Tibetan.The Dalai Lama is a cultural phenomenon. Not only the cultural phenomenon of Tibet, but also the cultural phenomenon of the world. However, we once believed that such a cultural phenomenon may attract Westerners, so they will also get their help. In fact, there are not many. It turned out that there was no other thing in the future. And economically not much help. We may feel very good before, thinking that everyone in the world likes us, but now we will know who likes who doesn't like it. So I think this is a very good thing.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T09-00-00-04-00/000002.png)His Holiness Dalai Lama has an intimate interaction with many people, including the British King Charles III. (The picture is taken from Facebook) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/weiseblog/ws-05152023135426.html/56708rfa535a5ba22-003.jpeg)I had such an idea when I first came to the West, including the idea of Tibetan scholars. In fact, those Tibetan tibetans have his own consideration. So these two weeks, we have all have such a knowledge: you Westerners, no matter how you learn Tibetan, you don't understand our Tibetan thoughts. Of course we do the same. For example, I have lived in the West for decades and I do not necessarily understand all Westerners. However, this is not important. The important thing is to communicate and the diversification of culture. Today's world is not like that, you live here, I live there. If we do not accept diversification, we will encounter many difficulties, many problems. Culture is equal. Whether culture is right, we can discuss it, but the Dalai Lama is a cultural phenomenon. If you think that criticizing and even slandering the Dalai Lama is his own affairs, this is wrong, because it is aimed at the cultural phenomenon of all Tibetans, so scolding all Tibetans and all Tibetan hearts.

In fact, there is no Oriental like the Dalai Lama who will become a topic and discuss in Western society for a long time. Maybe Gandhi is one. But Gandhi has no Internet and no self -media, and many Westerners do not know him. The Dalai Lama is different. In the past, I didn't believe that the Dalai Lama would have such a great influence and doubt, but from this, it can be seen that the Dalai Lama's influence is too great. In the entire Western society, almost everyone knows the Dalai Lama whether adults or children. But you ask who Xi Jinping is on the street, not necessarily many people know. I do n’t know who Iran ’s religious leaders are, and few people discuss topics related to him. Therefore, the Dalai Lama really transcends the boundaries of religion, the boundaries of culture, and the boundaries of the times. This is a very amazing thing. For example, one million people oppose him, but there will be one million people who protect him to support him. So who else will this in the world? No. I don't remember which Asians have such a great influence.

If the Dalai Lama is gone one day, it will be coming at this moment. Because culture exists, cultural phenomena will exist, and the Dalai Lama's remarks and ideas will exist. In fact, this incident is a test of the West this time. ** The crime of innocent!Crime blame!Popularized humiliated!** This is the image of the Dalai Lama. They are also talking about the injured. The energy of the injured is very large. At first, people thought that the little Indian boy was the injured, and now more and more think that the Dalai Lama is the injured. And people remember the injured. Especially innocent injured. Oh, the weather today is very good.

Me: You are very exciting and very inspiring to me. Your vision is farther and the perspective is wider, so I think it is great. Our discussion is very meaningful. It should be good if it is sorted into an article.

I also had Lord Coto (Hong Kong writer Pazu Potato, who has opened a cafe in Lhasa, has traveled through many places in Tibet, wrote books about Tibet, lived in Tibet for many years, learned Tibetan language and learned Buddhism. Last year, he got it. Discussion at the University of Hong Kong). You know he is now in Hong Kong. Regarding the incident of the Dalai Lama on the Internet bullying, he wrote several articles in a row, mainly technical analysis and language analysis. For example, he analyzed these technical processing videos emerging from the Internet. Some videos are poor, but what is the intention of the producers? It may not only be to attract the attention, so the analysis of Uncle Potato is also very exciting.

In addition, not only Chinese in the Chinese world, but also Hong Kong people and Taiwanese. So what are their ideas? There are also the thoughts of the Buddhists, and so on. These are very interesting, that is, you suddenly find that the world is particularly diverse, and there are all kinds of people and various voices. As you just said, no one else may be so widespread like the Dalai Lama, and everyone has their own position to discuss it.

I also said to Uncle Potato that there are so many religions in Asia, including India, and none of them are like Garva Rinpoche. As a refugee and an exile from the grabbing Tobert, they are so like the world today. Wide and long -lasting attention.

We may also pay attention to refugee issues. In this 21st century, refugee issues are globalization, and all countries have the existence of refugees, including the culture of refugees and the conflict of strong culture. The Dalai Lama has become refugees from the day when she had to escape from Lhasa on March 17, 1959. At the age of 24, he became a refugee, and now he is almost 90 years old. His Holiness may be one of the oldest refugees in the world, or one of the saying. A refugee will become the focus of global attention, the topic of the world's discussion, why is this? In fact, this problem is very interesting, and we are intellectuals after all. We need to study to analyze to discuss writing. At this time, we must not be just a Buddhist. We also have the identity of intellectuals and this is very important. (Serial)

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T09-03-31-04-00/000000.png)Fang Bin, deputy director of the Institute of Military Political Work of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05152023095003.html/@@images/image)Baidu Encyclopedia  [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05152023095003.html/@@stream)Our previous article "The content of the article in Liu Asia 22 years ago made the patriotic soldiers desperate to death" was reproduced by Literature City, a netizen signed "TW1234" published a comment: See how evil this party is. : "Three thousand people have been expelled from the party, military membership, and repatriated to their hometown to plant land. Some people are designated as traitors and sentenced. In the Cultural Revolution, 3,000 people were criticized, and farmers could not be spared. That is: "Three days of hard fighting, suffering for thirty years. "

Netizens who signed the "THERIVER1" provided Liu Yaia's "Golden Gate Campaign Review" in the article. The netizen said: In fact, Liu Asia has decorated a lot for the Turkish powder in the book, which is a hundred times more cruel than this!The prisoners of war returned at the time were all used as criminals and forced to expose each other!The most typical of these is Sun Shuliang, the former director of the Political Department of the 244th Regiment. Sun Shuliang was caught by framed others. As a result, many returned personnel were sentenced to imprisonment. The sentence was sentenced to 5 years, but Sun Shuliang was not punished, which aroused the public anger of the returned personnel and reported that Sun Shuliang's weak behavior in Taiwan was reported. As a result, Sun Shuliang was also sentenced to 5 years in prison!

In addition to being sentenced, there are also shot. In June 1951, the first batch of shot was shot, Li Ziyuan, the head of the 3rd Battalion of the 253th regiment, was detained in Nanjing Shuiximen to perform the gun decision. The guards on the execution ground were strict. If you have the achievements of the revolution, the organization comes forward to pay the coffin and burial. Li Ziyuan led the 3 battalion in the castle near the high bunker east of Linde in the Golden Gate battle. After the ammunition was shining, it would be given to death in vain. 17 people put down their weapons.

As for the number of prisoners of war returned to the mainland after the entire army of the Kinmen battle of the Kinmen, some netizens said that only more than 600 people were released. However, another netizens retorted and said: You were repatriated in 1950, and a total of 3,000 people were repatriated in 1952. The total number of captured the PLA was 5,175.

The author has found a lot of information, and the number of Kinmen prisoners of war returned to the mainland is that there are more than less, but the number of captured total is 5,175. It can be seen that the number of "more than 4,000 people captured by the Golden Gate Campaign" in writing the "Golden Gate Battle Review" was not accurate.

The previous article in our column introduced the articles such as the "Golden Gate Campaign Review" and other articles 20 years ago in the "Youth Soldiers" who read Liu Asia. The nation is self -prolonged, bowed to knees, praised hegemonism, and praised Chinese enemies. Some people in Mainland Chinese and recognized by the Chinese Army, which are recognized by the Chinese Communist Party, have also been criticized with chaos. He said: After Liu Ren's school's political commissar, a number of experts and scholars in the military had been known to the military. A major general is called the "Eagle School", but it also proposed that "saving the United States is to save China", from the National University of China; during the Russian and Ukraine War, it was said that Russia adopted a form of "abandoned by human civilization". The surname of the surname also came from the National University of China; the Americans had the help of aliens, and made China believe that it was favorable. This ridiculous style of Liu is not only not criticized, but also considered "eclectic use of talents."

The "Gong named school" here undoubtedly refers to Gong Bin.

Speaking of which, the Gongfang Bin University was really "net" from Liu Yaia into the National Defense University. Before the end of 2012, Gongbin was also a deputy director of the Institute of Political Work of the Military Sciences of the PLA and researcher. At the time, Liu Ya, the political commissar of the National Defense University, appeared in person to persuade Liu Chengjun, then the dean of the Military Academy of Military Sciences.

The Gongfang Bin said that he was a professor at the National Defense University, but he was a typical "self -learning talent". At that time, he became a soldier without even studying in high school. After his soldiers, he actually participated in the "border combat round" experience three times in a row. For the first time, the famous noise in the country was rated by the "Ten Outstanding Children" in 1984 by the "Half Moon". Before Liu Asia was going to the National Defense University, he had two first -class merits, three three -class merit, and a lot of award -winning experience with the PLA second -level British model.

A reporter in the PLA Daily, in a communication of Gongbin, the first sentence of the opening article was: "Gongfang Bin is a storytelling person." Before entering the National Defense University, he was included in the "Top Ten Most Popular Interview Guests" of the People's Daily Online in 2012, the "Top Ten Thoughts" of the People's Forum in 2013, and the "Most Popular Top Ten Interview Guests" in 2013. Sina.com's 2013 "Top Ten Grand Columnists", Beijing's 2015 "Top Ten theoretical Lecturers" and Beijing Evening News 2016 "Top Ten Annual Persons". Its popularity is higher than Liu Asia.

According to Gong Fang Bin himself, he published an article involving political reform before the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which had a great impact at home and abroad. The influence articles were named one of the "Top Ten Thoughts" in 2013 by the People's Forum.

The original title of this article published by Gong Fang Bin at the time was "New Political Viewpoint Innovation Point and Breakthrough". As soon as the article came out, it immediately aroused overseas attention. The central content of the focus on this "new political view" was "the system and system under the new political view should be designed, stipulating that the ruling party and its members exercise power and fulfill their responsibilities. ; And establish the political ethics of the ruling party: public power is given by the people, and the people have the right to deprive. " At the same time, the "People's Daily" set up under the official "People's Daily" of the Communist Party of China specially discussed the establishment of a forum on the establishment of a "new political outlook".

However, at that time, the contents of the article within the Communist Party of China and the military were strongly dissatisfied with the contents of the article of Cong Bin. At that time, a director of the Central Propaganda Department asked the army to deal with Gong Bin in the army on the grounds that "this article was reproduced by overseas reactionary websites". The National Defense University could not resist, and had to agree to "criticize" in a small area.

The next story was that the internal reference department of Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily at that time reflected the positive evaluation of the parties on this article. Gong Fang Bin was liberated.

However, according to the author, that is, from publishing this article, Gongbin, who was promoted to the future, could only stop in the rank of the college and the treatment of the duty.Gong Fang Bin said, "Think about it, what this will bring, you can imagine what Guo Xu has not been dismissed."

The next story is that Gongbin was criticized by the "General Army".

At that time, Liu Ya, the political commissar of the National Defense University, "reported" the paper to the Military Commission to discuss the statement. Xu Qiliang, then vice chairman of the Military Commission, even said "unknown".

After Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong settled down, they ended up with "notification criticism" of Gongfang Bin. At the end of 2014, Gongfang Bin published a short article "Xu Caihou Can't Shake the Spirit of our Army" in the Global Times. Zhang Yang, then director of the General Political Department, ordered the call to Liu Asia to ask three questions. Gong Fang Bin said in this article that when buying officials and selling officials, they bought them when they were sold.

As we all know, Zhang Yang was promoted by Xu Caihou at the time. After Liu Ya was dismissed by "Guo Xu", in a public speech, only he and Liu Yuan did not give Guo Boxiong and Xu Cai's thick in the military senior management. Even so, they once gave them because of Guo Xu's power. Give gifts.

Therefore, at this time, Liu Ya will also be paid for Zhang Yang, who will also accept the anti -corruption investigation, and directly answer Zhang Yang's subordinates: who are you talking for? You should ask yourself, Guo Xuliu has cleared it. The other party was speechless and returned. Gong Fang Bin recalled in the future: At that stage, there were indeed many upright leaders who protected me, so "accidental" was only in danger.

What makes Gongbin feel proud of is that at the future expansion meeting of the Military Commission in the future, Xi Jinping named him "Revelation of the Corruption Case of Gu Junshan" taught by the leadership class of the provincial ministries. Since then, "accidental" has been restored.

According to Gong Fang Bin himself, if it wasn't for this "accidental" experience at the time, he might have a future. He said, "So far, some people ask me if I regret it? Those who are familiar are that I just completed the study of the commander class of the National Defense University at that time, and I have the opportunity to meet a better tomorrow. I answered, as long as I have seen my experience, I have seen my experience, and I have seen my experience. I know that there is another opportunity, I still make the same choice. "In the future, I can only carry a big school shoulder seal for a long time. The sign on the shoulder will change. I answered that it is not me without talking. The leader also said that it would be too late to change the brand. I answered, put on a star, and two and three stars shining in front of my eyes. If Pursuing such a goal, you should never claim to be on the path of thought. From ancient times to the present, the path of thought has nothing to do with the official position and no utilitarian!"

The "leadership" here is Liu Asia.

Gongfang Bin also recalled in the future: "Actually, a previous leader was transferred to the main officer of the theater. He talked to me before the trip. He mentioned that the main leaders of the Military Commission learned several times to understand my situation and told me that it would be reused soon. The senior leaders he said to understand my situation for him because of his reasons. Before taking office, the classmates who were responsible for studying at the commander class of the National Defense University asked him to provide a consultation report about "Which important tasks should be launched first" (The classmate is the current general). The classmates know that I have been in the high -level internal reference for a long time, and many of them are adopted by the decision -making layers and decision makers, so please help me. I believe he reported my situation when he reported it. Special attention from the head. "

The "main leader of the Military Commission" mentioned here was the vice chairman of the Military Commission. At that time, Xu Qiliang, who presided over the ideological and political work of the army for Xi Jinping.

Xu Qiliang was born in the Air Force and was called the old leader by Liu Yaia. The two had a good personal relationship. When he was about to go to the National Defense University, Liu Ya was interested in the "model ideological work backbone" 10 years younger than himself. Outstanding military theory experts trained as his successor for his National Defense University Political Commissar. It can be imagined that Liu Asia should also say the beauty of Gong Bin in Xu Qiliang. The problem is, as Gang Fang Bin said: "It should be said that my prospects at that stage are extremely optimistic, and it is not doubtful at all. The question is that I am determined to embark on the road full of bumps and risks."

The story of the author's once heard about Gongbin is that he published the article "New Political Viewpoint Innovation Point and Breakthrough" on the eve of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. At that time, Wang Huning did recommend this article to Xi Jinping.

After this article was "reproduced by overseas reactionary website", after recruiting himself, Gong Fang Bin turned his brain and launched the article "The ideological connotation and theoretical foundation of Xi Jinping's new political view" on the People's Forum. In the process of exploring China's big country, we need a great politician to break through the party's self -transcendence and achieve the leaps of the nation with major theories, and this responsibility has fallen on Xi Jinping's shoulders. "

Next, Gongfang Bin wrote: "What challenges Xi Jinping faces, what must be surpassed? In short, neither Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were resolved or many major historical propositions that were not faced. The wisdom and courage of the home can be cracked. Mao Zedong did not solve the source of spiritual power other than class struggle. Deng Xiaoping did not solve the problem of distribution or interest sharing of interests after the rapid economic development. World. Only by solving both problems can the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation become a reality. "

Gong Fang Bin wrote in his article published seven years ago: Xi Jinping must effectively solve major problems that the two generations have not solved. Based on the ideological and theory of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, major innovation, or the breakthrough of revolutionary theory to governing theory, can solve the new situation, new problems, and new contradictions encountered by the Communist Party of China. Mao Zedong uses a cultural and social environment like China to complete the reality of the Chinese revolution using the advanced theory of Marxism introduced from the West. Deng Xiaoping explores the road on the basis of discovering the contradictions and problems in our past development, that is, still still, that is, it is still still It is carried out in a specific environment in China. Xi Jinping can no longer advance in such an environment. He wants to exceed the experience category of China ’s previous accumulated experience. Not only should you consider how China develops, but also how China and the world can develop in interaction, and even China can explore a more for the world to explore a more Good development road problem ... "

U.S. Financial Minister Yellen once again sent a letter to Congress on the eve of the meeting with McCarthy to confirm that the Ministry of Finance will not fulfill all the payment obligations to the government until early June, which will trigger the first debt defaults in the United States.

At present, about 150 countries and regions around the world have accepted Beijing financing bridge paving, airports, railway and hydropower plants.

Beijing stated that trade with Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Turkman, Uzbek and other countries came to $ 70 billion last year. In the first quarter of this year, it grew 22%compared with the same period last year.

The analysis circle stated that after the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, Central Asian countries have reflected on their long -term close relationship with Moscow, and began to seek economic, diplomatic and strategic protection from other forces, and the geographical situation further fell to Beijing.

The Observer Research Foundation, located in Mumbai, India. Researcher Ayjazwani told AF: "After the Russia invades Ukraine, Central Asian countries have begun to worry about their sovereignty."

Xi Jinping will host the "China-Central Asian Summit" in Xi'an, Shaanxi. Chinese official media said that this is the first time that this is the first time that Beijing and the five Central Asia have established diplomatic relations. The first time of the head of the Six Kingdoms has held a summit in a physical form, and it has a milestone in the history of the development of relations between China and China.

China said that Xi'an was the starting point of the ancient land road on land. More than 2100 years ago, the Western Han messenger Zhang Jian started to open up the West and East and East to the west, connecting the Silk Road in Asia and Europe, connecting China and Eurasia, and selecting the Central Asian Summit in Xi'an.

The summit is likely to be committed to pushing the huge traffic link between China and the five Central Asia. It includes the long -term and US $ 6 billion of the Sino -Jiwu Railway, and the expansion of Central Asia to China to China.

It has been a long time, saying that "China has consistent attitude towards Central Asia."

However, some analysts believe that China is more popular in the Central Asian elite class than in the Central Asian folks. Mainly, the investment that politicians are longing for are not necessarily paid by the people.

Li-Chen Sim, a scholar of the "Middle East Institute" (MEI), said that some problems were attributed to the "huge population and economic asymmetry" between countries and China.

She said that the infrastructure plan that China has funded failed to bring full employment opportunities for the local area and derived the heavy debt to Beijing, and also promoted the dissatisfaction of the Central Asian countries in the wild party in the wild party.

Professor Stefanhedlund, Professor of Uppsala University, Sweden, said that the anti -medium sentiment in some places has risen, "(this dissatisfaction) can be observed by the huge economic revenue, it is yet to be observed. "".

Dalham, a former federal prosecutor, said that the relevant investigations began under the circumstance where the evidence was insufficient and false. Dalham pointed out in his 300 -page survey report: "Whether it is a criminal investigation agency or an American intelligence agency, there seems to be no conclusive evidence that there is any secret agreement between the Trump team and the Russian side."

The special investigator appointed by Trump also said that the Federal Investigation Bureau obviously used dual standards. "Based on some intelligence, the Federal Investigation Bureau opened a related investigation during the election campaign based on some of the obliged, unsecured, and unconfirmed information, and the speed and method of the investigation were extremely distinctive. "Dalham also took the" dual standard "example of the Federal Investigation Bureau with the relevant investigation of Democrats Hillary Clinton. Dalham said that individual leaders of the Federal Investigation Bureau "have a strong hostility for Trump."

The background of the Federal Investigation Agency's relevant investigation is to clarify whether Moscow has tried to intervene in the 2016 US presidential election. Over the years of investigations have been in contact with the Trump campaign team with Russian representatives, and whether Trump himself has tried to obstruct the relevant investigation.

(Voice of Germany) According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in April, China's industrial production increased by 5.6%year -on -year, but it was still lower than expected. According to Germany, the market's expectations for industrial growth are close to 11%. Caixin.com reported that the base was low last year due to the outbreak of the epidemic in Shanghai, Jilin and other places in the same period of 2022.

The retail industry increased by 18.4%, which seemed to be obvious at first glance, but it was still lower than expected. According to Caixin reports, economists have a expected value of 21.5%. Bloomberg's expected value is 21.9%. The base was very low a year ago. At that time, the severe sealing measures under the epidemic had paralyzed many areas including Shanghai, including Shanghai. Now people gradually return to shopping malls and restaurants.

### Focus on employment issues: college graduates, migrant workers

The service industry is still slowly absorbing millions of rural labor for cities. The unemployment rate of the National Bureau of Statistics fell to 5.2%, and March was 5.3%.

In April, the State Council emphasized the stable employment market, especially "employment services such as key groups such as college graduates and migrant workers".

### economic growth slowed down

According to a report released by the Asian Development Bank in April this year, after the recovery of China's economy in 2021, China's economic growth in 2022 and 2023 will slow down. The reason is that the situation of low domestic demand has not improved. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund was further reduced to 4.4%of China's growth expectations on April 20. This number is far lower than the 5.5%target set by Beijing at the beginning of the year. The main reason is that China's anti -epidemic policies have adopted a tough clearance policy, and the extensive sealing of control affects economic activities, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated pressure on the Chinese economy.

### Poor travel for the public

Under the principle of "dynamic clearance" in Beijing, China hopes to minimize the risk of overseas infection cases. Therefore, strict entry and exit management restrictions have been adopted, and strict isolation must be accepted after entering the country. In China, once a case of diagnosis is found, large -scale nucleic acid testing and control will be implemented immediately. According to external predictions, health code and normalized ribin testing will become daily epidemic prevention in Chinese cities.

Shanghai and other cities have experienced several weeks of isolation, which not only allows many residents to face income loss, family separation, but also difficult to eat and see a doctor. Under the strict control of the epidemic, the public complained that the lack of people's biological supplies, the insufficient transportation of express logistics, and the lack of distribution in time, and the channels for people to see a doctor for medical treatment have also been restricted. During the seal of Xi'an, a pregnant woman was waiting for a long time outside the hospital due to the timeout of the nucleic acid test. The unfortunate abortion and myocardial infarction patients were died due to rejuvenation due to nucleic acid testing.

In the past two and a half years, China has further tightened the control of society. Recently, in Tianjin, some people were included in the "dishonesty list" on the grounds of evasion of nucleic acid testing because they did not participate in nucleic acid screening on time. Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights lawyer in the United States, believes that the Chinese government uses high -tech and other modern and effective monitoring technologies to conduct comprehensive surveillance and control of civil society. During the epidemic, the Chinese government also accumulated more experience in controlling social flow. It is expected that even if the epidemic is over, this set of epidemic prevention measures will continue.

###  Expert forecast will also implement more loose monetary policy

A spokesman for the China National Bureau of Statistics said that there is still room for residents' consumption capacity and increased consumption willingness.

At the same time, although the residents' consumer price index (CPI) only increased by 0.1%in April, the National Bureau of Statistics still stated that the current Chinese economy does not have shrinkage. A spokesman for the Bureau of Statistics said that the important reason for the low CPI is that service demand is still recovering. Driven by service consumption demand in the future, the CPI increase will return to a reasonable level.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-16T10-42-00Z/62550203_401.jpg)Although compared with last year, the consumption of the catering industry has rebounded, but compared with the pre -epidemic, the increase is not so obvious.

at the same time, [ ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济遭遇严重逆流-年轻人推迟购房计划/a-62044137)From January to April, cumulative decreased by 6.2%year-on-year. According to Caixin report, real estate investment in April fell 16.2%year -on -year, a significant expansion of 9 percentage points from March.

Germany's analysis said that in any case, low inflation allows the Central Bank of China to support the economy. On Monday, the central bank has released the signal to continue to maintain a loose monetary policy. Experts predict that the central bank will implement a more loose policy in the future.

However, the investigation rate of young people aged 16-24 recorded 20.4%, exceeding 19.9%in July 2022, the highest level since 2018.

"Relevant departments are currently actively introducing policies and targeted assistance." For young people's employment difficulties, a spokesman for the China National Bureau of Statistics, Fu Linghui, said that it is believed that with the gradualness of the policy effect, the employment situation of young people's employment situation said It will also gradually improve.

The China Economic Observer quoted Li Qiang, the vice president of the recruitment of Zhilian, said that the scale of college graduates has continued to rise in recent years. In addition, the previous unscrupulous groups left over in the past few years, the number of college students' job seekers continued to accumulate in 2023, and the "snowball" of employment pressure "snowball" The effect is obvious.

The report also quoted Zhang Chenggang, director of the China New Employment Studies Research Center of the University of Economics and Trade, believes that since 2020, the unemployment rate in China has continued to rise. This also means that "the unemployment rate of adolescents is already a medium- and long -term problem." He said, "the essence of the decline in job supply is caused by poor economic growth."

Lai Rongwei, assistant professor of the General Education Center of Longhua University of Science and Technology, was interviewed. For example, Guangdong Province issued a policy recently to call for 300,000 unemployed young people to go to the countryside to find a job. The increase in graduates is an inevitable trend in each country, but the supply surface of private enterprises can only be reduced without increasing. In this way, the unemployment will increase as soon as it disappears. "

The Chinese economy not only needs to "employment stable", but also faces the possibility of "shrinking". The National Bureau of Statistics of China recently announced that the April CPI rose by 0.1%, an increase of 0.7%in March. According to the sorting and latitude of Zhongxin, in April, the CPIs in 31 provinces in China all fell year -on -year. Among them, 7 provinces such as Shanghai and Liaoning have even more negative value, while Shanghai dropped from 0.9%in March to 1.1%, the largest decrease.

In addition, China's officially announced April producer price index(PPI)It fell 3.6%compared with the same period last year, a new low in the past three years. According to public opinion, China's manufacturing activities have weakened the pressure of industrial shrinkage.

Cheng Xiaonong, an economist in the United States, analyzed when interviewed by this station that China's CPI is currently rising slightly, reflecting the significant decline in PPIs where the cost of commodity production costs is changing, which is expected for future. From producer price index(PPI)Looking at, the Chinese economy will also shrink further: "China's middle class now adopts a collective action without organization to take out all the money of doing business, speculation, and stocks. A large number of borrowings in advance, whether it is a commercial loan or a real estate loan, because they are very optimistic about the economic prospects. "

At the same time, the People's Bank of China announced on the 15th that the "China Monetary Policy Implementation Report in the first quarter of 2023" emphasized that the current Chinese economy has not shrank.

The reason for the People's Bank of China is that the shrinking mainly refers to the continuous negative growth of prices, the amount of currency supply is also declining, and it is usually accompanied by economic recession. However, China's prices are still rising moderately, especially the core CPI is stable at about 0.7%year -on -year, M2(Visabular currency supply)The growth of social finances is relatively fast, the economic operation continues to improve, and it does not meet the characteristics of deflation.

"In the middle and long term, my country's economic supply and demand is generally balanced, the monetary policy remains stable, residents' inflation expectations are stable, and there is no basis for long -term contraction or inflation." The People's Bank of China comes to the above conclusions.

Cheng Xiaonong pointed out that China's official currency supply continues to expand, trying to put water to drive the economy, but after putting water, the money is just empty in the bank. He said that China's financial system is facing a new crisis. In addition to lending money to local governments to repay debts, he cannot find good loan customers. The conditions for maintaining the interest of the bank's loan collection are narrowing. Recently, the employees of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank have been severely cut off.

The price is still rising and the rise is not large, but the economic atrophy is fast. The situation actually means that the shrinking of the entire economy will accelerate. "Cheng Xiaonong said.On the other hand, Liu Yuhui, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, recently published an article in the First Finance and Economics that the slope and Kan facing the current Chinese economy have been "shrinking risks". In the past 14 months, M2 has increased by 37 trillion yuan, of which in the last two months It has increased by 9 trillion yuan and failed to prevent the approaching. He believes that "if domestic demand cannot find enough growth, the main contradiction faced by the entire economy is not 'swelling', but 'shrinking'."

Zhu Chengzhi, Chairman of Monetar Investment, said in an interview with this station that China's economy is not hot enough now, so money continues to deposit banks, and it may improve in the second half of the year. The economy is a mess.

"In the past two years, the mainland's economy is very cold. Now that the refrigerator has been opened, it has started a bit temperature. But the currency has not yet expanded pressure, because the economic vitality is not hot. Back to warm up, the people's money will be taken out. "Zhu Chengzhi said.

Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics of China, responded to the continued low operation of the CPI on the 16th that "the low price operation is staged, the current economy does not have a shrinkage, and the next stage will generally not shrink."

[](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/1-05162023110138.html/@@images/image)In the Associated Press, the information of the Associated Press has recently set up a fixed organized mechanism for organ transplantation with mainland China, and has caused social controversy. Based on Singapore's "Lianhe Zaobao" and Hong Kong "Ming Pao" reported that Lu Chongmao, director of the Hong Kong Medical and Health Bureau, revealed last week that the Hospital Administration will lead transplant experts to Guangdong Province to exchange for the formulation of organizational mutual assistance mechanisms for the two places. He also said that the data management system of organs donation in mainland China is very advanced, and the official hopes that this trip can strengthen the Hong Kong organ transplant industry's understanding of related systems. According to the Lianhe Zaobao reported on the 16th, Lugang cross -border transplant cooperation caused a lot of controversy in Hong Kong society. Some Hong Kong patients and medical organizations have different definitions of "death" in the mainland and Hong Kong, as well as different organs' donation monitoring and operating mechanisms. The biggest doubt of all parties is the issue of organ transplantation sources in the mainland. Many years ago, there have been rumors that the donation of mainland organs involves organ trading. The news of cross -border "sharing" organ transplantation has also caused some concerns of Hong Kong people. Some Hong Kong donors will withdraw from the donation plan because they are unwilling to send organs to the mainland, which will eventually affect the chances of organ obtaining organs in Hong Kong. In December of last year, Hong Kong introduced the mainland organs to Hong Kong for the first time for cross -border transplantation. According to Lu Chongmao, when visiting Beijing in March this year, he had set up a preliminary plan with the mainland on the organizational assistance mechanism. In April, he also visited China to visit the Chinese human organ distribution and sharing computer system (COTRS). Over the years, reports on conscience of conscience and Uyghur organs in mainland China have continued, and international human rights agencies have been questioned the huge differences between China ’s annual number of organs and huge actual transplant organs.

US President Biden is scheduled to meet with Congress leaders such as the White House today. US Treasury Secretary Janetyellen was alert yesterday. The U.S. government is likely to be in cash on June 1, which means that it will not be able to perform debt repayment obligations, and it may break out of destructive debt defaults.

China, which has been "closed" for three years because of the popularity of crown disease, is now re -open, but it has not been seen that U.S. airlines are scrambling to restart the busy routes between the two largest economies of China and the United States.

Bloomberg Business Weekly reported that before the outbreak of the epidemic in 2019, China -US Airlines had an average of 340 direct flights to and from the two countries per week. There are only 24 times a week.

People familiar with the names that they do not want to disclose that the largest airlines in the United States, USA, Da Mei Airlines and United Airlines, will continue to maintain the level of Sino -US flights reduced during the epidemic, but this is not because they are expected to be weak, but because they are weak, but because they are weak, but because they are weak, but because they are weak, but because Disputes caused by the prohibition of flights from Europe and the United States to fly over Russia's airspace make them unwilling to increase flights.

This measure is suitable for about 30 countries including the United States, and China has not been limited by this.

The relationship between Beijing and Washington has deteriorated, and it has also shadowed the prospects of quickly solving this problem through diplomacy.

During the same period, airlines such as British Airlines and Emirates by Japan ’s Aviation Airlines and IAG SA have restarted or announced daily flights to resume or plan to resume to Chinese cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai.

The Chinese route of Korean Air has reached the level before the epidemic, from 13 flights per week to 84 flights in April, and plans to increase to 99 flights within this month.

The content of the lyrics sung by the singer and the author reviewed it, warning some artists and strictly supervising their behavior. The authorities prohibit Tibetans from singing songs that advertise their national spirit and call for Tibetans to unite, while vigorously advocating Tibetans' songs and Tibetan mixed songs. The creative environment of the Tibetan art world has been suppressed by unprecedentedly.

The reporters inquired about the people's government of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the official website of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, and did not find out the relevant announcement of Tibetan lyrics. In response, the Dalai Lama representative Ge Sang Jianye was interviewed by Radio Free Asia that the CCP ’s approach now does not leave any evidence and switched to a verbal ban to prevent the outflow of domestic news.

** Tibetans in exile: the CCP's defense news does not leave evidence **

Darva Cairen, director of the Tibetan Policy Research Center of the Tibetan Administrative Central Tibet, also said that most of the above news is that Tibetans in the country pass the information through telephone and other channels to overseas. source.

The report also mentioned that in recent years, Tibetans sang Chinese songs at the New Year Gala in Tibet in recent years, praising the Communist Party, the PLA, and grateful to the CCP's development of more and more songs to Tibet. The less.

Geang Jianjian pointed out that this is the result of policy -oriented. Xi Jinping's so -called party governance of the party in the new era must use Tibetan culture, religion, and language as a tumor. Suppress.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-16T11-45-00-04-00/000001.png)On the streets near the Jokhang Temple, the Chinese flag fluttered above the monitoring camera. (Reuters) [] [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shaoshuminzu/hx-05162023092846.html/4.jpg)** Geang Jianjian: Xi Jinping has regarded Tibetan culture as a tumor in the new era.

"In the past, many Tibetan singers sang with their mother tongue, chanting Tibetan heroes with their mother tongue, and wrote the mood of praising the master and nostalgia in Tibetan lyrics. , Such singers and lyricists, many Tibetan musicians have the danger of being cleared, arrested, and detained. This is a signal of danger. "

Dava Cairen said that some studies have found that Tibetan songs rarely recite love or personal emotions, mainly singing their own nations, guru, lamas, snow mountains, grasslands, and emphasizing national unity. Dava Cairen gave an example: "Some lyrics say that the father's heritage must be inherited by the descendants, which means that the ancestors' cultural descendants should be inherited. It refers to how red laws oppress us. We hope that one day the law of Dharma can give it to the law of Dharma to give us the law of Dharma. Tibet brings freedom. These lyrics are regarded by the CCP as reaction, and some singers and lyrics are arrested and sentenced to sentence. "

Dava Cairen analyzed that if there was no special emphasis on anti -aggression, the content of euphemism would not attract the authorities' attention: "There is a" daughter of Tibet ": I am a daughter of a good person and a daughter of faith. Similar to these performances. I do n’t say anything else. Generally speaking, the problem is not big. Some singers will sing the Tibetans to unite, and the lyrics are called unity: Do not divide anything, they are all descendants of the same ancestors. Dry, what will happen to his father's suffering, what will happen without unity? Some emphasize that Tibetans have been the owner of Tibet: Since the existence of this world, he has lived on this land and never leave. "

Dava Cairen said that in the era of release of records, tapes, and discs, it was necessary to send review before the sale of packaging. Authorities have stipulated that at least one song must be praised by the Communist Party, otherwise it will not be approved. Many Tibetan singers now sing and sing by Tibetan groups and monascular invitations to the local horse racing festival. On -site video uploading and spread on the Internet. Afterwards, they found that the lyrics were "excellent" to catch people, so a new wave of strict trial was recently launched.

In response to why the authorities conducted reviews on color beard, Qinghai and other places, Ge Sang Jianjian said that Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Shiqu Township was a place where Tibetan protests had previously many protests. In addition, many Tibetan singers are concentrated in Qinghai, where the Tibetan culture is the cradle of Tibetan culture.

Gesson Kenjian said that if Tibetan singers sing the red songs that the CCP loves to hear, there will be no market in the Tibetan community; if the songs that recite Tibet and the national identity will be controlled by the authorities, they are in this tap. Tibetan singers will sing or sing in the restaurant and small song hall to earn income, singing the songs of Tibetans' favorite national and religious feelings, and some people are arrested.

** Singing Hongge has a platform on the official media without market **

Ge Sang Jian also mentioned that the self -immolation Tibetan singer Caiwangrobu, who came out at the beginning of last year, became popular in draft shows such as "Good Voice of China".

Such singers have a large market on television stations in various provinces. Many performance opportunities; those singers who use traditional Tibetan music style, have deep emotions for the Tibetan nation, and love Tibet have no stage on the official television station, let alone the Spring Festival Gala, but they are widely welcomed by Tibetan temples and Tibetans. Today, it is expected that the authorities will block their only market.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) Ukraine said on Tuesday (May 16) that 18 Russian missiles were shot down one night, including six Russian hypersonic missiles "Kinzhal" "dagger"). Moscow had previously claimed that the super weapon was unstoppable.

This is the first time Ukraine claims to shot down a row of high -speed supersonic missiles. If the news is confirmed, it will be a high -profile display of the effectiveness of the newly deployed Western air defense system.

Russian President Putin announced the dagger hypersonic missile in 2018 as one of the "new generation" weapons. He often touts the missile to show that Russia's military hardware is world -class and can confront NATO.

** More reading: [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯高超音速导弹你所该知道的/a-61235544)**

The dagger hypersonic missile can carry a conventional warhead or nuclear warhead up to 2,000 kilometers. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄罗斯又在乌克兰动用高超音速导弹/a-64972052)And only admit that they are launched in a few cases.

### "Unbelievable success"

Valeriyzaluzhnyi, chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said that in the night, the Ukraine forces intercept all 18 missiles launched by Russia, namely 6 dagger hypersonic missiles launched from the plane and ships from the Black Sea. 9 Kalibr cruise missiles (caliber cruise missiles), and 3 Iskanders (Isegel missiles) launched from land.

According to Germany, Zaluzi said that the Ukraine air defense forces also destroyed the 6 Kamikaze Drones.

Ukraine Minister of Defense Oleksiyreznikov wrote on Twitter: "The Ukrainian Air Force has achieved another incredible success!Last night, our Sky Guardian shot down 6 Russian dagger hypersonic missiles and" 12 other missiles ... ".

Reuters reported that after the missile was blown from the air, the Kiev was shined by the flash, and the fragments were like rain. Kiev Municipal Authority said that three people were injured by fragments.

### Moscow: "Dagger" destroyed a Patriot missile defense system

Earlier this month, Ukraine claimed for the first time, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/乌克兰用爱国者击落俄高超音速导弹/a-65541835)Earlier, the ability of patriots to intercept the dagger hypersonic missile is only theoretical. If you can hit six at a time, it will indicate that it may be a reliable defense method.

Russia has not confirmed Kiev's statement, and its statement is contrary to Kiev.

The Russian Zvezda Military News reported that the Russian Ministry of Defense stated that during the attack on Ukraine at night, the dagger hypersonic missile destroyed a Patriot missile defense system made by the United States. The Russian Ministry of Defense also said that night attacks were also storage for combat forces and ammunition for Ukraine.

### Russian high -frequency air strike Ukraine to prepare a big counterattack

As the Ukrainian army is ready to launch an offensive, Russia is now launching a long -range air strike at the highest frequency in the war.

According to Reuters, Russia has launched 8 drones and missiles this month, which is higher than the frequency of previous March, April and winter. Kiev claimed that most of them shot down.

In the past week, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄乌战况基辅称乌军继续在巴赫穆特推进/a-65606836), Retu some territories in the northern and southern suburbs of Bachurt. Moscow acknowledged that some troops had retreated, but denied that the front on both sides of the city was collapsed.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-16T12-11-00Z/65610579_401.jpg)The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said on May 12 that the Ukraine's offensive at the front line of Bachmut made significant progress

Kiev said that these progress is local and does not represent the full power of its upcoming counterattack. Kiev plans to use hundreds of modern tanks and armored vehicles sent by the West this year. Ukraine's counterattack will bring the war into the next important stage.

Moscow launched a comprehensive invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and now he has claimed that he has merged about one -sixth of Ukraine's territory. In the early days of the war, Ukraine repelled the Russian army from the Kiev suburbs and recaptured the territory in two major counterattacks in the second half of 2022. However, since November, the Ukraine has been in the trend.

Russia said that it is necessary to launch a war in Ukraine to respond to the threat of the security composition of Kiev and the West. Ukraine and its allies claim that this was an unseen and illegal war. Kiev said that all the Russian troops would not stop fighting before leaving their land.

For the support of politicians, it is very important to know that there are so many prisoners of death, otherwise more people are likely to be executed. "Many members of Germany and other countries provide similar political support for prisoners in Iran and other countries.

On the other side of the Persian Gulf, the number of victims of the death penalty rose straight. In Saudi Arabia, 196 people died of death in 2021. "Believe it or not, Saudi Arabia has executed 81 people in one day." Agnes Callamard, Secretary -General of the International Amnesty Organization, said in the report. This means that the number of death penalty for Iran and Saudi Arabia accounted for more than 80% of the global statistics.

### ** Thousands of people are executed every year in China **

In 2022, at least 883 people in the 20 countries/regions that have been counted were beheaded, hanged, shot or poisoned by the government's approval execution. This is the highest number of death sentences in five years, which has increased significantly compared with 2021-the number of people exceeds 300, and the increase is more than 50%.

It is worth reminding that these statistics do not include the number of death sentences performed in China-the number of people who are executed every year is as high as thousands of deaths-China will protect this number as national secrets. The same is true of Vietnam. North Korea, which is suspected to be over -useed too much, is not reflected in the data of the report.

Some countries that establish partnerships with Germany also use their death penalty, such as Japan, the United States and Singapore. The German Parliament Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid Spokesperson, Green Party Member, Borismijatovic, told Germany that whenever he expressed his criticism of the death penalty to the representatives of these countries, he often received the following two types. The response: "The person who talked to me was either embarrassed, felt guilty, or behaved very confident. A pair of" What do you want to tell me? "

![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-16T12-31-00Z/64871857_401.jpg)The number of people who executed the death penalty in Iran in 2022 doubled from the previous year

"Especially in the Gulf area, Asia, or North America, this is an old topic. If you want to make any progress, he must be very imaginative." He believes that German politicians are responsible for this. " This type of debate should be promoted, especially in those countries that are not only used for the worst crimes, but also for many other crimes. For example, Iran's "Anti -Alloral Crime" is very, very suspicious. "

### ** Punishment of drug trafficking with death penalty violations of human rights **

According to the report from the International Amnesty Organization, more than one -third of the determined execution was performed as punishment for drug trafficking. "Some countries take the death penalty as part of the common punishment means of their criminal law, which violates the" World Human Rights Declaration "and international law." Alder said.

This is because these declarations and laws clearly prohibit the death penalty of "the most serious crimes" -s such as deliberate murder-standard crimes. [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界反死刑日民意是维持死刑的藉口/a-45807287)Essence She said: "It will not reduce the murder, nor will it reduce the crime related to drugs."

### ** There are a total of ** ** ** ** 112 ** ** The country has abolished the death penalty **

However, in the case of dullness, a hint of hope can still be seen: another 6 countries abolished the death penalty in 2022. The trend is changing, especially in African countries: the death penalty in the African countries: Sierra Leone and the Chinese and African Republics. The equatorial Guinea and Zambia have restricted the death penalty to the maximum without completely canceling the death penalty. middle.

By the end of 2022, [](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣卡關逐步廢死-專家死刑淪政客廉價操作/a-64859404)Essence In December last year, nearly two -thirds of the United Nations member states, that is, 125 countries, voted for votes and supported the suspension of the global suspension of the death penalty to eventually abolish the death penalty. The number of votes reached a record high.

The nickname is "pro -Russian neutral". The comments entitled "Small Courtyard High Wall" wrote:

"But for the Chinese, this position is indeed very cost -effective. If there are winners in the Russian and Ukraine War, then this winner is China. However, Russia has fallen into the vassal of China. In view of this, how to deal with China has become one of the most important challenges facing the European Union. Because of this, the policy of China has become an important issue for the June EU Summit. Essence

On the eve of the summit, the European Commission will submit its economic security strategy, and the tone of the strategy is to depend on institutional opponents and will cause Europe to fall into a terrible situation, that is to say, to "risk '. Different from the "decoupling ', the purpose of' risk -risk 'is not to be economical in economics, but to enhance Europe's own economic pressure resistance.

"

The comments pointed out that it is a good thing to promote market diversification and avoid excessive risks, but it takes a lot of time to do so. Once China moves against Taiwan, the sanctions and counter -tailoring operations between the European Union and China will inevitably.

If Shulz does not want to continue to play the role of the Brussels stumbling block, then he will be very very very It's hard to reject such suggestions. "

"Editorial Network" commented that Germany regretted selling important energy facilities such as natural gas storage tanks to Russia at the beginning, and the red and yellow and green government of Berlin also advocated reducing its economic dependence on China as soon as possible. Below, the German government approved the transfer of part of the equity of the Burger Portal Words to the Chinese company. As far as the symbolic meaning of the decision is obviously a mistake.

After all, the comparability of natural gas storage tanks and the container terminal is limited. Qi as a means of pressure for politics. But with a container terminal to achieve the same pressure, it is unimaginable, not to mention that if China wants to fight a trade war with Germany, there are many more effective pressure on the Hamburg Wharf. .

Port operators had to answer why they did not log in to the pier as sensitive infrastructure as soon as possible. Why does the assessment last so long, and the federal government has to answer, why do they not be able to make a noise on the security positioning of the pier under the premise of knowing it?

Beijing announced last week that "Eurasian Affairs Special Representative" Li Hui's visit schedule said that in addition to Ukraine and Poland, his trip will also visit Russia, France and Germany.

According to Beijing, the purpose of this trip is to "communicate with the Ukrainian crisis with all parties in politics."

From the perspective of Li Hui's interview itinerary, the first stop is the Ukraine of the Antrocked country of the Russian and Ukraine War, which has propaganda significance; Polish No. 2 is the most powerful European country, which is also symbolic; France and Germany are European leaders and the targets of China's urgency to draw. It not only helps to mediate the Russian and Ukraine War, but also by the way, this will take the lead in blocking the United States to break through.

The last stop is the country and the invading country of Russia.

Therefore, such schedules have also aroused some skeptical concerns of the outside world.

This may involve a specific ministerial forum and be responsible for exploring what actions should be taken to respond to illegal countries."

Luke Depulford, executive director of the China Policy Council Alliance, emphasized that the G7 needs to formulate a tool for "economic coercion" during an interview with this station, so that Beijing knows that they cannot threaten democratic countries with economic means: "Demonstrate power and unity of unity and solidarity This is very important. Otherwise, we will fall into risks, allowing our democratic countries to expose economic coercion and bullying, just like before Australia and Lithuania.

Faced with the aggressive G7 summit, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also put the ruthless words in front. Speaker Wang Wenbin was full of firepower for two consecutive days.

In addition to the "economic coercion", the cross -border league of the China Policy Council has also urged the G7 countries to reduce its dependence on China at the level of supply chain, energy and technology, whether to supervise China to assist Russia to invade Ukraine, and investigate China's multinational suppression activities.

Pei Londe added that the outside world generally only pays attention to how to reduce dependence on infrastructure in China, but ignores that some countries depend on exporting to China in terms of economy. He took a punitive tariff on Australian red wine and the prohibition of the import of agricultural products such as pineapple in Taiwan as an example. It said that this is an example of "economic coercion" in China.

On the issue of Taiwan, the China Policy Council Alliance requested that the G7 countries reiterated their opposition to unilaterally changing the status quo of the Taiwan Strait.

The English Department of this station recently quoted a report of the latest independent agency that China, as the world's largest carbon dioxide discharge country, has reached a record level in the first quarter of this year, and it is expected to reach its historical peak in 2023.

[** Over half of the greenhouse gas emissions come from 25 cities in China **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/xx-07122021104918.html)  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/7-04252021132508.html) **  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/cm-12142020160945.html) **  * **[ ](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/jiaodianzhuizong/huanjingshengtai/bx-09242020144156.html)**

According to the relevant report released by the Finnish Independence Agency "Energy and Cleaning Air Research Center" (CREA) last Friday (12th), China's carbon dioxide emissions in the first three months of this year increased by 4 % compared with the same period last year, and it was more than three. One billion tons of single -quarter records. The analysis is based on official data and business data, and is first published on Carbonbrief News.

The reporter said that China's carbon emissions growth is mainly driven by three factors, including the authorities to promote economic recovery after the end of the epidemic "clear zero" policy, implement stimulus measures in the manufacturing and construction industries, and low rainfalls from all over China and continuous continuity Insufficient hydropower power generation caused by drought.

Due to the Spring Festival holiday, the Chinese economy usually has a low production and low carbon dioxide emissions in the first quarter. Therefore, the report pointed out that "the government's concern for economic growth means that China's carbon emissions are likely to reach the highest level of history in 2023, exceeding the peak of 2021."

From the second half of last year to the first quarter of this year, the approval project of China's new coal power capacity has increased significantly, but the report believes that this will not directly lead to an increase in coal consumption or carbon dioxide emissions, because "the rapid expansion of low -carbon energy supply, and the expected slower is expected to be slower The demand for power growth means that China's annual coal and electricity output may soon begin to decline. "

However, another report issued by another global energy think tank EMBER also showed that in 2022, among the global power plants, the highest carbon dioxide emissions of Chinese power plants in the world, reaching 38%of the total carbon dioxide emissions generated by global power generation.

China's official plan is to reach the peak of carbon emissions in 2030, and then gradually decreases, and net zero carbon emissions will be achieved by 2060.

Description: The International Monetary Fund stated that German economic growth prospects are sluggish, tightened monetary policy and the surge in energy prices caused by the Ukrainian war may drag their growth in the short term; in the long run, the issue of social aging also affects growth. On the same day, another Institute of Economic Research also issued a forecast of financial market experts, and the assessment of German economic prospects has deteriorated significantly.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-05-16T14-33-00Z/65514317_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65647555/65514317)The monthly survey of the European Economic Research Center (ZEW) shows that investors' confidence in the German economy has weakened for the third consecutive month, and concerns about the decline in the German economy have emerged again.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released documents on May 16 to evaluate the economic and financial conditions of its member states. It is believed that Germany's economic growth prospects are not good.

The organization stated that the factors that affect the short -term growth of German economy include a tightening monetary policy and the surge in energy prices caused by the Ukrainian war. In order to suppress inflation and increase key interest rates and the turbulent financial market turmoil, the financial market turmoil mainly comes from the banking industry in the United States and Switzerland.

The International Monetary Fund stated that Germany's economic growth rate this year may wander around zero. In the next few years, it is expected to accelerate to 1%to 2%. But in the long run, due to social aging, Germany's economic growth rate may fall to less than 1%.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/物价飙升的另一原因企业趁火打劫/a-65247804)The International Monetary Fund is expected to decline. However, the decline in core inflation may be slower and late. Core inflation refers to the inflation rate of goods and services with large fluctuations in short -term price fluctuations such as energy and food. The organization said that the decline in raw material prices on other commodity prices may be later reflected. In addition, the increase in wages is also promoting the rise in prices.

The International Monetary Fund also emphasizes high uncertainty related to economic prospects. For example, stubborn inflation may require a more tightening monetary policy response, and this will further suppress growth.

[](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/imf预测今年全球增长28-英德呈负增长/a-65289504)The International Monetary Fund predicts that Germany's economy will be negative growth (-0.1%) in 2023, and it is expected to rise to 1.1%by 2024.

The German federal government previously predicted that Germany's growth rate in 2023 was about 0.2%. The European Commission also predicted this week that Germany's GDP in 2023 will only increase by 0.2%, and then increased by 1.4%in 2024.

### Gas price soaring in Germany's middle -class stress mountains

### ZEW: The German economic expectation index drops steadily to -10.7

The European Economic Research Center (ZEW), Germany, also announced on May 16 the expectations of analysts and investors to the German economy in May in May. The monthly survey showed that analysts and investors' confidence in the German economy declined for the third consecutive month, and the evaluation of the economic prospects in the next six months has fallen by 14.8 points, from 4.1 in April to -10.7 points in May. This is the first time that the reading has been in a negative area since December 2022.

Achimwambach, chairman of the European Economic Research Center, said: "Financial market experts predict that the poor economic situation will worsen in the next six months," said he said that the German economy may fall into a mild decline.

Vambach pointed out that some of the reasons for the decline in economic emotional indicators are that people expect that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates further. In addition, "the United States may have defaults in the next few weeks, which has also increased uncertainty to the global economic prospects."

Carstenbrzeski, a global director of the Macro Research Department of the Dutch Group (ING), said ZEW's latest forecast for the German economy is a "worrying information." In a report to his client, he said, "Three consecutive declines are a new trend, a trend in the wrong direction."

China was worried that when the situation in the Taiwan Strait worsening faced the same dilemma, it actively promoted the internationalization of RMB and cross -border payment systems. However, some scholars believe that the dominant position of the US dollar is difficult to shake, and China's assessment of the RMB international status is too optimistic.

On May 16th, the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CENTERFOR Strategic and Internationalstudies) held a discussion to explore China ’s strategies to respond to Western financial sanctions led by the United States by analyzing the relevant research of Chinese scholars in the future.

Barrynauton, director of China and International Affairs of the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, Barrynauton, pointed out that Chinese scholars generally believe that China can use the status of a large trading country and control over important supply chains to counter international financial sanctions. At the same time, the US -led financial sanctions cannot have a decisive impact on China in the short term, but Beijing realized that the risk of secondary sanctions is greater. Therefore, China's financial systems and enterprises do not dare to directly challenge the US policy that will lead to sanctions.

This shows that China's financial bureaucratic agencies have stated to the CCP's senior management the risk and return of secondary sanctions.

"China realizes that the most important leverage they have is to make the United States realize that it is very expensive and risky to implement large -scale financial sanctions on China." He said: "If you see the United States involved in China or all technologies or technology or in China, In other aspects of policy response, you will find that sanctions are one thing, but sanctions are rarely used. For example China clearly realized that this is not what the United States wants to do. "

He mentioned that in order to cope with potential sanctions, China has established the RMB cross -border payment system (CIPS) to bypass the Global Bank of Financial Communication Association (SWIFT) transfer funds, but this system is not effective in the circulation of overseas funds: "If China The bank is included in the sanction list because China invades Taiwan, which will be disastrous ... now the alternative solution is very limited, which makes them very nervous. "

(Video screenshot/csis) [](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/jw2-05162023123825.html/untitled-1.jpg)Ma Yongzhe emphasized that if China invaded Taiwan, as the assessment of China shows that the financial sanctions leded by the United States and the European Union is difficult to form, because the higher the dependence on China in terms of financial, economic and trade, the greater the cost of sanctions. Unlike the direct impact of the Russian and Ukraine War on Europe, European countries will carefully evaluate the risk of financial sanctions on China.

In February last year, Joint Western countries led by the United States were excluded from some Russian banks outside the Global Bank of Financial Communications Association (SWIFT) payment system and implemented restrictions on the Russian central bank to prevent Russia from allocating its international reserves to weaken sanctions. Play. Although Russia has shifted to international trade such as rubles to settle natural gas, its economy is still severely damaged. This also sounded the alarm for China: Once the situation in the Taiwan Strait worsen, Russia's experience may be repeated in China.

China is committed to breaking the US dollar hegemony and actively promoting the internationalization of the RMB to prevent huge risks caused by potential international financial sanctions. In March of this year, China and Brazil reached a trade agreement with the currency settlement of both parties; in April, Argentina also announced that it would use RMB settlement products from China. In addition, Russia, Iran, and the “Belt and Road” initiatives, which have been sanctioned by international sanctions, are also forced to use RMB for some trade.

But Norton pointed out that China realized that the progress of RMB internationalization was not overnight. He said: "Unlike the situation ten years ago, at the time, China really tried to internationalize the RMB, and was even willing to bear some risks of opening up capital accounts ... Today, Chinese scholars obviously lost their expectations and ambitions. Obviously, obviously Everything was splashed with a pot of cold water.

# The United Nations urges plastic pollution to reduce plastic pollution

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 16th) The United Nations announced today that the world must minimize the amount of disposable plastic products and reduce the consumption of such plastic products to curb the wave of environmental pollution. The report also warned that it is crucial in the next few years.

![](Images/rficn/2023-05-16T16-32-10-00-00/000000.png)People are more and more concerned about the impact of plastic particles. These particles are produced when plastic products are decomposed in the environment. They can be found from the deepest marine trench to the top of the Mount Evereest.

Plastic particles have been detected even in human blood, breast milk and placenta.

Two weeks after the report of the UNITED National Environment Program (UNEP), negotiation representatives from nearly 200 countries will hold a new round of negotiations in Paris, hoping to reach a legal agreement to end plastic pollution next year.

In the report, a tri -tube neat plan is proposed to help reduce the total plastic pollution by 80%by re -use, recycling and diversified materials, and reduce the output of plastic products by one at one time.

This report quotes research estimates that by 2040, the greenhouse gases emitted by the production of plastic products may account for 19%of the global total.

This will at all prevents the world's commitment to perform a commitment in the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the increase in the average temperature of the earth within 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than the level before the industrial revolution.

The United Nations Environmental Planning Department executes Inger Andersen, said: "The way we produce, use and deal with plastic are polluting the ecosystem, bringing risks to human health and destroying climate stability."

About 238 million metric tons from 2020 from 2020 are used for short -term use of plastic products, such as packaging materials that eventually enter urban waste.

Without major changes, the UN Environmental Planning Agency estimates that by 2040, the annual plastic waste will reach 408 million metric tons, including 380 million metric tons of new fossil fuel plastics. This will mean that about 227 million metric plastic will eventually enter the environment.

The UN Environmental Planning Department reports estimates that through a series of "system changes" solutions, this pollution can be reduced to 41 million metric tons.

But the report said that there is no time to waste.

The report warned: "The next 3 to 5 years will take action at a critical moment to enable the world to embark on the way to implement a system change plan in 2040."

He said: "If we cannot explain to the American people why Taiwan's democracy and sovereignty are important, we cannot get the support of the American people.

On the other hand, for Taiwan, if the United States, the United States, if the United States, the United States, if the United States, the United States, if the United States, the United States, if the United States, the United States, if the United States is in the United States The government's inconsistent signal will weaken the courage to defend Taiwan's sovereignty.

A Jun told me that she had a folk publication "Wo Land" during the democratic wall period. I was very happy when I heard it, because in that year, I was a member of "Wo Tu". I published several articles in "Wo Tu". My "Freedom of speech" was first released in "Wo Tu". It's just that I don't even have a "Wo Land" myself now. A Jun said that this "Wo Di" at hand was the 6th issue of the 6th issue of the 5th issue of 1979. I remember this issue of "Wo Land" has a very wonderful work, signed the film literary script "Bright Road" written by "White Silk". I ask A Jun to check it. When I checked it, I took a photo and sent it to me.

I still remember the general plot of the story. The protagonist is Cui Mingliang, a private entrepreneur, making a golf club, and the products are exported overseas. The protagonist's suit and leather shoes, taking private cars. At the end of the story, Cui Mingliang received an order from abroad and went to Lisbon, the capital of Portugal by plane.

I have to say that "Bright Road" is really wonderful. The author's eyes are amazing. His "Bright Road" is more foreseeable than Jiang Zilong's "Director of the Qiao Factory" in the same period. That was 1979. At that time, there were no private entrepreneurs in China, and no one played golf. Most people had not even seen the golf club. At that time, the individual households just appeared in the city of Beijing were just selling large bowls of tea. Unfortunately, such a good work did not attract much attention at the time, and now he knows that there are fewer people who know this work.

"White Silk" is his pen name, which looks like a lady's name. Wang Shan said that because the author in "Wo Di" does not have a woman, he takes a female pen name. Wang Shan has published several articles in the pen name of "White Silk" in "Wo Land", mainly literary works such as novels.

Speaking of this Wangshan, the experience is also very extraordinary. Workers, peasants and soldiers have worked, they have worked as miners, educated youths, and they have been soldiers. During the Democratic Wall, Wang Shan worked in the administrative department of Beijing Normal University. He was a colleague who was on a hunger strike with Liu Xiaobo, Hou Dejian, Zhou Ru, etc. during the 89th Democratic Games. However, Wang Shan participated in "Wo Di" with a pseudonym, so Gaoxin in the same office did not know him about him. He only knew that there were many civil magazines in Wangshan's collection. Later The pioneer of the democratic movement under the Democratic Wall.

It is said that even Jiang Zemin has read this book and recommended to others. At first everyone thought it was written by the Germans, but later I knew it was Wang Shan.

At the beginning of this century, a record of interviews in Taiwan had an interview with Wang Shan. Wang Shan talked about the campaign of the Democratic Wall Movement to the reporter, which mentioned me. He said that when I was running at Peking University, I said: I am not a member of the Communist Party, and my three generations are not members of the Communist Party. So the audience applauded warmly. I heard this paragraph shortly after the campaign. At that time, it was said that a candidate at Renmin University said. Wang Shan Zhang Guanli Dai was on my head. He was listening to him. I don't know if this paragraph is really ordered.

After the rise of the Internet, Wang Shan also got on the Internet. The name he gave himself was "four horizontal vertical" -the strokes of Wang Shan's two words are exactly four horizontal and four vertical.

As a fan of "Wo Tu", in the years of the Democratic Wall, Wang Shan and I have seen several times, a meeting, and an outing. Wang Shan in memory is not tall, white and round, round face. Both Wang Shan and I are the third. He is younger than me. In the year of the Cultural Revolution, I was a senior year, and he was just the first day. However, he died of illness in 2012, and was less than sixty years old.

Seeing the photos of the public magazine "Wo Tu" from a friend, I remembered the years of the Democratic Wall and Wang Shan. Write this article to express it.

Sarawak is not restricted by other states (prohibiting non -Muslims from using Arah eyes). But this does not mean that (the ruling of the Kuala Lumpur High Court) is suitable for Malacca, Penang, Selangor or other states. "

The Ministry of Political Affairs of the Malaysia and the states of West Malaysia are prohibited from using Ala's eyes. When Sarawan Christians, Pill El returned to Kuala Lumpur from Indonesia in May 2008, was charged by customs personnel at the airport and charged eight Christian textbooks containing the word "Ala". Gil filed a lawsuit in August 2008, demanding a decision to withdraw the filled disc.
