With the suspicion of the US debt default, the market's attention returned to the Fed again to crack down on the inflation rate for decades high.</p>
<p>According to the data released yesterday, the number of new people in the United States in May declined, but it is still better than analyst expectations; salary growth has slowed down for the second consecutive month. The news is welcomed by the stock market dealers.</p>
<p>This data also brings a good sign to the US non -agricultural employment report that will be released later and the more attention in May. The latter is one of the major reference indicators for the Federal Substitute to make interest rates.</p>
<p>U.S. currency decision officials have stated that if they want to stop raising the cost of lending, key factors include the US labor market softened and inflation.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve ’s later month may be the hope of the first time to suspend interest rate hikes for more than a year. Now, two more central bank officials have spoken speeches to add market optimism.</p>
<p>Patrick Harker, president of Philadelphia Fed, advocated that central bank officials should "at least this meeting skipped interest rates."</p>
<p>Philipjefferson, the director of the nominated vice chairman of the Feds Association, also said that it can stop the impact of officials to evaluate the interest rate increase, but it does not mean a tightening cycle stop. His opinions are often consistent with the Federal President Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market closed up by 4.0%under the drive of technology stocks and led the rise in the Asian stock market. The Tokyo stock market closed up 1.2%, and the Shanghai stock market closed up 0.8%. Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Bangkok and Manila's stock market also received red.</p>

<p>China ’s first domestic passenger aircraft C919 first sailed on May 28. Nearly 130 passengers took a flight from Shanghai Hongqiao Airport to Beijing Capital Airport from Shanghai Hongqiao Airport to Beijing Capital Airport.</p>
<p><strong> On May 28, China ’s first domestic large aircraft C919 successfully achieved its first commercial flight and flew from Shanghai to Beijing. This aircraft was manufactured by the state -owned COMAC (Comac), from 2007 to its first commercial sailing in 2023, which lasted for 15 years. </strong></p>

Even the success of the Chinese high -speed railway -2004 high -speed railway items to 2018, 38,000 kilometers in 14 years, accounting for 70 % of the global high -speed rail mileage, and became the "business card" made by China's high -end manufacturing, and began to output.</p>

<p>BBC sort out information, interviews experts, analyzes the unique advantages and disadvantages of China's large aircraft, and tries to answer a question -Can Chinese aircraft replicate the success of the high -speed rail?</p>
<h3>What is C919?</h3>
<p>In 2007, the Chinese government established large aircraft and formed the "COMAC" company. Three years later (October 2010), the new company with a state -owned assets submitted the C919 model qualification certificate application to the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

Later, it did not succeed in the first flight until May 2017.</p>
<p>After the successful flight, the C919 entered the test flight and verification stage. It took five years. By September 29, 2022, the model qualification certificate was obtained, which proved that the design of the C919 was met. , Six of them participating in test flight subjects participating in power, performance, control, and two tests participating in static tests, fatigue tests and other tests.</p>
<p>At the end of 2022, COMAC officially delivered the first C919 to China Oriental Airlines. Five months later, C919 flew from Shanghai to Beijing and opened its first flight. From May 29th, the C919 will take MU9197 as the flight number, traveling between Shanghai Hongqiao Airport and Chengdu Tianfu Airport daily.</p>
<p>C919 is not the first show of the Chinese Shangfei aircraft. According to the official statement, the development route of China's civil aviation industry is three steps -branch aircraft, single -channel trunk aircraft, and dual -channel large -scale trunk aircraft.</p>
<p>Among them, the first step is the smaller ARJ21 line passenger plane. It was put into operation in 2015 and deployed more than 200 routes in China.</p>

<p>China C919.</p>
<p>The C919 is a step in the middle, that is, a single channel trunk aircraft. It is also a large passenger aircraft developed in accordance with the international aircraft standard at the beginning of the design. The longest range is about 5,500 kilometers. There are 158 to 168 seats in the cabin. A single channel is divided into both sides, 3 on each side.</p>
<h3>Advantage —— "Unified Market"</h3>
<p>The special feature of the C919 is that its design is the best -selling airline A320 and Boeing 737, and this type of model is the best -selling, accounting for nearly 80 % of the two companies' delivery. Among this best -selling model, China is the largest buyer -China's airline orders account for about a quarter of market demand.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in China, airlines are completely state -owned. There are more than 60 passenger airlines operating in China. All private capitals or holdings are 9, such as spring and autumn, auspiciousness, and Huaxia. Southern Airlines occupied half of the Chinese market.</p>
<p>In addition, when airlines introduced aircraft, about half of them were not purchased directly, but through aircraft leasing. Several of China's largest aircraft leasing companies, such as ICBC Leasing, Traffic Bank Financial Leasing, Guobi Airlines, AVIC International Leasing, and International Leasing, and International Leasing,, International Leasing, International Leasing, International Leasing, International Leasing, International Leasing, and International Leasing of AVIC. Recruitment of Bank of Financial Leasing, as well as Chinese aircraft leasing in Hong Kong, all have the background of state -owned or state -owned commercial banks.</p>
<p>Similar situations also appeared during the development of high -speed rail. Under the leadership of state -owned assets, the power of "the hands of policies" is stronger than the "hand of the market."</p>
<p>"China Railway Economy Strategy" author Xie Xiaowen said in the book that China's "unified" management model has a natural institutional advantage for better construction and development of high -speed railways.</p>
<p>Xie Xiaowen believes that the management model of "unification" is the national management model of "unification" on the one hand, and on the other hand, the "unified" railway management model. For China, both. Under this model, we can maximize and maximize the advantages of people's property, and to develop national infrastructure in huge quantitative and efficiently.</p>
<p>He also cited an example that the construction process of the 109 -kilometer HS1 railway in the UK involved a series of problems such as land acquisition, public consultation, and environmental protection, which took 16 years; the United States passed the California high -speed rail construction expenses in 2008 and 10 years. , Still in the research budget stage.</p>
<p>An industry insider who has worked in a Chinese aviation industry related company and is currently engaged in independent research summarizes the BBC in Chinese that the biggest advantage of the C919 is not cheap, nor technology advanced, but it is produced by China because China is the world in the world. The market with the largest demand, C919 is the most demand model, and the main body of this market is "national character".</p>
<p>In fact, C919 was born with a golden spoon. According to the official website of China Commercial Flying, when the first sailing of the commercial flight, the Chinese COMAC has received more than 1,000 orders, and the large orders are all state -owned assets, such as 100 orders leased by ICBC and 75 orders for RMB leased. And 50 orders for CCB Leasing and Ping An Financial Leasing.</p>
<h3>Demand- "Decompiled China and the United States" catalysis</h3>
<p>Starting from the Sino -US trade war in 2018, the opposition between China and Western countries has become more and more serious. This confrontation is reflected in the chip industry -the United States has not only prohibited high -end chips and manufacturing equipment to China itself, but also combined with Japan and the Netherlands to complete the completion of each other to complete together to complete the completion Joint embargo to Chinese chips and manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p>For the large aircraft markets that rely on Boeing and Airbus giants, this similar "decoupling" has occurred.</p>

<p>In September 2019, after Boeing 737mAX was banned by the US Air Administration of FAA, the 737 MAX of airlines from various countries in Grant County, Washington, Washington, Washington. (Information picture)</p>
<p>Last year, the Boeing Company of the United States announced a total of 480 aircraft in 2022. Compared with its largest competitors Airbus, the largest competitor Airbus delivered a total of 661 aircraft. The gap between the two is mainly reflected in the Chinese market. Last year, Boeing delivered eight planes to China, while Airbus delivered more than 100.</p>
<p>In October last year, Boeing said that there are currently 138 other aircraft manufactured by Chinese airlines waiting to be delivered in the United States. However, in view of the fact that Chinese airlines will accept these planes in the short term, Boeing has begun to resold these aircraft to sell them to soldiers to soldiers to Other airlines. Boeing CEO DaveCalhouse said that he hopes to deliver more aircraft in China in the end, but "it is really difficult to find a signal, indicating that the situation in China will change and move towards (benefit) Our direction development. "</p>
<p>However, contrary to the logic of "decoupling" on the chip, the large aircraft, as the "Pearl on the Crown" as the industrial system, has a high value -added, obvious prying for the economy. China chooses to buy less Boeing, while producing its own large aircraft, and more more than more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more, more, and more. Multi -consideration is the need for domestic economic transformation and upgrading.</p>
<p>In May 2005, then the then Chinese Minister of Commerce Bo Xilai stated at a conference in Paris, France that "China only sells 800 million shirts to import a Airbus A380." At that time, the two backgrounds were: a large number of Chinese textiles entered the European Union, causing the latter to panic; just a week ago, Airbus's A380 was successful.</p>
<p>Although Bo Xilai was dismissed in the political struggle seven years later, his words have been widely circulated for many years since then, attracting the shame of "Made in China". Regardless of whether it is C919 in 2017 or delivered in 2022, Chinese media often say that "the" 800 million shirts to change a plane 'will become history "in reporting, and there are many official media in China.</p>
<p>According to Corporate's own outlook, in the next 20 years, C919, a single -channel jet passenger aircraft, has a market space of 10 trillion yuan in China, and the global market is 4.4 times that of the Chinese market size.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned industry insiders said that China is now engaged in "abandoning the United States and Europe" in aircraft procurement. In fact, the order is finally returned to Europe and the United States, but C919 can be used to seize the domestic market of 10 trillion yuan in ten years. Till trillion international markets, and "more chips on negotiating tables."</p>

<p>On May 28, China's C919 took off from Shanghai and opened its first commercial flight.</p>
<h3>Lack -the engine is still made in Europe and the United States</h3>

There are special sections: "Reporter Lai Hong", "British Life" and "Chinese Talking about the World".</p>
<p>separation</p>
<p>End of podcast</p>
<p>In the celebration of C919's first flight, the biggest questioning is that China has "created an aircraft shell and has no core technology."</p>
<p>This is aimed at the engine used by the C919. Specifically, it is the Leap-X1C turbofan engine jointly developed by the United States Ge Aviation and the French Safran AirCraftenne. It belongs to the same series as A320.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned industry insiders said that this is not completely right, because even if the engine comes from Europe and the United States, there are still many parts with high difficulty and high technology content. For example Sexual; for example, a large number of controls such as control and avionics in the control system are very difficult and need to be tested one by one; even in the materials, China has made new gras in pottery aluminum materials, which is better than the materials used in Europe and the United States. Essence</p>
<p>"Although the localization rate is 60%, the entire aircraft of the C919 is still very strong, otherwise the Japanese industrial capacity, science and technology level, and the relationship with European and American countries will not fail to test the large water aircraft several times." The above People said.</p>
<p>However, C919 always needs to rely on Europe and the United States on the engine with the highest technical content and the most difficulty. This has been mentioned again that China has frequently faced the "stuck neck" problem that China has frequently faced in the past.</p>
<p>In fact, this concern has become a reality to a certain extent. When Trump was the president of the United States, he considered prohibiting exporting the Leap engine to China in 2020. Although the ban failed to take effect in the end, the current export permit of General Corporation was only 2025, and it was still a problem to continue exporting.</p>
<p>Chen Gong, the founder of Anbang Think Tank, said that it is difficult for large commercial passenger aircraft to produce all parts and components alone, and this industry has not occurred. Even today’s Airbus, Boeing, and Macao in the past They are all manufactured by outsourcing. The close cooperation is the basic form of the aviation manufacturing industry. This will not change because of the C919 to heaven. For a long time, Chinese passenger planes still need to rely on foreign manufacturers' products. This is a normal phenomenon and a normal production method.</p>
<p>After the United States included China COMAC in the "physical list" restricted to export in January 2021, it deleted it from the list five months later, confirming Chen Gong's point of view to a certain extent.The subtext is that even if the U.S. government does not find faults, it is difficult to accept the intellectual property rights of existing companies during the C919 localization process.</p>
<p>Similar situations also occur during the construction of the Chinese high -speed rail. For example, Japan ’s Kawasaki Heavy Industry has stated that if the content of China's high -speed rail applied for patents overseas with China and Chuanzaki Heavy Industry’ s contract on the export of Shinkansen's technology exports will be considered, and a lawsuit will be considered in infringement of China ’s high -speed rail.</p>
<p>"This can also reflect the biggest difference between high -speed rail and large aircraft. The high -speed rail is the main method of transportation in China, and the large aircraft is the main international transportation method. In China, how to build it, but the aircraft flying abroad has to worry about international traffic. Standards, rules and systems, "said the industry.</p>

<p>C919 successfully landed in Beijing and enjoyed the highest courtesy "water gate" in the aviation industry.</p>
<h3>Key -the confidence of the brand's establishment</h3>
<p>Experts believe that the current C919 is far from challenging Boeing and Airbus. The C919 comparison Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 series passenger aircraft have no advantages in terms of aerodynamics, energy consumption and maintenance. The longest flight mileage is only more than 5,500 kilometers, shorter than 6,900 kilometers of A320neo and 737max.</p>
<p>C919 has only price advantages. Eastern Airlines disclosed that the price of C919 was 99 million US dollars, and the price of Airbus and Boeing was about $ 110 million and about $ 120 million.</p>
<p>However, the price difference of 10%-20%is far from making up for the lack of C919. Markuskeiper said that the biggest challenge of COMAC may be its brand. If Airbus and Boeing have an ultimate advantage, it is a brand that they can recognize after 50 and 100 years of development.</p>
<p>The confidence brought by this brand is the huge global maintenance system that runs and maintains 12,000 aircraft behind it. Kaip believes that there is no brand image outside China outside China, and it takes decades to establish positive brand cognition and loyalty. If the Chinese Commercial Flying strategically chooses price competition, it will be considered cheap, which is not desirable in the aviation industry. To obtain a sense of advanced through design, security, service, customization and innovation, a large amount of investment and cost will be required.</p>
<p>So, where is the future of a large domestic aircraft?</p>
<p>Looking back at history, the only "century -old store" in the field of commercial large aircraft is Boeing. The company established in 1916 is nearly 90%of the market share in half a century.</p>
<p>Until 1970, many European countries formed an air passenger car company, and there was only one task: defeating Boeing. At that time, Boeing's market share was 87%.</p>
<p>After nearly half a century, 47 years later, Airbus finally exceeded 50%of the market share in 2017, and in the following four years, it led the delivery of Boeing.</p>

<p>Photos photos of the first aircraft of the C919 passenger aircraft in Pudong base in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After the emergence of COMAC, how often can this "double -headed monopoly" market become a "three -point world"?</p>
<p>Reuters quoted industry analysts that in the face of the monopoly position of Boeing and Airbus, it would take ten years to want to challenge them practically. During the period, it is also necessary to build a stable maintenance system from scratch to improve the training of maintenance personnel, management system, and aviation material guarantee system.</p>
<p>The above -mentioned industry insiders have further stated that if China wants to achieve the "three -point world" in the field of large aircraft in the field of large aircraft, China also needs nearly half a century. It has been more than ten years since the establishment of the COSCO to the present, and it will take 30 years in the future:</p>
<p>In the first ten years, C919 needs to maintain a record of safe sailing and successfully deliver domestic orders. As long as it is successful in the Chinese market and Boeing and Airbus, it is successful.</p>
<p>In the second ten years, on the next generation or the next generation of large planes, increase the localization rate, and install the domestic "Yangtze River -1000A engine", which significantly reduces the price. Global operation and maintenance system.</p>
<p>The third decade is the process of gradually rising global delivery, and eventually reached the situation with Airbus and Boeing's "three -pointers world".</p>
<p>What I have to mention is that any safety accident will disrupt this process. Chen Gong proposed his own concerns. He believes that some "satellites" and "Great Leap Forward" in C919 have seen in the C919. For example, at the beginning of this year, the flight was terminated due to the engine failure. Hidden danger? How high is the safety coefficient of C919? This is a deeply confusing thing.</p>
<p>Similar problems have occurred during the progress of high -speed rail construction. The rear -end accident of the Yingtaiwen Railway train that occurred in 2011 has allowed the national high -speed rail to reduce speed and stop construction for many years. The above -mentioned industry insiders said, "This is what I said for thirty years, and the process of confidence can only be rely on time, and others are not good."</p>

<p>(Voice of German in China) The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) (Regional Comprehensive EconomicPartneership (abbreviated as RCEP) was initiated by the Ten Kingdoms of the Southeast Asian National Alliance and was initiated by the National People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, etc. ASEAN has a free trade agreement with the Five Party, which has a free trade agreement, and a total of 15 parties formed.</p>
<p>The total population, total GDP value, and cargo trade amount of RCEP region account for about 30 % of global. After the RCEP takes effect, the tariff reduction between members includes different commitments such as the immediately dropped to zero tariffs and zero tariffs within 10 years. More than 90%of the cargo trade in the area will eventually achieve zero tariffs, and ultimately forms a free trade zone with the largest number of global population and the largest economic and trade scale.</p>

<p>Austin believes that China intercept the provocation of the US military's machinery, which is worrying. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's southern theater refers to the US "wicked first priority".</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, Sino -US relations have been reappearing because of balloon storms, and before that, it has been nervous because of Taiwan and trade issues.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Shangri -La dialogue, Taipei and Washington signed "[21st Century Trade initiative] on Thursday (1st) Washington on Thursday (1st)(https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-65788057)"The first batch of agreements. China said on Friday that" strong dissatisfaction and had a serious negotiation to the United States. "</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said that signing this agreement "is the latest example of the virtualization of beauty and empty the Chinese principle", and requires the United States to "stop and immediately revoke the so -called 'initiative' and agreement, and stop sending any of the split forces to the 'Taiwan independence' division forces. Error signals, otherwise the consequences of this must be completely borne by the United States. "</p>
<p>Coupled with Washington and Beijing this week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IJfxs2efqBs">the United States accused the Chinese fighter "provocative" US reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea</a>On the eve of the dialogue, the US -China relations can be described as cold wind.</p>
<p>Council On Foreign Relations, a senior researcher at the National Security Affairs, Richardbetts, said to the BBC TV news station: "(China and the United States) are concerned about how to avoid direct conflicts -there is no doubt that because there is no doubt because Many obvious reasons, they all hope to avoid war -but there are currently no clear or obvious ways to solve the Taiwan problem. "</p>
<p>Bates said that China originally hoped to press the Taiwan issue to be disappeared, but recently changed. Taiwan is not an independent country, but due to a certain degree of protection in the United States, Washington must face the reality that it is not easy to deal with the strategy of responding to the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>After the Pentagon announced on Monday (May 29) announced that after Li Shangfu refused to meet with Austin, the Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman Tan Kefei said on Tuesday (31st) and said: "The dialogue must not have no principles, and the communication cannot be communicated. The responsibility is exactly in the United States. "</p>
<p>Austin transferred from Tokyo, Japan to Singapore to attend the Shangri -La dialogue on Thursday that China refused to meet as "unfortunate". "I think the Ministry of National Defense should talk to each other often, or to establish a communication channel."Image source, EPA</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The Shangri -La dialogue ushered in the 20th session.</p>
<p>The Global Times of the CCP's "People's Daily" quoted "a Chinese scholar" on Friday, saying: "Just like the role played by the United States in the Russian conflict, the United States has continued to do things in Asia Pacific, trying to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this area in order to disrupt this region in order Fishing from it. "</p>
<p>"However, the United States never wants to directly conflict with a big country. It is afraid of wiping guns and getting angry.</p>
<p>Allen Connery, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Strategy, believes that Sino -US relations are not tight, so that the entire forum will be shadowed.</p>
<p>Connerly said to BBC: "By bringing both the United States and China to Southeast Asia to publish its position, this can force them to think about what the region wants to develop in this area and what they can do to ease tension. "</p>
<p>At the Japan Seventh -National Group (G7) summit held in May, US President Joe Biden had predicted that Sino -US relations were expected to thaw, and Huafu's internal "consultation" was also "negotiating" to lift the sanctions against Li Shangfu.</p>
<p>The G7 leaders also said in a joint statement that countries hope to seek reducing risks in relations with China rather than De-Couple.</p>

<p>Taiwan's security issues have continued to become Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>But Dr Lynn Kuok, a senior researcher at the Asia -Pacific Security Institute, who is also from the Institute of International Strategy, told Reuters that she was not optimistic about improving US -China relations.</p>
<p>"We should focus here to arrange guardrails to prevent compete from falling into the whirlpool and evolving into an open comprehensive conflict.</p>
<p>Yang Nianzu, the former Minister of Defense, who attended the meeting, pointed out to the Taiwan Central News Agency that he expects that Li Shangfu will show that China ’s position on Taiwan’ s issue and elaborates China's security strategic blueprint. The two sides will have relatively tit -tat words.</p>
<h3>North Korean missile threat</h3>
<p>Singapore's "Straits Times" quoted Dr. Zhuang Jiaying, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science at the National University of Singapore, said that it will continue to support Ukraine's anti -Japanese war, control the North Korean and Iranian weapons and missile plans, and how to cope with the spillover effect of the Myanmar civil war. Focus.</p>
<p>Compared to China and the United States, "passing by", South Korean Minister of Defense Li Zhongzheng will meet Li Shangfu during the dialogue. According to the Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean side will clearly point out at the meeting that North Korea ’s nuclear guidance provokes to severely damage regional peace and stability, and calls on China to play a constructive role to promote North Korea's restraint and provocations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65761995">Korean Wednesday (31st) launched spy satellites failed</a>On the eve of the dialogue, the official North Korean Society issued a document to warn the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) activities in the Asia -Pacific region. Jensstoltenberg, Secretary -General of NATO, condemned the satellite launch of the North Korean satellite. It was the origin of this article.</p>
<p>The article said: "If, the launch of my country's military reconnaissance satellites makes NATO worry, which clearly shows that NATO tries to the insidious heart of the opportunity to intervene in the Asia -Pacific affairs on the grounds of the unnecessary 'North Korea threat'."</p>
<p>"Recently, the increasingly active NATO, Japan and South Korea's representative office and network joint training are representative evidence, which indicates that the military collusion activities of the Atlantic and Pacific aggression forces have entered a dangerous signal of a comprehensive implementation stage."</p>
<p>"If NATO continues to attempt to infringe the sovereignty and security interests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we will regard NATO as the same opponent as the United States to deal with it."</p>
<p>In May this year, Japan confirmed that NATO will set up a liaison office in Tokyo in July, but at the same time clarify that Japan has no intention of applying to join NATO. In addition to North Korea, China also set up a offices to propose dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Chen Yaohua, assistant professor of Chinese research at the Chinese University of International Education (Akita International University) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65774317">Earlier to BBC Chinese</a>The interaction between Japan and NATO is at least in the short term, which is more symbolic than substantial significance.</p>
<p>Richard Bates, a senior researcher at the American Foreign Relations Association, commented on the BBC that North Korea has difficulty in the United States because of its nuclear weapons and its own "crazy" characteristics. However, the United States needs to guarantee the long -term commitments of the allies to South Korea. It is a way to explain these guarantees to the local and US military soldiers and register defense resources to the local area.</p>

<p>Description: (AFP, Washington, 2nd) The U.S. Department of Labor announced today that 339,000 newly -employed people in May were more than in April and much higher than analyst expectations; The Federal Federal Preparatory Council (FED) still has the opportunity to suspend interest rate hikes this month.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-02T15-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />In May, the new employment population in the United States was far higher than the 294,000 people after April amended. The unemployment rate rebounded by 3.7%from the lowest point in history.</p>
<p>The May employment report in the United States also showed that the average salary increased by only 0.3%, an increase of 0.4%in April.</p>
<p>High Frequency Economics Chief American Economist Rubeelafarooqi said: "Data shows that American employment continues to grow rapidly, but the pressure of salary has not increased."</p>
<p>Although the Fed will have 10 degrees of high interest rates since the beginning of last year in order to reduce the popularity of US economic enthusiasm and crack down inflation; the US job market still maintains unexpected intensity. The latest data may make central bank officials think about whether to suspend interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>Faruch pointed out that although the new employment population in the United States in May exceeded analysts, salary data may still allow Feds to have space to maintain monetary policy.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Bank decision officials will hold a meeting in mid -month. Some high -level officials have released messages this week, saying that this time may support the suspension of interest rates.</p>
<p>Their key claims are that when Fed officials decide whether they need to take more action, they should focus on the delayed effect of spreading interest rates to the US economy so far.</p>
<p>The part where the decision -making officials are particularly concerned that the demand for American workers is strong. If the salary is continuously growing, the inflation may not fall; but if the salary growth has not risen, it may ease the pressure on the central bank's interest rate increase.</p>

"I think a feminist will do one thing, first of all, to do some leading actions. The second is to speak loudly and shout out their appeals loudly."</p>
<p><strong> From feminist reflection of ritual power </strong></p>
<p>In China to grow up and receive education, Que's said that she had a vague understanding of the "June 4th" in the past. She only knew that "very bad things" had happened in Tiananmen. After going to Britain to study in the UK, after being asked by local classmates, she was in, and she was in. Search online, so I really understand what the "June 4th" is. However, for her, the real political enlightenment is the feminist theory read in the UK, so that she doubts the Chinese system full of patriarchal color.</p>
<p>"I realize that feminism cannot be separated from politics, because when we have to reach our rights, we must have certain political impacts, and then get some political rights." Que's I think it is not only a totalitarian government, it is also a very patriarchal and patriarchal system. For example, some diplomatic methods made by Xi Jinping are like a 'strong man ideological', which is what he wants to be a strong man. In the party, women and ethnic groups are the same as vases. "</p>

<p>On the other hand, she also re -reflected that the Eighth and Ninth Study Games, which is a precedent for the Chinese resistance movement. She believes that this movement is dominated by men, and women are more logistical. However, their contributions have been ignored in the past 30 years. "When I have learned some of the more familiar theories of feminist, such as power levels, inequality of power, and how women are exploited by invisible ways, and why women are always erased in history. In fact, this has certain June 4th. Related, many women are working hard during the June 4th period, but you will see the photos taken, as well as the documents left, and the like, which are actually men. "</p>

During the 89th school movement, Wang Chaohua, who participated in the Beijing University Student Autonomous Federation (Gao Zilian), was a few female student leaders of the year. The Beijing Public Security Bureau released only two women two women and Chai Ling released by the 21 -person wanted list released after the "June 4th". Wang Chaohua recalled that at the end of April 1989, a few days after Hu Yaobang's memorial service, when she first went to Peking University to meet with the student leader, Chai Ling brought her to a boys' dormitory and introduced Feng Congde.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T16-18-00-04-00/000011.png" />On behalf of graduate students, Wang Chaohua, who participated in the Beijing University Student Autonomous Federation (Gao Zilian), was one of the few female student leaders of that year. (Provided by Wang Chaohua) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/al-06022023095528.html/m0602al-2.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T16-18-00-04-00/000012.png" /></a>She said that the common phenomenon of that year was the meeting of all student leaders, which were carried out in the boys' dormitory. The room was full of boys. The girls were more assisted from the side, so that she felt the gender difference: "For example, I from us from us When the school goes to Peking University and other schools, to see the status of sports, to understand and communicate, you must go to every school for a boys' dormitory. Yes, positive girls have basically become the secretary of active boys, and girls are basically auxiliary and supported characters. "</p>
<p>Wang Chaohua is 37 years old during the school movement. He is the older graduate student among the student leaders. Therefore, he has won the respect of other student leaders. It is comparable to women's identity and free voice. Looking back at that year, Wang Chaohua believed that she and Chai Ling played different roles in the school movement, but they couldn't get out of gender: "I am a much larger role as an age than everyone, and then it can play a balance. Small, but passionate, pure, and ideal. From the beginning of the hunger strike to the end, there are a strong appeal image. "</p>

"Of course I have been there, I am a woman in myself, but my gender identity is basically marginalized, or wiped out. For more than 30 years, you are the first to find me. From a gender perspective, more than 30 years. Although as a woman, although they are commemorating each year, this gender role is erased in history. Or marginalized. "</p>
<p><strong> The feminist voice absent from the 89th school movement </strong> **</p>
<p>From the perspective of Beijing citizen Lu Jinghua at that time, although there were not many female leaders in the school movement, many women participated in miscellaneous and supported work. At that time, she opened a clothing store in Beijing. She was infected with students' movement. She simply closed the door and did not do business. She pushed a bicycle to raise donations and send materials for students: "I watched a group of students holding donations boxes, and a group of students were in Tiananmen Square is on a hunger strike. Then many students are from other places. They do n’t eat or drink. We can support it if you can support it, because after all, it is a foreign child. We can give it a little help. "She said," Anyway At the time, the citizens came to support, and they were particularly actively given some supplies. The soda bought at home, a box of boxes and a box of buns and buns at home. "</p>
<p>Lu Jinghua also joined the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation (Workers' Union) to organize the workers' movement. She served as the latest news of the broadcasting campaign on Tiananmen Square, as well as the manuscripts of various masses to spread the voices of workers and different groups. Looking back at the time, she said that students and the masses had the demands of anti -corruption, fighting for the rights and interests of workers, and political reform, but they had hardly heard the voices of fighting for women's rights."After all, the education we receive is traditional education, to restrain our thoughtful ideas. Including human rights, there are new words in our eyes, and they all come overseas to know. Is there any awareness of rights to women? , But in this movement, its voice is very weak, and it seems that we have not deliberately brought out the topic, saying that we want to raise women's rights. "As a woman, Lu Jinghua also admitted that she had no consciousness more than 30 years ago to speak for feminism.</p>
<p><strong> After the "June 4th", political reforms ended women into political vases </strong></p>
<p>Wang Chaohua also said that she participated in the Beijing university student dialogue delegation. When the student was preparing to talk to the government, the feminist appeal was never included in the agenda. However, in fact, she believes that the social status of women during the 1989 Studies Games retreats during the Cultural Revolution. The reason is that after the CCP has gone out of the Cultural Revolution and entered the economic reform, many social issues including men and women, including men and women, have been abandoned.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong advocated that "women can top half the sky" and encourage women to get out of their families and participate in the public domain. However, Wang Chaohua believes that with the end of the political reform in the "June 4th", the social status of Chinese women is getting lower and lower -the social tradition is increasingly required that women should be obedient; in the political system, women have become vases and become more than vases and become even more become more vases and become even more. The victims in the struggle of power and nobles: "The economic reform of the nearly two or 30 years, the bureaucrat is basically the noble, and at the same time, there is the right to and money. When it is black and greedy, it often comes out. In the political struggle, the role of sexual services. Not only the officialdom, including the big companies, all of them have become a matter of course and publicly accepted. So this is a social reality that is very unfriendly to women. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T16-18-00-04-00/000017.png" />Wang Chaohua believes that many professional women who have received higher education have come forward to participate in the "white paper movement" and admire them very much. (Provided by Wang Chaohua) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/al-06022023095528.html/m0602al-5.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T16-18-00-04-00/000018.png" /></a>The latest report released by the United Nations to the Women's Discrimination Commission recently pointed out that there are no women in the 7 Standing Committee of the 20 Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, and among the 24 Politburo members, there are no women for the first time in 20 years. Among the 14th China National People's Congress, the proportion of women is less than 27%. The committee is concerned about the lack of women in China's highest leadership, and urges the Chinese government to increase the number of women in decision -making and government departments. The committee also expressed concerns about the reports of Chinese women's human rights defenders' intimidation and harassment.</p>
<p>Lu Jinghua believes that it is the current system of China that there will be tragedies like the "iron chain girl". However, Xi Jinping's wife Peng Liyuan, although the title of "Women and Children's Special Envoy" of the UNESCO, did not say a word to the situation of the "iron chain woman": "What contribution of Peng Liyuan to Chinese women? Does a singer? Does she go to the grassroots level? Does she know the pain of Chinese women? If you really understand, you really represent Chinese women, and a 'iron chain woman' was exposed in March last year. Chinese women, who spoke at the International Women's Congress, I think it is a violation of the title of women's representatives, which is unacceptable. "</p>
<p><strong> Chinese women who came out of the "White Paper Movement" from silence to explosion </strong></p>
<p>Lu Jinghua said that when she worked as an overseas Chinese human rights agency, many grass -roots women in China were overwhelmed and risked to her. Dissatisfaction with the system.</p>
<p>Wang Chaohua believes that the long -term oppression of Chinese society has made many professional women who have been educated from higher education to participate in the "White Paper Movement" and admire them very much: "White paper sports, we see that standing in front, most Some are girls. Including arrested, they are basically girls. It is really a very eye -catching social change. You can see that feminist consciousness is entering the new generation, and women who have been educated have a conscious consciousness. "</p>

<p><strong> Tags: lack of evidence, misleading </strong></p>
<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>"Most respondents in the world oppose NATO intervene in Asia Pacific." China State -owned Media Central Radio and Television Channel China Global Television Network (CGTN) quoted its polls on May 29 that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Kishida confirmed on the 24th that the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) plans to set up a contact in Tokyo next year At the time, as many as 70 % of the respondents expressed the "strong opposition" position.</p>
<p>However, the Asian factual investigation of the laboratory found that the report only explained that the survey was conducted on the "CGTN multiple language official website platforms", but there was no basic information that provided polls. In addition to the official website, CGTN has also launched a poll for "whether to agree with NATO's liaison offices in Japan" on its official Twitter account. However, CGTN deleted the Twitter poll page, and did not explain the reasons for deletion in later reports. In summary, the conclusion that "70 % of the people oppose NATO's Asia -Pacific" given by the CGTN polls are unbelievable and suspected of misleading the public.</p>

<p>NATO's settlement in Japan will attract international attention. CGTN will be [English] on May 29th <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-05-29/CGTN-Poll-NATO-involvement-in-Asia-Pacific-opposed-by-70-globally-1kcu7oTVVQs/index.html">English</a>, <a href="https://espanol.cgtn.com/news/2023-05-29/1663092793195958273/index.html">Spanish</a><a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?t=1685348111764&amp;toc_style_id=feeds_default&amp;share_to=wechat&amp;track_id=8D7289A3-1D88-4A06-8D2F-AD679A3585F9_707040969604&amp;item_id=8698853393988945642">Chinese</a>Published related reports. In English reports, CGTN mentioned that recently launched a network poll on the "multi -language network platform", as a result of 71.1%of the respondents "strongly opposed" NATO approach. The report pointed out that in different languages, more than 80 % of the respondents were opposed to this possible measure on the platforms of Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian. If the country is based on the country, the proportion of Russian interviewees is the highest, reaching 92%. The lowest opposition on the English platform website is 54%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T18-45-29-04-00/000004.png" />CGTN's poll results released by Western language intercept the CGTN Western Twitter account <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06022023183139.html/pic-2-screenshot.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T18-45-29-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> "Global" polls lack of survey methods </strong></p>
<p>SCOTKEETER, a senior investigation consultant at Pew Research Center, has written an article explaining how the polls should be provided to the audience. , "How many people visit", "execution methods", "whether there are weighted results" and "questionnaire title" and so on.</p>
<p>Kit believes that many polls are not even randomly sampled now, but to allow the people to voluntarily or choose to participate in the investigation through various technologies. How can these polls accurately represent people? Although some executive units will be adjusted through weighted, this survey is of poor representativeness, and it is also vulnerable to the influence of false respondents -that is, they are not qualified to participate in the investigation or provide a sincere answer.</p>
<p>Dai Li'an, an expert in Taiwan polls, told the Asian factual investigation laboratory in June 1 that CGTN did not provide detailed information such as the gender, age, education level, and country of the respondents. At the same time, the investigation on the network platform itself is not rigorous, because there are many fake accounts in social media such as Twitter. Even if hundreds of thousands of people submit questionnaires, they may not have sample representativeness and authenticity.</p>
<p><strong> What did CGTN do on Twitter? </strong></p>
<p>In this poll, a "deleted text" operation on the Twitter platform also caused doubts.</p>
<p>On May 26, CGTN initiated a vote on Twitter to ask the netizens "whether to support NATO to set up a liaison office in Japan." Federal Senator Ted Cruz's former bill assistant Michaelsobolik (Discovery](https://twitter.com/michaelsobolik/status/1662431259165970432?s=20), CGTN will quickly delete the tweet. The screenshot of Su Bolik showed that at least 3 am on the 26th, the voting tweet still existed. As of the time, 86.5%of the participants supported NATO to set up a liaison place in Japan. Asian factual inspection laboratories cannot independently confirm and check the exact time point of CGTN delete Twitter voting.</p>
<p>However, the real -time voting on Twitter is not in the English report content subsequently issued by CGTN, and the report did not mention that CGTN itself deleted the vote on Twitter.On the matter of "deleting the results of the Twitter platform polls", the Asian facts investigated the laboratory to let the CGTN inquire about the reason, and hoped to know how many people and which platforms participated in voting. By the time of the draft, CGTN did not reply.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T18-45-29-04-00/000006.png" />CGTN deleted the survey results of the Twitter platform, but did not explain the reason. Screenshot of Su Bolik's tweet <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06022023183139.html/pic-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-02T18-45-29-04-00/000007.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>"民调"的诱导性问题</strong></p>
<p>亚洲事实查核实验室同时发现，CGTN设计的 <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/vote/dAA/index.html"> 提问 </a>There is a prerequisite for premium, such as:</p>
<p>Question 1: As a country with a history of aggression against other countries, Japan has sought to expand its military strength in recent years. Are you worried?</p>
<p>Question 5: With the support of the United States, NATO has continuously expanded the scope of military forces and intervened in regional affairs. Do you think NATO has become a tool for the United States to protect hegemony and pursue political interests?</p>
<p>Dai Lian criticized this that although there are not many questionnaires, "each question is full of induction", the purpose of the questionnaire is to highlight the position of the executive unit. He said: "CGTN's survey is‘ pushpoll ’.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the specified poll results report will explain its sample quantity, valid samples, confidence rates, polls for time and sampling positive and negative error values. The results of the CGTN poll results only quoted the results of the survey on their official website, and the above basic information was not explained. The problem design is also guided, and has not been explained to delete the voting results on the Twitter platform.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the Asian facts check the laboratory that the poll of CGTN itself lacks scientific and credible. CGTN is based on the report that "more than 70 % of the global interviewees in the world strongly oppose NATO's Asia Pacific" report released by this poll. It is also misleading public opinion.</p>

<p>The research survey showed that the respondents expressed only 55%of the "Wu Tong" Taiwanese in Beijing, and 33%of the respondents did not agree to unify Taiwan by force. The results of polls caused public opinion discussion.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's views on cross -strait issues have always been rare because of the sensitivity of issues.</p>
<p>Liu Yao, one of the author, told BBC in Chinese, "The most important discovery is that the mainland people have a relatively large tolerance for solving the Taiwan problems, not as much as expected. In other words, the research results show that the research results show that the results show that the research results show that Wu Tong did not receive overwhelming support among the interviewees.</p>

On May 28, the local police claimed that "a case that seriously obstructs the order of social management in Nagu Town, Tonghai County", and called on those involved in the case to "surrender" by June 6 to strive for "lenient treatment".</p>
<p>The conflict is accused of being related to the demolition of the mosque for the authorities. The local court made a judgment in 2020, saying that the reconstruction of the mosque was illegal and ordered the demolition.</p>

<p>On May 28, China's first domestic large aircraft C919 successfully achieved its first commercial flights, flying from Shanghai to Beijing. China hopes that this plane will break the monopoly between Boeing and Airbus, and will share a share in the trillion -level aviation market.

<p>However, the large aircraft is different from the high -speed rail. The latter through technical transfer, digestion, and upgrading through technical transfer, digestion and upgrading in just three or four years, key components such as large aircraft engines are still dependent on Europe and the United States. It is believed that under the increasingly tense geopolitical pattern, it is always in danger of technology "card neck" at any time.</p>
<p>So, where is the future of a large domestic aircraft? Can Chinese large aircraft replicate the success of the high -speed rail?</p>

<p>The U.S. Treasury has warned that if the debt limit is not resolved on the 5th of this month, the US $ 31 trillion debt in the United States may breach contract. The US debt default may cause market panic, a large number of unemployment and economic recession, affecting the world.</p>

<p>Description: A study by the Atlantic Council of the American Think Tank showed that since Russia has fully invaded Ukraine, some countries such as China have strengthened trade with Russia, but they are far less than India, Turkey, Greece and other countries. In addition, there are signs that China has maintained a certain restraint in economic exchanges with Russia.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to a research report from the Atlantic Council of the American Think Tank, since the beginning of 2022, some countries have added trade with Russia, including non -allied countries and even some EU member states. The report believes that the surge in trade with Russia is not necessarily the indicator of the war that supports Putin, but it is more likely to be the result of cheaper export goods in the company and the country to fill the new gap in the Russian market.</p>
<p>The report wrote that countries that have increased sharply with Russia include Turkish NATO, Turkey, Greek, EU member states, and India in the United States. In 2022, India's trade with Russia increased by nearly 250%year -on -year, Greece's trade with Russia increased by 100%year -on -year, and Turkey's trade with Russia increased by 93%year -on -year. India and Turkey provide an important lifeline for the key areas of the Russian economy. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/印俄石油交易正在削弱美元的主导地位/a-64921007">India has surpassed the European Union, becoming the second largest oil export destination in Russia after China</a>。土耳其现在是俄罗斯电子机械和零部件的重要供应商，包括集成电路和半导体。土耳其公司还向俄罗斯大量出口化学品、塑料、橡胶制品和车辆。在七国集团的压力下，土耳其已同意停止向俄罗斯转运受制裁货物。</p>
<h3>中俄贸易去年增加27%</h3>
<p>报告指出，虽然中国是俄罗斯最大的贸易伙伴，中俄贸易额去年达到创纪录的1880亿美元，但是，其增长幅度同比仅为27%。"考虑到中国的经济规模是俄罗斯第二大贸易伙伴土耳其的20倍以上，中俄贸易并不那么突出，低于许多美国盟友和伙伴与俄罗斯的贸易额。"</p>
<p>报告认为，中俄贸易增加与俄罗斯从2013年开始的"向东看"战略有关。此外，2022年人民币对美元和卢布都贬值，也增加了中国对俄罗斯出口的竞争力。从中国的角度看，中俄贸易额相当于中国和马来西亚的贸易额，远低于中国与越南的贸易额。而这两个经济体的规模只有俄罗斯的五分之一。</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>The initial ally</h3>
<p>On the second day of the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the Soviet Union became the first country to establish diplomatic relations with China. At the end of the year, Mao Zedong went to Moscow to visit and stayed in the Soviet Union for more than two months to participate in the 70 -year -old Japanese celebration life movement (picture). After the incident, Mao Zedong complained that he was not well made by Stalin and the progress of the signing talks was not smooth. On February 14, 1950, Mao Zedong signed the "Sino -Soviet Friendship Alliance Mutual Aid Treaty" in Moscow, and the two countries and the Soviet Union were ally.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>"Big Brother" in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>From the 1950s to the early 1960s, it was regarded by the outside world as the "honeymoon period" of Sino -Soviet relations. The two parties signed a series of agreements. The Soviet Union provided China, materials and personnel from trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry aspects. Aid to help China build a complete industrial system. The first "five -year plan" formulated by the Chinese government in 1953 was introduced by the help and planning of the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong emphasized that he would learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects, "the Soviet Communist Party is our best gentleman." The picture shows a report from the 6th anniversary of the Sino -Soviet Friendship Treaty in 1956.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>Korean War</h3>
<p>The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, China sent troops to participate in the war in October (the picture shows the volunteer army crossing the frozen Yalu River), and directly confronts the United Nations troops dominated by the United States. China calls it "anti -US aid North Korea." The Soviet Union did not directly participate in the war, but provided a large number of weapons and equipment and funding assistance. In June 1953, the two souths of the North and South signed the Banmen Store Agreement: It stipulates that the North Korea and South Korea use the 38 -degree line north of North Korea as a boundary ceasefire, which solidifies the split pattern of the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<h3>From reverse to break to break</h3>
<p>In September 1959, the Soviet leader Khrushchev visited China (pictured) to participate in the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. At that time, the contradictions of the differences between the Chinese and Soviet leaders in the political concept and the strategic interests had emerged. In 1960, Moscow recovered all the Soviet experts that recovered China to abolish various agreements for economic and technological cooperation between the two countries. Beijing has carried out long -term sharp criticism of the Soviet Union's "revisionism" and the foreign policy of the CPSU.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>Border conflict</h3>
<p>China and the Soviet Union are the two neighbors in the world with the longest land border. In 1964, the first round of border negotiations in China and the Soviet Union failed. On June 3, 1969, the Chinese and Soviet troops broke out in the Treasure Island of the Uranus River in the Jiehe River (the picture shows the Chinese defense of the Treasure Island), and both sides have casualties. In the same year, the two countries conflict again on Basai Island, Heilongjiang and Tielekti, Xinjiang. In September, the Chairman of the Soviet Minister's Meeting, Koshin, took the road to Beijing and met with Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai for 3 hours at the airport to achieve a consensus to maintain the status quo and avoid armed conflicts.</p>

<h4>中俄关系变迁：从兄弟、对手到战略伙伴</h4>
<h3>中苏交恶</h3>
<p>勃列日涅夫任苏共领导人后，中苏关系依然处于对峙势态。1966年中国文化大革命开始之后，两国间几乎停止了所有交往。1967年，红卫兵曾冲击苏联驻北京大使馆。图为1969年中苏边境冲突后，包头钢铁厂工人抗议“苏修社会帝国主义”的示威。</p>

<h3>Resisting the Moscow Olympics</h3>
<p>After entering the 1970s, China began to improve relations with Western countries led by the United States. In 1972, Nixon's visit to China opened the door to China's opening to the international community. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was severely sanctions and confrontation due to invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Moscow held the Olympic Games, and China joined the resistance camp of Western countries led by the United States.</p>

<h3>Relationship Normally</h3>
<p>At the end of the Soviet Union, Sino -Soviet relations eased. From October 1982 to June 1988, the special envoys of the China and the Soviet Union conducted 12 rounds of consultation on the normalization of the relationship between the two countries. In May 1989, Gorbachev, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited China to meet with Deng Xiaoping. The two sides published the Joint Bulletin in Beijing, marking the normalization of the relationship between the two countries.</p>

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>From good neighbor to strategic partner</h3>
<p>After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, China announced that Russia was the heirs of the Soviet Union. The highest levels of the two countries began to recover. In 1999, the "List of Two Sections on the East and West of the Sino -Russian Boundary Line" was signed. After Pujing came to power in 2001, Russia signed the "Treaty of China -Russia and Russia's Neighbors and Friendship Cooperation" to determine the strategic collaboration partnership of equal trust. In 2010, the two countries confirmed the "comprehensive strategic collaboration partnership".

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>to the international stage</h3>
<p>After entering the new thousand years, with the increase in economic strength, Beijing and Moscow intend to play a more active role on the international stage. The multilateral platforms such as the BRICS Summit and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (established in 2002) provided opportunities for this.

<h3>Friendship of Political Strong Man</h3>
<p>Xi Jinping and Putin, the two authoritative authoritarian leaders, have similar political beliefs of a large country. While firmly consolidating its own power, they also hope to break the existing international order led by the United States. During the visit to Beijing in February 2022 and attending the Winter Olympics, China emphasized that China and Russia were "unlimited friendship and endless cooperation."

<h4>Sino -Russian relations change: from brothers, opponents to strategic partners</h4>
<h3>is not an ally, it looks like an ally</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war in February 2022, Russia has been sanctioned and isolated internationally. However, China has always refused to condemn Russia's aggression, and accusing the United States and NATO in charge of conflict, opposing sanctions, and calling on the "security concerns" of Russia. At the same time, China has greatly expanded imports from Russia, especially energy imports. In March 2023, Xi Jinping visited Moscow and became the first head of head of the Ukrainian war since the outbreak of the Ukrainian war.</p>

<h3>China has maintained restraint in economic exchanges with Russia</h3>
<p>The report of the Atlantic Council believes that "in fact, there are signs that China has maintained a certain restraint in the economic exchanges with Russia, and only when there is an overwhelming interests in Beijing." After Russia invaded Ukraine in February of the year, Bank of China stopped financing to purchase Russian goods. In the entire 2022, China avoided providing funds for any major new investment in Russia. Sinopec and other state -owned enterprises stopped their previous investment plans. Xi Jinping 2023 2023 2023 When visiting Russia in March of the year, he did not immediately reach an agreement on the "Siberian Power 2" as Putin's willingness to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The report said that although there are <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美媒中企对俄出口芯片等具有潜在军事用途产品/a-62498085">China and other foreign companies avoid the sanctions and export controls of the Seventh Kingdoms Group</a>Examples, but "Generally speaking, China seems to abide by Western sanctions and export control because they are worried that they will be subject to US sanctions or second -level sanctions." On the other hand, China continues to extend from the United Nations and the Group of 20 Diplomacy was released, and in 2022, it sold millions of dollars of drones and drone parts worth millions of dollars.</p>

U.S. Defense Minister Lauda Austen said during the meeting that talks with China were the key to avoid conflicts (Reuters).</p>
<p>Chinese military officials have severely criticized US Secretary of Defense Lauda Austin at the Shangri -La dialogue in Singapore. The latter stated that Washington has deep concerns about China's unwilling to contact military crisis control, and warn that the talks avoid conflicts to avoid conflicts. The essential.</p>
<p>Austin delivered a speech at the Supreme Security Summit in Asia on Saturday that the communication channels open between the United States and Chinese defense and military leaders are essential for strengthening the guardrails that prevent conflicts and the stability of the Asia -Pacific region.</p>
<p>Austin said at Singapore's conference, "I am deeply concerned that China (People's Republic of China) has been reluctant to participate in a better crisis management mechanism between the two armies."</p>
<p>Austin said, "The more we talk about, the more you can avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment that may cause crisis or conflict."</p>
<p>Austin specifically mentioned that Chinese aircraft "dangerous interceptions on the US and allies aircraft that legal air in the international air."</p>
<p>Austin, the US Department of Defense, wrote in a series of tweets he spoke at the summit, "We will not be scared by the dangerous operations of maritime or international airspace."</p>
<p>Austin said in another tweet, "It is important to maintain a smooth communication channel with the People's Republic of China -especially the communication channels between our defense and military leaders."</p>
<p>Austin said, "For the responsible national defense leaders, it is a suitable time for conversation at any time. Every time it is a suitable talk time, and now it is the right time for conversation."</p>
<p>He also added, "Dialogue is not a reward. This is necessary."</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation quickly responded to Austin's speech. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Defense Tan Kefei said that the head of the Pentagon "put forward a number of false allegations" in his speech.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaozhuo, a member of the Chinese Military delegation who participated in the "Xianghui" and a researcher at the War Research Institute of the Academy of Military Sciences, said that Washington should not tell China what to do.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaozhuo told reporters, "What our Chinese army does is based on the core interests of maintaining China's security. This is fundamental."</p>
<p>According to "Nanhua Morning Post"(SCMP)It is reported that General Jing Jianfeng, the deputy chief of staff of the Ministry of Staff of the Central Military Commission, specially refuted Austin's remarks on Taiwan.</p>
<p>According to the "South China Morning Post", Lieutenant General Jing Jianfeng said in the summit: "The United States ignores the facts and distort the facts in Taiwan, and is completely wrong." He also added, "First of all, there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is the Chinese territory. Sacred and inseparable part. "</p>
<p>"South China Morning Post" reported: "Jing Jianfeng accused the United States accusing the United States of exchanges between the United States and Taiwan officials, condonning the split activities of Taiwan, and the sale of more powerful weapons to Taiwan, which has been emptied to a Chinese principle."</p>
<p>According to the Nanhua Morning Post, Lieutenant General Jing Jianfeng stated that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been fully prepared to prepare to strengthen the unity of the motherland and defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity at any time."</p>
<p>The relationship between Beijing and Washington is at the lowest point in decades. China and the United States have serious differences in all issues such as issues from Taiwan to the South China Sea dispute.</p>
<p>Austin also mentioned the Russian and Ukraine War in his speech, saying that this was an example of "how dangerous our world would invade its peace neighbors if a big country could invade its peace neighbors."</p>
<p>Austin said that the United States "is firmly committed to" to maintain the status quo of Taiwan and oppose unilateral changes in any side.</p>
<p>Austin said, "It is not imminent or inevitable. Today's deterrence is very strong. Our job is to maintain this deterrence."</p>
<p>Austin said, "What needs to be clear is that we do not seek conflict or confrontation," he also added, "but in the face of bullying or coercion, we will not shrink back."</p>
<p>U.S. military officials have previously stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for the development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.</p>
<p>Austin said in response to the relevant questions about President Xi Jinping's plan for Taiwan, "This does not mean that he has decided to do so."</p>
<p>Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu refused to meet with Austin's invitation at the summit this week. The Pentagon stated that the two shook hands during the meeting, but did not conduct detailed talks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-03T09-04-24/1-1685782347.jpg" />The Asian Security Summit opened in the tension between China and the United States</p>
<p>Austin said, "Careful shaking hands can not replace substantial participation during dinner," he also added that "the United States does not seek a new cold war, and competition must not evolve into conflict."</p>
<h4>"Are you sincere?"</h4>
<p>Peninsula TV reporter Florence LOOI reported from Singapore that the theme of Austin's speech was to keep the Asia -Pacific region "open -trade openness and freely open operations."</p>
<p>Roy added, "He also warns that if there is a conflict between the Taiwan Strait, it will have a devastating impact on other parts of the world."</p>
<p>Austin also said that the United States will continue to strengthen partnerships and alliances in the region by holding more military exercises and ensuring that partners have the ability to prevent aggression.</p>
<p>"How do China think of his speech?"</p>
<p>"We know that many actions in China here are regarded as an attempt to curb its influence and surround it. This summit is held when Sino -US relations become more and more tense."</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu in the United States stated in an email statement on Friday that the exchange between China and the United States is conducive to improving mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The statement talked about, "However, the United States now stated that it is necessary to talk to China, and at the same time seek to suppress China through all possible ways, and continue to impose sanctions on Chinese officials, institutions and enterprises."</p>
<p>"Does such communication have sincerity and significance?"</p>
<p>Another recent hotspot was high -end micro -chip. Beijing said last month that the US semiconductor giant Micron failed to pass the national security review and shall not sell products to operators of "key information infrastructure".</p>
<p>After taking measures in Washington and its allies in recent months, the news was announced. China claims that these measures aims to limit their ability to purchase or create cutting -edge chips and curb their growing global strength.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-03T09-04-24/image-1685782548.jpg" />Our understanding of the "Okus" submarine agreement</p>
<p>Beijing also criticized an agreement to purchase US nuclear -powered submarines announced in March in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia will spend $ 368 billion ($ 250 billion) for the submarine plan in the next 30 years. This is part of the widespread security agreement called "Aukus" signed with the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Austin said, "(Aucus) has promoted greater stability and security."</p>
<p>The Beijing Aukus agreement is regarded as another attempt to try to curb China's growing global power.</p>

<p>According to the English group of this station, US Secretary of Defense Laud Austin urged the Chinese military leaders to contact the Chinese military leaders after meeting with the Chinese National Defense Minister, saying that open communication channels are "important".</p>
<p>Austin said an important speech on the Saudin Shangri -La Dialogue Safety Forum on Saturday that he "deeply concerned that China has always been reluctant to participate more seriously to participate in a better crisis management mechanism between the two countries."</p>
<p>The US National Defense Minister mentioned the formal name used in China was the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>He said, "For the responsible national defense leaders, the appropriate conversation time is at any time. The appropriate conversation time is every time, and now it is a suitable conversation time," he added "Dialogue is not a reward. This is a must must be a must. "The more we talk about, the more you can avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment that may cause crisis or conflict."</p>
<p>The US Secretary of Defense Austin and the Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who has been sanctioned by the United States since 2018, had a brief handshake before the official dinner on Friday, but did not talk or expect them to hold bilateral talks.</p>
<p>"Cute handshake at dinner cannot replace substantial participation," Austin said.</p>
<p>The US Minister of Defense criticized China. He said that China "continues to intercept the number of US and allies aircraft that legal air in the international aim."</p>
<p>Just last week, the U.S. military accused China's J-16 fighter aircraft "unnecessary offensive" maneuverability when intercepting the US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
<p>"We don't seek conflict or confrontation, but we will not shrink back in the face of bullying or coercion," Austin said.</p>
<p>American Strategy and International Research Center(CSIS)A very resident researcher Huong Le THU said that the obvious cracks between the two big powers have "become a new reality."</p>
<p>Huong Le THU told Radio Free Asia that regional countries must accept it regardless of whether they like it.</p>
<p>"But they can reduce the heat by promoting and encouraging dialogue between the United States and China, which helps to control the tension," the researcher added.</p>
<p><strong> Common Vision </strong></p>
<p>Xiao Kalito Galvis, senior deputy minister and supervisor of the Philippine Ministry of Defense(Carlito Galvez Jr.)It said that Manila believes that "international law is the biggest balancer among countries."</p>
<p>The Philippines won a legal lawsuit against China in the South China Sea in the United Nations court in 2016, but Beijing has refused to accept the ruling so far.</p>
<p>The sovereignty issues of some islands in the Nansha Islands have recently been involved in new disputes.</p>
<p>"As the saying goes, good fences are good for neighbors," Galves said. "Only when neighboring countries have clear boundaries and respect the established boundaries can the relationship be truly friendly."</p>
<p>The Indonesian Minister of Defense Plabovo Sophia said, "We must overcome our geopolitical competition and territorial disputes through dialogue, negotiations and win -win solutions."</p>
<p>"Comparative compromises are the only way for community and social prosperity," he said, and warned that the competition between super powers "has become the Cold War. In any war, the danger of disaster is always at hand."</p>
<p>However, US Secretary of Defense Austin insisted that the United States "does not seek a new cold war."</p>
<p>"Competition must not evolve into conflict. The area should never be split into hostile groups," he said.</p>
<p>Austin said Washington has not been created in the Indo -Pacific region as China repeatedly claims, and is not willing to create a new NATO.</p>
<p>However, Austin said that the United States hopes to establish "flexible alliances to promote our common vision" so that the Indo -Pacific region is "more stable and more flexible."</p>
<p>Washington listed Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand as its "firm ally" in the region, and regarded India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Singapore as "important partners".</p>
<p>When talking about autonomy in Taiwan, Austin said that the United States "is still firmly committed to maintaining the status quo there, which is consistent with our long -term Chinese policy and fulfill our established obligations under the Taiwan Relations Law."</p>
<p>"Conflicts are neither immortal nor inevitable. Today's deterrence is strong, and our work is to maintain this deterrence," Austin said.</p>
<p>Beijing regards Taiwan as a province in China and resolutely protests "external forces" to participate in Taiwan's politics.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Jing Jianfeng, deputy minister of the Ministry of Staff of the Central Military Commission of China, returned to Taiwan's Taiwan -related remarks, saying that it was "completely wrong."</p>
<p>"There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is the inseparable part of the Chinese territory." The unification of the motherland is the common desire and sacred responsibility of all the Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots. Motherland. "</p>
<p><strong> China ’s counterattack </strong></p>
<p>A researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences of the Chinese People's Liberation Army said that the United States has been trying to change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Zhao said to reporters at the Shangri -La dialogue: "The Taiwan Strait has been very stable in the past ten years, but the United States wants to destroy this stability."</p>
<p>"In this way, they can sell weapons to Taiwan and make a lot of money," he said.</p>
<p>The Chinese participants of the Singapore Security Forum countered the criticism of the United States and its allies.</p>
<p>The Academy of Zhao said that Washington needs to change what he said in the way he interacts with others.</p>
<p>"In terms of dialogue, you must take care of each other's interests," he said, and accused the United States of not understanding this basic principle.</p>
<p>Another Chinese representative and Zhang Chi University from the National Security Institute of China National Security questioned whether Washington established a multilateral institution while promoting the central status of Southeast Asian Group ASEAN.</p>
<p>At the same time, Major General Tang Yongsheng, the former vice president of the college, countered the Canadian Minister of Defense Anita Aande, saying that China was a destructive force in the region. He said "China has made great efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region."</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece "Global Times" quoted an official of the Chinese military in a report on Saturday, "China is confident to go to the stage to speak."</p>
<p>"Although the Shangri -La dialogue would be a platform led by Western countries, China was still here," the report said.</p>
<p>Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu will make important speeches on Beijing's new security measures on Sunday, the last day of the forum.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Since the first appearance in 1996, H5N1 avian influenza virus has its seasonality in the past explosion period. However, according to Richardwebby, the person in charge of the WHO's Animal Fluid Research Center, the "something happened" in the mid -2021 in the mid -2021, which greatly enhanced the infectious infection of this group of viruses. Since then, the outbreak of flu has continued for a whole year, spreading to new areas, causing a large number of wild birds to die, and tens of millions of poultry was killed.</p>
<h3>New strain is more threatening</h3>
<p>Wabe told AFP that this is definitely the largest bird flu epidemic in the world so far. The research project led by him this week has published a research results in NatureCommunications, exposing how viruses evolved rapidly in the process of spreading from Europe to North America.</p>
<p>The study said that when the virus reaches North America, the toxicity enhances, which means it can cause more dangerous diseases. The researchers also infected a white heales with a new bird flu virus. Wabe said that a large number of viruses were found in the Burchurine's brain, which showed that the new poison strain caused more serious diseases than the previous virus strains.</p>
<h3>Mammal infection The number of infections greatly increases</h3>
<p>While Wob's emphasizing the threat of virus to humans is still very low, he also pointed out: "This virus is not static, it is evolving." He mentioned that the virus may "get genetic characteristics" by accident and become more likely to infect humans. For example, after contacting the infected birds, human beings may infect this sometimes or even fatal virus. Wabe added that the virus was tested on more and more mammals, which was a "very disturbing sign."</p>

This is "the most Let us scare. " </a>Ianbrown, the head of the British Dynamics and Plants Health Bureau, said that there is no "clear evidence that this virus is easy to survive in mammals." Brown told AFP that although this virus has become more threatened to birds, it still "does not adapt to humans."</p>
<p>WW virusist Werbi said that poultry virus is different from human virus with the receptor in the host cells. He said that only "two to three small changes on a protein of the virus" can become more adaptable to humans. He pointed out: "This is what we are really looking for."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-03T10-05-00Z/64996083_401.jpg" />Experts suggest that poultry should be vaccinated for poultry</p>
<h3>Vaccine reduces risk</h3>
<p>Wabe said that one way can help reduce the number of bird flu in the number of bird flu, thereby reducing human risks is that countries vaccinated vaccines for their poultry. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世卫组织中国出现首名h3n8禽流感人类死亡病例/a-65293543">Including China, Egypt, and Vietnam, some countries have launched vaccines for poultry. </a>However, there are still many countries who are unwilling to do so due to certain import and export restrictions, and are worried that poultry that has been vaccinated may still be infected with viruses.</p>
<p>The United States began to test several candidate vaccines that may be used for poultry in April this year; France recently said that he hopes to start vaccination for poultry in the early fall of this year. However, British chief veterinarian ChristineMiddlemiss also mentioned that poultry vaccination is not Wanling, "because the virus will continue to evolve."</p>
<p>MoniqueEloit, director of the World Animal Health Organization, said that vaccination for poultry should be "put on the desktop." She added that after all, "Everyone knows now that big epidemic is not just a fantasy -it may be a reality."</p>

<h4>The top ten most dangerous viruses in the world</h4>
<h3>Marburg Virus</h3>
<p>The most dangerous virus is Malburgh virus. Its name comes from a rural animal husbandry -like town on the Raine River in Germany -but the town has nothing to do with the virus itself. The Malburgh virus is a kind of hemorrhagic virus. Like Ebola virus, Malburgh virus caused convulsions and mucous membranes, skin and organ bleeding. Its mortality rate is as high as 90 %.</p>

<h4>The top ten most dangerous viruses in the world</h4>
<h3>Ebola virus</h3>
<p>There are five species of Ebola virus, named after five African countries and regions: Zaiel, Sudan, Tay Forest, Bendobo and Reston. Zail Ebola virus is the most fatal, with a mortality rate of 90 %. It is currently spread in Guinea, Sierra Leine and Liberia and other regions. Scientists believe that the fruit mart may bring Zail Ebola virus into the city.</p>

<h4>The top ten most dangerous viruses in the world</h4>
<h3>bird flu virus</h3>
<p>Different species of bird flu viruses often cause panic -this can be understood because its mortality rate is as high as 70 %. But in fact, the risk of people's most familiar H5N1 bird flu is very low. Only those who have directly contacted poultry can be infected. This is why most cases appear in Asia, because many Asians have chickens.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brosky will visit Saudi Arabia next week.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the U.S. State Department said on Friday (June 2) that Brins will discuss security and economic issues with Saudi officials. Prior to Brinken, the White House national security adviser Shalvin just visited Saudi Arabia last month.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the relationship between the two countries deepened the relationship between the two sides due to the deepening of differences and distrust. In less than a month, the United States conducted two senior visits to Saudi Arabia in less than a month, showing that Washington was seeking to repair the relationship with the world's largest oil exporter.</p>
<p>Kobe, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said on Friday that Brinken will focus on promoting the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Cerma calls Saudi Arabia as an "important strategic partnership", and he said: "We put our eyes in the future. This does not mean that we always agree with Saudi Arabia's position, nor do they agree with what we do. When there are differences in opinions. "</p>
<p>In the 2018 Saudi column reviewer Kashuji, the incident of Kashuji caused a deterioration of relations with the United States and Saudi Arabia. In February last year, the Russia -Ukraine War broke out, and energy prices soared. US President Biden visited Saudi Arabia in July of the same year to alleviate the pressure of oil. The oil alliance+(OPEC+), which is composed of Organization and other oil -producing countries headed by Saudi Arabia, then announced the reduction of oil production, and US -Saishi's relations have become further cold.</p>
<p>According to the State Council's statement, Blints visited from June 6th to 8th, and will attend the Middle East Security and Integrated Ministerial Meeting of the National Cooperation Commission of the United States-Gulf Arabian National Cooperation on the 7th. On the 8th, Brinken will co -host meetings with Saudi Foreign Minister Ferra to discuss the issue of cracking down on the Islamic national radical organization.</p>

<p>According to the report on the 3rd, China and Russia ignored the United States on Friday that the United States called on the UN Security Council to unite and condemned North Korea to try to launch satellites this week.</p>
<p>Robertwood, a diplomat in the United Nations Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a appeal at the UN Security Council conference organized by the United States and allies to discuss the failure of North Korea's launch satellite on Wednesday. The United States claims that North Korea's failed launch violates a number of UN resolutions because it uses ballistic missile technology.</p>
<p>Wood said: "We call on all members of the Security Council to maintain the reputation of the Security Council, condemn this illegal behavior with us, and urge North Korea not to continue its established plans for another further threatening international peace and security launch."</p>
<p>After the launch, North Korean leader Kim Jong -un's sister Kim and Zheng said that North Korea will soon send a military spy satellite into the track and vowed that Pyongyang will improve its military surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>Geng Shuang, deputy representative of the United Nations in the United Nations, stated at the United Nations meeting that North Korea has "reasonable security concerns" and stated that the Security Council should promote the reduction of upgrades instead of blaming one.</p>
<p>After Geng Shuang spoke, Wood's speech once again pointed out, "The representatives of the Chinese delegation did not condemn North Korea's space launch at any time."</p>
<p>Geng Shuang responded to this that it is necessary to make real conversations and take into account North Korea's concerns.</p>
<p>UN Secretary -General Antonio Guterres said this week that any launch of Pyongyang's use of ballistic missile technology has violated the Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>Kim Kim said that the criticism of satellite launching satellites in North Korea is "contradictory" because the United States and other countries have launched "thousands of satellites".</p>

<p>In 2021, the "June 4th stage" announced its own dissolution, and former chairman Liehui Hui moved to Britain with copyright. This year, the International Amnesty Organization Taiwan Branch was authorized to cooperate with the Taiwan Theater Troupe "Xiao Theater" to move the "May 35th" to the Taiwan stage for the first time, performing 6 consecutive games in Taipei, including a Cantonese reading drama. It is estimated that there are more than 1200 more than 1200 Famous audience.</p>
<p>On the stage, "May 35th" tells the process of the family members of the victims never talked about June 4th to the forward square; in reality, the drama itself has witnessed the huge changes in Hong Kong that can no longer openly mourn.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-03T13-55-00Z/65816358_401.jpg" />The International Terminal Taiwan Branch stated that this is the first time that it commemorates June 4th in Taiwan in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>"Cleaning"</h3>
<p>"In the past, there were no sensitive words in Hong Kong. It was said that" May 35 "was a bit ridiculous that the mainland could not say June 4th, and I never thought that the transformation was so fast." Lie Zhihui, invited to Taiwan to watch the performance, sighed in an interview with DW. "In the past so many years in Hong Kong, we have freedom, and now there is no freedom to mourn."</p>
<p>Hong Kong used to be the largest cities in the world in the world. The Candlelight Gate of Victoria has a history of more than 30 years, attracting tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people each year. This year, the candlelight will be the last 4 consecutive year, and it will be renamed the hometown market to celebrate the "26th Anniversary of the Motherland" by the group group.</p>
<p>When the Hong Kong Security Director Deng Bingqiang talked about June 4th, he only referred to the "special day"; when the chief executive Li Jiachao responded to whether the citizens could mourn their own mourning, the police believed that the offenders would decisively law enforcement. A large number of books are removed from the museum, and the June 4th book is almost clear](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/公共圖書館撤書挨批-特首借書須符香港利益/a-65633101); <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/香港警方扣押国殇之柱-创作者称太离谱/a-65529588">The "Pillar of Guo Yan", which is stored in the University of Hong Kong, was also used by the Hong Kong Police Inspection as an investigation</a>Essence</p>
<p>List of Hui Hui described that the Communist Party of China is trying to "clean" the memories of June 4th in Hong Kong, but <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/六四紀念館紐約開幕-特設香港民運展區/a-65811714">Overseas Hong Kong people will continue to mourn in their own way</a>"Even if it is very small, it is likely to buy a book, maybe wearing a dress, and maybe a candle."</p>

<h3>"Hong Kong and Taiwan on May 35" meaning</h3>
<p>In 2020, the Gengzi version of "May 35" was not performed by the "Hong Kong National Security Law" and the new crown epidemic. The version of that year was specially adapted to add the picture of the streets of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Lie Zhihui told DW that after the anti -repair campaign, it commemorated the new significance in the hearts of many Hong Kong people. For her, June Fourth "is not just a wound of historical, but my living and bleeding wound now."</p>
<p>"In the past June 4th, the first thing I thought of was the students who died that year. I would think of Tiananmen's mother and the mainland rights protection. But every few years to June 4th, I would like to think of friends in Hong Kong. Because some of them are still prison, they are still waiting for trials, and they have been detained for more than 2 years under the case of unruly. The crime of regime, facing 10 years or even life imprisonment. "</p>
<p>She said that she hoped to pass the alarm number to Taiwanese audiences with "May 35": "The CCP's authoritarian regime will actually affect Taiwan ... I hope it can connect everyone and let us maintain a universal value, not simply surrounding June 4th, not simply surrounding June 4th, not, not simply surrounding the June 4th, not to surround the June 4th. (But) How can we connect, fight for democracy and oppose autocratic regimes. "</p>

She said she was busy with the creation of new script and had no time to be interviewed for the time being. However, when asked if she could presented a presence in Taiwan, she replied that the social movements that occurred in Hong Kong after 2019 and everything that happened later made her understand the importance of citizens' quality, media, education, and record history.</p>
<p>Zhuang Meiyan said that she hopes to pass to the audience: "As a Hong Konger, I deeply feel that I have lived in a social happiness with information opening and freedom of speech. But the most important thing is to take care, look at beautiful things, and look at justice. "</p>
<p>Zhong Boyuan, director of the Taiwan version of "May 35", told DW that how to present "Taiwan epitome" is the primary thinking when adaptation. He said that although the stage play tells the story of the June 4th story in China, when the actor speaks Taiwanese Mandarin or Aboriginal tone and Taiwanese comes out from time to time, the audience is likely to be illusory, "this is really telling a Taiwan story."</p>
<p>In addition, the Taiwanese version used 3 banned songs and Sunflower Xueyun songs "The Island Tiantu" during the martial arts period of Taiwan. It is transitional justice, and there is still a long way to go. "</p>
<p>Zhong Boyuan said that Taiwan now naturally enjoys democracy and diversification or freedom, but sometimes it may be forgotten, "How to make everyone know that it is not easy, or in a free situation, how to avoid the next time when they are oppressed. Only to do something. In fact, I think it is the greatest significance reflected in this work. "</p>
<p>Qiu Yizheng, president of the International Territory Organization, said that he hopes to use stage dramas to make Taiwanese audiences better understand June 4th and pay attention to the current situation of human rights in China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-03T13-55-00Z/65816297_401.jpg" />Director Zhong Boyuan (first from left) said how to present "Taiwan epitome" is the primary thinking when adaptation.</p>
<h3>Scholars: Memory erase is not easyLin Zonghong, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Technology and Director of the Contemporary China Research Center of Tsinghua University in Taiwan, told DW that the June 4th incident itself was "the struggle between memory and forgetfulness." When the June 4th memory of Hong Kong was suppressed, overseas Hong Kong people were continuing this common memory in various ways in Taiwan and transformed into a symbol against Beijing's totalitarian.</h3>
<p>Wu Ruiren, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Central Research Institute who studies nationalism, also believes that although the public memory of June 4 in Hong Kong is disappearing, "this disappearance does not mean that memory is really erased because memory is a delicate thing."</p>
<p>For example, "Hong Kong is now very similar to Taiwan in the 228 era, and has experienced a very serious, whether it is physical physical or mental slaughter." The 228 incident was strictly prohibited from talking in the martial arts era of Taiwan, but it was passed down by folk mouth, not only did not disappear, but more ingrained; Hong Kong people were highly global ethnic groups. Taiwan is better. "It is not so easy to erase and identify the memory."</p>
<p>Wu Ruiren believes that the people of overseas Hong Kong people commemorate the June 4th is a practice of preserving the traditional memory and identity of the Hong Kong nation. "This is a long struggle that has just begun."</p>

<h3>Hong Kong "June 4 Memory" transplant Taiwan?</h3>
<p>But compared with Hong Kong, Taiwan is generally colder for June 4th. Can the June 4th memory of Hong Kong transplant Taiwan? Wu Ruiren believes that it is not easy objectively. He explained that this was because the significance of June 4 in Hong Kong and Taiwan was completely different.</p>
<p>Wu Ruiren pointed out that in the hearts of the Hong Kong democratic school that claimed to return to democracy in June 4th, it inspired a stronger sense of responsibility for Chinese democracy. It was not until the umbrella movement and anti -repair campaign, and the young local generation re -defined the meaning of June 4th. However, the process of democratization in Taiwan has always been rooted in the local area. The local factions have regarded June 4 as "other countries' affairs". Taiwanese who commemorate June 4th also start from the position of Chinese nationalism. Universal human rights value.</p>
<p>In addition, Wu Ruiren continued to point out that Taiwan was very good Hong Kong a few years ago, but after the outbreak of the Ukrainian war, because it was worried that similar conflicts might happen to Taiwan, and isolationism became more obvious. Cooling "," This is why I don't think Taiwan can take it to take over or transplant. "</p>
<p>However, Wu Ruiren emphasized that Taiwan has its own history and memory. The current geopolitical crisis will also give June 4th to commemorate the new meaning, such as democratic output or co -resistance. He believes that the so -called transplantation "the growing things must be different, including what has been in Hong Kong in the past, but it also includes things in our Taiwan ... Finally, a new thing that is combined together."</p>
<p>Taiwan scholar Lin Zonghong also pointed out that although Taiwan has no way to fully carry the collective memory of Hong Kong people, it may not be as lively as the June 4th Memorial event in Hong Kong in the past, but it provides at least one commemorative occasion.</p>
<p>"Some people holding different historical memories can start a dialogue here, and then re -create a new, more diverse common memory ... it must not be a simple transplant, or put the past ones The drama will repeat it again -every time the play is restarted, it will become a new life. "</p>
<p>In this regard, Lieminghui believes that Hong Kong and Taiwan experience different experiences and can understand the different reactions of the two places to the June 4th. However, she pointed out that art and drama are a good breakthrough form, which can have a deeper connection with the locals. "May 35" is welcomed in Taiwan this time, not necessarily because the audience is interested in June 4th, but this is also a deeply infectious family story. She said that she will continue to do "May 35" in the future, hoping to connect more people around the world.</p>
<p>"I don’t return to Hong Kong, because this is a high risk that I do now, and I think this is a price. If you choose to return to Hong Kong, you may have the opportunity to be arrested and detained .. So I decided to decide If you don't return to Hong Kong, I will continue to do "May 35", "she said.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65816473/65779052"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-03T13-57-00Z/65779052_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany) Russian President Putin received an invitation to the BRICS conference. South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said that the BRICS heads of state-China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Russia-all were invited to attend the BRICS Summit scheduled to be held in August.</p>
<p>For the leaders of the four countries, this is only a arrangement on the schedule, but for Russian President Putin, the situation is quite embarrassing. Because once he set foot on South Africa, he would be arrested and extradited. In March of this year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/国际刑事法院对普京发出逮捕令/a-65035499">International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Putin</a>Essence South Africa, as a parties to the Roman Statue, is obliged to execute the arrest warrant and extradite Putin. However, South African officials have previously announced that all members participating in international conferences enjoy diplomatic exemption.</p>
<h3>exemption right is not far away</h3>
<p>However, the Dean of the Nuremberg Principles International College and the Criminal Law and International Law Professor of Erlangen-Nuremberg University, Christophsafferling, said that "the existence of exemption is to promote international law and international relations." Under the premise of the national court's prosecution.</p>
<p>The exemption is not far away. In the past, the International Criminal Court insisted on a number of judgments that in front of the International Court, even the current head of state had no exemption. "This is the law of the Roman Statue, there is no exception," Saverinen said.</p>
<p>In other words, the president of a country, which was wanted due to the international criminal arrest warrant, has no legal effect on the meeting. Even in South African law, because there have been precedents before. Putin is the current head of the second place to be arrested by the International Criminal Court. The first was then the then Sudan President Omar Bali. In 2015, he went to South Africa to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>At that time, South Africa should have extradited this dictator, but he <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/苏丹总统狼狈逃离南非/a-18517610">left South Africa before issuing a arrest order in the South African Court</a>Essence "After that, the South African Constitution Court ruled that South Africa should have arrested him, and the government violated the laws of its country. This principle is still applicable. This means that not extradance of Pujing will violate international law and South African law." (HSFK) Researcher Kristoffer Burck said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-03T13-57-00Z/65437091_401.jpg" />Former Sudan President Omar Balle has not been sent to the International Criminal Court</p>
<h3>Putin can be a guest gold brick summit?</h3>
<p>So what happens? Is Putin still attend a meeting in South Africa? Theoretically is feasible, because there are only a little sanctions method in the International Criminal Court. "They can condemn the existence of the arrest warrant and the emphasis must be executed, and then it is clearly stated that they can be condemned. But that's only that." Because different from the country, the International Criminal Court did not implement the current laws. Police power.</p>
<p>Therefore, the International Criminal Court can only rely on the respect of the contract to the Roman Statue. "Anyone who does not follow and does not support execution will weaken the international criminal court. This is obvious, because the arrest order is lost, it is just a piece of paper. This will be a weakened to the international court, and "Saverine said.</p>
<p>Initially, the arrest order to Putin was considered a strong signal. Even a powerful politician like Putin will be investigated for criminal responsibility. Saverine said: "The International Criminal Court did do this, the purpose is to clearly indicate its existence, and indicate that it can do it, is willing to do it, and will be executed." He believes that overall international law has become more important to become more important. Essence</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-03T13-57-00Z/65118833_401.jpg" />In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin</p>
<p>Different from Bohil in South Africa in 2015, people now start to discuss the arrest warrant beforehand and see it as a matter of serious treatment. "Now we can't easily ignore this, and even have an arrest order. This must be considered in diplomatic negotiations. This is actually a very good news."</p>
<p>However, HSFK researcher Borke is not so optimistic. He was worried that the arrest warrant of the current well -known head of state may have a negative rebound effect on the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>"There is a very high risk that there will be such a situation, that is, someone is sued, but after many years, it has not been arrested. In fact, it can be assumed that if Putin does not make any mistakes, he will not be arrested. This means that this means There will be a case that has been suspended after years or even decades. This is very dangerous for the court's practical function of justice to stretch justice. "</p>
<p>There are not many similar cases. Putin is the second head of state to be arrested. The success or failure of the International Criminal Court depends largely on the attitude of its member states.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The German "Commercial Daily" published by Dusseldorf is "<a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/gastbeitraege/gastkommentar-global-challenges-deutschland-droht-ein-china-schock/29174284.html">Germany is facing the threat of shock from China</a>"The title, published a customer comments written by Daliamarin, a professor of economics at Munich University of Science and Technology. The author pointed out that a large number of imports of Chinese goods have led to the decline in the American local industry, which has paved the way for Trump's entry into the main White House; but now it is now Germany also faces similar fate.</p>
<p>The author noticed that the export volume of Chinese automobiles has surpassed Germany last year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国一季度汽车出口超过日本-俄罗斯成为最大海外市场/a-65668908">this year is about to surpass Japan</a>And consumers, including China, are interested in German cars. "Compared with BYD and Weilai Automobile with advanced batteries and sensor technology, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国电动车在中国市场步履蹒跚/a-65359971">German electric vehicles are almost out of date</a>Essence For decades, German engineers have gone to improve in the field of internal combustion engines, but the electric vehicle revolution is threatening the overall technical advantage of the German automotive industry. "</p>
<p>"Given the automotive industry is an important employment engine in Germany, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国车市燃起价格战-德国车商面临大风险/a-65029191">German economy is facing the threat of shock from China</a>Essence The United States and other countries have experienced a 'China shock': After China joined the WTO in 2001, many Western manufacturers face the strong competition of Chinese companies; first of all, low -value products such as clothing, furniture, and more complicated products such as computers and electronic devices Essence From 2000 to 2010, the proportion of Chinese manufacturing products in the total imports in the United States increased by 25 percentage points, which accelerated the industrialization of the United States 'rust belt', and also paved the road for Trown in 2016. Various signs show that Germany is also experiencing its own 'Chinese shock': In 2022, the number of cars imported from China exceeded the number of cars exported to China for the first time. ... There are similar trends in the field of mechanical manufacturing. "</p>
<p>"This is really a historic irony. The process of rapid industrialization of China is initially attributed to a large number of imported cars and machinery from Germany. In the past 30 years, Germany has established a joint venture factory with China in the past 30 years. . The Chinese government transferred the technology of this situation as a condition for market access. "</p>
<h3>Shanghai has become a city of electric</h3>
<p>"Today China has risen into an industrial country. Compared with Germany, China has two advantages: First, they are <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/电动汽车/t-41781394">electric vehicle</a>The times do not need to make up in the field of internal combustion engines. Secondly, the huge scale of China has made a large number of production possible, thereby rapidly lowering the cost. Now, China is already a global market leader in the field of lithium -ion battery, and will soon develop sodium ion batteries. "</p>
<p>"Multiple factors have allowed the past Germany to avoid 'Chinese shock': Commodities from China are mainly competing with products in low -wage countries such as Turkey and Greece. In addition, German companies broaden their industrial chain to Eastern European countries, which has improved production efficiency and reduced costs. Over the years, Germany has also benefited from the Chinese economy. "</p>
<p>"However, Germany can no longer avoid the negative effects that other countries have experienced. Although the reconstruction of Ukraine after the Ukrainian war is expected to provide German companies with opportunities similar to after -Cold War, the premise is the end of the war. In the short term, this war, this war Unlikely to end. However, the German political circles still have the opportunity to avoid industrialization like the United States. Germany should actively <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不忧欧中关系-中国电池厂商正式在德国量产/a-64539329">attract Chinese battery manufacturers</a>, Asian Semiconductor Enterprise, Israeli startups come <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国萨尔州-不会阻止比亚迪收购福特工厂/a-64673183">Direct Investment</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马克龙吸引外资成功-台中电池厂落户法国/a-65628858">Opening a joint venture</a>Essence This helps German engineers to make up for the shortcomings of knowledge.

The author pointed out that a authoritarian regime can suppress the people and eliminate opponents, but the spirit of freedom will not disappear.</p>
<p>"For many years, China has been expanding its hysterical monitoring system. Camera and central databases are monitoring the people of their own country. All the information of each individual will be recorded. However, even such a system Resistance. The reason is very simple: a political active person deliberately discloses his identity. The government monitoring system is becoming more and more strict and cannot change the former attitude. In addition, political active people are also preparing to accept the price of imprisonment or even worse. The monitoring system cannot also change this. "</p>
<p>The author pointed out that since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has experienced <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/六四事件/t-17457912">June 4th</a>A series of democratic movements, including.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-03T14-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />Although experts emphasize that the current situation is still low in the risk of humans; they point out that the case of bird flu in mammals is significantly rising and worrying.</p>
<p>The H5N1 virus appeared for the first time in 1996, and it was roughly limited to seasonal popularity. However, Richardwebby, director of the Animal Influential Research and Cooperation Center of the World Health Organization (WHO), said that in the middle of 2021, "some changes occurred", which led to a significant increase in bird flu virus infectious.</p>
<p>Since then, the bird flu epidemic has become unknown throughout the year, and has spread to a new area, causing a large number of wild birds to die and tens of millions of poultry.</p>
<p>Weiby, who is also a researcher at the St. Jude Children's Researchhospital of MEMPHIS, told AFP that the scale of the world's avian influenza epidemic in the past period was "absolutely the largest.</p>
<p>Related Research on Wabei, the results published this week in the "NatureCommunications" journal. It shows that the H5N1 virus spreads from Europe to North America, and it is rapidly mutated during the process. The report pointed out that the toxicity of the virus after coming to North America means more dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>The researchers also asked a newly avian influenza virus strain. Wabe said that they accidentally discovered a "large number" virus in the brain of the severum, showing that the virus strain was more serious than the disease caused by the previous few.</p>
<p>Although Wabe emphasized that the risk of human beings in dyeing bird flu is still quite low; but the H5N1 virus is currently "not stagnant, but is changing." "This does add some geneticity and become more likely to become a human virus, even if the probability is very low."</p>
<p>Wabe also pointed out that the number of mammals infected with H5N1 virus has increased significantly, which is "very, very worrying signs."</p>
<p>Chile in South America said last week that nearly 9,000 sea lions, penguins, otters, rodent dolphins and dolphins have been found on the northern coast since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Most mammals are infected with bird flu because they ate infected birds, but Virgi said that a mink field in Spain and sea lions along the South American coast showed a sign of "the most scared of us", that is, the virus may be mammalians in mammals. Infectious between.</p>
<p>Wabe said that if the overall cases of bird flu to reduce and then reduce the risk of human infection, one of the methods is that countries are vaccinated with poultry.</p>
<p>A few countries such as China, Egypt, and Vietnam have promoted poultry vaccine vaccine, but many other countries may become a breakthrough after considering the import restrictions in some regions, and that birds who have been vaccinated. The vaccine is stubborn.</p>
<p>However, the United States has begun testing several bird fluidums that may be given to birds in April this year. France has recently stated that it hopes that poultry vaccination will be promoted as soon as this fall this fall. (Translator: Zhang Zhengyu/Calculation: Dai Yazhen)</p>

<p>As the price of oil fell to $ 70 per barrel (about S $ 95), the oil alliance consisting of the Organization of the Organization and Allies of the Petroleum Export+will discuss whether it is further reduced. Sources revealed that the oil alliance+may consider reducing production up to 1 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>Oil League+(OPEC+) produces about 40%of crude oil worldwide, and its policy decision may have a significant impact on oil prices.</p>
<p>Three sources told Reuters on Friday (June 2) that the Minister of Oil League would meet on Saturday (3rd), and then discussed the problem of production reduction with allies on Sunday (4th).</p>
<p>The oil alliance+currently reduced production of 2 million barrels per day, and announced in April this year that the voluntary additional reduction was reduced by 1.6 million barrels. If the proposal of reducing another 1 million barrels is approved, the total amount of oil reducing production will reach about 4.6 million barrels per day, accounting for 4.5%of global demand.</p>
<p>Oil League+accidentally announced voluntary production reduction in April this year, and has pushed up to $ 87 per barrel. However, due to the weak global economic growth and demand, the rise in oil prices quickly retreated.</p>
<p>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Novak pointed out in a media interview that it did not think that the oil alliance+Sunday will announce the reduction of production. However, Saudi Arabia Energy Saalman warned that investors who were short -term oil prices last week were "careful" and were considered an additional warning to reduce production.</p>
<p>Market analysts believe that crude oil supply is excessive today. The Washington Energy Market and Policy Consulting Company Rapidan Energy Group predicts that the possibility of oil alliance+further reduction is 40%. They said: "The ministers of the oil producing country seem to be determined not to repeat the same mistakes. In 2008, because the global economic and financial stability instantly collapsed, it caused oil prices to slide from the $ 140 per barrel to $ 35 within six months."</p>

<p>Experts warn that the H5N1 virus with a record high of bird flu viruses around the world is rapidly mutating, calling on countries to strengthen vaccines for poultry in China.</p>
<p>Experts emphasized that although the current situation is still low in the risk of humans, the bird flu cases of mammals are significantly rising and worrying.</p>
<p>Wabei, director of the Animal Fluid Research and Cooperation Center of the World Health Organization, said that the H5N1 virus appeared for the first time in 1996. It was originally limited to seasonal popularity. Since then, the bird flu epidemic has become unknown throughout the year, and has spread to a new area, causing a large number of wild birds to die and tens of millions of poultry.</p>
<p>The Research team led by Verbia found that the H5N1 virus spread from Europe to North America, and it quickly mutated quickly; the virus increased toxicity after coming to North America, which means that it might cause more dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>Wabe said that most mammals were infected with bird flu because they ate birds who were infected, but there were also suspected cases in a mink field in Spain and sea lions along the South American coast, which means that the virus may be transmitted between mammals.</p>
<p>He emphasized that if the overall case of bird flu is reduced, and then reduce the risk of human infection, one of the methods is that countries are vaccinated with poultry.</p>
