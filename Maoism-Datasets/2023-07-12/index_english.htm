<p>Description: According to the Kremlin, Putin received Pleigon and Wagner Commander after the soldiers. This shows that Putin believes that it can continue to use the mercenary organization, and also adds uncertainty to the future of Poigo and Wagner. Sergei Guneyev/Sputnik, Via Associated Press Press in a Russian official media, Russian President Putin delivered a speech to the Kremlin's military forces after the rebellion of the Wagner Group.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-11T02-53-46-08-00/10russia-prigozhin-01a-hkwp-master1050.jpg" />According to the Kremlin Palace, Russian President Putin had held a long period of long -term talks with the commander of the Wagner Private Military Service Company, the Wagner Private Military Services, which was led by Yofgen, and the latter launched a mutiny to set the country and set the country. A few days after the Civil War.</p>
<p>Putin has condemned these leaders who launched the rebellion from June 23rd to 24th, but received them on June 29. This disclosure was shocking, and it also showed that although Putin had roared, he thought the employment was hired. Military organizations and their bosses can continue to use. This meeting was the first known contact between the two since the rebellion. The rebellion has formed the most significant challenge to Putin's 23 years of authority.</p>
<p>The news of this meeting made Pryoen Ren and his troops even more uncertain. It is unclear why a warlord with a private army and trying to overthrow the Russian military leadership with force is allowed to stay in Russia, and it is obviously unimpeded. He is said to return to his hometown to retrieve the confiscated firearm.</p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said Putin invited 35 people to participate in the three -hour meeting, including all senior commanders of Pleigon and Wagner, and faced the company in Ukraine The efforts on the battlefield and the actions in the rebellion expressed their views.</p>
<p>Peskov said that the Wagner armed personnel also made their explanation of the incident, and Peskov believed that the meeting was a chance to clarify the misunderstanding and determine the direction. "Putin heard the opinions of the commanders and put forward the choice of further employment and further fighting," he said.</p>
<p>Peskov also said that Wagner's armed personnel swore to loyal to Russian leaders during the meeting.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-11T02-53-46-08-00/10russia-prigozhin-02-qbmp-master1050.jpg" />Last month, Yofgeni Pleigo was appointed in Rostov on the Russon River, and the Wagner Group began to end the rebellion. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters</p>
<p>He said: "They emphasized that they are firm supporters and soldiers of the head of state and chief commander, and said they have been preparing to fight for the country."</p>
<p>Just a few days after Putin vowed to suppress the rebellion a few days later, Pricigen and his senior deputy played with this Russian leader with calmness and sitting at the table at the table with people's impression of Putin. People generally believe that Putin is a cold dictator who is good at suppressing the threat to its rule.</p>
<p>This seems to reflect the calculation of the Kremlin, that is, to avoid completely eliminating an experienced and well -being supported by the people in a high -cost war. Some analysts said that Putin may also think that this rebellion was just an out of control. Poligon has stated that his purpose is to overthrow the Russian military leadership rather than challenging Putin's rule.</p>
<p>"I won't think that Pritigon will always be favored by Putin again, as if nothing happens. Things have happened. The conclusion has been concluded," Yev said. "But for some reason, it is better to let him go with him and him at this time."</p>
<p>The Russian security department expert Andre Saldatov said that Putin's tough remarks on betrayal are mainly targeted at the Russian military to prevent commanders from standing on the side of the rebels. He said that the President and Pryigo later "made another transaction."</p>
<p>"We don't know the specific terms," Saldatov added. "But our understanding is that they know each other and know what the other party wants, so they can still cooperate or work together."</p>
<p>But this rebellion exposed Putin's vulnerability to the world, and admitting that talking to Wagner's leaders may make it look weaker.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-11T02-53-46-08-00/10russia-prigozhin-06-qhkt-master1050.jpg" />During the rebellion, a military column of the Wagner Group was driving along the cities connecting southern Russia and Moscow. Reuters</p>
<p>The founder of the political consulting company Tatiana Stannovavara, the founder of "real politics", said that the Kremlin decided to disclose that the meeting may be to appease the Russian elite, and they were still confused about what happened, that is, Perigo Renren In the end, "a traitor or a person.</p>
<p>"This is a signal to the elite, indicating that Perigo still belongs to this system," Steinneraa said. "Yes, he made a mistake, yes, this is a very serious crime. But due to the particularity of the situation, this is indeed very unique. Putin will spare him for his life."</p>
<p>This change revealed that Putin was unable to or be unwilling to deal with public power struggle in public for several months. Pricigen often said bad words on the Russian military leadership on Telegram. Steinnovah, who is also a senior researcher at the Eurasian Center of Cunciekia, said that Putin felt at least some responsibility for the failure to better deal with the continuous upgrade.</p>
<p>Porigen's troops were very important for the Ukrainian war in Russia, but the government ordered the Wagner forces to join the regular army last month. In the face of major losses, Perigo complained loudly, but it did not help.</p>
<p>His troops occupied Rostov and an important Russian headquarters in the city of Don River in southern Russia, and traveled to Moscow at a place 200 kilometers from the capital.</p>
<p>Putin warned not to be caught in a civil war in his speech to the country, and said that those who "consciously chose the road of betrayal" would be punished the most.</p>
<p>But punishment did not come.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the Kremlin announced an agreement reached under the mediation of Belarusian leader Alexander Luchenko: Pryigo will be stepped down, exempt from prosecution, and go to Belarus. The Wagner Army participating in the rebellion will not be punished; those who have not participated will have the opportunity to sign a Russian military contract.</p>
<p>Porigon and his subordinates packed their clothes and retreated.</p>
<p>The agreement was angrily angered Russian hardliners. They pointed out that the rebels shot down the Russian aircraft and killed military personnel.</p>
<p>In the days since then, Pryigo's status has always been a mystery. He did not show up. His company has stopped issuing a response to media questions. The person who came out of the scene last year and disclosed his identity at least temporarily disappeared.</p>
<p>Anton Yelzarov, the famous commander of Losor's Wagner, accepted an interview with a Russian war blogger in southern Russia on Friday. He stated in the interview that all Wagner armed personnel had been leave until early August. He also said he and his family were resting by the sea.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-11T02-53-46-08-00/10russia-prigozhin-03-tqvl-master1050.jpg" /></p>
<p>In an interview published by Telegram, Yelzarov said that Wagner will not participate in the Ukrainian war for the time being, and there are many jobs to do before preparing to "retreat" Belarus.</p>
<p>"President guarantees to us that law enforcement will not be held accountable," Ye Lizarov said. "As for society and ordinary people, you can see it yourself: girls wearing our badges walk around, which may be cheated by kissing from our soldiers. Boys wearing Ts printed with T we marked with our logo, wearing Ts printed with our logo T -identification T Together and hat. The children are playing war games. Ukraine is a German, and the Wagner PMC soldier is the Red Army. "</p>
<p>He did not rule out the possibility of this mercenary organization involved in the Ukrainian war again. He said: "Our armored trains are in a state of combat reserve, and we are always ready to work for our motherland and our country when they call us in the Russian people."</p>

<p>On July 5th, the British Think Tank Paddy Ashdown Forum (Padi Ash Ashidang) held a "Global Dialogue". The first interviewed guest was the former chief secretary of the British Ministry of Finance. Sir Dannyalexander. The AIIB is a controversial agency in the UK. I heard rumors several times that "the AIIB is serving the 'Belt and Road'." Not long ago, Canada suspended its contact with the AIIB because the bank's global communication director and a Canadian said that the bank was "led by the Communist Party" and resigned. Therefore, I have a high curiosity about the Asian Investment Bank and the former British politician Alexander Alexander who served the AIIB. Bypassing the AIIB, the founder of the British Liberal Democratic Party, Merleneemerson (Du Shuzhen) directly invited my interview to Sir Alexander, and quickly received consent. 45 minutes before the beginning of the "Global Dialogue" of Padi Ash, I interviewed him.</p>

<h1>Monitoring is omnipresent, the "Skynet" in China makes the northern person desperate</h1>

<p>Description: Almost all those who escape the North will take China, but the expanding monitoring system in China in recent years has allowed those who help the North Korea to go to South Korea to become almost impossible. As the risk of being caught by the Chinese police has increased, the prices of hiring traffickers have soared. CHANG W. Lee/The New York Times May, Rev. Qian Yiyuan's office in Seoul, he helped North Koreans trying to escape from South Korea.</p>

<p>He was sent to Northeast China in 2019 to make money for the North Korean regime. After working for a long time under the continuous surveillance of the team leader, he <a href="http://durihana.com/">find an email address on a website</a>In 2021, a distressing message was sent: "I risked my life to write this email," the engineer mourned.</p>
<p>A young woman was smuggling from North Korea to China in 2018, and she contacted the owner of the same website at the beginning of this year. She originally planned to flee to South Korea, but was locked in a border town in China and was forced to make money through network transactions. "Please help us escape from this house," she wrote.</p>
<p>The website belongs to Seoul's Christian pastor Qianduan. He is famous for helping North Korea's refugees escape through China. Almost all those who are from the North will choose this route. He was often condemned by Pyongyang and was imprisoned in China for helping hundreds of North Koreans reach South Korea or the United States.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>But now, the work of helping the northern people in China has become "almost impossible", Qian Yiyuan said.</p>
<p>During the epidemic, China has implemented strict restrictions on transit or even domestic travel. In recent months, when these restrictions began to relax, Qianxianyuan and other aid workers received thousands of. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20230404/north-korea-human-rights/">Stay in China</a>North Koreans for help.</p>
<p>However, due to the increase in risks caught by the Chinese police, the prices of hiring traffickers have also soared. The continuously expanding monitoring intensity of Beijing has made it more difficult to avoid the authorities. There were 1047 people who arrived in South Korea in 2019. Last year, this number plummeted to 63 people.</p>
<p>"The decrease in the number of people from North is not because the desires of the Korean people have fled the oppression power," Hannah Song (Yin), a human rights worker who monitored the situation of refugees in Washington last month <a href="https://www.cecc.gov/events/hearings/north-korean-refugees-and-the-imminent-danger-of-forced-repatriation-from-china">Congress Hearing</a>Speaking. "On the contrary, it reflects China's ubiquitous monitoring measures to increase difficulty."</p>
<p>Thousands of yuan shared hundreds of text messages, audio files, bank records and other documents with the New York Times to help rebuild his efforts to help him and Ms. Li, a software engineer and network worker. In order to protect their identity, he asked the Times to go to the name of the engineer and the lady's name and other details.</p>
<p><strong> Trasperer in China </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Ms. Li and the software engineer did not know each other, but they all found thousands of dollars for the same reason -they wanted to leave China and not be sent back to Kim Jong -un's authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>"They were monitoring my every move," the software engineer said in the first email written to Qian Yuan in 2021.</p>
<p>He and thousands of young <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20220705/north-korea-crypto-hack/">North Korean computer professionals</a>When they came to China together, before the epidemic, they were often sent abroad to make money for the Kim Jong -un government through IT or cyber crimes.</p>
<p>North Korea cuts off the connection between domestic and the Internet and dispatched well -trained online professionals to work in China, Southeast Asia and other places to avoid the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/09/world/asia/north-korea-promises.html">due to nuclear weapons projects</a>International sanctions. These foreign professionals usually live in collective dormitories and are required to monitor each other. The North Korean team leader will also look for clues of unfaithful behavior, such as watching Korean dramas.</p>
<p>When talking with Qianyu Yuan on the communication application Telegram, the software engineer described his life as "bird in the cage". From morning to night, he is <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">upwork</a>Finding the work of writing code on the network platform to make money for Pyongyang regime.</p>
<p>The video sent to Qianyuan showed that he and North Korean colleagues both worked under the camera. A slogan on the wall wrote: "Let's express loyalty to the beloved leader Kim Jong -un with high performance!"</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>However, it is difficult for these workers to earn a standard of $ 45,000 in the manager. They have to buy fake identities frequently, because under sanctions, international companies must not hire North Koreans.</p>
<p>When he first arrived in China, he did not have a plan to escape to South Korea. But last year he posted a video of Qian Yiyuan's bruised face, saying that he was beaten because he was uncomfortable. "I want to be a freedom, even if there is only one day of freedom, I am willing to fight for it," he wrote.</p>
<p>Some human rights organizations have criticized China to let so many North Koreans fall into a slave -like situation, but they demanded that the call to crack down on such behavior is basically ignored. After Beijing arrests the North Koreans who try to escape to South Korea, they often treat them as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and repatriate them back to North Korea for punishment.</p>
<p>China will use surveillance technology to arrest foreigners who are fugitives or have not resisted in the country without permission.</p>
<p>Ms. Li came to China five years ago, and her plan has always fled to South Korea.</p>
<p>She said that the middlemen who helped her off the north and entered China told her that they would work for a boss for three months before being sent to South Korea. As a result, the middleman sold her to a Korean woman, and the latter's husband was a Chinese police officer in the border city Baishan.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Women like Ms. Li are often sold to men who cannot find their wives in rural China, or they have forced them to work for illegal online trading gangs. The woman in Baishan City detained Ms. Li in an apartment, forcing her to perform sexual behavior for male customers in front of the network camera.</p>
<p>In January of this year, Ms. Li contacted Qianyuan, saying that she and two other Korean women were about to be sold to another trafficker, and they needed emergency assistance.</p>
<p><strong> Go to a safe place </strong></p>
<p>Director Li Xuejun, a film producer Li Xuejun, a documentary about Korean refugees(Lee Hark-joon)It is said that to help those who get out of the north, you must hire a trusted person who is worthy of the "middleman."</p>
<p>However, "the middleman cares about making money, not the death of the north." He said, and told me that after the middlemen charged the fee, they abandoned the northern person or for extortion at the condition that they did not report to the police.</p>
<p>The epidemic has made this problem intense. Human rights activities said that the cost of sending a northern part of China from China rose from thousands of dollars before the epidemic to tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>advertiseWhen everyone arrives at a safe place, the next step is to take North Koreans to steal from China to Laos, and then go to Thailand. The North Korean people can apply for asylum from South Korea. This is the escape route of many northern people. They will drive through China because their identity examinations have become more frequent during the epidemic, and they cannot take public transportation.</p>
<p>Qian Yiyuan divided the routes of software engineers and three women into Qingdao into several sections. Each intermediate person would change cars to avoid being tracked by facial recognition or other monitoring technologies.</p>
<p>Qian Yiyuan also asked software engineers and Ms. Li to send their avatar photos, and made it clear that they were wearing when they escaped from the prisoner's apartment.</p>
<p>He wants to send the car photos and license plates from North Koreans. He discussed the details with everyone, and then started planning.</p>
<p>"Everything is ready. I'm leaving now. I'm dressed," the software engineer sent a text message to Qian Yiyuan before escaping.</p>
<p><strong> Tracking and arrest </strong></p>
<p>The trafficker did not send the software engineer directly to Qingdao. Instead, he went to a house in Jilin, Northeast China. On the way, he stopped the plan again on the way.</p>
<p>After entering the house with the software engineer, the middlemen contacted Qianxian yuan to buy more money to buy food, new clothes and shoes.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the next day, the middleman was preparing to go out to pick up the three women in Baishan, but was stopped by the Jilin police. Software engineers were also arrested by police.</p>
<p>The relatives of the middlemen who were put into the prison informed Qian Yiyuan. The North Korean leader reported the disappearance of the software engineer, and the middleman drove to pick up his car and was identified by the surveillance camera during the residence of his plan.</p>
<p>Qian Yiyuan quickly looked for another middleman to pick up three women, so as not to be too late.</p>
<p>"The middleman will wait for you in the designated place in the middle of the night. The car is purple," he wrote in the message to Ms. Li. He asked her to hold an umbrella in her right hand so that the middlemen recognized it.</p>
<p>In early February, the new middlemen brought three Korean women to the security location of Qingdao. But a few days after arriving, the husband's husband who imprisoned her, the Baishan policeman broke into the house with a thug, and Qian Yiyuan said that several women called him in a panic.</p>
<p>Qian Yiyuan said that a middleman must have traded with the husband and used three women to exchange cash. "Otherwise there is no other explanation," he said.</p>
<p>Qian Yiyuan said that software engineers are still detained in Chinese prisons and are waiting to be repatriated to North Korea. In North Korea, those who try to escape to South Korea may face the labor -renovation camp or make a more tragic end.</p>
<p>Ms. Li's whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>"I have helped North Koreans for 23 years," Qian Yiyuan said. "I have never felt so sad and helpless."</p>

<p>Sunshine depression is not a professional medical term, but recently has been discussed in the network space. It mainly refers to the explicit personality and the positive image, and the lively and optimistic people suffer from depression. Emotional or delayed medical treatment leads to an intensified condition.</p>
<h3>"Sunshine Melancholy"?</h3>
<p>According to the HEALTHLINE explanation of the American Medical Website, generally speaking, depression is connected with sadness, drowsiness and despair -such as the symptoms that cannot get up. But now, the manifestation of depression varies from person to person. The so -called "sunshine depression" refers to those who have a melancholy but look very happy or satisfied with those inner depression. Their public life and image are usually "combined together", and may even be normal or perfect for some people.</p>
<p>In addition, the typical depression is extremely low in energy, and it is difficult to get up in the morning. In smiling depression, the energy level may not be affected (unless a person is alone).</p>
<p>The health line emphasizes that the "Diagnosis and Statistics Manual of Psychiatric Diseases" in the medical community(DSM-5)"Smile Cormeration" has not been regarded as a formal disease name, but it may be diagnosed as severe depression symptoms with "atypical features".</p>

<h3>patient's signs</h3>
<p>Cui Zhongjun, a registered psychotherapist who has been practicing in Hong Kong for many years(Nastass tsuei)Tell BBC Chinese that the so -called Smiling depression can be said to be a high -function form of depression. The patient looks normal and performs well in daily life, but they may hide their true emotions to outsiders. The reason may be that the reason may be Its work has always been entertaining others. This is also part of their identity. Like many comedians in Hollywood, Robin Williams and Kim Kaarie are patients with depression.</p>
<p>The Psychological Health Center of the Taiwan Dong Foundation has recently pointed out through a press release that the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that depression will become the first of the global disease burden in 2030. The press release says that depression can be said to be a "heart" cold. It is not different from gender, age, and wealth status, and whether it is sunny, vitality or introverted, it may suffer.</p>

<p>American comedian Robin Williams died in 2014.</p>
<p>Cui Zhongjun told the BBC that according to many years of clinical observation, maintaining the image is very important for some patients with depression. Therefore, they are also good at hiding emotions, and it is difficult to be found by others to find that their mental health has problems, because patients may feel guilty because they have their own emotions: "Just like children who need to please in the abuse family to survive. They are good at hiding their emotions and pleasing their parents to avoid danger, but not that all patients with sunny depression come from abused families, but children who have difficulties will also be sensible, hide their emotions, and do not want their parents to worry about it. . Or some children who are not caring can only get friendship through funny, so I have been mocking myself, funny, and hiding their emotions. Many comedians are like this. "</p>
<p>In 2014, Professor Gordon Claridge, Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/britain_focus/2014/08/140815_britain_focus_comedy_depression">Research</a>523 comedians from the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia (404 men, 119 women), Clarge said, "We have found unusual personality characteristics combinations, and these characteristics are contradictory." He found on the one hand. These people perform introverted and are prone to depression. "Maybe you will describe them with schizophrenia."</p>
<p>He said: "This is an unusual combination of personality characteristics ... Perhaps the extroverted personality characteristics of comedians are the way to solve inner depression. Of course, not all comedians adopt this way."</p>

<p>Li Yan sang at the 2001 Oscar Golden Awards.</p>
<p>The "Healthy Online" website also emphasizes that people with sunny depression may look at it, like an active, strong individual, or a stable work, healthy social and family life. A happy person, but when they are experiencing depression, they continue to smile because they may feel that depression is a weak behavior, or they think that expressing their true feelings will have a burden on others. It's worse than you, what else can you complain. "</p>
<h3>how to respond?</h3>
<p>A YouTuber "That Master" in Taiwan invited Li Yan to sing in 2019. As a senior fan of Li Yan, the master said at the time that Li Yan had a clear personality, like a "sun", warm fans and staff. A Taiwanese music industry who has worked with Li Yan also told the BBC reporter that Li Yan was diligent in work and was generous and kind to others. It was difficult to imagine that she would suffer from depression.</p>
<p>Cui Zhongjun told the BBC that if there are such patients around, what others can do are to treat them kindly: "Because they are good at covering up their feelings, we only need to be more sensitive and supported by our friends."</p>
<p>She added that it is important to see professional help if she realized that she might suffer from sunny depression. In addition, you can start learning and share feelings with friends, feel and pay attention to your needs, and learn to set up the boundary between yourself (including parents or partners) for yourself, treat yourself well: "You can also do some mindfulness exercises ( Mindfulpractices), or yoga, Tai Chi and other outdoor activities. These are physical activity that can soothe the nervous system and improve emotions. "</p>

<h3>NATO Summit: Turkey and Hungary expressed support, Sweden is about to become the 32nd member states</h3>

<p>Turkish President Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Christensen shook hands under the gaze of NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg.</p>
<p><strong> NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said Turkish President Erdogan has agreed to support Sweden to join NATO. </strong></p>
<p>He said that Turkish leaders will submit applications from Sweden to their Chinese parliament and "ensure approval."</p>
<p>At the same time, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristerson said: "I'm very happy, this is a good day in Sweden."</p>
<p>Turkey has previously accused Sweden accusing Sweden Kurdish militants and spent several months from applying for Sweden.</p>
<p>As one of the 31 member states in NATO, Turkey can reject the new countries that join NATO (the country that applies for joining NATO requires the approval of all member states).</p>
<p>US President Biden said he welcomed President Erdogan to "quickly approve" the commitment of the application.</p>
<p>"I am ready to cooperate with President Erdogan and Turkey to strengthen the defense and deterrence in the European-Atlantic region. I look forward to welcome Prime Minister Christen Song and Sweden to become our 32nd NATO allies," the White House issued a statement.</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Baerbock, wrote on Twitter: "32 are, we are more secure together." RishiSunak, British Prime Minister, said that Sweden's joining will "" Let us be safer. "</p>
<p>After Turkish and Swedish leaders held talks in the capital of Lithuania, Stoltenberg announced the news on Monday night.</p>
<p>The Secretary -General of NATO claims that this is a "historic step", but emphasized that it is impossible to give a clear date for Sweden to join NATO because it depends on the Turkish Parliament.</p>
<p>In May last year, a few months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden and its east neighbor Finland announced their intention to join NATO. Both countries have long -term neutral history. Finland officially joined in April this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-60136487">Ukraine War: What did NATO do? How to join Sweden and Finland? </a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-61407312">Finland and Sweden will be safer or more dangerous if you join NATO Europe? </a>Stoltenberg said that Turkey and Sweden have resolved "reasonable and safe concerns of Turkey". To this end, Sweden amended the Constitution and Law, expanded the Kurdish Workers' Party(PKK)The counter -terrorism operation and restored the export of weapons to Türkiye.</p>
<p>Turkey and Hungary are the only two NATO members who have not yet approved the Swedish alliance.</p>
<p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Tuesday that the approved application for Sweden is now just a technical issue.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, President Erdogan also seemed to linked Turkey's support for Sweden to NATO, and the European Union and Akara restarted to join the EU negotiations.</p>
<p>EU officials quickly rejected the request, saying that these were two different issues.</p>
<p>NATO issued a statement later stated that Sweden will actively support the "revitalization of Turkey to join the EU process", which includes "EU-Turkish Tariffs Federation Modernization and Visa Liberation."</p>
<p>Turkey applied for the first time to join the European Union as early as 1987, but under the leadership of Erdogan, Turkey gradually moved towards authoritarianism, causing the process of entering the alliance to stop.</p>
<p>However, since Russia invaded Ukraine, Erdogan has also played a unique role -an influential NATO national leader in Moscow.</p>
<p>Last year, he helped promote the "Black Sea Grain Plan", which enabled Ukraine to export agricultural products from its port.</p>
<p>Although Russia has frequently threatened to withdraw, Turkey has been helping to maintain the plan.</p>
<p>But Turkey also angered the Kremlin because of providing armed drones to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Zellennki hopes that NATO will issue a "clear signal" on the application of Ukraine at the Vilnez Summit.</p>
<p>On the weekend, after the visit of Ukrainian President Zeleki, Turkey unexpectedly allowed five former Ukraine to fly back to Kiev, which also made Russian officials angry.</p>
<p>According to last year's prisoner exchange agreement, Russia hoped that these people would stay in Turkey until the end of the war.</p>
<p>The two -day NATO Peak opened on Tuesday in Vilnius in Lithuania. The application of Ukraine's enrollment will be an important issue on the agenda.</p>
<p>All NATO member states agreed that Ukraine could not join NATO during the war because it was worried that it would lead to a direct conflict with Russia with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Zelei himself also said that he did not want to become a member state before the end of the war, but he hoped that the summit would send a "clear signal" to Ukraine's application.</p>
<p>Several NATO member states in Eastern Europe are urging their neighbors to join NATO, but other member states, including the United States and Germany, seem to be hesitant.</p>
<p>Russian President Putin spokesman Dmitrypeskov warned on Monday that Ukraine's joining NATO will "have a negative impact on the entire security architecture, as if it was destroyed in Europe."</p>
<p>Peskov said that Ukraine's joining the European Union will "absolute danger and threat to our country, which requires us to make a very firm and clear response."</p>
<h3>NATO Summit: The prospect of Ukraine is attracted attention</h3>

<p>NATO leaders gathered Lithuania to participate in the NATO Summit. The summit may determine the direction of the Ukrainian war and the future of this Western league.</p>
<p>31 member states hope to show Russia that they are determined to support Ukraine for a long time.</p>
<p>After giving up against Sweden to join NATO, they were welcomed. However, there are still differences in all parties for Ukraine's ambition to join the EU in the future.</p>
<p>Some allies are believed to promise new security to Kiev to prevent Russia from invasion in the future. They will also discuss the issues of providing more weapons and ammunition.At a two -day meeting, NATO leaders are expected to reach a new plan to protect NATO member states from Russian aggression by strengthening NATO's troops in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese network) Data from various aspects show that the downward trend of the Chinese real estate market is still continuing. According to the surging news report, the data of the sales of real estate companies released by the Krier Real Estate Research Center at the end of last month showed that in June 2023, less than 30 % of the top 100 housing companies increased year -on -year. Only half of the enterprises. Nearly 600%of the top 60%of the real estate companies decreased by more than 30%year -on -year, of which 27 companies' performance decreased by more than 50%.</p>
<p>The report believes that real estate sales continued to be dull in June. Although the supply of 30 cities has rebounded, it has increased by 34%month -on -month. However, from the absolute scale, it still has a new low in the same period in the past five years. The overall transactions of first, second and third -tier cities have been decreased year -on -year, and Shenzhen alone is an exception.</p>
<p>The report of the Institute of Perspective Index also pointed out that the total sales amount of the total equity of the 100 housing companies in June was 363.6 billion yuan, a year -on -year decrease of 34.4%, which was basically the same as the month.</p>
<p>The slump of the housing market is also reflected in the construction industry. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in the first five months of this year, the newly started construction area of houses decreased by 22.6%year-on-year, and the decrease of 1.4 percentage points from January-April. At present, the scale of houses is decreased. From January to May, the construction area of houses decreased by 6.2%year-on-year, and the decrease was expanded from the previous 4 months. From January to May, real estate development investment decreased by 7.2%year-on-year, and the decrease was expanded by 1 percentage point from January-April.</p>
<h3>Where to adjust the housing price through tax collection?</h3>
<h3>Cool down after rebound</h3>
<p>The "Securities Times" reported that one of the keys one of the key to new project development of real estate development enterprises and insufficient willingness to start construction is that the sales are not bad.</p>
<p>Since 2023, the Chinese property market has appeared in a wave of obvious [rebound] in February and March <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访中国房市真的回暖了吗/a-64843185">rebound</a>However, with the release of the depressed housing demand during the epidemic sealing period, since April, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国房地产迎来复苏信号但是/a-65420163">the property market quickly cools down</a>Essence In June, which is particularly important for semi -annual performance, in the past, housing companies will increase supply to promote sales, but this year is obviously insufficient. Guoxin Securities Research Report shows that in June this year, the supply of housing enterprises reached a new low in the past five years.</p>
<p>The China Real Estate Market Report released in the first half of the 2023 Chinese real estate market released last week that in the short term, when the sales repayment and financing have not significantly improved, the cash flow of real estate companies still face a large challenge, which directly restricts the start of the company's construction. , Investment enthusiasm, the difficulty of new construction and real estate development investment has now changed significantly.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that the current emotions of home buyers are still affected by multiple factors. Among them, residents 'income is expected to be weak, housing prices are expected to be strong, and buyers' concerns about the end of the house. The report believes that with the continuous weakening of the market in the second quarter, the policy of policy in the second half of the year is expected to increase. If the economy has exceeded expectations in the second half of the year, real estate as an economic "stabilizer", and the policy policy may accelerate the landing.</p>
<p>The Kerry Real Estate Research Center also believes that if there is no strong rescue policy in July, the overall new house transaction scale will still be stable at a low level.</p>
<h3>Henan Rotten Tail House Project Endogenesis is difficult to collect</h3>
<h3>The central bank extends "16 Finance"</h3>
<p>On Monday (July 10), the People's Bank of China and the State Financial Supervision and Administration Administration issued a notice to "related policies for the stable and healthy development of the financial support in the real estate market" (also known as <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国国有银行出手-千亿资金救房企/a-63875752">16 Finance</a>) The period is extended to the end of 2024. In November 2022, the Central Bank and the former Bank of China Insurance Regulatory Commission jointly issued a notice to keep real estate financing steadily and orderly, actively do a good job in financial services for insurance, cooperate with the risk disposal of housing companies, increase housing leasing financial support, etc. It clarified 16 support policies, and two of them stipulated the applicable period.</p>
<p>Market analysis believes that the extension of the policy will help further alleviate the pressure of housing enterprises, reduce the risk of financial institutions on loans of housing enterprises, promote the "preserved property", and boost confidence in the property market. The China Securities News reported that it was called "the benefits of real estate".</p>
<p>However, before, the Ehresearch analysis pointed out that it is not easy because the underlying layer of support demand, that is, the recovery of the macroeconomic economy, is difficult to show stable recovery in 2023. " Under the comprehensive effects of many factors such as saving savings, housing enterprises, and promotion of policies, it will be repaired within a period of time, and then re -enter the downlink range. "</p>
<p>The report of the middle finger research institute also concluded that under the current situation, the "old model" of Chinese housing companies' development is not sustainable. DominicBarton, chairman of the board of directors of the transnational mining giant Rio Tinto, talked about the challenges faced by the Chinese economy in an interview with Bloomberg. The real estate industry "is a big problem."</p>
<p>Shen Dong, a former member of the Beijing CPPCC, who has published memoirs and former Beijing CPPCC members in exile, believes that China's real estate industry has come to an end and has no possibility of rebound, which will also affect the trend of consumption. He recently accepted <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/獨家沈棟將赴美作證中國民企一片荒涼/a-66113718">Voice of Germany</a>It is pointed out that about 87%of Chinese people live in the house. If the real estate is going down now, the effect of wealth drama will be reduced. "87%of people see their wealth shrink. In this case, the consumer market cannot be mentioned."</p>

<p>The facilities of the South Korean Uniform Institute provide Korean refugees with various courses including cooking</p>
<p><strong> A drive about two hours from the South Korean capital Seoul, in a village full of jungle hills and paddy fields, there is a building complex that looks incompatible. </strong></p>
<p>This multi -story building complex overlooking the surrounding rural areas, surrounded by high walls and door guards guarded by guards. This place is isolated, safe and secret.</p>
<p>It is both a training base and a medical facility, but also a re -education center. This is the place where North Korea was sent to South Korea for three months after arriving in South Korea.</p>
<p>Its name is "HANAWON", which is called "North Korea from the residents of the Settlement SUPPPPORTRTREFORTHKOREAN Refugees".</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of North Koreans who fled to South Korea through a difficult journey decreased significantly, and they risked the risk of death to escape to get rid of poverty and suppression.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, about 3,000 North Koreans arrived in South Korea each year. In that year, this number dropped to about 1,000 people, and during the new crown epidemic, as North Korea closed the border, it fell to less than 100.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, South Korea has reiterated not only to continue to open the unified house, but also expand facilities.</p>

<p>This isolated place has a area where technology products are displayed.</p>
<p>The Seoul government believes that as the North Korean side relaxes the control of the new crown epidemic, more North Koreans can escape. In that case, the unified home will be full again.</p>
<p>South Korea ’s unified minister, Quan Ningshi, said that South Korea needs to prepare to welcome these newcomers.</p>
<p>"Don't think of the northern people as aliens, but we must think of them as neighbors from the northern hometown," he said.</p>
<p>Those hedges, flowers and trimmed trees were very popular under the summer sun on Monday. The Korean government rarely allowed reporters to visit the facilities on this day.</p>
<p>We visited a training center that provided 22 courses for the northern people, including hairdressing, beauty, baking and clothing production, and so on.</p>
<p>A room is arranged as a nail shop, and the northern person is here to learn fine nail art. They use the model hand to practice coats, light and trimming.</p>

<p>The support center provides training courses such as manicure and beauty</p>
<p>There is also the aroma of baking, which floats from the cooking class next door.</p>
<p>Other courses are designed to help North Koreans adapt to the lives of this country. The technology here has decades than their country.</p>
<p>One of the classrooms is arranged as a small shop selling high -tech products. Tablet computers, smartphones and computers are placed on the booth.</p>
<p>The floor of another building looks like a modern hospital. There is a small ward, a clinic, and a doctor wearing a white robe.</p>
<p>Not only to take care of these North Korean people's physical needs, many people also have serious psychological problems when they come here, and need emergency assistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of my patients ... worry about what people think if he knows him from North Korea. <strong> Dr. Quan Zhenyong </strong>&gt; The psychiatrist who worked in the unified hospital</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Quan Zhenyong is a psychiatrist working in a unified hospital. He listened to the North Korean people in the facilities about some terrible trauma experiences.</p>
<p>He said that they had to deal with the pressure brought by the escape, as well as the continuous fear of being arrested and repatriated before arriving in South Korea.</p>
<p>Many people are difficult to overcome guilt. They leave their loved ones in North Korea and may never see each other again.</p>
<p>Some people suffer prejudice in South Korea, so they chose to conceal the facts from North Korea.</p>
<p>"My patient had lunch in a restaurant. At that time, the news of playing North Korea's launching missiles on TV," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"He was very uncomfortable, so he quickly left the restaurant after eating. He was worried that people would think if people know what he came from North Korea."</p>

<p>In the facility surrounded by the fence, there is a vocational training center.</p>
<p>In an interview with reporters, the three women who are now in the Unified Academy have revealed what difficulties they are trying to overcome.</p>
<p>They are afraid of their names, and they are referred to only A, B, and C. One of the women also hid behind a barrier to talk to us.</p>
<p>All three fled to China first, and then arrived in South Korea. They live better in China than in North Korea, but they are still full of anxiety and danger.</p>
<p>Ms. B said she failed to obtain a Chinese ID card, which means that she could not go to the hospital, cannot apply for a bank card, or even take a train.</p>
<p>Ms. C said her salary was only half of Chinese workers, because her situation made her unable to fight for more.</p>
<p>They also told that China ’s increasingly close monitoring network forced them to go to South Korea to seek asylum.</p>
<p>"When I decided to defect, I was not afraid of anything, because I was alone," Ms. A said, "but then I gave birth to a child in China, so I realized that I had no legal status."</p>
<p>All three women talked about their hopes for the future -and anxiety. One of them also said that she was even worried about paying taxes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-07-11T09-07-46.000Z/3b3bc63c-130c-4d18-afd2-395aa11b577f" />BBC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally came to South Korea, I was relieved, hugging my daughter and started crying. <strong> Jin Chenghui </strong>&gt; Graduate of the Unified College</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a person who understands them is Jin Chenghui. She graduated from the Unified Academy more than ten years ago and now operates her own business to produce a kind of rice wine that is very popular in North Korea.In North Korea, Ms. Kim was told that the Koreans would welcome her at first, and then she would be abused and killed.</p>
<p>"It wasn't until I graduated from the unified hospital that I really realized that I was safe," she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Jin said that the real education started after leaving the unified hospital.</p>
<p>"For all the people from the north, the first night outside was unforgettable. Finally, I came to Korea to make me feel relieved. I held my daughter and started crying -not because of my sadness or loneliness, but because of us Survive, "said the 49 -year -old lady.</p>
<p>Ms. Kim remembers how many Korean volunteers are treating her and helping her adapt to a new life in the first few weeks outside.</p>
<p>When she walked into her new home, they greeted her there, took her to see the surrounding shops, and helped her pay for the first taxi. She still keeps in touch with some of them.</p>
<p>Those who are still in the unified hospital will hope that they will have such a good ending.</p>

<h1>Why do young people in China do not want to get married</h1>

<p>Description: As urban women's economy and education levels rise, marriage is no longer just needed. Men mean that marriage is facing economic and cultural pressure. In recent years, political and economic instability has affected many young people's expectations for establishing families, and the marriage rate has reached a new low. Qilai Shen for the New York Times A pair of newcomers took a wedding photo on the Bund of Shanghai and took on Wednesday.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-11T11-14-42-08-00/00china-marriage-01-vzwf-master1050.jpg" />For young adults in China, these three years have been a bit cruel in the past three years. The tide of corporate layoffs led to rising unemployment rates. Although the "clear zero" measures that have been harshered in the new crown have ended, their uncertainty about the future is still there.</p>
<p>For many people, the recent chaos is another reason for delaying the decision of major life, which has led to a record low in the marriage rate and made the government avoid the efforts of the population crisis.</p>
<p>Technical worker Grace Zhang (Yin) has been holding contradictions on marriage for a long time. Last year, the Shanghai Municipal Government's closed control measures restricted her for two months in her home. After being deprived of the ability of free action, the feeling of out of control caused her state to decline. Seeing that the sealing measures spread to other cities, her optimism gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>After China's release in December last year, Ms. Zhang, 31, left Shanghai and started long -range work. With a changing environment, she can restore her positive attitude and travel from one city to another.</p>
<p>Now, due to the poor economic status of China, she has seen the number of people around the layoffs that has continued to increase, and she is not sure if her work is stable enough to make her consider building a family in the future. Although she has a boyfriend, they did not plan to get married immediately, although her father often urged her to settle early.</p>
<p>"The instability of this life will make people more and more afraid of changes in new life," she said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-11T11-14-42-08-00/00china-marriage-bfjm-master1050.jpg" />A residential community during the closing of Shanghai last year. The new york times</p>
<p>The number of marriage people in China has declined for nine consecutive years, and has decreased by half in less than 10 years. According to data released by the government last month, about 6.8 million couples registered for marriage last year, which was the lowest level since the record in 1986, far lower than 13.5 million pairs in 2013.</p>
<p>Although the number of registered marriages in 2023 has increased compared with the previous year, the number of divorce is also increasing. In the first quarter of this year, the number of marriage people increased by 40,000 compared with the same period last year, and the number of divorce increased by 127,000 pairs.</p>
<p>The survey showed that the cost of allowing children to experience the cruel education system in China and many young people do not want to have children. With the economic independence ability and education level of urban women reaching a new high, for them, marriage is no longer necessary from an economic perspective. Men said they could not afford the cost of marriage, and they pointed out that cultural pressure forced them to have houses and cars before starting date.</p>
<p>The instability of the past three years has exacerbated these pressures, affecting many young people's expectations for establishing families. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has applied increasingly stringent control in all aspects of society, and its results may have an impact on the marriage rate.</p>
<p>"If young people have no confidence in the future, it is difficult for them to consider stabilizing and get married," said Peng Xiujian, a senior researcher at the University of Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>The fertility of unmarried partners or single people is extremely rare in China. Therefore, the decline in marriage rate is directly related to the decline in birth rate. Since the large -scale famine in the early 1960s, the Chinese population has shrunk for the first time last year.</p>
<p>The ruling CCP carried out publicity activities that encouraged marriage and childbirth, and even held a blind date activity sponsored by the state. The government is conducting pilot projects that promote the "new era" marriage in 20 cities. One of the purpose of the "new era" marriage is that the husband and wife should share the responsibility of raising their children, which is equivalent to recognizing that Chinese women have traditionally assumed unequal burden. A local government in eastern China has launched a wedding application.</p>

<p>But the anxiety that leads to so many people to resist marriage is not easy to solve.</p>
<p>For Xu Bingqian, a 23 -year -old university graduate, the popularity of the new crown virus disrupted her plan to study and apply for graduate students. She has a professor from Cuba who cannot return to China due to travel restrictions. As Feng Zong trapped her in the dormitory, the roommates began to quarrel. She said that they were sorrowful to lose their education opportunities, and there was almost no way to vent such a way.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu now work in a bookstore in Qingdao in the eastern city of the eastern city. She said that planning to be interrupted has caused her to adopt a more "conservative" attitude towards her life to avoid making major decisions, such as looking for a boyfriend.</p>
<p>"I can't be sure that he must be good and bad," Ms. Xu said. "I still don't want this uncertainty to enter my life."</p>
<p>Last month, after a video was widely spread on Weibo, marriage problems became hot topics online. In the video, a man drove his wife many times due to family disputes and killed him. Many comments warn women not to get married. Recently, a Weibo label about refusing marriage has received 92 million views. Commentary pointed out that China lacks protection of women on women's laws on divorce and domestic violence.</p>
<p>Analysis of Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California Owen, shows that among Chinese cities with ages aged 25 to 29, the proportion of never married has risen from 8.6%in 2000 to 40.6%in 2020.</p>
<p>Many men say they delay their marriage because they lack economic security. In the era when the government's policy of only children (the policy has ended in 2016), due to China's heavy male and female culture, the male population was about 35 million more than the female population, which exacerbated the sense of economic competition in marriage.</p>

In the first quarter of this year, the number of people registered in China increased from the same period last year, but the number of divorce also increased. Qilai shen for then york times</p>
<p>The 30 -year -old Xu Xi (Yin) left a multinational technology company this year and changed jobs to a state -owned enterprise. He wanted to get more work protection, although his salary was reduced by 50%, his current annual salary is about 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After changing his job, he felt that he had prepared to propose to his girlfriend next year, but he said that they did not intend to have children because the cost of raising children was too high. He said that although China is becoming more prosperous, many people feel that they are more poor, and this emotion will inevitably affect people's attitude towards marriage. According to Chinese population scientists, after the adjustment of the per capita economic output, China is the second largest country in the world to raise children, second only to South Korea.Until 2020, 35 -year -old Irene Wang (Yin) has always been optimistic about life in China. Later, she saw the government's cracking down on private enterprises, stifling employment opportunities in the process, and harsh measures to take the epidemic. She is increasingly worried about the increasingly autocracy.</p>
<p>"I don't think I am confident to give birth to children in China," she said.</p>
<p>Recently, her financial consulting work has exhausted her, so she resigned from Hangzhou to Shanghai to find new occupations. She hopes that Shanghai can have a more diverse date than Hangzhou. She said that many men in Hangzhou's social circle just want to find an obedient wife and are willing to sacrifice their careers for their children.</p>

<p>She has worked in the United States for four years. In April of this year, she went to the United States to see if she should move back. She still lives in China, but is designed to leave plans to transfer some funds to foreign banks, while studying an overseas visa.</p>
<p>"I want to get married too," she said, "but if there is no suitable one, I won't feel what happened."</p>

<h1>In order to stabilize the United States and China relations, Biden is looking forward to high -level diplomacy</h1>

<p>Description: Biden believes that high -level dialogue can stabilize relations between the two countries, but recently, the visits of Brinken and others have also highlighted the structural issues of the relationship between the two countries. This diplomacy is not helpful to solve the Taiwan issue and China's military ambitions in the Asia -Pacific. Doug Mills/The New York Times "I think there is a way to solve it and establish a relationship with China that is beneficial to them and us," Biden said.</p>

<p>This may be the most important diplomatic promotion during the term of President Biden. For several years, the relationship between the two countries has been in a dangerous free fall, and Biden believes that the high -level dialogue itself can stabilize the relationship between the two countries. "I think there is a way to solve it, establishing a working relationship with China and us," Bayeng broadcast on Sunday <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2023/07/09/gps-0709-biden-on-china.cnn">CNN interview</a>Zhong said that the Minister of Finance Jennite Yellen at the time <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230710/janet-yellen-china-us/">is about to end</a>Visiting Beijing.</p>
<p>Yellen and Chinese Prime Minister and a deputy prime minister who was a senior economic assistant of Xi Jinping made several hours meeting, which is relatively strange to American officials -this indicates that these exchanges may help establish an important one -to -one channel for one -to -one channels Essence Since May, the Director of the Central Intelligence Bureau and the Secretary of State have visited Beijing, and the Minister of Climate and the Minister of Commerce are about to go.</p>
<p>Biden and his assistants said that establishing these personal relationships may be necessary for resolving the crisis between the two major superpowers in the world. However, the recent interviews have also highly highlighted the worsening structural problems in relations between the two countries. Some analysts said that if it is not handled properly, these problems may lead to armed conflicts.</p>

<p>This kind of diplomacy does not help solve the most difficult problems between the two countries- <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20221010/taiwan-biden-weapons-china/">Taiwan's status</a>—— and China's military ambitions in the Asia -Pacific region are incompatible with the military dominance of the United States in the region. When the Secretary of State Anthony Brinkeng met Xi Jin's usual in June, the Chinese leader even refused to acknowledge that it was necessary to establish a framework for [competition] between the two countries.(https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230621/china-blinken-xi-economy/)Essence</p>
<p>This means that China will continue to regard a series of policies in Washington as hostile acts, including export control of advanced semiconductor technology and new military agreements with other Asian countries. US and Chinese officials realized that relations between the two countries are increasingly affected by military tensions.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/podcasts/the-daily/china-taiwan-us.html)Essence</p>

<p>In an interview, Biden said that when the United States strengthened its military alliance in the region, Xi Jinping called him and asked: "Why do you do this?" Bayon said, "We do this It's not to surround you. We do this to maintain the stability of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea "and strengthen the standards of use in international waters and airspace.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that the risks of sea and air in the two countries are increasing, and any accident may cause crisis. But military diplomacy is still a huge gap in relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>When Brintken asked Xi Jinping and his assistants to re -open high military channels, they were rejected. After the Speaker Nanti Pelosi visited Taiwan last August, China closed these channels. In early June, the National Defense Minister Laudie J. Austin III was at the annual security conference held by Singapore by General Li Shangfu, the Minister of Defense of China,(https://www.politico.eu/article/china-defense-chief-ghosts-us-but-meets-with-europeans-security-forum/)Essence In 2018, the US government imposed sanctions on Li Shangfu because China purchased military equipment from Russia.</p>

<p>Both the Biden government and Chinese officials are preparing for the intensive tensions of US domestic politics next year. The two -party candidates in the 2024 election will compete for remarks on the Huagong. U.S. officials said that this summer's visit aims to give the two governments a frank dialogue on the relationship between the two countries before the political campaign is heating up.</p>
<p>"For China, this year is the last opportunity, because the US presidential election next year may become worse," said Sun Yun, a scholar of Chinese foreign policy in Washington, DC. "Combined with China's own <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230629/china-exports-economy/">economic challenge</a>In particular, the economic recovery is slow, and Beijing has the motivation to remedy. The same is true of Washington. "</p>
<p>China hopes to receive US economic cabinet officials before visiting China, but the Bayeng government insists on asking Brinken to be the first official to visit after the secret visit by the Central Intelligence Bureau William J. Bernus in May.Yellen, who opened the trip to China last Thursday, was warmly welcomed. The Chinese Ministry of Finance issued a copy on Monday <a href="http://www.mof.gov.cn/zhengwuxinxi/caizhengxinwen/202307/t20230710_3895227.htm">Long Statement</a>The wording of the last US -China relations statement has described her speech. The statement emphasized that Yellen insisted that the United States did not seek to decompose its economy with the Chinese economy -less than two weeks ago, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang warned in a speech that the United States was trying to decompose.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the Ministry of Finance's statement recognizes the recent appeal of Yellen and Brinken, that is, the United States and China should cooperate in the areas of the common interests of both parties, including global economic stability and climate change. "Effectively responding to solving global challenges is inseparable from the coordination of China and the United States," the statement stated.</p>

However, the official declined to disclose whether Yellen invited He Lifeng, deputy prime minister and economist, who was closely related to Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Eswalprassad, a professor of Cornell University who studies the Chinese economy, said that Yellen was "willing to contact the Chinese economic leadership on a series of substantial issues, and at the same time acknowledged the existence of differences, and explained the reason for the United States to take measures. This will lay the tone for more constructive discussions. "</p>
<p>"Although economic hostility between the two countries is unlikely to ease significantly, the visit of Yellen may still help stop the further upgrade of bilateral economic and trade tensions, although Washington's anti -Chinese wording has been continuously upgraded," he said.</p>
<p>However, more conflicts are expected to have more conflicts on investment restrictions, export control and sanctions. The information that US officials tried to pass to Chinese officials are that for national security considerations, the United States is preparing to cut off some extremely specific trade connections with China, which will become a new normal for relations between the two countries. In the April speech, the national security adviser Jack Shalin clearerly explained this concept. At that time, he said that the United States would "use a small yard and a high fence to protect the most important technology."</p>
<p>The Chinese government continues to oppose the United States to impose sanctions on a large number of Chinese entities and individuals. These sanctions are punishment for human rights violations of Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Some Chinese scholars have doubts whether the goodwill brought by Yellen's visit to China. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of Beijing, said that Yellen's most important opinion is that the United States will continue to realize the diversification of the supply chain outside China and will take targeted measures to defend national security.</p>
<p>"This summarizes the two basic national policies that the United States persists and continues to upgrade," he wrote in the text message.</p>

<p>Wu Xinbo, Dean of the Institute of International Issues of Fudan University, said that the long -term impact of Yellen's visit to China "will depend on how this will be transformed into a policy." He said that technological issues have become the core issue of relations between the two countries, so the visit of the Minister of Commerce Raymond Doro is critical to show whether the United States is willing to resolve China's concerns.</p>
<p>"To some extent, her visit is more important than Yellen's visit," he said.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Chinese social media application -WeChat is widely used in Australian Chinese. In the complex relations between the two countries, what role WeChat play has attracted widespread attention. WeChat has repeatedly rejected a hearing of the Australian Senate on interference in domestic political affairs through social media. The timing of the Australian official on Tuesday's hearings on Tuesday continued to increase by the Australian official's suspicion of WeChat.</p>
<p>Australian Liberal Senator Jamespaterson issued a letter claiming that WeChat has repeatedly rejected a hearing at the Australian Senate's foreign interference social media special committee. He told the Tencent's leadership to Shenzhen's headquarters in Shenzhen that if WeChat continued to refuse to publicize its position to Parliament, the committee may have a negative perception of it. In the letter, he wrote: "Some experts who testify in front of the committee believe that WeChat should be considered to protect the freedom of Australian users. If WeChat continues to refuse to attend the committee, we will inevitably be willing to be willing to be with Australia. Legal cooperation draws conclusions and makes corresponding suggestions. "</p>
<p>"I know in Australia, there are about one million users in Australia. I admit that it is a necessary communication tool for Australians with Chinese ancestry. However, the committee has received convincing evidence. [WeChat is the "narrative machine 'of the Communist Party of China]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/智库中共通过微信控制澳洲中文媒体/a-55984361)We heard some disturbing allegations, that is, WeChat has been used to intimidate and harass Chinese Australian human rights activists and their families overseas to suppress their freedom of speech. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-11T15-00-00Z/54996593_401.png" />WeChat and TIKTOK have become the target of government inspections in the United States</p>
<h3>WeChat in Australia: Controversy and influence</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" reported that WeChat does not have a resident employee in Australia, so the Australian Parliament cannot forced executives from Shenzhen, where Tencent Headquarters is located to attend the hearing. However, WeChat said, "WeChat strictly abides by all markets. We look forward to continuing to talk to those related to Australian interests."</p>
<p>"South China Morning Post" pointed out in the report: WeChat's influence and role in Australia attracted people's attention. A survey by the Lowy Institute of Sydney shows that WeChat is the third largest social media platform used by Australians daily, second only to YouTube and Facebook. 76%of Chinese Australians said they use WeChat every day, which has become the main source of news from Chinese Australians.</p>
<p>However, WeChat, as a platform for news and perspectives, has caused alertness in Australia's politics. During Morrison's ruling, the relationship between Beijing and Canberra was deteriorated, and WeChat faced the call for banning due to national security issues. In addition, WeChat is not the only Chinese application in Australia. In April this year, Australia announced that Tiktok will be removed from all federal governments. Today, social media companies, which have been interfered by domestic media in Australia through social media in Australia, also include Twitter and Lingying.</p>
<p>Kapland, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University(Seth Kaplan)In April, I told relevant committees in Australia that although <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/哪些国家禁止tiktok原因何在/a-65700672">everyone is paying attention to video sharing application TIKTOK</a>, But WeChat's threat to Australia's national security is more profound.</p>
<h3>WeChat can't stand the refutation of the feet</h3>
<p>According to the Sydney Pioneer Morning News, WeChat argued to this that the application was designed for users outside China and was not under the jurisdiction of Chinese law. Tencent refers to the WeChat overseas version "WeChat". Tencent previously said that WeChat allows users to conduct private communication and will not push any content to users. Tencent has no editing control over the content of the users.</p>
<p>But this is not the case. WeChat has been able to accurately control what kind of users can send or accept. For example, if you use WeChat to send the banned book that the Chinese authorities are unwilling to see, users can see the PDF documentation smoothly, but the receiver cannot see any document. Both sides will not receive any wrong prompts. At the same time, if you publish some include <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/因发四通桥信息被封号-微信用户认错求宽大/a-63474337">Four Tongqiao "</a>, "Eighty -ninety -sixth" chat messages or multimedia content, will also face similar problems. The scope of sensitive words will continue to change according to the current demand of the current publicity and censorship system in China.</p>
<p>However, "Sydney Pioneer Morning News" also pointed out that two Australian scholars stated in a document submitted to the investigation committee that it is forbidden to WeChat to prevent the country's huge and increasingly increasing Chinese community "emotion, psychology and actual actual Chinese community. harm".</p>
<p>In general, WeChat has attracted 1.25 billion monthly active users worldwide, most of which are located in China, and WeChat's influence in the global Chinese community cannot be ignored. On August 1st this year, Australia's relevant committees will submit policy recommendations to the government.</p>

<p>On December 8, 2008, before the publication of Charter 08, the CCP authorities arrested Liu Xiaobo into prison, and one year later, he sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting the crime of subverting the state power". This judgment shocked many people. "Charter 08" is very gentle, and there are more than 300 people in the first batch of signed, but only Liu Xiaobo was convicted in prison, and his sentence was 11 years. At that time, I speculated that most of them were the CCP authorities who wanted to exile Liu Xiaobo overseas.</p>
<p>In 2008, Professor Hao Jian of the Beijing Film Academy made a video interview with Liu Xiaobo. This is Liu Xiaobo's last video interview during his lifetime, which is very precious. In this interview, Liu Xiaobo mentioned that during the period of 1996-1999, he had the opportunity to exempt from labor camp and leave China to the West. Liu Xiaobo said: "In 1998, Clinton visited, and the Chinese government asked me (Liu Xiaobo) to talk to the United States in the name of medical treatment. To be honest, if you really sentence me for more than ten years, like Wang Danwei Jingsheng, I am, me Maybe you will consider it. To be honest, this three years have passed, and there is one and a half years left. How can I survive. "</p>
<p>I wanted to come to the authorities to see Liu Xiaobo's interview. This is why the authorities have sentenced Liu Xiaobo for 11 years. Because the purpose of the authorities is to exile Liu Xiaobo overseas. The authorities believe that if only three or five years are sentenced, Liu Xiaobo will insist on the jail; if he is sentenced to more than ten years, Liu Xiaobo will consider whether it is an exile as an overseas exile like Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng.</p>
<p>But the authorities made a wrong abacus. Because of this moment. In 1998, Liu Xiaobo, if he was sentenced to more than ten years in prison, will mostly agree to accept exile; but in 2008, Liu Xiaobo, even if he was sentenced to seriously sentence, would rather sit and wear it at the bottom without accepting exile.</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2008, Liu Xiaobo's thoughts and realms had an amazing improvement.</p>
<p>On January 13, 2000, Liu Xiaobo wrote in the letter to Liao Yiwu: "... Compared with the characters in other Communist darkrs, we can't call the real tough guy. For so many years of great traged There is still no moral giant, similar to Harveil. In order to have the right to selfishness, there must be a moral giant to sacrifice selflessly. The will. History is not necessarily inevitable. The appearance of a martyr will completely change the soul of a nation and enhance the spiritual quality of people. Gandhi is accidental, and Harvey is accidental. The improvement of people is done by these accidents. You cannot expect the collective conscience of the public, and can only rely on great personal conscience to condense the cowardly public. In particular, our nation also requires moral giants. Infinite, a symbol can evoke too much moral resources. "</p>
<p>In 2002, Liu Xiaobo wrote a long article "The Poverty of the Chinese Folk Opposition -Sixty -33rd Anniversary". The article said that the loss of freedom of Aung San Sui would rather sit in the bottom of the prison and never exile. The development of faction itself and the support of the international community provide sufficient morality and organizational resources. Liu Xiaobo is regrettable that in China, under the extreme horror of the June 4th slaughter, a large number of representative characters of folk morality can escape or be forced to exile. History originally gave some people to become such symbolic characters. The opportunity, but for this kind of reason, they failed to become such a character, which caused China to fail to produce enough to consolidate the people like Sanahanov, Harvel, Wavina, Mickey Nik and Aung Shan Suji to condense the people A moral consensus opposition leader. Liu Xiaobo firmly believes that China needs such a model of morality. This means that as early as 2000, Liu Xiaobo had made up his mind. If destiny puts the opportunity to become a model or put it on him, he must try his best to take it.</p>
<p>We can speculate that the authorities sentenced Liu Xiaobo for 11 years at the beginning, and the purpose was to force Liu Xiaobo to accept exile overseas. We can also speculate that the authorities must reveal their intention to Liu Xiaobo more than once. It was just rejected by Liu Xiaobo. Later, the authorities gave up this intention. The authorities were afraid of Liu Xiaobo sitting through the bottom and walking out of the prison alive, becoming Angshan Suji in China, so they took extremely vicious means, which caused Liu Xiaobo to be cancer. When he was released from prison, he died in prison.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobo failed to become a Chinese Sukhan Suji in China. Liu Xiaobo's death made him a great martyr. Compared with Sanhanov, Harville, and Aung Shan Suji, Liu Xiaobo set us a eternal model of eternal morality in his own way.</p>

<p>Microsoft Microsoft disclosed on Tuesday evening that Chinese hackers invaded the US government email account and tried to collect American intelligence. The New York Times reported that people familiar with the matter said that the attack was targeted, and hackers were targeted at specific accounts, rather than large -scale invasion. Adam Hodg, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said that the confidential network has not yet been affected and the evaluation of the amount of information obtained is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Microsoft said that a total of 25 organizations including the US government were attacked by hackers. This gang uses a fake authentication tool to access personal email accounts. Microsoft also said that hackers have invaded some accounts at least a month before being discovered. The complexity of the attack and its targeted indication shows that this hacker gang is either affiliated with the Beijing intelligence department or working for it.</p>
<p>Charlie Bell, executive vice president of Microsoft, wrote on social media, "According to our evaluation, opponents are mainly engaged in spy activities, such as entering the email system to collect intelligence."</p>
<p>Microsoft did not disclose the names and institutions invaded by hackers. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department stated that it has been investigated, and immediately takes action to ensure the security of its computer system.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-07-12T-4-32-09-00-00/000000.png" />This is the conclusion that scientists have discovered that human appetite and activities have expanded rapidly, and after fundamental changes to the natural system and entered a new geological era "Anthropocene".</p>
<p>Among the mud and rocks in the middle of the 20th century, there are other obvious clues, including increasing carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, as well as radioactive debris generated by nuclear tests, omnipotent plastic particles, and the spread of invading species.</p>
<p>But chicken bones may be one of the most deep discoveries.</p>
<p>First, they are human inventions.</p>
<p>Geopologist Carys Bennett said: "Compared with its ancestors or wild similar," modern meat chickens are far away ... body shape, skeletal shape, skeletal chemistry and genetics are different. "</p>
<p>Bennert is the main author of a research in 2017 in the British journal "Royal Society OpenScience". This study provides evidence for chickens as the saying of "iconic species" of the human world.</p>
<p>In other words, the existence of meat chickens proves that humans have the ability to invade nature and intervene in nature development.</p>
<p>Janzalasiewicz, a honorary professor of paleontology at the University of Pierst, told AFP that "(animal) evolution usually takes millions of years, but only a new kind of" Type animal. "</p>
<p>He presided over the official "AnthropOocene Working Group (AWG), which was more than 10 years old that Crawfordlake (Crawfordlake) in Toronto, Canada has proved that the earth has entered the earth about 70 years ago because of human activities. The new geological chapter "Human World".</p>
<p>The commonly existed broiler is another evidence, and a lot of chicken bones will be left on the places where people live on the earth.</p>
<p>Bennte, who was a researcher at the University of Leist and the current official of the "Peta" (PETA), said: "Chicken is a symbol of our changes in our biosphere.</p>
<p>She said: "A large number of unique chicken bones are discarded all over the world, leaving clear signals in the future geological records."</p>

<p>For many years, people have been dreaming of a world without a job. Oscar Wang Erde(Oscar Wilde)In a prose in 1891, I imagined such a future: "It's like trees growing, but rural gentlemen are in a rest, so when humans are happy and enjoying elegant leisure (human goal is it, not it is not it, not it is not, not it is not, not it is not it, not it, not it, not it, not it, not it, not it. When labor), creating beautiful things, reading beautiful things, or just thinking about the world with praise and joy, the machine will do everything necessary and unpleasant jobs. "</p>
<p>This year, the rapid development of artificial intelligence once again triggered such a question: Will one day machine completely replace the needs of human labor? I doubt this, especially because humans have the extraordinary ability to create work for themselves. However, let us and assume that technological progress really started a leisure era. Can we really adapt?</p>

However, the director of the agency, Rafaelgrossi, interviewed on Friday (7th) that there are actually differences between the 11 experts of the assessment working group](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/路透社iaea总干事暗示福岛报告专家组内部存在意见分歧/a-66153690)And waves.</p>
<p>Wang Wenbin said that experts participating in the IAEA evaluation have published different views, showing that the agency's introduction of the report is too hasty and the conclusions are also limited and one -sided. Pass "".</p>
<p>Some media questions were asked that when Gronci visited South Korea and New Zealand a few days ago, it was no dangerous for the drainage of Fukushima nuclear treatment water to drain the water and other nuclear power stations. In this regard, Wang Wenbin responded that Fukushima's nuclear pollution water is still uncertain whether it can be dealt with. Compared with the water excreted by other nuclear power stations, it is different from the types of radioactive nucleoin and the difficulty of treatment. "It is not at all at all. "One thing", incurable ratio.</p>

<p>Wang Wenbin said that IAEA did not evaluate the effectiveness and long -term reliability of the Japanese nuclear pollution water purification equipment, and it cannot guarantee that all nuclear pollution water in the next 30 years can deal with the standards. in conclusion.</p>
<p>He said: "If some people think that Fukushima nuclear pollution water can be consumed and swimming, we recommend that the Japanese side use the nuclear pollution water to make good use of them for drinking or swimming instead of being row into the sea and worrying about the international community."</p>
<p>Regarding the strong response of the Chinese side this time, Chinese netizens have supported it and agreed that "why do you not keep it by himself since it is a good thing?" He also said that Wang Wenbin "knew the proposal" and "domineering leakage". Gronci "talks about it for 10 years and said it will not be rowed."</p>
<h3>China wants to expand restrictions on daily food imports</h3>
<p>Reuters reported that Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao previewed on the 11th that if Tokyo insisted on nuclear treatment of water, Hong Kong will prohibit imported water products from many counties in Japan.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in Fukushima</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.</p>

<h4>Fishermen in FukushimaWhen cleaning silver fish, Ono remembered the day when he changed the world: On March 11, 2011, a nine -level earthquake triggered a huge tsunami on the east coast of Japan. Ono survived on his boat, but his home on the land was destroyed. He lost a younger brother. The tsunami also impacted the Fukushima nuclear power plant, causing explosion and melting.</h4>

<h3>Tragging fisheries</h3>
<p>The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly recovered. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."</p>

<h3>Place of cooling water</h3>
<p>The damaged Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station scene at the scene of the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station is the focus of controversy. According to the authorities, these water storage tanks must be removed before rebuilding. These water is mainly used for cooling reactors after the disaster.</p>

<h3>cooling water is safe?</h3>
<p>An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.</p>

<p>Ono Chunfu stands in the place where the former house is located. After the tsunami, the area was turned into a park. Although his new home is inland, the 71 -year -old man had to "work at sea" to the end of his life. He felt dim in the future prospects of the fishing industry. He asked: "What do those children who go to elementary and junior high schools?" For them, it was too unstable for them.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-12T02-12-05-00-00/000187243_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>The longer the life span of an enterprise, the better the number of companies?</p>
<p>In the past, the economy and society always tended to think that the more the number of enterprises, the better, and the longer the life span of the enterprise, the better, the so -called "businessmen gathered, human smoke spoke", and the "hundred -year -old shop" was advertised.</p>
<p>The number of enterprises is positively correlated with the activity of the economic system, and the motivation for establishing an enterprise is also diverse. Enterprises breed more enterprises and maintain their existence for different purposes. The number of enterprises has a certain relationship with the life span of the enterprise, and there is no doubt that the existence of a large number of unable to profitable enterprises has extended the life of the corporate group on the surface. Extreme examples, that is, the so -called zombie enterprise -although companies are difficult to make profitable and have difficulty in operating difficulties, it is necessary to try to keep it on the cost of closing the cost or bearing it. Some zombie companies are caused by acquired, partly set; some are based on financial considerations, and some are based on legal settings; some zombie companies still have their "value" and still responsible for their specific functions. Can wait for bankruptcy to close.</p>
<p>Although many reasons or motivations have prevented the withdrawal of some enterprises, maintaining the competitive intensity of enterprises, improving innovation capabilities, and a more vigorous vitality of the economy and society are still constantly promoting the corporate environment to be exempted from closed, conservative, and rigid. The household is not stingy, and the flowing water is not rot. " But everything has two sides, and it is changing:</p>
<p>In the era of the digital economy, the social and economic environment of the enterprise has a historic drama, the competitive intensity of the enterprise is higher, the innovative ability has a qualitative leap, and the economic vitality is also changing. Then, the number of enterprises will become more and more. few? Will the life span of the enterprise become longer and shorter?</p>
<p>Under the digital economic conditions, the establishment and exit of enterprises should be more convenient in the technical process. The activities of many enterprises are even digitized. The records of finance and legal activities are clear, complete, and timely. The termination of exit is guaranteed in terms of efficiency, and no longer experiences tedious finances, laws, and administrative procedures. In short, the exit of enterprises is not "difficult" as it is established. On the other hand, the corporate responsibility has become completely "digital" to a considerable extent. The identification and definition of the facts are clear, accurate, complete, and timely, and the responsibility is greatly reduced. As a result, when the function of the enterprise comes to an end, its responsibility naturally comes to an end, and there will be no de facto deferred, and the determination of responsibility between enterprises will not be deferred.</p>
<p>This shows that under the conditions of digital economy, the survival of enterprises is more based on the actual situation of its functional implementation. Once the function is completed or terminated, the necessity of the company's survival is zero. Compared with the re -setting of the enterprise, the functional rehabilitation is compared with the company. The latter may be more convenient. The main form of the assets of exited enterprises is digital assets, and its circulation is efficient and convenient, and it is not necessary to transfer through the form of company equity or control. Therefore, as the enterprise's new establishment, the withdrawal of enterprises will also frequently occur frequently or even a large number.</p>
<p>Under digital economic conditions, business outsourcing will be more convenient, effective and comprehensive. The functional organization of the company's institutions will be modularized and outsourced, and the adjustment of the function framework will become more convenient and efficient. Therefore, external functions will be external. Universalization, a large number of company companies have newly established and exited have become a normal system arrangement.</p>
<p>So, how short is the life of an enterprise?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the product, the life span of the enterprise should be longer than the product life. Simply put, when the product is still in a shelf life or warranty period, the enterprise should continue to ensure its product responsibility. The problem is that if the product is outsourced out of the after -sales, or the product responsibility is more detailed, that is, the main body of the product responsibility is diverse, then the product sales party is not the only or main responsible party. However, the impact of the product liability event is completely in a controllable range, which does not cause trouble. That is to say, the life expectancy of enterprises can be universally shortened than the product liability period, that is, it is not subject to its constraints.</p>
<p>From a financial perspective, the tax completion of the enterprise is based on the financial year. Under the digital economic conditions, the time node of the economic activities is dense and accurate. The corresponding payment arrangements and the tax burden occur in time and accurate. It can occur in time or even at the same time according to the standards of digital and fiscal and taxation, and it is stagnant from time to time. There is no need to agree or set separately. Funding between enterprises, payment is settlement, and the popularity of smart contracts, there is no need to arrange separately. Even if there are so -called unified accounts, nuclear debts, and even the arrangement of upward increases, they often occur immediately or at any time. There is no need to accumulate mergers and processing, or the part of the subsequent financial responsibility is greatly compressed. Obstacles. That is to say, under digital economic conditions, the constraints of financial activities on enterprises will be weakened, and they will not even constitute fundamental constraints. Because the financial responsibilities on the financial office are clear, and the constraints such as smart contracts are guaranteed, the meaning of the accounting assumption of sustainable operation is not great. It will bring fundamental distress.</p>
<p>From the perspective of corporate law, the efficiency of the establishment and exit of the enterprise has greatly improved, and the company's industry is more sensitive to legal responsibility. The legal responsibility sharing and functional settings are more detailed. The complex responsibility subject will timely terminate a series of responsible subjects in a timely manner. Therefore, legal, the life span of the enterprise will be completely based on its functional settings. A large adjustment or change of the functional model will be a more reasonable and efficient choice to replace existing enterprises will be more reasonable and efficient. Adjust the reform to adapt to the new situation, and the industry will respond through more convenient replacement of outsourced companies or new companies.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the market, the experience, reputation, and market position or share accumulated by the company still have its inheritance. higher. In fact, most of the changes in enterprises are carried out indirectly, which helps change, transfer, authorized production or sales of trademark patents, instead of new enterprises to replace existing enterprises. Transition period or adaptation period. In the era of digital economy, this so -called transition or adaptation period is more short -lived, and even the market does not care about changes or replacement of enterprises.</p>
<p>From the perspective of corporate operators, the digital economy era provides more flexible and changeable corporate operation dimensions. In terms of employment, it can even achieve zero employment. The business model and its activities depend on digital economic environment such as network computing power. The institutional constraints and concept constraints of the previous digital economy are weaker. The length of the life expectancy of the enterprise will not be the purpose, but the means.</p>
<p>It is expected that the enterprise is flexible and suitable, and its relocation or change will occur more frequently, which is more favorable for individuals or markets. On the other hand, a new "long -lived" company enterprise will also appear, which only provides the agency functions of related company companies, and its so -called products or services are all realized by the "outsourcing" company. In fact, these companies are "empty shells" of just living crabs, not so -called "zombie companies" ...Note: This article only represents the author's personal point of view</p>

He said: "I see the age of 35 years of age, it is easy to think of the age threshold in the field of employment in China. In 1994, the temporary provisions of the relevant civil servants promulgated by the Chinese government must be under the age of 35 to apply for civil servants.

In response, Nike responded that it had confirmed to the supplier that it had not used textile materials produced in Xinjiang. (Data photo)</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Canadian Enterprise Responsibility Supervisor's Office (Core) issued a preliminary evaluation report on Tuesday (July 11) to investigate the Nikecanada and Dynasty Golds of Nike Canadian. The supply chain and Chinese business of these two enterprises are suspected of using or <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/涉新疆強迫勞動-德國車廠遭ngo提起申訴/a-65985141">benefit from the forced labor for Uighurs</a>Essence</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that this is the first time that the office has launched such investigations since the office has established a complaint mechanism in 2021. In the past, no other institutions in Canada had conducted similar investigations. China has always refuted the above allegations about the forced labor in Xinjiang. On the 11th, the Chinese ambassador to Canada denied it again in a statement.</p>
<p>In June last year, 28 private groups jointly complained to the overseas business of 13 Canadian companies, including the two cases, and the evaluation report and subsequent measures of the 11 cases will be released separately in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Supervisor Sheri Meyerhoffer said through a statement that the mission of the agency is to solve human rights involved in human rights in a fair and fair manner. Responsibility](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/防范强制劳工-德国供应链法落实得了吗/a-65438393)"".</p>
<p>The Office of High Commissioner of Human Rights Affairs issued a report last year that the Chinese government's allegations of torture to Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are "credible", and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/聯合國發布新疆報告-稱中國恐犯下反人類罪/a-62987574">may constitute anti -human crimes</a>Essence At that time, Zhang Jun, a Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, stated that Beijing "resolutely opposed" the assessment of the report, saying that "the so -called Xinjiang issue is completely lies for political motivation."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T03-40-00Z/56997381_401.png" />The picture shows the "Occupational Training Center" of Daban City, Xinjiang. Western accusations such as "re -education camps" are actually "re -education, but China continues to deny it. (Data photo)</p>
<h3>Nike and the dynasty gold ore facing allegations?</h3>
<p>According to the Canadian Supervisory Institutions Report, the civil organizations proposed by the appeal quoted the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy (ASPI) in 2020. Enterprises such as Yida Textiles have business exchanges; these Chinese enterprises are suspected of being forced to be forced to "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新疆女子遭警方帶走-曾因分享再教育營情況遭打壓/a-64682037">re -education</a>The Uyghur, or "exported" Uyghur workers from Xinjiang to other provinces.</p>
<p>Civil groups call for Nike to take reasonable measures to ensure that their product raw materials are not from Xinjiang. Faced with allegations, Nike responded in February this year that it had confirmed to the supplier that it had not used textile materials produced in Xinjiang, and had strengthened its supervision procedures, and did not find that the Uyghur was hired in the supply chain. Nike denies related companies such as Hao Yuanpeng.</p>
<p>The dynasty gold mines were accused of using or benefiting from forced labor in Xinjiang mining areas. Civil groups advocate that although the operation of the dynasty's gold mines in China may be controlled by local partners, it is still responsible for ensuring that the mining area is not used for forced labor. In this regard, the dynasty gold mines said that it had stopped mining in Xinjiang in 2008, and the relevant human rights doubts occurred after the company evacuated Xinjiang.</p>
<p>In response to the report issued by the Canadian Supervisory Institution on the 11th, the dynasty's gold mines responded to Reuters through emails, saying that the allegations were "completely without basis"; Nike did not immediately reply to the comment request.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T03-40-00Z/56996335_401.png" />In 2021, the "Xinjiang Cotton" controversy broke out. H &amp; M and other multinational brands were rebounded by China for not using Xinjiang cotton in the past. At that time, the Chinese government and the people also launched a large -scale resistance to support Xinjiang cotton. (Data photo)</p>
<h3>Forced labor involved in Chinese prisons</h3>
<p>On the 11th, another company was charged with suspected forced labor: the US Congress questioned that Milwaukeetool, Milwaqi, had hired a Chinese prison prisoner. According to Reuters, Republican members Chris Smith and Democratic Senator Jeffmerkley asked in a letter in a letter asking whether Metoch did supervise the supply chain and investigate relevant charges.</p>
<p>According to Wisconsin Watch, Wisconsin Watch, [Taiwan Human Rights Proposal Li Mingzhe], which has been detained for 5 years, has been detained in China for 5 years.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/遭關押五年返台-李明哲揭中國司法獄政現況/a-61742524)It means that he had been forced to work for 13 hours a day and stitched his work gloves for Movak with other Chinese prisoners. One of the company's suppliers, Shanghai Sidel Safety Products Company, was charged with outsourcing to prison in Hunan Province.</p>
<p>In response, Movccy responded to Reuters that the company had "strict policies and procedures" to ensure that the product was not forced to work, and claimed that "no evidence was found to prove relevant allegations." Movagch belongs to Hong Kong's Chuangke industry.</p>
<p>The United States' "Prevention of the Uighur Labor Law" officially came into effect last year. Many multinational retail operators faced Congress's inspection due to their business in China. In May this year, US Congress also wrote to Nike, Adidas, Shein, Temu and other companies to ask whether its products use raw materials from Xinjiang. Some U.S. officials also accused China that shifted prisoners from Xinjiang to factories in other provinces; China has repeatedly denied it. The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment request.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-12T04-52-51-00-00/000187231_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>The US Supreme Court made a major judgment at a time, as if throwing a bomb from the bunker, causing a masterpiece of gunfire in all directions. It is often necessary to let the bullets fly for a while to see which ones hit the targets, which are missed, which are wrong, and even put the guns in the sky. After the "Student's Fair Admission Organization Organization for Harvard Cases", the scene where the bullets were fluttered. As soon as the sentence was sentenced, large and small media reported immediately, saying that "the court has overturned equal rights measures." All kinds of comments are flying, and those who support the judgment cheer and defeat the discrimination fairly. A few hours later, President Biden said on TV that "this court is abnormal."</p>
<p>After a few days of bullets, people can calm down, carefully read what the judgment is written, which policies have been denyed, and which new policies have created space -the judgment of the Supreme Court is often not only negative. The old policy is denied, but the problems in reality still exist and must be replaced by new policies. The "Judgment" of this case plus the approval and opposition from several judges, as long as 237 pages. It is worth noting that, unlike the previously Supreme Court's judgment of Affirmative measures, the "Judgment" written by the chief judges of Johnroberts does not mention "equal rights measures", but it is said that Harvard's "racial conscious admission policy" The equal protection clause that violates the 14th amendment of the Constitution is because it treats candidates according to race identity. The "Judgment" did not clearly overthrow the previous judgments that supported equal rights. Instead, the Supreme Court has never allowed schools to treat candidates according to racial identity.</p>
<p>In order to avoid understanding the deviation, the "Judgment" even specifically pointed out: "You should never interpret this judgment as a prohibition of the university's considering how the ethnic group that the applicant said to affect his/her life, good discrimination, inspirational, or even other, all belong to them, all belong to them, all belong to them, all belong to them, all belong to them. Life experience ... Take racial discrimination as an example. If a student must benefit from it, he must closely close the courage and determination of the student himself. " Candidates' racial factors are completely excluded, but they cannot use racial identity alone as an indicator that separates from the student's personal experience. In other words, this judgment requires that the university must see the racial identity through the personal experience of each student, and it must vary from individuals, rather than simply and rudely determine the choice according to the racial identity. Interpreting this judgment as "overthrowing equal rights" is obviously suspected of simplified.</p>
<p>The original intention of implementing equal rights was to pursue equality and fairness. This case showed a wider social, political and economic demands more extensive than racial rights from beginning to end. Although the direct law of the lawsuit is that Harvard takes care of African candidates during the admission, the evidence submitted by the plaintiff shows that Harvard's biggest unfairness in admission is not in terms of racial identity, but a large number of preferential second -generation rich second generation and the second generation of the school. This type of discount only accounts for 5%of the total number of Harvard candidates, but it accounts for more than 30%of the admitted new students. If candidates are the gold master of Harvard, the opportunity to be admitted is 7 times higher than ordinary candidates; if the parents are alumni of Harvard, the opportunity to be admitted is 6 times that of ordinary candidates. Moreover, 70%of the new students admitted through such preferential policies are white, accounting for 43%of all white new students. Obviously, this policy not only greatly reduces the admission opportunities of minority candidates, but also greatly reduces the admission opportunities of ordinary white families and poor families.</p>
<p>During the Supreme Court's argument, the plaintiff aimed at Harvard's preferential student policy in the opening white, saying that the Supreme Court asked the university to adopt a fair admission plan for racial neutrality 20 years ago. After the prosecution, I started to make some attitude of taking care of the candidates for poor families, but the specific measures did not hurt or itchy. The symbol of significance was greater than the actual effect: "82%of Harvard students are rich children, and the proportion of rich students and poor students is 23 to 1 . It is not diversified at all. "Harvard's lawyer argued that the donation was in line with the legitimate interests of the school. Gorgach, considered conservative(Neil Gorsuch)The judge asked: "Does Harvard donate to build an art museum than the interests of the Constitution's equal protection of the Constitution?" Harvard's lawyer was asked to vomit and speak unparalleled.</p>
<p>In the context of the equal protection of the Constitution, lawyers to defend Harvard's policy admitted by Harvard and the ribbon relationship, which is obviously an irreplaceable mission. In the opinion of the solo agreed judgment, Judge Gosach wrote in a sharp language: "The policies of the discount gold master, alumni, and children's children can brag with those who cannot take their parents' wealth, and there is no condition to enter the alumni meeting tent. Candidates are not helpful. Although on the surface, such preferential policies are also racial, but the most benefit is undoubtedly white -rich candidates. "Social public opinion has further, and the targets of criticism are the second -generation and rich second generation and rich second -generation and rich second -generation. The second generation of the study extended to the second -generation official, and remembered that President Bush's old Geng Bush was mediocre but was admitted to Yale by his father. He even questioned whether President Kennedy rely on family relationships to enter Harvard. The author who has a good thing even turned out of Kennedy's application letter. He wrote a major reason to apply for Harvard in the letter: "I want to go to the same university with my father."</p>
<p>The unfairness of American society is reflected in different social issues in different eras, and has different effects on various social groups. This verdict terminates the practice of the heroic status as a racial identity in the university's admission. At the same time, it is also expected to make the equal-scale social-economic disadvantaged class that benefits all races. However, the prohibition of taking care of minority ethnic groups in admission has become a reality, but the policy of canceling the relationship between the preferential gold master and the tape in the admission is generally just a vision. Under the current law, the school is admitted to money and admission according to the relationship. It is the same as that of the test scores. As long as it is not directly linked to the student's ethnic identity, it is not illegal. So far, only a few private universities such as MIT, John Hopkins have canceled the policy of preferential second -generation and the second generation of the university. Only one state legislation in Colorado has banned state universities from implementing similar policies.</p>
<p>If the federal government is willing and determined to change the unfair status of the admission of prestigious schools, there is enough carrots and sticks in their hands, and it can be made in the existing legal framework. Private and state universities in the United States receive a large amount of funds from the federal government every year, and the share of famous universities has the largest share. Taking Harvard as an example, the scientific research funds received in 2019 exceeded $ 800 million, of which 70%came from the federal government. According to US law, the federal government can set up additional conditions for schools using federal expenses. For example, schools are required to take "equal rights measures" to students of social-economic disadvantaged families during admission, as the federal government did in the 1960s. At that time, the request was not to discriminate against minority ethnic groups. After the Supreme Court made the above -mentioned judgment, the federal government had sufficient reasons to require universities to not discriminate against candidates from ordinary families and poor families during admission.Note: This article only represents the author's personal point of view.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-12T05-09-21-08-00/pkcw-master1050.jpg" />NATO national leaders who held a meeting in Lithuania this week have sufficient reasons to celebrate success.</p>
<p>Just four years ago, on the eve of another summit, the organization seemed to be at a low tide; using French President Macron at the time, it was in "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/europe/macron-nato-brain-death.html">brain death</a>"Status. Since the invasion of Ukraine in Russia, the situation has changed. As the NATO plan welcomes Sweden's joining (Finland has become a formal member in April this year,(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/world/europe/finland-nato-russia-ukraine.html)) And sending the army to strengthen the East Wing, the EU allies have finally fulfilled their commitments to increase military expenditure that have been delayed. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/06/22/positive-ratings-for-nato/"> Public media</a>Followed by. If Russia sought to split Europe, then President Biden could announce it rationally last spring that Russia's actions instead completely made the European continent "<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/27/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-united-states-naval-academys-class-of-2022-graduation-and-commissioning-ceremony/">NATO</a>"".</p>
<p>This transformation naturally revives the supporters of NATO. NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg's main statement- "NATO's power is the best tool for our maintenance peace and security" -the never so many loyal fans. Even those who have a criticism of the organization (such as the people of the Huagong faction, they believe that NATO is not enough to pay attention to the true threat of East Asia; such as the restraint in the United States, they hope that Washington will re -pay attention to diplomatic solutions and domestic issues).) The main purpose of NATO is to defend Europe.</p>
<p>But NATO has not been based on gathering military forces from the beginning. In <a href="https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/01/24/nato-ready-for-anything/index.html">the peak of the Cold War</a>NATO has deployed 100 divisions, which is only a small part of the Huayo soldiers. It is impossible to expect it to repel the invasion of the Soviet Union, and even the nuclear weapons of the European continent are under the control of Washington. On the contrary, its plan is to bind the more magnificent projects dominated by Western Europe and the United States. Under this project, the protection of the United States as a leverage, which allows the United States to obtain other issues such as trade and monetary policy. concession. It turns out that this mission in NATO is very successful.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Many observers predict that after its collapse of its cold war opponents, NATO will be closed. But in ten years after 1989, the organization played a real role. It serves as EU's rating agencies in Eastern Europe and announces the security of countries in development and investment. The organization promotes potential partners to adhere to liberality and support the market, just as President Clinton's <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/1994-03-01/confronting-backlash-states">National Security Counselor</a>As mentioned, in accordance with the creed, "pursuing democracy and expanding the free market" and "promoting collective security" are along handling. European military professionals and elites with reform ideas have formed a voluntary supporter group, and NATO information institutions have promoted their activities.</p>
<p>When the European people are proved to be too stubborn or affected by the adverseity of socialist or nationalist emotions, the Atlantic integration continues. The Czech Republic is a good example. <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=7937"> 1997</a>In the face of the NATO's referendum, in the face of possible "opposition" votes, NATO Secretary -General and senior NATO senior officials decided to let the Prague government simply cancel the referee; the country joined NATO two years later. After entering the new century, the focus of NATO's work has changed steadily. At the same time as the Global War, the "Big Bang" expansion in 2004 -seven countries added NATO -in NATO's wording, counter -terrorism replaced democracy and human rights. What is still unchanged is the emphasis on the necessity of liberalization and the reform of the public sector.</p>
<p>In the field of defense, NATO is not as promoting. For decades, the United States has been the main provider of weapons, logistics, air bases and combat plans. In the Ukrainian war, although people are talking about Europe to strengthen intervention, the asymmetry of the United States and Europe has basically remained unchanged. Obviously, the scale of US military assistance -in the first year of the conflict, it reached <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/">$ 47 billion</a>——It is more than twice the total assistance of the EU countries. European expenditure commitments may not be as impressive as it looks like. The German government announced the establishment of [$ 110 billion Special Fund] for its armed forces(https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/special-fund-federal-armed-forces-2047910)After more than a year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-happened-to-the-german-militarys-100-billion-fund/a-64846571">Most of the money</a>Nothing has not been spent. At the same time, the German military commander said that they lacked enough ammunition and could not play high -intensity battles for more than two days.However, this paradox is only superficial. In fact, NATO is in accordance with <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2018-12-11/natos-original-purpose-double-containment-soviet-union-resurgent-germany#_edn2">Post -War U.S. Planner</a>The design method has enabled Europe to be dependent on the power of the United States and compress its exhibition space. NATO is by no means an expensive charitable plan, but to ensure the influence of the United States in Europe at a low cost. The United States' investment in NATO and other security aid projects in Europe only accounts for a small part of the Pentagon's annual budget -according to recent estimates, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/why-america-still-needs-europe">less than 6%</a>Essence The current war will only enhance the influence of the United States. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, European military expenditure [about half] <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-europe-buy-american-weapons-military-industry-defense/">about half</a>Flowing to American manufacturers. This trend has intensified due to surge in demand. Buyers are anxious to buy tanks, fighters and other weapon systems to sign expensive multi -year contracts. Europe may be re -military, but the United States is enjoying its success.</p>
<p>This model is obvious in Ukraine. Washington will provide military security. American companies will benefit from a large number of military orders in Europe, and Europeans will bear the cost of post -war reconstruction -compared to military power construction, this is a more capable task in Germany. This war is also a preview of the US -China confrontation, and it cannot be easily expected to be at the support of Europe. Restricting Beijing's strategic technology and promoting the development of the United States is almost not a priority in Europe, and it is still difficult to imagine that cutting off the European -China trade. However, there have been signs that NATO is progressing in terms of allowing Europe to follow it in the European Theater leadership. On the eve of the visit to Washington at the end of June, the German Defense Minister was timely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/world/europe/german-defense-minister-pistorius-stronger-geopolitical-role.html">point out that he knows</a>To "Europe's responsibility to the Indo -Pacific region" and the importance of "rules -based international order" in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Regardless of its advantages, Atlanticists are worried that false information and network intervention will destroy support for the organization. They don't have to worry. NATO has been controversial throughout the Cold War. It was still a controversial topic until the 1990s. At that time, the disappearance of the opponents inspired people's thinking about the new European security structure. Today, there are fewer voices than ever.</p>
<p>Most of the European left -wing parties, which have always criticized militarism and American strength, have joined the ranks of defending the West: the trajectory of the German Green Party is a particularly vivid example. The party was once a fierce opponent of nuclear weapons. War risk. In the United States, the criticism of NATO is concentrated on the risk of over -expanding the obligations of the US treaty, rather than the rationality of this. This is the most successful alliance in history. Ceremony is gathered to celebrate themselves. There is no need to wait for champagne to wait until the 75th anniversary of the establishment of next year.</p>

<h1>Microsoft said that the US government agencies were invaded by Chinese hackers</h1>

<p>Description: Microsoft said hackers have obtained the access authority of government email accounts, but it has not stated that the specific organizations and institutions are affected. When the Biden government sought to ease Sino -US relations, the new invasion could lead to further tension between the relationship between the two parties. Andy Wong/Associated Press Microsoft said the Chinese hacker organization has obtained access to the email account since May and was not discovered until June.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-12T05-11-55-08-00/11dc-china-hack-kclh-master1050.jpg" />Microsoft disclosed on Tuesday evening that Chinese hackers intending to collect American intelligence have obtained access to government email accounts.</p>
<p>According to a person who understands the government's network invasion, this attack is targeted. Hackers are targeted at specific accounts instead of obtaining a large range of data invasion that will obtain a large amount of data. Adam Hodch, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said that there was no confidential network affected. The assessment of the amount of information obtained is still continuing.</p>
<p>Microsoft said that about 25 organizations (including government agencies) were attacked by the hacker organization, and the organization used forgery authentication tools to access personal email accounts. Microsoft said that hackers have obtained at least some of the account entry permissions at least a month before they were discovered. Microsoft did not disclose affected organizations and institutions.</p>
<p>The complexity of this attack and its targetedness show that the Chinese hacker organization is either part of the Beijing intelligence department or working for it. "According to our evaluation, opponents are mainly engaged in spy activities, such as entering the email system to collect information," Microsoft Executive Vice President Charlie Bell(CharlieBell)Written in a blog post.</p>
<p>The new invasion seems to be different from the recently known biggest invasion, Russia's penetration of government computers (known as the Solarwinds Hacker event) in 2019 and 2020. Microsoft managers said that the number of e -mail accounts involved in the new invasion is much less and does not penetrate the target system.</p>
<p>Hackers did not seem to enter the secret network. Nevertheless, hackers can access government emails a month before being discovered, which may let them understand the useful information about the Chinese government and their intelligence departments.</p>
<p>Even when the Bayeng government seeks to cool the tension between the United States and China, the invasion may further lead to tight relations between the two countries. Due to several incidents such as Chinese spy balls flying over the United States, the tension has deteriorated in recent months.</p>
<p>The outside world does not have enough criticism in deterrent Chinese spy activities, and this incident will also exacerbate related criticism. Former spokesman of the Trump administration, the former spokesman of the National Intelligence Director of the Trump, said that because President Bayeng did not try to influence the recent election behavior and confrontation, China became more bold.</p>
<p>"We have to take action how many hackers we have to endure," we must conduct serious discussions, "Sims said.</p>
<p>In the blog post, Bell stated that the person who was under the hacker had received notifications and the company had completed the effort to reduce the consequences of this attack.</p>
<p>Microsoft said that on June 16, the information reported to them prompted them to pay attention to the invasion and the damage caused. The company's blog post says that Chinese hackers have obtained access to email accounts a month ago, that is, May 15th.</p>
<p>Microsoft did not disclose how many accounts that Chinese hackers might have invaded, nor did they disclose whether the information was stolen.</p>
<p>Over the years, Beijing has implemented a series of hackers and successfully stole a large amount of government data. In 2015, a data leakage of a hacker implemented by a foreign spy agency affiliated to China stole a large number of records from the Personnel Administration.</p>
<p>In the Solarwinds hacker incident during Trump's administration, Russian intelligence agencies used software vulnerabilities to enter thousands of computer systems, including many government agencies. That hacker attack was named after the network management software used by Russian intelligence agencies to invade computers around the world.</p>

<p>NATO leaders stated in a statement that "the future of Ukraine is in NATO, but they did not provide a specific timetable for this process.</p>
<p>The statement pointed out that "when the allies agree and the conditions are met, we will be able to issue an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance." However, the statement did not specify these conditions.</p>
<p>NATO did give up the requirements of Ukraine's performance of the so -called member action plan, thereby effectively eliminating the obstacles to Ukraine's joining the military alliance.</p>

Before meeting the leaders of NATO, Zelei went to the crowded urban square in Vilnius to speak to a group of Lithuanian supporters.</p>
<p>Before Zediski arrived, he criticized NATO leaders on Twitter.</p>
<p>He wrote: "Whether it is invitation to Ukraine or obtaining the qualifications of member states, it has not introduced a certain timetable. This is unprecedented and ridiculous."</p>
<p>A reporter from Peninsula reported that although NATO's support for Ukraine was "unwavering and no doubt", the results of the NATO Summit on the first day of the NATO Summit were not what Kiev wanted to see.</p>
<p>The reporter reported from Vilnex, "They have been promised to be invited to enter the league in the future, but the conditions that need to be met have not yet been fully clarified, and it is important that there is no timetable for all this."</p>
<p>The reporter pointed out that Zelei Sky has lobby the leaders of the summit and hopes that they will immediately issue an invitation, even if it depends on whether the war will end.</p>
<p>The reporter added that "he said that although he trusts the NATO, he may not be confident and believes that any form of uncertainty will be interpreted by Russia as weak."</p>

There are currently 31 member states. Russia opposes NATO military deployment near its border(Peninsula TV Station)</p>
<h4>major and direct threat</h4>
<p>NATO's position highlights the differences in the issue of its 31 member states in Ukraine's alliance or directly inviting Ukraine to enter the alliance. As early as Russia launched special military operations on Ukraine in February 2022, Kiev has been promoting the rapidly joining NATO on the basis of security guarantee.</p>
<p>NATO member states in Eastern Europe supported Ukraine's appeal and believed that Ukraine under the security umbrella of NATO is the best way to prevent Russia from attacking again.</p>
<p>The United States and Germany have always been more cautious and are worried that any act may cause direct conflict between NATO and Russia.</p>
<p>NATO statement stated that "we reiterate our unswerving support of the Ukrainian government and their people, and they bravely defend their countries, land and our common values."</p>
<p>This statement stated to Moscow with a tough wording, "the peace and stability of the Russian Federation to the security of the allies and the peace and stability of the European-Atlantic region constitute the most significant and direct threat."</p>
<p>When asked about the criticism of Zelei, NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg stated at a press conference that "NATO has never sent a stronger information, whether in terms of political information about the road to enter the alliance. , Still in the specific support of NATO member states. "</p>
<p>He also said that there was no additional schedule that had previously joined NATO. "They have always been based on specific conditions."</p>

<h4>to increase military support</h4>
<p>In view of the desire of Zeelianzki's hope of entering the alliance, Western officials emphasized that there will be a broader -share support proposal to make Ukraine have a military advantage relative to the Russian army.</p>
<p>German Prime Minister Schultz said that the Seventh Kingdom Group will issue a long -term support statement, and once "realize peace", it will start immediately. It is expected that this will be announced after the NATO Summit will be announced on the 12th.</p>
<p>Recently, Germany promised to provide more than $ 771 million (about 700 million euros) military assistance to Cyrania.</p>
<p>The new assistance includes the launch system of the two patriot missile systems, the other 40 weasel infantry chariots and 25 "Leopard 1" tanks.</p>
<p>French President Macron said that France will provide a long -range "storm shadow" cruise missile with Britain so that Ukraine can strike the Russian goal deep in the front line.</p>
<p>Denmark and the Netherlands stated that an alliance consisting of 11 countries will start training Ukraine pilots to drive F-16 fighters next month and will set up a new training center in Romania.</p>
<p>The NATO Summit also received the prospects of Sweden as the prospect of its latest member states. Previously, Turkish President Erdogan suddenly gave up his position against Sweden's alliance this Monday, and also promoted the restoration of Turkey's negotiations to join the European Union.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T06-38-23/image-1-1689143320.jpg" />Why does Türkiye change its position to join the NATO in Sweden?(Peninsula TV Station)</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zaharava told a reporter from Peninsula that NATO member states were only reached an agreement on the issue of Ukraine's unable to join the military alliance.</p>
<p>"You can see here that NATO decides not to be included in Ukraine. What kind of support do we discuss? This means that when Ukraine seek help, NATO member states have pulled it into the Western world. But they abandoned them. Ukraine, let it down. "</p>
<p>"They invited Finland and Sweden, but they did not invite Ukraine. Why? This is a question that all TV channels should be raised -why not?"</p>
<p>Russia used NATO East Expansion as a factor to attack Ukraine and criticized the NATO summit. It also warned that if the war was upgraded, Europe would first face the "catastrophic consequences."</p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said, "The issue of Ukraine's joining NATO may be quite dangerous to European security ... Therefore, those who will make decisions must realize this."</p>
<p>He also said that European leaders did not seem to understand that it was a mistake to move NATO's military infrastructure to the Russian border.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Many Hong Kong media reports that Guoan is on Tuesday (July 11) <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/羅冠聰家人遭港警突襲問訊-英議員憤慨/a-66195914">July at 6 am search for Luo Guancong's Hong Kong family residence</a>Essence Radio Hong Kong quoted police sources that the Guoan Department sent staff to Luo's apartment in Tung Chung, taking away Luo's parents and elder brothers to admit out their confession, "to understand whether they provide economic assistance to Luo Guancong and whether they are in Hong Kong." The three were not arrested after completing the question and were allowed to leave the police station.</p>
<p>Luo Guancong responded on the social media on the same day: "For a series of actions in the Hong Kong police recently, I can say certain: Related persons have nothing to do with me at all. My work has nothing to do with them. In the end, he publicly issued a month as early as the end of July 2020 that after leaving Hong Kong, he expressed his disconnection and contact with his loved ones. Luo Guancong is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/港警通緝8位民主人士-國際社會譴責/a-66101360">Guoan Office issued a million -dollar red order to be wanted on July 3</a>One of the eight overseas Hong Kong democrats.</p>
<p>This time after the announcement of the red order, the second wave of law enforcement operations against people in Hong Kong, all of them pointed to Luo Guancong's affiliated figures. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/涉嫌金援海外通緝犯-数名港人被捕/a-66130659">The Guoan Office arrested five former members of Hong Kong last week</a>It refers to the mobile phone application "Punishment Mee" supported by the "Yellow Store" (generally referring to a merchant supporting a democratic camp) to support Luo Guancong. The "Hong Kong Zhi Zhi", established by Luo Guancong and Huang Zhifeng, has announced the dissolution on the day of the implementation of the National Security Law.</p>
<h3>Guoan Hanging Red Order</h3>
<p>Li Enzhen, a visiting scholar at the University of London University of London, analyzed that the development of this week reflects that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英忧香港国安法寒蝉效应-港府批双标/a-55706399">the authorities expect to achieve the political effects greater than the legal effect</a>Essence He said to Germany: "The government understands that it is impossible to arrest eight people in essence. The red order aims to provide greater causes and create a white horror atmosphere monitoring each other in Hong Kong and overseas."</p>
<p>Li Enzhen pointed out that the special thing about the Guoan's red order is that it only needs to provide a chance to get a bounty, which is lower than the threshold of other criminal cases; Essence The national security case reward is also higher than other cases. The murder is only 30 to 800,000 Hong Kong dollars. Li Enyu pointed out that the outside world is unknown to the determination of the amount, but believes that heavy funds will help the authorities to master the whereabouts of eight people. The eight Hong Kong people who were wanted by the reds include: former Legislative Councilors Luo Guancong, Guo Rongzheng, and Xu Zhifeng, Meng Zhaoda, Director -General of the former Workers' Alliance, Ren Jianfeng, former French and Politics Converses, Guo Fengyi, Liu Zudi, and Yuan Gongyi.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Democratic Commission (HKDC), headquartered in Washington, is an overseas initiative of Hong Kong people. Member Zhou Yongkang, a member of the board of directors, believes that subsequent development has added scruples to overseas social movements. In an interview with the Voice of Germany, he said: "" Punishment of Mee "The arrest of the members of the pre-state aspirations was a new warning-both threatened to be in Hong Kong and intimidated the proposal outside. Undertake the cost of implication innocent. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T08-18-00Z/66130654_401.png" />The Hong Kong police arrested four former members of Hong Kong on July 5 and accused them of "punishing Mee" through the online mall to absorb funds to help overseas fugitives. The picture shows Lin Langyan, the chairman of the former Hong Kong Zhongzhi, was arrested by the Guoan Police</p>
<h3>soft confrontation, overseas report</h3>
<p>The National Security Law has been arrested for three years since the implementation of the National Security Law, and a large number of local political groups and unusual media have disbanded. In recent months, "soft confrontation" has become a new word that is often hung by officials. The media under the China United Nations Office repeatedly criticized the yellow economic circle for "soft confrontation". After the former Hong Kong members were arrested, "Punishment of Mee" and another well -known store supported by prisoners immediately closed.</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Li Jiachao said that the police had received some reports that they would use all forms of assistance to use any forms of assistance, calling on the city citizens to regard eight people as "cross -street mice". Deng Bingqiang, director of the Security Bureau, pointed out that the redness was to cut off their capital chain, and specially named Luo Guancong as the "modern traitor." Ye Liu Shuyi, the convener of the Executive Council, even said that the store's transportation for Hong Kong -style food to the fugitive is also "support".</p>
<p>The National Security Law has external legal power, and it has a significant impact on the blessing of the red order order. "Will you know that the wanted people, once supporting their social media or donations, will it cause the criminal responsibility or the National Security Department to question?" Scholars Li Enzhen believes that the Hong Kong government hopes to extend the report atmosphere overseas. With the Guoan hotline, the hanging red wanted to further cause the immigrant group to be suspicious and differentiated with each other, in order to seduce the effect of creating dislikes. "</p>
<p>Even before there was no red order, the projects of overseas Hong Kong people were under pressure. Former Chief Executive and the current vice chairman of the Chinese CPPCC Liang Zhenying have criticized criticism. This year, the "Yangcun" series of "Yangcun" series of picture books in the UK is "external forces challenged the Hong Kong National Security Law". Some Hong Kong people were arrested in Hong Kong because of their picture books. The production team revealed to the Voice of Germany that after the arrest operation, the reading and donations of books were reduced, and some reading activities were temporarily canceled due to pressure on the venue.</p>
<h3>?</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong police acknowledged that it would be difficult for them to take them out if they were not returned to Hong Kong. In response to the media inquiry from the Interpol, I did not receive a request to issue a red wanted order to eight democrats. The International Interpol Charter stipulates that no political criminals must be hunt, and law enforcement operations must meet the principle of human rights. Li Enzhen believes that the possibility of issuing a red wanted order is very low, but the authorities can apply for non -political reasons such as economic crimes or counter -terrorism, and there have been precedents in the past.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T08-18-00Z/66107406_401.png" />Luo Guancong's family was asked by the Hong Kong police raid on July 11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/五眼纷纷叫停与香港引渡协议-中方回应/a-54342518">Since the implementation of the National Security Law, multiple Western countries have interrupted the extradition agreement with Hong Kong</a>Essence The eight people are now living in the United States, Britain, and Australia, and they have no extradition agreement with China. Li Enyu pointed out that if eight people have stepped on a country with no extradition agreement but friendly with China, they still have the opportunity to be sent to the "original land." The problem is not a legal issue. " In today's political atmosphere, Li Enzhen believes that there is not much opportunity to repeat.</p>
<h3>Laying on overseas activities</h3>
<p>Eight people are well -known democrats, nor have they been exiled or participated in the initiative recently. Li Enzhen believes that this time may be with [The Outreach Law "with <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论对外关系法-中国要对美亮剑/a-66101691">China implemented on July 1st</a>related. "The general trend of the development of the national security system in China and Hong Kong is to strengthen overseas activities and groups. Hong Kong is about to set up three three sins for spy. I believe that the red order is just the beginning and pave the way for more new law in the future."</p>
<p>Analysis means that the Hong Kong Government has not had a big chance of arresting eight people in the Hong Kong Government, but the reddishness has caused some obstacles to overseas initiative. Zhou Yongkang visited South America on behalf of the Hong Kong Democratic Commission (HKDC) last month. For example, he said that Brazil and China had an extradition agreement. A group must communicate with the local department before entering the country. Essence He claims that the red order increases the political costs and risks of visiting these areas. "In terms of strategy, we must do more proposal to do more non -traditional democratic countries in the future. For example, many democratic countries in the southern China are Chinese allies. If you don't go there, you will have a great discount on human rights promotion, and you have to pay more attention in the future."</p>
<p>However, he believes that if the Hong Kong government's expansion list is not necessarily beneficial to it, "the name increases the exposure of the other party, but it will help to prevent the opposition movement. Most people on the list of reds have publicly stated that they would not stop their vocals. Zhou Yongkang believed that overseas proposals were psychologically prepared for the current situation. "It is indeed a dilemma, but people in overseas have no choice. I believe that everyone has thought and struggle earlier before I decided to choose to take this way." He said that he would not adjust the way of acting: " What we do is to help Hong Kong people from fear of fear. If long -term concentration or self -castration will make the work meaningless, it is exactly the effect that the regime wants to achieve. "</p>

<p>Liu Yangwei, chairman of Hon Hai Group: Foxconn must consider responding to the worst situation</p>
<h3>Indian Semiconductor Development In the event of frustration?</h3>
<p>However, Paultriolo, a global consultant company, told BBC: "Foxconn's sudden exit of Foxconn was a considerable blow to India's semiconductor development." He explained that "the obvious reason for this withdrawal is the lack of clear technical partners and the development track of joint venture. Both parties lack the rich experience in developing and managing large -scale semiconductor manufacturing business."</p>
<p>However, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Rajeevchandrasekhar, said that Foxconn's decision has no impact on India's semiconductor manufacturing goal. Chandrasecar also added that Foxconn and Willda are the "important investors" of the country, and they will promote their strategy separately in India.</p>
<p>The Indian government has been formulating a strategy to support the chip manufacturing industry. Last year, India established a $ 10 billion fund to attract more investors to invest in the field, looking forward to reducing India's dependence on foreign chip manufacturers. The flagship plan launched by Modi in 2014, "Made in India", is to help the country transform into a global manufacturing center that can match with China.</p>
<p>In recent years, several other companies have announced their plans to establish semiconductor factories in India.</p>

<p>India has been formulating strategies to support the chip manufacturing industry. In 2022, India established a $ 10 billion fund to attract more investors to invest in the field and look forward to reducing India's dependence on foreign chip manufacturers.</p>
<p>Last month, Microntechnology, a US memory chip giant, said it would invest $ 825 million to establish a semiconductor assembly and testing plant in India. Micron said that the construction of the factory in Gujarat will begin this year. It is expected that the project will directly create as many as 5,000 tasks and indirectly bring another 15,000 employment opportunities to the region.</p>

<p>End of podcastIntel former executive executive Vinod Dham is now a member of the Indian Semiconductor Mission Consultation Committee. He accepted an interview with the US media Businessstoday this year that India still faces some important challenges before becoming a key role. He said that, for example, to build a successful wafer factory, electricity cannot be faulty, because some plants for manufacturing high -end chips need to supply power without failure, and to avoid the risk of natural disasters, especially earthquakes.</p>
<p>However, Dam analyzed that in India, the infrastructure has not yet fully developed, and the customs clearance sometimes takes a few days or even a few weeks. Therefore, India must apply to the airport of the key components that are exported by India, or the customs set up in manufacturing facilities, assembly,, assembly, and Next to the cluster of testing and packaging facilities. In addition, Dam also emphasized that the factory area where the semiconductor factory and the back -end (assembly, testing and packaging) facilities are located should be protected by law, and it is necessary to prevent strikes and consider "unnecessary vacation regulations" to ensure that the Indian chip factories are competing for competition in competition. The fierce global semiconductor industry is competitive: "A advanced chip factory may take five years to enter comprehensive production. Not only does it require comprehensive financing to complete the work on time, but also the labor force must work all year round to ensure the chip factory factory to ensure the chip factory factory Can be put into operation as soon as possible. "</p>
<p>Analyst Srishti Khemka published a research report in the US Independent Think Tank "Council On ForeignRelations" stating that although huge investment in semiconductor manufacturing, lack of electricity, water, and mobility The bureaucratic bureaucracy has made India unable to become a semiconductor power on the basis of existing. She explained that although India has a strong talent pool and political will, it is not easy to create a feasible semiconductor ecosystem, and today's chip power has spent decades to develop to mature, and India is managing the "Indian manufacturing" plan. And providing difficulties in promoting the basic resources required for the semiconductor system, so that he is not optimistic about the efforts of Delhi's expansion of semiconductor development: "If there is no solid policy framework to fully solve all these problems, India cannot achieve the mission of a global semiconductor power. "</p>
<p>She said that water and energy are the other two key resources of semiconductor production, and both of the existing resources in India are insufficient. The Modi government has made some progress in improving groundwater management, but it is unclear whether these measures can be and how fast they can succeed.</p>
<p>Dham believes that although India currently has tens of thousands of design engineers cooperated with the world's top semiconductor companies, in terms of component physics required by the chip designed by these design engineers, and in terms of process and technical knowledge, India has almost no talents in India.

<p><strong> Moderator: Hello everyone, here is "view" I am Tang Qiwei. The guests of the "Viewpoint" program today are still the famous poet Yang Lian in Berlin. </strong><strong> Leaving home for more than thirty years, poetry became Yang Lian's "only mother tongue". He has published thirteen Chinese poems and was translated into more than thirty kinds of texts. </strong> <strong> 2018, </strong> <strong> Yang Lian </strong><strong> won the Hungarian International Poetry Award, known as the "Poetry Nobel Prize"(</strong> <strong> Yaus Pannuni International Poetry Award)</strong> <strong>. In the award -winning speech, Yang Lian said: </strong><strong> Poetry is like a butterfly, flying on a heavy life, maintaining the pride of the soul. In Yang Lian's view, poetry is natural, and he enjoys his own thoughts and freedom of thought and speech. For so many years, Yang Lian has been using poetry to express this freedom of speech. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: You have written a poem "To Hong Kong": the endless epic. You say that the real theme of this poem is far beyond Hong Kong, and their subtext is today's China. In your opinion, what is the biggest backward in China today?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Of course, this biggest reflux is of course the entire 40 years of the past 40 years, even if it is the incomplete reform and opening up, but the one it brings, from economic levels to social levels, such a gradually open opening up Status, or at least a possibility. As a poet, we still hope to have a modern transformation in culture, but Xi Jinping has cut off such a cultural transformation direction. Hong Kong is actually the most typical victim, because before 1997, at least they still appreciated the basic operating standards of a civilized society and the legal society. And now they have been pushed back to a power society. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: Speaking of this, Chen Zhiming, editor -in -chief of Hong Kong's "Exclusive People" (magazine), has been lost with the outside world since September last year, as well as the owner of the former Shanghai Independence Bookstore monsoon book garden Yu Miao. His wife thanks Fang, after nine months (by the Chinese authorities) restricted from leaving the country, it was only recently reunited with the United States and his family. Recently, similar things seem to be constantly happening. In your opinion, what kind of signal is this conveying?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: I admire Mr. Chen Zhiming very much, because this magazine can be said to be upstream. In this case of Hong Kong and the whole of China, he can express his own humanities and people very clearly about humanities, for humanities, for humanities, for humanities, to treat humanities, to humanity, to humanities, to humanities, to the humanities, to the humanities, to the humanity, and to The concern and call for conscience. In fact, Mr. Chen Zhipeng is good. Just now you say that the family members of the monsoon (the owner of the book garden) are also good. In fact, it continues the highest political power from the Cultural Revolution of Shidongshan and the 57th year. Conscience, Chinese intellectuals, conscience and conscience are a kind of suppression and persecution, and they are the latest recent batches of victims. This is also a proof that I just said that Xi Jinping, such as Xi Jinping. What he wants to pass to the Chinese is that you are still our slaves. It is equivalent to Xi Jinping's hope that the world is acceptable. He is China and China. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I know you are very concerned about the iron chain girl. You have a poem to write like this: You said that in China, the mother personally deleted the word mother in Chinese. What is the biggest shock of the iron chain girl?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: The biggest shock of the iron chain woman is not her miserable fate of a woman in China, because I know that such a tragic experience and a tragic fate, there are too many men in Chinese men. My shock is because of the phenomenon of the iron chain girl. It inspires the conscience of Chinese people within a short period of time, and this conscience broke out so violently. In a month, there have been 67 billion people on the Internet. Anti -struggle, and this struggle is quite rational, in my words, the iron chain woman is a Tiananmen gate that does not go to the street. And my poem, "Please delete the word Chinese in Chinese", was also very gloomy when I heard the news just when I heard the news. This gloomy feeling is not only the fate of a woman, but also the fate of culture. It is not China but Chinese. A text and culture that lasted for thousands of years had to turn the word of mother into a state of sacrifice that was raped and forced to give birth. So in fact, when the mother does not exist anymore, let alone the child, let alone every generation. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: You just mentioned the iron chain girl, and the response of many citizens like a Tiananmen gate that is not on the street. I saw that you (overseas) actively responded during the white paper exercise. In your opinion, do they really realize what they are resisting? In fact, the question I want to ask is that their resistance and you in the 1980s have the resistance of young people in Hong Kong. What is the difference? How will this different affect the development of Chinese society in the future.</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: When we supported white paper sports on the streets of London, I was very surprised to find that there were about hundreds of hundreds of in our parade. At first glance, it was a child of the post -90s. This is a phenomenon that has almost never seen these in the middle of the fight with the CCP. I guess one of the reasons, because the families of these children can go to school (overseas) in Berlin, etc. Maybe their families are not very poor families in China, but Xi Jinping's inverse is exactly for these compared middle -class, there are certain some in the middle class, there are certain some in the middle class, there are certain some in the middle class. This income, but in order to accept good education for children, they can fight again, and then they can send them out of such a family that they can send out to school. I felt such a pressure, so I stood for the first time in our ranks. I think that these young people now, although they are not as good as we have come from the Cultural Revolution, there is such a mature consciousness, but their consciousness has begun. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: You should have written a poem in Hangzhou called "Gongye Bridge One Night" eight years ago. You wrote: How beautiful the West Lake is, how black the canal overflows. I saw that Hangzhou netizens were very unconvinced and said that in the past two years, the canal have become cleaner and cleaner. The small bridge flowing water people have the style of Jiangnan water village. Actually why I want to ask you such a question, because you just said that many Chinese people's struggles were one before, and your understanding is a kind of Tiananmen gate that is not on the street, but we must see that there is a phenomenon, that is, on the one hand The mainland people in China are the iron chain girl, as well as the indignation of the coercive clearance campaign and even protesting on the street, but on the one hand, it may be the same group of people. They also sincerely feel that China is getting better and better. The conditions are getting better and better. What is your observation?Reporter: I think you are very fiercely criticized for some of your young fellows when you were young. Today, they and this ideal ambition of that year run counter to the back. You say that the land is covered with "Junjie" who knows current affairs, and this Junjie is a quotation. At that time, the poet Kita Island, who was like you, once said that the huge China could not tolerate the desk. How will you evaluate the return of North Island? (In your opinion) Is he also the "handsome" of current affairs?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: </strong> <strong>, since you all said, this huge territory can't set the desk, then you have to find this place where there is no desk, so what do you find? What is definitely looking for things outside the desk, right? So for me, like North Island, including some people like North Island, they can't avoid this kind of conflict. I can't stand the sense of loneliness of overseas, or the coldness of life as an exile, and go back to find a kind of warm Can't find what can be written on the desk. So what makes me regrets is that almost all these dilemmas that later have the contradictions, and still go back to curl up in a certain mouse cave, and sometimes some people who decorate some scenes on some scenes. Any decent work can also be produced, which is also a fate that cannot be avoided. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I know you have won numerous awards in the international poetry world. How did you maintain this creative passion for so many years? Are you more written in Chinese or in English?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: Poetry I will always write in Chinese, because poetry is like your blood, and you can't change such deep things like your blood. As for how to maintain such a creative energy, I think the most important thing is to maintain the energy of such a kind of thought, and the energy of this idea comes from a word: question, and this question must be implemented to self -question questions Essence So I have a saying, not saying "I think I am", what is it? I said "I ask me, I am here." I also have a word called nightmare inspiration. Maybe we should admit that we really do n’t lack the inspiration of this nightmare, but because of this, its inspiration and energy have never been broken, so I think we still have a long way to go. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: I saw a conversation with you and writer Yan Geling (at the University of Frankfurt) last year. Geling said that she did not believe that China would have been like this. What about your observation? Do you have her optimism like her?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: I should also say that I still agree with such a statement, although I will feel that the process will not be so simple. As a historical evolution process, as a cultural transformation process, such a short historical retrogression is actually not surprising. Because of such a process that does not flow, history can step by step, accumulating valuable thoughts or valuable culture. So in this sense I think in a broad sense. If we have opened the one hundred and two hundred years, it is true that this small part of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping’s younger section is actually nothing, but it is in it in Nowadays, they are still very cruelly persecuted, especially everyone who is living now and every young man who is living now. In this sense, each individual is the universe and it is the world. So we have to say that our broad optimism must not replace this very clear and harsh struggle now. Especially when Xi Jinping is more dangerous than Putin, he wants not only against the West. He actually wants to buy the West to differentiate the West and reduce the basic civilization of the entire human. He is actually a more dangerous enemy. </strong></p>
<p>Reporter: We all said that before the age of eighteen, everyone was a poet, but poetry seemed to be far away for most people's daily life. What do you think of the biggest significance of poetry today?</p>
<p><strong> Yang Lian: I think poetry is the only thing that cannot be politically or overwhelmed by business. Throughout the ages, poetry has existed in the freedom of thought and expression of freedom. There is no poetry without the freedom of thought and freedom. This is the first. Do not need poetry, and poetry does not need business. Excluding the threats of these two aspects, poetry has become the most pure and last base of human spirit. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Moderator: At the end of the show, Yang Lian wanted to read a poem that he wrote to his younger brother who wrote to the dying brother in Beijing at the end of last year: "Anti -An Soul Song". I am Tang Qiwei, thank you for watching it, you will go again!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Section 4: </strong></p>
<p><strong> Seal the empty street full of the city </strong> **</p>
<p>** A drop of blood on the way out of the way out.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-07-12T09-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />The European Parliament is approved by 587 votes and 10 votes against the EU Chipsact. The goal is to increase the production of chip production by 4 times by 2030, allowing EU chips to reach 20%globally.</p>
<p>In the past few decades, the rise of globalization and Asian manufacturing industry has led to a decrease in European activities in the chip industry.</p>
<p>The chip market is mainly dominated by Taiwan and South Korea. Nine most advanced chips in the world are produced in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The new crown epidemic in 2020 led to paralysis in the Asian supply chain, and the European automobile industry was particularly facing a serious shortage of chips.</p>
<p>Semiconductors are also very important for many other daily necessities such as smart phones and household appliances; green technology that is fully expanded and reducing carbon emissions also requires semiconductors.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the magnificent goal of chip production, the European Union must invest more than 43 billion euros (NT $ 1,480 billion) in public and private investment.</p>
<p>The EU chip bill also requires the EU to invest 3.3 billion euros in the research and development field.</p>

At the same time, a U.S. submarine, which can launch nuclear ballistic missiles, plans to visit South Korea for the first time in 40 years.</p>
<p>North Korea is often angry with the US military reconnaissance activities around the Korean Peninsula. But since Monday, it has continuously issued three statements, threatening to retaliate against the so -called "provocative air spy activity" of US reconnaissance aircraft and drones.</p>
<p>On Monday, the North Korean Ministry of Defense accused a US strategic reconnaissance aircraft illegally invading the "invasion of leading" near its east coast this month.</p>
<p>According to the Chaozhong News Agency, "It is not guaranteed that it will not happen that a shocking accident like the US Air Force strategic reconnaissance aircraft is shot down."</p>
<p>In the two separate statements released on Tuesday and earlier on Tuesday, the sister and spokesman of North Korean leader Kim Jong -un, Kim Jong -un, also said that the US reconnaissance aircraft flew over the country's exclusive economic zone and "seriously infringed North Korea's sovereignty "And security". She warned that if this illegal invasion continues, "shocking" or "serious" incidents will occur. In 1969, North Korea shot down a US reconnaissance aircraft, causing all 31 people to be killed on the plane.</p>
<p>Both the Pentagon and the South Korean military have denied that North Korea's statement is not currently accusing. However, officials and analysts in the region are worried that North Korea's continuously upgraded remarks may lead to various military provocations.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said, "We have always carried out actions and safely in accordance with international law responsibility and safely." US State Council spokesman Matthew Miller urged North Korea to "do not upgrade its actions."</p>
<p>South Korea also countered North Korea's response. A South Korean military spokesman said on Tuesday: "North Korea puts forward these claims for domestic purposes, perhaps to make an excuse for launching a provocation." He pointed out that the exclusive economic zone guarantees the freedom of navigation and flight of foreign ships and aircraft.</p>
<p>According to the International Public Law, a country can advocate the right to develop its exclusive economic zone marine resources. This economic waters start from the width base line volume of the 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles. sovereignty.</p>
<p>North Korea usually upgrades anti -American remarks before the end of the anniversary of the Korean War on July 27 to strengthen the legitimacy of its nuclear weapon plan. In a statement, the North Korean Ministry of Defense severely criticized the Pentagon's decision to send a nuclear submarine to visit the South Korean port to visit the South Korean port. When President Biden met with South Korean President Yin Xiyue in April, the two sides agreed to strengthen the joint military exercises between the two countries.</p>
<p>On the occasion of North Korea, South Korean President Yin Xiyue was participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in Lithuania. It is expected that he will condemn North Korea's nuclear weapon development with the world leaders at the meeting. Before such international gatherings, North Korea usually becomes more provocative.</p>

<p>Since the Doron Islands have broken diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2019, China has paid great attention to Solomon, promised to provide a lot of support and provide gold aid for a series of key infrastructure plans.</p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said yesterday that the outside world is worried that the police cooperation agreement between the Solomon Islands and the China may "cause more regional competition."</p>
<p>Huang Yingxian's spokesman said in a statement: "The Solomon Islands and China should immediately announce the agreement and disclose their intentions to Australia and the region, so that the Pacific family can think of this agreement on our common safety."</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand also expressed uneasy about the matter.</p>
<p>A spokesman said today: "We hope the content of the agreement is public to understand the security impact on the Pacific."</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands are one of the poorest countries in the Pacific. As China, Australia, and the United States compete for regional influence, the Solomon Islands are in the center of continuously upgraded tug -of -war.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to the Czech Public Television report on Wednesday (July 12), the famous writer Milan Kundra died at the age of 94. According to AFP, a spokesman for Milan Kundera Hometown Library also said on the same day, "Unfortunately, I can confirm that Mr. Milan Kundera died of illness yesterday (July 11)."</p>
<p>Kundela's work describes people, their thoughts, feelings, and desires. He is best at interpersonal novels. The most famous of which is "Unbearable Light in Life", which describes a triangle love story in the background of the spring background of Prague. In 1984, this novel came out, making Kundela quickly enjoy the world.</p>
<p>For decades, Kundela lived in France. At the end of the 1970s, the Czechoslovak government canceled his nationality and made the country's famous writer an exile. Kundela later joined French nationality. However, at the end of 2019, Kunderla, who once said that "no dream of returning to his hometown," was re -regained in the Czech nationality. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/米兰昆德拉流亡半生-重获捷克国籍/a-51528855)</p>
<h3>Socialist brand</h3>
<p>Milan Kundera was not only influenced by the Czech culture, but also the experience of being a writer in a socialist country also made him deeply imprinted him. In 1948, in the last year of high school, he joined the Communist Party passionately, and two years later, he was expelled from the party for "hostile thoughts and individualism". The consequence of this incident was that Kundela had to interrupt the university course he had just started-he originally learned music and literature, and later moved to the film school to study director and screenwriter.</p>
<p>In 1953, Kundera published his debut "People: A Vast Garden". In this episode, he thought about communist ideology and social realism. Later, he re -joined the Communist Party and was fired again, so repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's accusation of its "individualist tendency" has become the focus at the latest in the 1960s. He created some ironic short stories, and in the 1970s, he became a short story collection "Funny Love". Most of the tragedy stories are intertwined in the unique style of love and politics, seriousness and humor, and relaxing.</p>

<h3>Fleeing party membership, exile France</h3>
<p>After the "Prague Spring" in 1968 was brutally suppressed, Kunderla became an unpopular figure. As the supporter of the reform of the Communistism, Kundera was fired in 1969 and was expelled in the party in 1970. His faculty at the Film Academy was also deprived, the drama he created was canceled, his works were removed and prohibited from publishing.</p>
<p>But Kundela was not afraid of review and continued to write. In "Living elsewhere" (1973) and "Farewell to the Yuan Dance" (1976), he liquidated his experience repeatedly joining the Communist Party. He knew that he could not publish his works in Czechoslovakia. Both books are published in France. In 1975, he got a teaching position in Renne, France, and then found a shelter in Paris.</p>
<p>During the exile, Kundela continued to create literary creation and continued to take Czechoslovak as the background. Since he was deported, after publishing "Laughing and Forgetting", Czechoslovakia's leadership could only deprive him of his nationality in 1978. In 1984, Kundela's "Unbearable Light in Life" was published, and it was sold well worldwide, and Kundera was famous for this. The book was later adapted into a movie and succeeded. The starring actor was Juliettebinoche)And Daniel Day-Lewis.</p>

<h3>Literary thinking in the context of philosophical context</h3>
<p>Although Kundela's works "Immortal", "Slow", "identity" and "ignorance" were also valued, they were not as successful as early works. "Slow" and other works are written in French. Some literary critics believe that these novels are philosophical and scattered culture, and others believe that Kundela is a pioneering moral model, a critical criteria for Western European civilization, and postmodernist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/捷克著名作家竟是告密者险陷同学于死亡/a-3707826">In 2008, Kundera was accused of selling an opposition in the 1950s,</a>He has been locked in a labor camp for many years. It is said that the Czech Secret Police records have related confession. But is the confession really from Kundela? Or is anyone posing as Kundela? Kundera said nothing at the time, and there was no signature on the document.</p>
<p>In 2014, after 10 years of silence, Kundera's novel "Celebrations meaningless" was published. The book describes 4 men's roaming Paris with a humorous and sad Kundela's pen and tell his personal bumps. This long -awaited novel is very popular in Europe, but critics have mixed praise. Some people think that this is a masterpiece, but others think it is aged. This is his last work.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) The Chinese strategy of the German government is desperate. <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/bundesregierung-china-strategie-kurz-vor-verabschiedung/29251514.html">According to the "Business Daily" report on Wednesday (July 12)</a>The document that should have been finalized at the cabinet meeting that day was postponed to Thursday due to the NATO summit.</p>
<p>The Business Daily stated that related negotiations and discussions were still conducted on Tuesday. According to people knowing the matter, the parties have reached a compromise on the focus of the dispute. These disputes include: how to formulate extensive transparent rules and how to perform pressure tests for German companies with large -scale Chinese business.</p>
<p>Insiders from the German federal government informed that the document has reached a consensus on the final details, but the German Foreign Ministry of Foreign Foreign Affairs that dominated the document did not respond to the media's inquiry.</p>
<p>If the discussion of the discussion for a long time has been discussed and officially announced on Thursday, it will be the first Chinese strategy in Federal German history as a document. The purpose of the strategy is that in the context of strengthening oppression and increasingly aggressiveness to China, Germany must integrate policies for China so as to be consistent in pace.</p>
<p>The "Commercial Daily" wrote that the problem so far is that the ministries and even some bureau units have maintained some relationship with Beijing, and the practices of federal states, cities and counties here are not the same. The consequences of this phenomenon are: in various fields and different levels, they are inconsistent when dealing with China. Due to its authoritarian rule, China shows a more unified action to the outside world.</p>
<p>At present, the outside world knows very little about this repeated Chinese strategy. After the first strategic draft was leaked to the media last year, the Berlin government improved alert and kept high -level confidentiality on later discussions and negotiations to prevent leakage in content.</p>
<h3>is how to re -position relations with China</h3>
<h3><strong> What are the first drafts of the draft? </strong></h3>
<p>In November 2022, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/机密文件曝光揭示德国未来对华战略/a-63784934">Ming Mirror Weekly "said the draft China strategic draft drafted by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs,</a>It has been forwarded to multiple departments related to diplomatic and security policies. At that time, the draft included 59 pages, which covered the attention of human rights issues and sanctions. Military -civilian dual -use products exported to Germany could not be used to infringe human rights and internal suppression. skill improved".</p>
<p>The draft strictly accused Sino -Russian relations, thinking that China did not trust the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, "we observed that China supports Russia's remarks that support anti -Western countries." In the war against Ukraine "Russia".</p>
<p>When it comes to Taiwan, a draft strategy wrote that if Taiwan participated in international organizations, it would not violate the "China" policy. In addition, Germany's requirements for the European Parliament quickly began to assess bilateral investment agreements with Taiwan. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that "such an agreement is consistent with the EU's 'Chinese' policy."</p>
<p>The first draft of China Strategy, which is passed on to the media, also suggested that in the future, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be synchronized with the European Union to define China as partners, competitors and institutional rivals, and "the weight in the latter two aspects will become heavier." At that time, the draft was reposted in the media and some related institutions before the Prime Minister's Palace was recognized.(Comprehensive report)</p>

On the evening of the 11th local time, NATO released the communiqué of the summit.</p>
<p>The communiqué focuses on China's extensive political, economic and military tools to increase its global influence and projection power, while maintaining its strategy, intention and military assembly to be opaque. Bulletin criticism has damaged the security of NATO by using malicious hybrid operations and network actions and confrontation speech and false information.</p>
<p>The communiqué states that China tries to control key technology and industries, key infrastructure, strategic materials and supply chains, use its economic leverage to establish a strategic dependence relationship and enhance its influence. China also tries to subvert the rules -based international order in space, network and marine.</p>
<p><strong> NATO Follows Sino -Russian strategic partnership and nuclear strike capability </strong></p>
<p>NATO also also called on China and Russia to continue to deepen strategic partnerships, calling on China to play the role of the UN Security Council's permanent member of the State, "condemning Russia's war against Ukraine and not providing any fatal aid to Russia."</p>
<p>The bulletin also said, "China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and diversified it, increasing the number of warheads and cutting -edge carrier systems, to establish a trinity of all -in -one nuclear strike capabilities." NATO said The project's attempt to support the production is the goal of "the Treaty of the Non -diffused Nuclear Weapons". NATO has also urged China to participate in the discussion of strategic risks and improve the transparency of its nuclear weapons policies, plans and capabilities.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador responded to NATO's bulletin by question and answer that NATO repeatedly declared that it was a "nuclear alliance" in the bulletin, which would only further exacerbate regional tensions, and the Chinese side focused on this.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg(Jensstoltenberg)To reporters at the summit, "Although China is not the" opponent "of NATO(adversary), But China is challenging the rules -based international order through its 'coercion'. "He also said:" China refuses to condemn Russia's war on Ukraine, threatens Taiwan, and conduct large -scale military construction. "</p>

Among them, the China Nuclear is not transparent, because China has not participated in the nuclear reduction meeting for a long time, and the secret increase has increased secretly. The production of nuclear warheads obviously violates the basic spirit of nuclear tailoring treaties.</p>
<p>He believes that the communiqué reflects NATO's might have made Jedi revenge on Russia and has a deeper sense of crisis. "Since the start of the Russian and Ukraine War, Putin has been doing 'nuclear blackmail", and now it may still perform' nuclear destruction '. If the nuclear country's devastating weapon is added, NATO will bear great pressure.</p>
<p><strong> The United States strengthens the allies partnership to resist China differentiation </strong></p>
<p>"NATO is a significant extent to continue the United States's" National Defense Strategy Report "last year, which pays attention to China's nuclear weapons (expression). In addition, it is also showed that in the process of competition in the United States, the United States avoids the so -called one -on -one pair with China." Taiwan's national defense security research research Zhong Zhidong, assistant researcher at the Institute of National Security Research Institute of the Academy, made the above.</p>
<p>Zhong Zhidong further analyzed that China's pressure will increase. In the past, as long as China faced the United States alone, it could differentiate European Germany, France and other countries, and even extended to Japan and South Korea through the incentives of the economic market, and even extended to Japan and South Korea to break the impression of creating a single hegemony in the United States. But now the United States Biden government competes with China through allies, instead of fighting alone in the United States. Nuclear threats are no longer concerned about the United States, and now it has also become the attention of the entire NATO.</p>
<p><strong> China opposes NATO East Asia Pacific </strong></p>
<p>Reuters reported that the capital of Japan and South Korea attended the NATO Summit. This is the second time the Japanese Prime Minister Kishita Kishita participated in the summit to remind the military alliance to pay attention to East Asia's risks. Strengthen international security cooperation."Resolutely oppose NATO 'East Asia -Pacific'!" The Chinese in the European Union stated toughly that any behavior that harmed the legitimate rights and interests of China would be resolutely fighting back.</p>
<p>Song Guocheng pointed out that NATO's obvious qualitative changes and transformations this year not only recognize the threat of the Russian and Ukraine War and China, but also make predictions and preventive measures, propose the strongest warning, but also prepare for the corresponding policies of the future crisis. NATO regains and stronger.</p>
<p>Song Guocheng: "It is no longer limited to the so -called NATO national borders. It also believes that it should be involved in the Asia -Pacific defense, which means that NATO has already crossed the border and participated in other regional security issues. Effect, NATO itself is no longer limited to European defense work. "</p>
<p>However, NATO still expresses constructive contact with China to safeguard NATO's security benefits. However, NATO emphasized that it is responsible for the "systemic challenges" of China's "systemic challenges" composed of Europe-Atlantic security in a responsible way.</p>

<p>The largest war in Europe has re -activated the organization since its establishment 74 years ago, which has brought it back to the role of the Cold War period during the combat alliance. The Russian and Ukraine War also triggered turtle issues such as providing military assistance to the Ukraine government and applying for joining NATO in Sweden and Ukraine.</p>
<p>One problem has been resolved on Monday night. NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said that Turkey, which has not agreed to join NATO, will no longer stop Sweden from entering the Alliance.</p>
<p>"This is beneficial to all our member states," Stoltenberg said. "This is beneficial to Sweden because Sweden will become a formal member state; this is beneficial to Turkey because Turkey is the NATO allies and will benefit from a stronger NATO."</p>
<p>However, it is expected that other problems will become the highlight of the two -day summit. US President Biden and leaders of other countries will attend the summit. This will be the first time in Finland. It has given up the [neutral policy] that Russia has pursued for a long time(https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-finlandization.html), Joined NATO this year, becoming the organization's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/world/europe/finland-nato-russia-ukraine.html">31st member states</a>Essence The addition of Finland is a striking sign, indicating how to stimulate the Russian and Ukraine War to NATO, which is a bad factor for Russian President Putin. He once regarded NATO East Expansion as one of the reasons to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Let's briefly introduce the alliance, and what changes have happened after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia:</p>
<p><strong> What organization is NATO? </strong></p>
<p>NATO was a collective defense alliance established by the United States, Canada and ten European countries in 1949 after World War II.</p>
<p>The Alliance is based on the <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm">14 Convention</a>Named that all NATO member states must abide by the convention. Among them, <a href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/HM949SG80537AG3Q.html">the most famous is the fifth one</a>It announced that the attack on a member country was an attack on all member states.</p>
<p>When NATO was established, the Soviet Union was consolidating its dominant position in Central Europe and Eastern Europe, and its strength and ambitions seemed to only show an increase. In the face of this situation, the fifth Convention put Western Europe under the protection of the United States.</p>

<p>After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, NATO began to have a broader role. NATO troops are composed of voluntarily sent troops from member states, and in the 1990s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/world/a-longer-nato-stay-in-bosnia-uncertain.html">perform peacekeeping mission in Persia</a>In 1999, to protect Kosovo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/25/world/conflict-balkans-overview-nato-opens-broad-barrage-against-serbs-clinton.html">bombed Serbia</a>NATO is still in Kosovo in the troops.</p>
<p>NATO's English abbreviation is NATO, French abbreviation is OTAN.</p>
<p><strong> What member states are there in NATO? </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the United States and Canada, countries that joined NATO in 1949 include Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Portugal.</p>
<p>Later, 19 European countries joined NATO: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lativia, Heishan, North Malaysia, Turkey, Romania, Slovenia, Slovenia, and Slovenia, and Slovenia, and Slovenia, and Slovenia, Spain.</p>
<p>The addition of Finland added one of the most powerful troops in Western Europe to NATO. At the same time, NATO's commitment to collective defense has now extended to a country with a 1340 -kilometer border with Russia.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg announced the news of Sweden joining NATO in Vernis. He said that Turkish President Erdogan has revoked opposition to Sweden and will submit the Swedish application to the Turkish Congress as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong> Who is the leader of NATO? </strong></p>
<p>Stoltenberg, the former Prime Minister of Norway, has been the Secretary -General of NATO since 2014. It is expected that he will step down in September this year. But last week he announced the consent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/world/europe/nato-chief-extends-term.html">extend the term of office</a>By October 2024.</p>
<p>The extension of Stoltenberg's term of office makes this controversial problem that does not have to be discussed at the summit, and several possible candidates have appeared in the previous weeks.</p>
<p>These include Estonian Prime Minister Kaya Karas, Denmark Prime Minister Meter Frederikson, British Secretary of Defense Ben Wallace, and the Chairman of the European Commission Ulsula Von Delin.</p>
<p><strong> What changes have taken place in NATO in the Russian and Ukraine? </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>**** French President Macron said in 2019 that NATO had died in brainstick and expressed suspect that the United States had a commitment to the alliance. But since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, NATO discovered that it is meaningful.</p>
<p>Although NATO did not provide military assistance directly to Ukraine, NATO member states have provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars of equipment. From the perspective of total amount, the United States is the largest donor country. All member states in NATO each month in Ram Teta, Germany, to discuss military assistance to Ukraine. NATO also <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_192648.htm">help coordination</a>Humanitarian assistance requirements in Ukraine.The Russian and Ukraine War also gave the new core position of member states located in the eastern part of NATO, especially the Baltic countries and Poland, and the latter has gained important new influence within NATO. Poland President Angy Duda was one of the earliest foreign leaders who visited Kiev after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia, and one of the tough supporters of Ukraine. The Polish government also strongly supports Ukraine to join NATO.</p>
<p><strong> Why does Türkiye oppose Sweden to join NATO? </strong></p>
<p>Sweden broke the neutral policies pursued by Russia, and submitted an application for admission to NATO in May 2022 with Finland in May 2022. However, the president of NATO member State Turkey, Erdogan, has never agreed to let Sweden enter the Alliance, saying that the Swedish asylum and the Kurdish Workers' Party have related Kurdish exiles and refugees.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>President Biden said last week that he "anxiously looking forward to" Sweden to join NATO, although the possibility looked small at the time. Earlier on Monday, Erdogan said that the European Union should first join the European Union for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-sweden-nato.html">Turkey to join the European Union</a>Open the door, and then Turkey will agree to let Sweden join NATO.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said that as a part of Sweden joining the NATO agreement, Sweden will help restart Turkish applications to the European Union. The two countries will jointly crack down on terrorism. NATO will set up a new "anti -terrorism coordinator".</p>
<p>Except for Hungary, other member states in NATO support Sweden applications. Hungary said it was waiting for Türkiye to agree.</p>
<p><strong> What is the possibility of Ukraine to join NATO? </strong></p>
<p>Over the years, joining NATO has always been the core goal of Ukraine's foreign policy, and it is also part of Ukraine's future plan to join the EU and enter the ranks of Western countries. As early as 2008, NATO said that Ukraine would eventually become a member country. Russia's invasion has increased interest relationships, and the Ukrainian government has been in September last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/world/europe/ukraine-nato-zelensky.html">Apply to join NATO</a>Essence</p>
<p>Although Poland and other Eastern European countries are in favor of providing a route map for Ukraine, the United States, Germany and France have always blocked Ukraine to join, because they do not want to take a step in the expansion of war with Russia.</p>
<p>They said that the current primary task should be to provide military assistance to Ukraine, leaving Ukraine to join NATO's problem until it will be resolved in the future. President Biden said in an interview broadcast by CNN on Sunday that Ukraine is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/09/us/politics/biden-ukraine-nato.html">not prepared to join NATO</a>The application procedure is "too early" when the war is still ongoing.</p>
<p><strong> What about other European countries? </strong></p>
<p>European countries including Ireland and Austria have chosen not to join NATO, usually because they pursue neutral policies.</p>
<p>Another country that borders Russia is not a NATO member country. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is Putin's intimate ally. He has allowed Russia to use Belarus as a gathering place to invade Ukraine.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-12T10-30-27-00-00/000121434_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>From "inner rolls" and "internal consumption" to "lying" and "rot", to "crazy", young people who occupy the right to speak on the Internet try to put themselves in rounds of words in round. The popularity of these new words is inseparable from resonance, which also means that "this is not just a person's problem" -the almost everyone is repeatedly swaying between meaning and nothingness, function and value, ideals and reality, and "lie down flat flat "Inner roll" repeatedly jumped. Why is this? Because this is an inevitable trend after human beings entering modernity. Meng Qingyan, an associate professor of Sociology of China University of Political Science and Law, responded in the new book "Who Questions: Non -Standard Answers in Modern Society".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-12T10-30-27-00-00/000187285_piclink.jpg" />After aware of the various problems and helplessness of modern society, how can a sober modern person face a specific life? Where does the courage in the face come from? Regardless of whether it is work or during the communication, Meng Qingyan is not ready to provide a standard answer about "what to do". In his opinion, sociology is the science that overcome blind anxiety, "it is the science of the times."</p>
<p><strong> The following is the full text of an exclusive interview: </strong></p>
<p><strong> FT Chinese website: </strong> "Whose Problem" This book is born from a series of programs of Teacher Meng Qingyan in the "East Cast West Tune", "Social Pathology". The topic of each period of the podcast is closely following the concerns and anxiety of young people, and the drama they watched. What are you going to do these social phenomena analysis? Social phenomena may be an incident that only caused a brief discussion, or it may be a trend that lasted for a period of time. What standards do you choose to analyze objects?</p>
<p><strong> Meng Qingyan: </strong> There is no standard. There are two starting points.</p>
<p>I did not directly deal with real problems in my research field. Many of my studies are about the changes in modern Chinese society. Why go to record this podcast? I have been working in 2014 and have been a university teacher. It has been nearly ten years. Although people are old, they have been with young people, making me not so easy to get out of frequent young people in society. In these decade, I have also felt more and more that everyone is more powerful than before. The pressure of young people is increasing. Therefore, I want to talk about how the so -called phenomenon and problems in society come from in a relatively easy way. I am willing to share my views with everyone, even if it is not necessarily correct.</p>
<p>There is another reason. In my opinion, it is "selfish" in my opinion. In the past, traditional scholars said that learning was "learning to learn." Mr. Chen Yinque has a sentence called "Reading is not busy." There are many explanations in this sentence. For example, Mr. Chen never talked about what others said. My own understanding is: Reading is ingenious. Whether it is humanities and social sciences or natural science, learning is essentially related to your own life. From this perspective, sociology is a type of learning that is closely related to our daily life. When the theme of the sowing guest (also in the book), there is a main line: what does modern life mean for each of us? In such a modern situation, what levels and confusion will we encounter? These problems are universal and cross -age. Not only today ’s post -00s and post -90s, including the post -80s and post -80s, they will face similar problems, but the degree and expression are different. Sociology has a deep -rooted idea: that constitutes a topic of sociological research and discussions, it must not be a very personal factor. We believe that many issues are universal.</p>
<p>For example, after reading the "Summer of Little Monster" in the anime "Chinese Strange Talk". I think it describes the "self -cultivation of a supporting role", which tells the fact that modern people are unwilling to admit -each of us is a supporting role, there is no substantial difference. Modern society is a system. Everyone in this system is important but not important, this is the supporting role. Many people often see on the Internet that they will complain about their work and life "meaningless", but in fact, it is at least valuable for the operation of the social system. As soon as the Spring Festival, takeaway and courier brothers are on vacation, and the operation of the social system may slow down. The same is true of other industries. No one can. We will encounter many similar problems in our lives because we are in the same social system. From this perspective, the topic does not come from deliberate design, but my personal understanding of modern life.</p>
<p>The program "Social Pathology" does not chase hot spots. Because hot spots can never catch up. In my opinion, there are no hot spots in modern life. There is nothing new under the sun. Modern social systems are complicated, but its operating logic is constantly evolving in a fixed direction. This podcast and this book are trying to figure out this logic.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another reason to turn audio programs into books -the language logic and text logic of human beings are different. Although it is convenient to use software such as HKUST Xunfei to transform voice into text, it cannot replace the thinking link in the conversion process. I added some new thinking in the process of reorganization and arrangement of the manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition to the above problems, I think there is another important influencing factor, that is, the distance between academic and public is still a bit far away. In fact, the book talks about every theme, such as cyber violence, "workers" trapped in the system, etc., have been studied by many sociologists and economists. These majors are issued on top publications, but most ordinary people will not read these topics. So I have always emphasized that "Who's Problem" is a book of general writing. We are also preparing to record a podcast of this theme.</p>
<p><strong> FT Chinese website: </strong> Book attributed the topic as three levels -society, life, and individuals, which is completely different from most sociological entry materials. Move ... Do you have a pre -overall framework when you do these shows? Why do you adopt the structure of "society, life, and individual" to respond to the dilemma in modern society?</p>
<p><strong> Meng Qingyan: </strong> Because this is not a textbook. The textbook is written for students who studied this major, which forms a preset that is not stated -all students who have practiced sociology have no choice in the course of "Sociology Introduction/Principles". It is a compulsory course. The new problem facing the humanities and social sciences in the university is: students can not listen if they don't want to listen. Because this is not a compulsory course. So I want to find a way to "cut myself" so that everyone feels that sociology is not particularly far away from me.What is society? Back to the context of Sociology into China, the earliest translation of the word Yan Fu was Yan Fu, and Yan Fu called it "group learning", that is, the knowledge of the group. As long as there are humans, there will be groups, and the group will have a variety of organizational forms -a school, city, rural, race, nation, a language habit, a country ... humans are group -type animals, This sentence can be replaced, human beings are social animals, because humans will invented different groups. Big or small groups of different groups will produce order and generate culture, customs, ideas and systems. Competition between groups and groups will have competition, cooperation, and conflict. Sociology is to study all types of groups, how can its order possible. So I put the "society" in the book as one of the three topics.</p>
<p>Conversely, society is invisible, but it is real and will affect specific people. Since the emergence of social sciences in a broad sense, a tendency has appeared since the 19th century, that is, always hope to imitate natural science and regard phenomena in human society as natural physical phenomena. Sociology is the earliest called social physics, which regards society as an organic body. The problem is that organisms can be dissected. Social organisms can not use surgery knives toatomy, and even you can't see it and cannot be clearly described, because there are too many types of society. In any case, society or group must be composed of a individual. The system and order are realized in the communication between people and people, and in turn act on people. We must never leave the individual when we discuss society.</p>
<p>The word "life", I don't know if it is accurate. I also hope that sociology is from the situation in life rather than from the concept. In college education, concepts must be mastered by students, but if we regard sociology as a knowledge system that can be meaningful to the public, it is important to return to life itself.</p>
<p>When we discuss general issues, avoid words that ordinary people do not understand. I often say that knowledge is not power. Knowledge has nothing to do with your life and life, it is nothing. For non -social majors, the level of liberal arts is omitted, the more likely the knowledge will be related to life and become powerful things, not "useful" things.</p>
<p><strong> Sociology is the integrity of the times to deal with the great changes in the times. </strong> What is a great change in the times? Sociology was born in the 18th century. At that time, human civilization started the modernization process -steam engines were invented, industrialized, and ethnic countries appeared. The entire world began to have industrial production and capital operations as the core. This process has been extended to all aspects of human life, making people feel that their lives are different from the life of the Middle Ages, and the life of the feudal society is different. As a result, people call it "modern life." There are various problems in modern life, and people do not know how to face it, so they have sociology. The work I do is to go back to the origin of sociology -we have a huge challenge for our universal fate. <strong> Sociology is not to deal with social knowledge, but to the science of the times. </strong></p>
<p><strong> FT Chinese website: </strong> "Abstract society, suspended life, hollow individual", three adjectives sound a bit bitter and helpless. The cover also says "use social thinking to fight mental internal consumption". I think the internal consumption itself has its own value, but it is not so happy. So the root cause of modern people is the characteristics of "modern"? Will "modernity" go to a general reality of bitterness? Is "mental internal consumption" a psychological process that most modern people are at the moment, especially in today's Chinese society?</p>
<p><strong> Meng Qingyan: </strong> Yes, it is almost an inevitable process. Human beings have developed from the Middle Ages and feudal society to the present, and there are two or three most original problems.</p>
<p>Since the Renaissance to the Enlightenment and the Chinese New Culture Movement, my good friend and Mr. Li Yan, a good friend of my good friend, and the Department of Political Science at the University of Political Science and Law, said that "uppercase people" stood up and people can dominate their own destiny. Before the first element of modernity, people did not exist in the situation of "dominating self -destiny", nor did they consider who was dominating themselves? Human destiny is dominated by religion, monarch, clan and blood. For example, Aristotle said "people are animals in the city." One of the main tasks of the city -state is to cultivate the courage of people, and to cultivate the courage to sacrifice people for the city -state.</p>

The Vietnamese cultural department ordered whether the organizer was suspected of supporting the "nine sections" on the 5th. The organizer then apologized and promised to delete. Some Facebook and TIKTOK netizens launched a boycott of the concert.</p>
<p><strong> "Nine Section Line" controversy to the international entertainment industry </strong></p>
<p>The controversy of the Sino -Vietnamese nine -stage line was extended from film and pop music to the album. The Vietnamese Film Bureau announced on the 10th that the Chinese drama "Walking to the Wind" at least 9 episodes were placed in the "Nine Section Line" maps in China. Vietnam's "Film Law" stipulates that the Vietnamese government has ordered the streaming platform Netflix and Vietnam FPT Telecom to remove the platform. The Netflix subscriptions registered outside Vietnam can still be watched.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Film Bureau announced that even if the FPT has blurred the nine -segment line map screen, this TV series still has "inappropriate content" that must be removed.</p>
<p>Vietnam adopts a post -event review system on the Internet or community platforms. Vietnam Film Director Vi Kienthanh said that the Vietnamese Film Bureau set up a working group to manage the film and check the two -class inspection per day. Because the number of online films is huge, it can only be sampled and difficult to get dripping. Now establishing a reporting mechanism, inviting the whole people to be the "pension team", and the audience who discovered the problem film to help the authorities help the authorities find out the "wrong illegal" films on the Internet.</p>
<p>Huang Zongding, an expert in the South China Sea issue and an associate researcher at the Taiwan Institute of National Defense and Safety, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia that Beijing's announcement of the Nine Section Line has impacted the interests, free navigation rights, and fishery rights of the nine sections.</p>
<p>Huang Zongding for example: "Some Chinese people went to Vietnam. When customs clearance, the passport involved a page of pressing pages of the nine sections of the South China Sea, which was written by Vietnamese officials. In addition, Chinese passengers traveling to Vietnam, wearing T, printed on the nine section of the South China Sea The shirt was stopped by the Vietnamese police at the airport and was asked to replace and confiscate the T -shirt. "</p>
<p><strong> Vietnam Anti -China Qi Qi </strong></p>
<p>Huang Zongding pointed out that the ruling of the regular arbitral tribunal in Hague in 2016 clearly revealed that Beijing's claiming the nine section of the South China Sea's sovereignty was not a legal basis.</p>
<p>Huang Zongding said: "Beijing uses the so -called 'historical rights' in the South China Sea, including the demands of biological and non -biological resources, which is actually incompatible with the United Nations Convention in the Marine Law in 1982. There is an endorsement of this arbitral tribunal, which is where Vietnam has a legal position and a confidence. "Huang Zongding said that only China has advocated the so -called "nine -segment line" territorial sovereignty. Direct interest -related countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Taiwan, etc. in the South China Sea, do not recognize the claims of the so -called nine -segment line in China. Most European and American countries are also standing in the position of supporting the South China Sea arbitration.</p>
<p>Huang Zongding pointed out that the Vietnamese government has banned the nine -segment line of China in the film, which is not the first time. "Vietnam's sovereignty in the South China Sea is indeed limited that the weapons that can fight against China are indeed limited. In practice, confrontation with China is usually in Vietnam. , Often Vietnam falls into the wind. Vietnam can play in the South China Sea through legal warfare and public opinion war. "</p>
<p>** Beijing has declared "the South China Sea is China" and "Taiwan is China" through film and television culture.</p>
<p>Taiwanese film scholar Qi Longren accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and said: "Just like the Hollywood film" Defending Soldier "protagonist Tom Cruise's jacket appeared" the Qing Tian Bai Sun Banner of the Republic of China "was banned in mainland China. Islamic music videos were detained by the police while entering the Kuala Lumpur Airport. "</p>
<p>Qi Longren said that this kind of sensitive issues such as sovereignty, nationalism and other sensitive issues, ideological movies, drama, and popular music to touch sovereignty, nationalism, etc. are directly ordered to ban broadcasting. It is more common in centralized countries. Quarrel. For example, many European and American films involved in Tibet and Hong Kong are not allowed to be released in China, and some are required to cut off the pictures that do not match the ideology of the authorities to re -examine.</p>
<p>Qi Longren analyzed that Vietnam's similar way of replenishing the dead sheep highlights that it is not strict at the source, and the check is not strict. The ideological examination is not so strict. Only after the online circulation is needed to launch a national report. The Chinese government adopts an advance review and quota system. Through the censorship, it must meet the official "main theme".</p>

<p>Beijing, which has a deep relationship with Taiwan, has also increased its efforts. Will it be possible to break AIA before the Taiwan election in the next six months? Ding Shufan analyzed: "It is possible. Xi Jinping has been like this in the past. Before the digging, a bunch of short checks had been issued. After digging over, how the actual situation was another matter."</p>
<p>Ding Shufan mentioned that Duterte, the former President of the Philippines of Chinese Friendship, ate a lot. After taking office, he visited China. Xi Jinping had issued a large check and later did not fulfill it.</p>

The other party said that China had a bunch of short checks that did not fulfill it, and Duterte was difficult to explain. Macos last year. In the selection, this year, when I went to China this year, China issued another $ 200 billion investment commitment. In fact, many of them were those things that repeated during the Duterte period. At first glance, the Philippines knew that Beijing was holding a short check again. "</p>
<p>Ding Shufan said that in March this year, Honduras, who had broken diplomatic relations with Taiwan this year, asked Beijing to help him build a railway from the east bank to the west coast. It is said that it cost more than $ 200 billion. Honduras's GDP a year is only more than 20 billion US dollars. Chinese people are worried that can Hong Guo get debt? China is now very cautious after all. However, China is a big country in the United Nations and has its advantages. The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs still must strictly prevent it and be dug away.</p>
<p>Ding Shufan analyzed that China ’s own economic situation is very bad, and the opening check is not surprising, but should those countries go to him? Besides, China may not be needed by China, and such cases occur in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>

Xu Zhifeng, who is also on the wanted list, criticized the Hong Kong police and emphasized that threats will not be effective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st-07112023035120.html"><strong> Hong Kong National Security Law issued a wanted order after the Hong Kong Guoan Police took away Luo Guancong's question in Hong Kong </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/jw-07032023095306.html">The third anniversary of the National Security Law is wanted eight people in the name of "endangering national security"</a></strong></p>
<p>The Hong Kong Guoan Police had another action. On Tuesday (July 11), in the residence of Tung Chung, he took away the investigation of 2 men and 1 woman in suspicion of assisting those who fled and continued to engage in national security behavior. The police did not disclose the identity of the person who was taken away, but many Hong Kong media quoted the news, saying that the Guoan police went to Luo Guancong's old residence and his father's residence in the early morning to take his parents and brother.</p>
<p>Before the National Security Police took less than 3 hours, before the holding of Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao, the media told the media that the actions of overseas Hong Kong people have made new progress. Police have received some information to expand intelligence collection and cracking down on the network.</p>
<p>Li Jiachao: "The investigation will only increase. Everyone should be a mouse crossing the street. It is good to avoid it. If there is information, it must be provided to the police. At present, the police have received some information. "</p>
<p>Luo Guancong, who was overseas, responded to the recent actions of the Hong Kong police through Facebook, saying that he had no money with relevant persons. His work overseas had nothing to do with relevant persons. Criticizing the so -called assistance of the Hong Kong police was nonsense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hong Kong Guoan Police searched for exile people on Tuesday <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E7%BD%97%E5%86%A0%E8%81%AA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> #Luo Guancong&gt;</a>&gt; The residence and took away their parents and brothers for a long time interrogation, and then released. &gt; This is the first time the Hong Kong police officer the relatives of the activist after the arrest warrant. <a href="https://t.co/ASVFCyFvSd">pic.twitter.com/asvfcyfvsd&gt;</a>&gt;&gt; - Liberty Asia Radio(@RFA_Chinese)<a href="https://twitter.com/RFA_Chinese/status/1678882323146870785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> July 11, 2023&gt; </a>The family of Rong Haien, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, is also a wanted Yuan Gongyi. Rong Haien told the media that he had been separated from the relationship between Yuan Gongyi, and did not receive a notice from the National Security Department to ask for investigation. His husband and Yuan Gongyi's son Yuan Yichang did not receive relevant requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Xu Zhifeng approved the National Security Police in accordance with the political stance, as in order to apply for a certain person in accordance with Beijing instructions </strong></p>
<p>Xu Zhifeng, a former member of the democratic faction, who was wanted with Luo Guancong, criticized that the National Security Police took action against Luo Guancong's family in accordance with the political position.</p>
<p>Xu Zhifeng: "It is extremely unfair. Rong Haien has admitted that her husband had been connected with Yuan Gongyi. The police had enough evidence to ask Yuan Michang to help the investigation, but the Guoan police did not do this. On the contrary, Luo Guancong said that he had said with his family several years ago. Disiting the relationship, his family was taken away by the police in the early morning. The purpose of obvious action was to harass Luo Guancong's family, or even approved intimidation. "</p>
<p>Xu Zhifeng estimates that the Hong Kong Government's actions have Beijing instructions. It also said that pressure on relatives of the disgraceful is the usual method of maintaining stability in China. The purpose is to keep them silent.</p>

This is an obvious example of Hong Kong's rituals. Someone is worried, but our will is still firm. "</p>
<p><strong> Comment: Recently, the actions of overseas strangers are related to the establishment of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China </strong></p>
<p>Current affairs commentator Sanpu said that in the past week, from the China Union and the senior management of the Hong Kong Government to the National Security Police, they all actively actively stated their opinions and suppressed those who were unusual. They believed that they were established with the Central Hong Kong and Macao Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and each person was anxious to express loyalty.</p>
<p>Sanpu: "The Hong Kong and Macau Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is not the other signboard, but a trend of implementing institutional reform. It is a rectification of personnel replacement. Each of the Hong Kong government is not voice. Well, it shows the spirit of daring to fight, so a series of general guidelines are basically to express their loyalty to express their loyalty, and the spirit of the Cultural Revolution is so -called. "</p>
<p>Sanpu believes that the Hong Kong Government shall be punished in a row, and at the same time, the relatives and friends of the disgusting people are encouraged to report it.</p>

However, until the project was completed on May 5, the salary was still not settled, and it was still owed to more than 300,000 yuan.</p>

" I called Zhang Rui, the person in charge of the project department left by the worker's salary post to express the attention of the media, and said with a sneer and said: Ha, then you pay attention!</p>

" The Federation of Trade Unions specially hired a professional law firm. In 2022, 101 legal aid cases were accepted by the union, 100 lectures on law publicity lectures were carried out, and 25 enterprises also carried out free medical examination services for the rule of law to effectively safeguard employees' rights and interests.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Qianlong.com, in order to achieve "where the migrant workers are friends, where they have their warm home", Fengtai District has established 7 "[Home of Migrant Workers] who moved with the construction site of the construction site.(http://society.yunnan.cn/system/2022/08/26/032249445.shtml)"There are 173 such homes in Beijing.</p>
<p>Wang Zhenhua, chairman of the Fengtai District Federation of Trade Unions, said that "Beijing Fengtai Trade Union is fully improved to improve the sense of happiness in industrial workers." There are their warm home ", and the money of taxpayers has established so many homes." So, the union claims that these work and achievements they have done have nothing to do with industrial workers who have owed wages in the construction site of Fengtai District? In other words, these are the slogans that must be shouted, and have nothing to do with the rights and interests of the construction industry workers?</p>
<p>Please listen to the workers' salary representative Ye Xiangming's conversation with me.</p>
<p>Does the union go to the union to know this?</p>

Or cancel special treatment for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Biden criticized that the Chinese government took measures to destroy Hong Kong's autonomy, and then threatened great and unusual threats to the national security, diplomacy, and economy, so it was necessary to maintain relevant measures.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong has expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to Biden's decision, arguing that the United States' practices are unreasonable and interfered with China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs.</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua, former assistant professor of the Department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Institute of Technology, said that after the implementation of the "Hong Kong Edition National Security Law", the Hong Kong government lacked accountability, the parliament lacked checks and balances of public opinion, and the legal system and civic society were damaged. He took a yacht owned by the Russian rich man Mordasov, which was sanctioned by Europe and the United States in October last year as an example. At that time, some media quoted US State Council officials to warn Hong Kong that they should not be used as a shelter that evades sanctions. If they do not take action on yachts, they doubt the transparency of Hong Kong's business environment.</p>

If Hong Kong still has a more effective Legislative Council, at least Russian rich yachts will stop in Hong Kong. Hong Kong becomes active. With the launch of effective parliamentary, civic society, and media, there will naturally be members of the lawmakers asking the government to submit relevant data, and the media will also conduct tracking and investigation. Lack of these, the Hong Kong government can cover the sky alone. Hand covering the sky is actually equal to the CCP's hands to cover the sky. "</p>
<p><strong> Li Jiachao: If the nuclear wastewater discharge sea, it will expand the restrictions on imported food in Japan </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the United States, the Japanese government also feels the impact of the Hong Kong Edition National Security Law on Hong Kong. The first month of the Fukushima first nuclear power plant in Japan will discharge nuclear sewage through the underwater pipeline. The Hong Kong government's response is normal. The Chief Executive Li Jiachao said on July 11 that if the Japanese government launched a plan, the SAR Government will take action to expand the control of imported food in Japan and prohibit the import of seafood from multiple counties. The environment and ecological director Xie Zhanhuan threatened to prohibit the import of aquatic products in 10 capitals including Fukushima, Tokyo and Chiba. "Nikkei News" quoted the Japanese Plains Naoki of the Japanese Consulate General in Hong Kong that the SAR Government performed tough and only to win Beijing's impression.</p>
<p>Ye Jinlong, a former member of Hong Kong, who is studying for a master's degree in the University of Tokyo, said that in the past, under the "one country, two systems", Hong Kong has taken priority considerations by economic and trade, which is very different from mainland China. Actively publish the "Chinese War Wolf -style" remarks, standing on the same front as mainland China.</p>

According to Analysis Company Similarweb, it is the first application to do this during this time period, surpassing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html">Chat Robot ChatGPT</a>The latter obtained 100 million users within two months after the release.</p>
<p>Mobile analyst Soyter said that the number of users obtained by Threads is "objectively impressive and unprecedented."</p>

<p>The owner of Twitter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/technology/elon-musk-twitter-plan.html">Musk</a>Seems to be uneasy about Threads's momentum. Threads has 100 million users and is quickly heading out to Twitter's last disclosure. In July last year, Musk acquired Twitter four months ago, the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/22/technology/twitter-earnings.html">disclosed</a>The number of users daily is 237.8 million.</p>
<p>Musk has taken action. On the same day of THREADS last week, Twitter threatened Meta to sue this new application. On Sunday, Musk called Zuckerberg on Twitter as "soft eggs". Then, he asked Zuckerberg to measure a certain body part of a certain body, which was larger than anyone else, and also sent a ruler's emoji. Zuckerberg has not responded.</p>
<p>(Prior to the release of Threads, Musk provoked Zacberg alone and asked him to have a "<a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230703/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-cage-match/">fight in the cage</a>")</p>
<p>Musk's lack of things -a huge audience, Zuckerberg has a lot in Meta. More than 3 billion users visit a series of applications of Zuckerberg, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.Threads is now closely connected to Instagram. Users must have an Instagram account to register. If users need to touch the screen, they can import the entire focus list from Instagram to Threads, eliminating the trouble of finding new followers in the service.</p>

<p>On Monday, Zuckerberg said he could do more things to promote Threads growth. He wrote in a post in Threads that he has not "opened a lot of promotional activities" for this application.</p>
<p>Some users want to know why THREADS seems to have less basic functions in Instagram's programs when they first debuted, such as allowing people to browse the search function of hot topic labels.</p>
<p>Annier Dash, a senior person and writer of the technology industry, said, "Threads has not launched many functions, maybe to ensure brand security." From the beginning, minimizing controversy. "What impact will this have a long -term interesting network?"</p>
<p>Instagram, the person in charge of Instagram, Adam Mersery said in a post published by Threads on Monday that people demand to add a series of new features to this new application. He wrote, "They said,‘ let it succeed, make it wonderful, and let it grow. ”He also said,“ I promise that we will make it great. ”</p>
<p>However, bundling a new application with the company's existing products may eventually lead to the result of the tiger head snake tail.</p>
<p>In 2011, after Google co -founder and then CEO Larry Page withdrew from Google+ that imitated Facebook, users' freshness of this new social network quickly passed and no longer used it. Some people think that Google+ is imposed to them when visiting Gmail.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-12T11-31-19-08-00/11threads-billgates-mpfg-master1050.jpg" />Microsoft founder Bill Gates used the scale of the Windows operating system to bundle other software and overwhelm competitors. Kevin Dietsch/getty images</p>
<p>Former Google employees described this product as "<a href="https://twitter.com/morganknutson/status/1050609469523021826">based on fear</a>"The product was developed just to respond to Facebook, and it did not explicitly explain why people should use it instead of other competitive networks. A former Google employee analyzed the cause of the problem afterwards <a href="https://medium.com/chris-messina/thoughts-on-google-8883844a9ca4">write</a>Google+ is mainly defined by "what is not, that is, it is not Facebook".</p>
<p>Of course, Zuckerberg can also follow Bill Gates on Threads. Gates is one of Microsoft's founders. He used the Windows operating system to establish his own empire. This operating system promoted the development of a generation of personal computers and then successfully used this scale to crush competitors.</p>

<p>When Windows dominates the personal computer market, Gates -wide's knowing approach is to bind other products on the system for free. In 1995, he packed the Internet browser InternetExplorer into Windows, and IE soon became the default browser of tens of millions of computers. In just four years, it surpassed the dominant and dominant [NetScape].(https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/17/business/gates-pinpoints-date-of-browser-decision.html)Browser.</p>
<p>Even so, this strategy eventually caused Gates. In 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Microsoft's unfair use of Windows's market forces to kill competition. In 2000, a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/04/business/us-vs-microsoft-overview-us-judge-says-microsoft-violated-antitrust-laws-with.html">ruled that Gates' company lost the case</a>It is said that Microsoft "pressed his fingers on the balance of competitive wealth."</p>
<p>Microsoft later reached a settlement with the government and agreed to make concessions.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) North Korea launched a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on its east coast on Wednesday (July 12). Various threats including nuclear support.</p>
<p>Before the launch, North Korea issued a tough statement for many days in a row, accusing the US spy plane invading its economic zone airspace, condemning the US nuclear -powered cruise missile submarine recently visited South Korea, claiming to take countermeasures.</p>
<h3>The longest flight time in North Korean missiles</h3>
<p>Matsuna Kazaki Matsuna, the chief of the Japanese cabinet official room, said that the suspected intercontinental ballistic missile flew for 74 minutes, with a height of 6,000 kilometers and a range of 1,000 kilometers. This is the longest flight time of all missiles launched by North Korea.</p>
<p>The Japanese Coast Guard predicts that missiles will fall about 550 kilometers east of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>In April of this year, North Korea fired the first solid fuel -containment missile missile, which was one of the dozen missile tests this year.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that the flight distance of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles is enough to fight the goals of anywhere in the United States, and North Korea is likely to develop a nuclear warhead that can be installed on the rocket.</p>
<p>Kimdong-Yup, a professor at Seoul North Korea, said: "This may be the second test of the solid fuel 'Huacheng-18' intercontinental ballistic missile on the basis of the first launch results."</p>
<p>Yang Xu (transliteration), a researcher at the Institute of Policy of Yashan Policy, said that after North Korea's first launch of the spy satellite in May, the latest test may be part of North Korea's efforts to recover the face and regain initiative.</p>
<p>In addition to missile tests, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/衛星發射失敗墜海-朝鮮燃料不穩定/a-65761319">May this year, North Korea tried to launch its first spy satellite with a new carrier rocket, but ended in failure. </a>The United Nations Security Council decided to ban North Korea from using ballistic missile technology, including satellite launch. The Security Council and some countries imposed sanctions on it due to North Korea's missiles and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
<p>Yang Xu said that Pyongyang accused the United States of violating its airspace this week to find reasons for this launch, while Washington and Seoul believed that these allegations were not foundable.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T11-37-00Z/65545260_401.png" />Japanese and Korean leaders are preparing to meet during the NATO Summit to discuss various threats including North Korea's nuclear support</p>
<h3>Japan and South Korea, worry: "Can't condone these provocative behaviors"</h3>
<p>Leif-Ericeasley, a professor of international research professor of Erhua Women's University, said that North Korea is following a model that conducts weapons tests during diplomatic activities (such as the planned Korean and Japanese talks).</p>
<p>Yin Xiyue, a South Korean President, who is participating in the NATO summit in Lithuania, held an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the launch incident and vowed to use the summit to call on the international community to unite and respond to such threats together.</p>
<p>Yin Xiyue said at a meeting with Japan, Australia, and New Zealand that North Korea's launch poses a direct challenge for regional and world peace, as well as standard order -based order.</p>
<p>According to its office, Yin Xiyue said: "We cannot condon these provocative behaviors. We must respond to the reckless behavior of North Korea through a strong response and unity in the international community."</p>
<p>Matsuno Koichi Matsuna, the chief of the Japanese cabinet official house, said that the launching threat area and international peace and stability, Japan has protested by North Korea in Beijing's diplomatic channels in Beijing. Matsuno said at a press conference on Wednesday that North Korea already had the technology of hitting Japan with nuclear ballistic missiles, reiterating the statement in the white paper published by the Japanese Defense Province.</p>
<p>It is expected that Yin Xiyue will hold a separate talks with the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida in the later Wednesday to discuss the way to strengthen the method of jointing the threat of North Korea.</p>

<h3>KN-24 Type short-range ballistic missile</h3>
<p>On January 17, North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) suspected to be KN-24 from a airport in Pyongyang, the capital. According to Korean official media reports, the two missiles "accurately hit an island target on the east coast of the country." Analysts said that the last test of these missiles was in March 2020, and it seems to have entered the deployment of large -scale production and military units. The KN-24 missile is similar to the American MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and can avoid the missile defense system with a more flat ballistic flight than a traditional ballistic missile.</p>

<h3>The second time this month conducted a hypersonic missile test</h3>
<p>The Korean official media posted photos of the Chinese Society that the North Korean Institute of Defense Research conducted a new type of hypersonic missile at an unveiled place on January 11, 2022. It is rumored that North Korea's top leader Kim Jong -un also attended the test shooting. The height of the hypersonic weapon is usually lower than that of ballistic missiles. Experts said that the main features of hypersonic weapons are not speed, but their mobility, which can help them avoid the missile defense system. This is the second time North Korea tested this missile this month.</p>

The Red Guards in the picture had high school students and college students, and they waved their hair quotes. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-07122023103239.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-12T11-38-28-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Agence France-Presse information picture [Audio-LLINK: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/Wenge/HIST -HIST -HIST -HIST -HIS(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-07122023103239.html/@@stream)<strong> 1. The official start of the Red Guards Movement </strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, welcome everyone to listen to "History of the Great", I am the host Sun Cheng. Today, we will continue to conduct a series of historical revolution history. From this lecture, we have to tell the establishment of the Red Guards attached to the Tsinghua University of Tsinghua.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in the Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, the sharp and opposing political atmosphere of the peace and the children of the cadres and children was permeated. Under such circumstances, only one fuse is needed, and Tsinghua High School, which has become a gunpowder barrel, will be fully detonated, causing a political bang.</p>
<p>From May 1st to 3rd, 1966 on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, 11 students from the Tsinghua Affiliated High School started an outing out of the school's four -day vacation. According to the meeting of Luo Xiaohai, one of the founders of the Red Guards of the Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School, the situation of this outing is:</p>
<p>"Our 11 male and female classmates in Class 651 of our preparatory course took the school to take a 4 -day vacation opportunity to bring compass, watches, crystal radios, cameras, quilts, pots and noodles to the west of the western suburbs of Beijing and Tanyu Temple. Everyone has enhanced friendship and exchanged views on the cultural revolution in the educational industry. It is also a coincidence. In the process of camp, we heard that Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed the Albanian delegation from the radio. It seems to be a signal bomb. After returning, these people have become the main force of the 651 view. They are not from cadre families except Bu Luo. '; Tanzhang Temple's trip is indeed the origin of the Red Guards. "(See Luo Xiaohai:" An Important Historical Materials ")</p>
<p>Despite Luo Xiaohai, there are only three cadres and children among these students. But from the equipment they took when they went out of the outing, their living conditions were extremely good at the time. Yang Jidong, the author of the Cultural Revolution, who had studied at Tsinghua University at that time, had commented on this, saying: "At that time, our college students in Tsinghua, many people have not even seen the desktop electronic tube radios. Many people have never played. After the phone. And these middle school students brought the very precious transistor radios to the suburbs at the time. It can be seen that their living conditions are superior. "</p>
<p>In fact, Luo Xiaohai himself said in a memories of the article: "The students of different political opinions of the Tsinghua University of China are the children of cadres. Although most of the people from the start of 651 are non -cadre children, the proposed program does not involve class routes, but The leader of the 651 view is the children of the minority cadres in the class. Soon, the movement of this different political opinion was absorbed by the Cadres of the Cadre Children in the Central Plains of Tsinghua University. Important Historical Materials ") Therefore, although most of the students participating in this outing are not cadre children, those who have their views are indeed cadre children.</p>
<p>On May 28th, a group of students with "different political opinions" of Tsinghua High School had a unified signature in the school's dormitory building and adopted a name called "Red Guards". On the next day, on the night of May 29, a dozen students from the Tsinghua Affiliated High School came to the Beijing Yuanmingyuan site and held a secret meeting. At this meeting, they believed that the party branch of the school was implementing a bourgeois education route, saying that "the situation in which the mountains were coming and the wind was full of storms at the time. The struggle is necessary to set up its own organization and unanimously agree to name the organization as the Red Guards. "Most of these students are cadres and children, and the word" Red Guard "comes from the pen name that Zhang Chengzhi once used by the participating students, which means" Mao Zedong Red Guards ".</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Second, Tsinghua Affiliated Chinese Guards to Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China </strong></p>
<p>On May 31, the newly established organization called the "Red Guards" sent a faithful letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong. The letter said in this way:</p>
<p>"We are students of the Tsinghua Affiliated High School. Our party branch has 24 party members and 5 party members. Most of them are intellectuals, and the proportion of workers and peasants has a small proportion. The chairman's writing, refusing to treat Chairman Mao's book as the highest instructions for all work. There are few class struggle views. Basically, there is no implementation of the proletarian school running policy, no prominent proletarian politics, and no implementation of the party line. "</p>
<p>When we hear this passage, what we need to pay attention to is that during the Cultural Revolution, many people's words were actually in the literal sense, and there was a layer of meaning -oriented meaning. Although this paragraph seems to be saying that at that time, most people in the party branch of Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School were intellectual, and the proportion of workers and peasants was small, but in fact, the students in the Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School were mainly divided into cadre children peaceful people. These two opposite factions. Here, the red guards, mainly cadres and children, used the hair -style class struggle discourse system. They believed that the school's party branch workers and peasants were insufficient and there were too many intellectuals. At that time, the so -called "revolutionary cadres" and "workers" and "poor and middle peasants" both belonged to the "red five categories" of politics. Although intellectuals do not have been regarded as a political persecution label as a political persecution label as the so -called "rich and anti -right to the right", the various sports in the Mao era did not let the intellectuals go. In the Mao era, intellectuals were naturally regarded as a suspicious person and could not be fully trusted. In the faction of the students of the Chinese Revolution of Tsinghua University, many children of intellectual children hold the views of civilian children. Therefore, it can be said that although this passage seems to indicate that there are too many intellectuals in the party branch and too few workers and peasants, in fact, it is the political strategy used by the cadres' children to try to combat civilian children.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School students also sent another letter to Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This is what this letter says:Judging from the letter of this letter saying that "we are a senior in the high school of Tsinghua University and the descendants of the revolution", they should also be cadres and children. Some of the so -called schools in the letter, such as "implementing class routes" and "focusing on performance issues", in fact, they can also be very dissatisfied with cadre children. As mentioned in the previous lecture, many civilian children at that time rely on the so -called "focusing on performance" policy to gain benefits. For example, on the issue of allowing students to join the Communist Youth League, teachers will pay attention to the development of students who have "not good origin" but "good performance". In general, the author of this letter represents the interests of cadres and children, and buckle a large hat to the school. It is believed that the school's care for civilian children is the so -called "a black line of a bourgeois amendmentism for several years. "" ". To this end, they must write to Mao Zedong "to disclose and report these amendments private goods sold by Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School."</p>
<p>This letter also said: "Some Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao supports us, and some workers, peasants and soldiers give us a strong backing. We are not afraid of anything. Resolutely fight to the end. We are fighting for Mao Zedong's thoughts and fighting for communism.</p>
<p><strong> Three, more than a hundred people jointly signed a big newspaper </strong></p>
<p>On June 2nd, a big news poster with a more explosive content was posted in school. Its title is called "Oath of Defending the Proletarian Dictatorship, Oath of Defending Mao Zedong Thought", and the content can be said to be quite crazy. Various political slogans are piled up, showing a taste of teeth dancing claws and exhausting. The full text of this big newspaper is said:</p>
<p>"The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao sounded the charge to the people across the country and carried out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!</p>
<p>"We, the descendants of the proletarian revolution, infinite love, infinite faith, infinite worship of Mao Zedong thought. For all the words and deeds of all anti -Mao Zedong thoughts, with the hatred of hatred. In the Great Revolution, we must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thoughts, one foot, one foot The so -called 'authority' of all anti -Mao Zedong thoughts, where Chairman Mao instructed, we resolutely followed up and resolutely implemented it. No matter what the banner he is, no matter how high he is, he must be smashed!</p>
<p>"The Cultural Revolution is a decisive battle of two classes and two worldviews. We must highlight the proletarian politics, engage in the transformation of the world outlook and life outlook, and the bourgeoisie is not allowed to resist stubborn in any field!</p>
<p>"The bourgeois masters, since we have provoked this struggle, so okay!We do not refuse, insist on accompanying to the end, do not pull off the black flag, do not defeat the gang, do not smash the black shop, and do not ban the black market. Never accept troops!</p>
<p>"Comrades, revolutionary comrades:</p>
<p>"Vowing to follow the Party Central Committee, vowed to follow Chairman Mao, and vowed to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!</p>
<p>"long live Chairman Mao!</p>
<p>"Red Guards</p>
<p>"June 2, 1966"</p>
<p>The above is all the contents of this big newspaper. It can be seen that there are all kinds of crazy Cultural Revolution languages, such as expressing "infinite love, infinite belief, infinite worship" of Mao Zedong's thoughts, and show "hate" with words and deeds that oppose Mao Zedong's thoughts. The Dazi Poster also said in an unspeakable tone that to establish the "absolute authority" of Mao Zedong's thoughts, for Mao Zedong's instructions, it is necessary to "resolutely take care of and resolutely implement it." More than one hundred people signed this big poster, and from the writer of this signature "Red Guard" poster claiming to be "us, the descendants of the proletarian revolution", this is of course a representative cadre's child position Big characters. According to the statement in this big poster, the so -called "violating Mao Zedong thought" will be "smashed" in the end.</p>
<p>(The content of the letters and posters quoted above comes from Bu Weihua: "The Establishment of the Red Guards of the Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School")</p>
<p>At this time, the Red Guards movement in the Tsinghua Affiliated High School had launched. In just a few days, the Red Guard Movement has developed from the plot of a dozen people to the posters of hundreds of people. Judging from the political demands of these Red Guards, they represent the position of the cadres and children in the school. What they want to maintain in the real interests are the privileges they get through their parents, and the Tsinghua Affiliated High School has become their target. On June 2, 1966, a poster posted on June 2, 1966, a more explosive news appeared and accelerated the evolution of the situation. On this day, the full text of the Chinese official mouthpiece "People's Daily" published a big poster from Peking University, and expressed support for the extreme attitude expressed by this big newspaper in the form of a commentator article. According to the current words, this actually proves that the official is "rhythmic rhythm" in person. In this way, we need to transfer the camera to Peking University to narrate the next history.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone. This is here this week, we see you next week.</p>

<p>When the United States is in charge of the assistant Secretary of State Barbara Lif, the assistant Secretary of State Barbara Lif, the occupation of the government -it promises to the United States that it will not expand the settlement site on the west bank of the Jordan River in four months -made the most dangerous decision, the purpose of the purpose, the purpose of the purpose, the purpose of the purpose It is to accelerate the construction of Israel. On June 18, the occupation forces approved a plan to shorten the time required to shorten the settlement of the Jordan River on the west bank of the River. Qi "" fully approved the plan to build a settlement, without waiting for the approval of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.</p>
<p>Until recently, because of worrying about international resolutions refusing to settle, Israel has taken cautious steps on the issue of annexation of some areas of the west coast. Although the occupation country has not respected these decisions in the end, the situation became worse after the right -wing government came to power. The government has gathered the biggest supporter of the expansion of the settlement, which has led the occupants to confiscate the Palestinian land of more than one million Danan, and these lands are classified as "Israeli National Land".</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T11-52-08/1-1689161990.png" />Shrine and mosque in Nabisuel Village(Shutterstock)The Village of Nabisonar is located at the foot of the mountain at an altitude of 859 meters. There is a shrine and a mosque. The village of the same name enjoys a stunning view. On the one hand, you can see the occupied City of Jerusalem. At the hustle and bustle of Lamara, when you turned to the East, the scene began to change, and two Jewish recovery settlements appeared in front of you, namely the settlement site of "Hashmur", devouring 331 Dean's Danan. The village land and "Nev Shimer" settlement site, the settlement was built on about 136 Dean land. These settlements turned the village into a "extreme orthodox faction" cell. The place between the ruins became a Jewish church, claiming that the prophet Samuel was one of the prophets of the Jewish.</p>
<p>The Village of Nabisunul constitutes a clear explanatory settlement model, because the village was occupied by Israel after 1967. In 1971, then the then Prime Minister Gorda Mayer ordered to demolish all houses, and the villagers were evacuated. At a house of about 100 meters east of the mosque and archeological sites, Israel built about 1,000 housing facilities for Jews on the ruins of Jewish homes.</p>
<p>The residents of this village were isolated from the west bank of the Jordan River. Since then, the village has never escaped the consequences of Israeli settlements. · Laibin(Yitzhak Rabin)The government decided that the occupation of the land of 3500 Dean (865 acres) was confiscated as part of the Israeli "National Park". This time, the farmland and houses of the village were confiscated. Archaeological sites.</p>
<p>In this way, the occupation troops established one of the largest parks on the west bank of the Jordan River after expel the residents of the area and destroy their homes. In action, the current Neitanahu government proposed to modify it in May, and aims to apply it to the archeological site on the west bank of the Jordan River. The land of the Israelites used the Bible name to refer to the occupied the west bank of the Jordan River) is full of inheritance sites with major countries and historical importance for the development of the settlement on Israeli land. "</p>
<p>With the goal of Nabisonar village, it has exposed the great efforts of the Israeli government to annexes the land on the west bank of the Jordan River. In the past few decades, the Israeli settlement project has continued to develop, ignoring the International Convention and the International Criminal Court (ICC) (ICC) (ICC) (ICC) The rules, and the international criminal court transferred the national civilian population to the occupied territory and deemed the crime of war, and prohibited from mandatory transfer in territory and expelled the occupied personnel out of its territory. Since the west bank of the Jordan River, Israel has built more than 130 settlements and about 140 settlement outpost bases. At present, nearly 700,000 Israeli settlers live in these settlements (of which 230,000 are in East Jerusalem).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T11-52-08/1-1689162021.png" />Israeli settlement point construction</p>
<p>The attitude of the Israeli "Liberal" government on settlements is not different from the right -wing government. The Minister of Labor) proposed a plan to annex the west coast (including the Jordan Valley and the Great Jerusalem). Ten years later, during the period of "Menheim Beijing" and his (right -wing) Likard Group, The continuity has emerged, and the party proposed a large Israeli plan to call for annexed to annex the west bank of the Jordan River and oppose the international community in the so -called "center of the Bible region." Igel Alon (former Labor Minister) ended in the end of the war in 1967 that the war ended in the end of the war in 1967. Later, a plan to annex the west coast (including the Jordan Valley and the Great Jerusalem region) was proposed, and 10 years later, the "Menheim Beijing" and its (right wing) Likard Group were proposed in the rule of rule. After the Grand Israel Program, the party proposed a large Israeli plan that required annexation of the West Bank of Jordan, opposing concessions in his so -called "center of the Bible regional".</p>
<p>After the signing of the Oslo Agreement, the situation has not changed much, although most people in Israeli politics agree to establish Palestinian countries, at least in the form of form. In the past three decades, the right wing of Israel has continued to hold up the set flag of the settlement, "Na Na Naisa," Na Na Naisa, "Na Na Naisa," Na Na Naisa, "Na Na Na," Na Na Naisa, "Na Na Na," Na Na Na, "Na Na Na," Na Na Na, "Na Na Naisa," Na Na Naisa, "Na Na Naisa," Na Na Na, "Na Na Naisa," Na Na Na, "Na Na Naisa," Na Na Naisa. The campaign of leaders such as Futari Bente "continued to emerge. After entering politics in 2013, Navarley Bennett immediately asked Israel to comprehensively annexate Zone C. This violated the Oslo Agreement. With him In 2021, the government led by Bened consolidated the occupation of Zone C, which prompted Palestine's Jerusalem Minister Fati Hudmi, claiming that Israeli Prime Minister Naff Tali Bennet spent a year. It is the most difficult and dangerous year for Jerusalem and its residents. It has initially approved the construction of 14108 settlement units and demolished 270 Palestinian buildings.</p>
<h4>The most ferocious Neitanahu government</h4>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By implementing Israel's complete sovereignty on some homes of Jewish and Samaria, establishing new cities and settlements, and letting hundreds of thousands of settleers live there. The reality is irreversible, and the dream of the Arabs established in Jewish and Samaria to establish a country has been completely shattered.Smomuric's extensive government power helps to promote the settlement agenda on the west bank of the Jordan River. As the Minister of Finance, he instructs the government department to prepare to place another 500,000 settleers on the west bank of the Jordan River. It is roughly the same, and promises to provide a huge new budget of up to billions of Shakel to develop the infrastructure of these settlements.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T11-52-08/1-1689162071.png" />Smomoric and Extreme Minister Ben Geville appeared together. They did not care about the human rights and democratic values of the occupation country in front of the international community (Anadoru News Agency)</p>
<p>However, the authorities of Smochi did not stop there. In February, he obtained the same important position and was appointed director of the Civil Affairs Administration. According to Israeli law, he actually became the "Governor of the West Bank of Jordan". A position means changing the official governance structure of the West Bank of Jordan, and transferring many administrative power from the military command of the occupation forces to the civil command power represented by Smomuric.</p>
<p>The pace of the Neitana government's annexation is the fastest in history. The Israeli government approved a bill in March to allow the Israelites to return to 4 settlements on the west bank of the Jordan River. If the law is implemented, the law ordered the resident from these settlements and the Gaza Strip, and Israel's highly controversial "judicial reform" plan is also part of the measures aimed to completely control the west bank of the Jordan River. It was also confirmed that he said that re -consideration of democracy and legal structure may ensure that the government annexed the west bank of the Jordan River.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of Neitania Hushaw and the west bank of the Jordan River did not awaken with his recent government, although his pace became more fierce in this area. When he served as Prime Minister in 2017, Likard, led by Neitanahu, Lacide led by Neitanahu. The group passed a dangerous decision and sought to comprehensively annex the west bank of the Jordan River. Although this decision failed to implement the opposition from the international community, Neitanahu slowed down. It will gradually exercise sovereignty in the local area and make the decision after confirming the support of the former US President Donald Trump administration. In 2020, the Israeli Prime Minister announced that he had to unilaterally annexes the land that was designed as Israeli sovereignty. The decision was soon withdrawn to pave the way to reach a "normalized agreement" with multiple Arab countries.</p>
<p>The decision to withdraw this withdrawal of Israel is neither the ultimate nor strategic, but it is just a tactical move. The outskirts of the West Bank Palestinian city of Nabrus extended to the 55th highway on Cafaaba, Northeast, Tellaviv, like other roads built during the occupation period. The author of the report of the report, Yehudashaul, published a quite inspiring remark. He explained the strategy of the Israeli government to develop infrastructure in order to consolidate the settlement point. "Everyone said," Everyone It is believed that with the signing of the normalized agreement, the annexation of the West Bank of Jordan has been frozen, but in fact, Israel is still continuing to annex through the infrastructure to annex the west bank of the Jordan River. In the process, we will always consolidate our control of the Palestinian people. "</p>
<h4>The international community in imagination</h4>
<p>In May, a lawyer who supported the most famous right -wing organization "Regavim", one of the most famous right -wing organizations, appeared in court in the occupied Israeli Supreme Court in the occupied Jerusalem. The demolition order of Khanal-Ahmar, Jahalin Beidu in that village was banned from building houses for occupying tribal residents. Therefore, they lived in tin-made houses.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the "Regavim" organization has been calling for the demolition of the village and successfully received the court support in 2018. However, its demolition plan has not yet been implemented. "It was stopped for demolition.</p>
<p>The loose judgment based on the court covered the concerns of the international pressure movement seeking to protect the village. Because it is difficult for foreign delegations to leave the village and their residents, in addition, EU member states also issued a joint statement to oppose the court's decision by the court's decision. The former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Fattu Ben Da also condemned Israel's behavior and emphasized that forcibly the transfer of villagers will be regarded as the crime of war.</p>
<p>After staying away from Khan Ahmel Village, Israel continued to implement the polar right agenda. Based on "the exclusive rights of the Jewish people to the entire Israeli land", there is no more clear example of what happened than the Homos outpost. This is At the end of the 1970s, the settlement on the land on northern Nublus was empty in 2005. According to the resident who evacuated the Disa's departure contact method in 2005, extremeism settled in 2009 successfully established a religious school in a religious school there in 2009. Essence</p>
<p>As the current government came to power, the departure law was quickly amended, and the "official" ban on the Israelites entered the Homos and other settlements on the west bank of the Jordan River. Although this law caused the opposition from the United States, the Israeli government also merged the government of the Israeli government. Without paying attention to the position of its U.S. allies, it announced that Homash's private land of Palestine's Palestinians was transformed into "state -owned land", which caused the settlers there. A construction company recently completed the water pipe laying work of Homos. A few weeks ago, Smomorich celebrated the 75th anniversary of the disaster, the "Israel Independence Day" as the "Israeli Independence Day".</p>
<p>On the other hand, some international decisions about the steps of the west bank of the Jordan River have become the object of people ridiculed. As it happened in January this year, at the time, the UN General Assembly voted to request the Hague International Court of Hague in the West Bank and East Jerusalem on the west bank and East Jerusalem of the Israeli River in Israel. Legal consequences have issued consultation opinions, which means that the United Nations hopes that the court ruled that the behavior of the occupation country on the west bank of the Jordan River is "temporary occupation" or "annexed". This process takes one to two years to take action wisely.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Neitanahu government continued to build a settlement point on the west bank of the Jordan River, and adopted a policy to avoid international public opinion. It initially announced the plan to build a settlement point in specific sensitive areas. With the anger of other Western countries, it publicly announced the suspension of the first project and started other settlement projects in other regions, including the "E1" construction project. The international community believes that the project is the real obstacle of the two countries' programs. When opposed to the project, the occupation country promised to stop its completion, but at the same time informed Washington's plan to build 4,000 new units in other places.</p>
<p>Occupy countries violate international law on the issue of settlement. Although it sometimes does not want to anger Western allies led by Washington, it listens more to the tendency of extremist religious remarks and expansion. The Palestinian who expelled the Palestinians and defended the parade of their homes. The dark parade began 75 years ago and continued until today.</p>

<h1>Goldman Sachs: The second Indian economy in 2075? Experts</h1>

<p>Description: Goldman Sachs recently issued a prediction that India is expected to become the world's second largest economy in 2075. The country's economic growth is expected to reach 5.9%this year. However, some experts believe that more than ten years ago, the world had made too optimistic predictions on India, but it was not fully realized.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66201124/57918401"> <img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T12-10-00Z/57918401_303.png" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Investment Bank Goldman Sachs published an article on its website on July 6, predicting that in 2075, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马斯克莫迪相谈甚欢-特斯拉将尽快在印度建厂/a-65988335">India</a>It will become the second largest economy in the world, second only to China, and tied in front of the United States, the euro area and Japan.</p>
<h3>Demographic Dividend</h3>
<p>The main reason for the prediction of Goldman Sachs is, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人口超越中国的印度能获得人口红利吗/a-65471911">Indian population</a>Continuous growth, huge labor potential. Santanusengupta, an economicist at the investment bank, said: "In the next 20 years, India's raising ratio (that is, the ratio between the non -labor age and the working age population) is the lowest in the world One of the regions. "He said that India should seize this opportunity to strengthen the production capacity of manufacturing, continue to serve the growth of the service industry, and the growth of infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Economic Digitalization and Aadhaar identity system</h3>
<p>Goldman Sachs specially said that India has achieved a flying over economic digitalization, the so -called Aadhaar biometric identity system. This system includes 1.4 billion people in the country. Through this system, public services can make public services easier and targeted, and also help small and micro enterprises to obtain loans, thereby promoting growth. According to the "Washington Post" columnist and CNN host Fareedzakaria in April, the system now covers 99.9%of Indian adults. Using this figure, you can open a bank account or transfer within a few minutes. The system is operated by public institutions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T12-10-00Z/64916040_401.png" />Aadhaar biometric identity system has also triggered a debate on personal privacy and data protection</p>
<h3>Low labor participation rate, especially women</h3>
<p>The analysis of Goldman Sachs also pointed out that India's risks are that it cannot effectively increase the proportion of labor participation. According to analysis, the proportion of labor in India has continued to decline over the past 15 years. Especially women. Zakalia's article also pointed out that in the past 20 years, Indian women's employment ratio has decreased from 30%to 23%.</p>
<p>Another opportunity facing India is the green economy. The country announced zero emissions in 2070, and half of the energy from 2030 came from non -fossil raw materials.</p>
<h3>The Chinese economy is five times the Indian</h3>
<p>However, the German Economic Weekly published a guest article from Harvard Kennedy College Graham Allison on July 11, and believed that the praise to India was too early.</p>
<p>He pointed out that although India's economic growth rate in the first quarter of this year reached 6.1%and China was 4.5%, it should be cautious about overnight forecasts. He quoted Zacalia's article, saying that around 2006, India's growth was even more than 9%. At that time, the world was optimistic about the Indian economy, and even the Indian Minister of Trade predicted that the country's economy would surpass China soon. However, this is not exactly the case.</p>
<p>Today, the Indian economy is ranked fifth, behind the United States, China, Japan, and Germany. China's GDP is five times that of India.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T12-10-00Z/57105844_401.png" />It is said that the ratio of Indian women's participation in the employment market has decreased from 30%to 23%in the past 20 years</p>
<h3>China technology and production efficiency are higher than India</h3>
<p>Professor Ellison's article pointed out that in addition, China is still leading India in science and technology. Of the top 20 technology companies in the world's top 20, four are Chinese companies, and no Indian companies are on the list. In terms of artificial intelligence, China is also the only country that can compete with the United States.</p>
<p>In addition, Professor Ellison believes that China's labor efficiency is higher than India. Goldman Sachs also pointed out that the huge population of India is obviously an opportunity, but how the challenge is to effectively use these labor. This means providing skill training for them while creating employment.</p>
<h3>Obstacles: Surname system, complex ethnic and religious relationships: Create employment from bottom to top</h3>
<p>Professor Ellison quoted the comments from former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to India's development, saying that Lee Kuan Yew has been looking forward to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美财长访问印度推动伙伴合作-减少经济依赖/a-63729145">India</a>Powerful ability <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登和莫迪瞄準中俄-稱美印是親密夥伴/a-66009193">compete with China</a>Essence However, Li Guangyao later discovered that due to the requirements of India's surnames, bureaucracy, and elite classes, they were unwilling to face the requirements of complicated ethnic and religious groups, so it was difficult to meet the due economic efficiency. Zakalia's article also said that the Muslim groups in India accounted for one -seventh of the country's population, but continued to be persecuted.</p>
<p>However, Zakalia also has confidence in India. He believes that India is able to popularize smartphones and the Internet. At the same time, with the AADhaar identity recognition system, it can help hundreds of millions of small and micro enterprises to obtain loans, thereby hiring two more employees, which can increase tens of millions of employment opportunities. This way from the bottom up is completely different from that of China from top to bottom-for example, 100 new factories to increase tens of thousands of jobs-to increase tens of thousands of jobs-.</p>

<p>The plan to build a new embassy in the London Tower in China was rejected by the London District Council last December. The plan has risen to diplomatic conflicts between China and the United Kingdom from the regional level.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted officials of China and Britain's officials that the confrontation was destroying the efforts of repairing the severe damage relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>Two Chinese officials and three British officials told Reuters that the Chinese government was disappointed with the construction permits that failed to obtain the new site of the embassy and expressed dissatisfaction at the official meeting.</p>
<p>China bought land about 6.4 kilometers from the current site of the embassy in the central city center of London for US $ 31 million. The new and old sites are located in the "Tagura" administrative district in East London. Local officials in charge of urban construction planning basically agree to this case. However, district councilors oppose this plan for safety issues and reasons that may affect residents.</p>
<p>Chinese officials said they suspected that the British government conspired to prevent the new site construction plan of the embassy and planned the local opposition. A Chinese official said "this is definitely a political issue."</p>
<p>British officials refuted these allegations, claiming that local parliaments could decide themselves.</p>

Risk.</p>
<p>This article written by Alexander Görlach pointed out that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟19国呼吁减少制药工业对中国的依赖/a-65501791">now European countries re -position their policy of China -that is, the position of free trade has been higher than politics in the past 30 years</a>This kind of behavior further shows that "the global decision -making world order may be about to end."</p>

The first thing that is the democratic island country that has never belonged to the People's Republic of China. "</p>
<p>With the lessons of the Russian and Ukraine War, countries around the world are more cautious about China. However, if the Taiwan Strait really broke out, can the previous sanctions on Russia applied to China?

Therefore, the Taiwan Strait of the Taiwan Strait Conflicts will be a double disaster for German trade. "</p>

This is far from "German efficiency" far from catching up. "</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the author said: "The good news is that we can learn something from Lithuania. That is: do not commit a similar mistake to Russia in response to China."</p>
<p>The article refers to the risk of conflict between the Taiwan Strait: "If the Chinese army really attacks Taiwan, what will happen? Taking our car manufacturer as an example, their 40%of their sales come from the Chinese market. How will our economy cope with this consequence ?

So, will the Taiwan Strait burst out? If China invades Taiwan, when will the PLA's attack time point be? On Wednesday, the American academic community discussed the above issues.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/jw-07062023104707.html">What is the intention of Xi Jinping to inspect the southern and eastern theater? </a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12oUZJhik0HqUtSpOBffGu82QD7nINyDq">Xi Jinping inspected the Eastern theater of the PLA to speed up and improve the win -win ability</a></em>**<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/cmh1-04122023065333.html"><strong> Xi Jinping inspected the southern theater navy to emphasize deepening military training preparations </strong></a>As the presidential election of Taiwan is about to begin early next year, the security issues of the Taiwan Strait will once again become the focus of attention from all walks of life. On July 24th, Taiwan will conduct a real soldiers in Hanguang No. 39. The National Army in Taiwan will actually exercise how to deal with China's possible invasion. Taiwan's counties and cities will also exercise how to conduct air defense exercises and evacuate refuge at the same time at the same time.</p>
<p>At the same time, on Wednesday, the Hudson Institute of Washington Think Tank, the United States, also held a seminar to discuss the Chinese offense schedule of China.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Kylebass, the founder of Hayman Capital Management L.P., believes that in the near future, Chinese President Xi Jinping has a high possibility that he will determine Taiwan. Baths pointed out that since 2020, the Beijing authorities have revised many legal integration of domestic resources. At the same time, it has also made preparations for Taiwan to send troops through the diversification of oil imports, increased gold reserves, and increased food stocks.</p>
<p><strong> American Expert: The first step of China ’s attack to cut off Taiwan’ s foreign communication </strong></p>
<p>According to Bath's analysis, if the Taiwan Strait War broke out, China's primary goal is to block information blocking Taiwan. This is a lesson from China from the Russian and Ukraine War: "If China attacks Taiwan, information control will be the key, and the Communist Party of China is often very common. It is very important to mention the flow of information that cuts off Taiwan and the world. Before the United Lingjian exercise, China cuts off the cable between Taiwan Island and Matsu, so you can know what China's intention is. "</p>

We cannot get other information. This is a strategy. This is a strategy. Although we know that China's youth unemployment rate has reached 20%and China's economic performance is not good, Xi Jinping does not want Western media to continue to report on China's economic problems, so he decided to hide data directly. "</p>
<p><strong> Expert: Xi Jinping’s attacking Taiwan decides will not be out of rationality </strong></p>
<p>Bath's analysis of the financial trend pointed out that China is likely to attack Taiwan in the next 12 to 18 months: "China hopes to start attacking before being investigated, so I think that China's time to attack Taiwan will be faster than expected. ","</p>
<p>When will China attack Taiwan, and all parties have different views. A U.S. Air Force will predict in an internal document that the United States will start war in Taiwan in 2025. In October last year, a general of the U.S. Navy predicted that the U.S. army first needed to prepare for potential conflicts with China this year. In addition, the former commander of the United States India -Pacific Command recently stated that he insisted that China would invade Taiwan by 2027.</p>
<p>Bath also mentioned that Xi Jinping is not a rational actor in the issue of Wu Tong Taiwan. In other words, although attacking Taiwan will reverse the Chinese economy and endanger China's prestige in the international community, Xi Jinping will still be alone. At the same time, Bath also believes that unified Taiwan will not be the ultimate goal of the Beijing authorities. Taiwan will only expand its influence to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island country.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T15-23-13/1-1689174444.png" />The British government refuses to provide any assistance, claiming that this means more borrowing and higher inflation (Gaidi image)</p>
<p>Due to the high inflation rate and unprecedented high price wave, for millions of British people, the monthly payment bill has become a real nightmare. About 11 million British people are now difficult to pay monthly bills or repay cumulative debts.</p>
<p>A study by the British Financial Behavior Regulatory Bureau (FCA) shows that the number of British people who are difficult to pay the monthly bills have increased from 7.8 million last year to 10.9 million this year. It is expected that by the end of this year, this number will exceed 12 million British people.</p>
<p>Due to this unprecedented crisis, the central bank announced that in May, the United Kingdom has extracted about 4.6 billion pounds from the savings account, which is a record that has never been since 1997 -that is, 27 years ago.</p>
<h4>Nightmare of payment bills</h4>
<p>According to data from the British Financial Behavior Regulatory Commission, this is no longer just the issue of paying the bill on time, but the problem turned to installment payment and debt defaults. This is because 5.6 million people announced the debt, which increased by 1.4 million people over the previous year. Essence</p>
<p>The main reason for this crisis is that the monthly installment payment of liabilities has increased dramatically (the premium has risen by about 500 pounds). In addition, the rent price of houses has also increased by 21%.</p>
<p>According to research by British research institutions, one -third of British repayment increased monthly, while more than 34%of British rent prices rose. At the same time, this number is expected to rise next year. One of the British will renew the loan -related loan.</p>
<h4>cut the expenses</h4>
<p>The crisis of rising prices has prompted millions of British people to significantly reduce expenses. A survey by British Insurance Corporation showed that 6.2 million people claimed to cancel or reduce insurance this year.</p>
<p>A survey by HSBC also shows that 78%of British are looking for ways to reduce expenses this year, of which 45%said that they are cutting food and drinking expenses while looking for the cheapest shops to buy food.</p>
<p>HSBC -considered one of the largest banks in the UK -also announced that many electronic applications, gyms and other monthly subscribed for more than 200,000 monthly subscriptions will be canceled.</p>
<h4>Resort to savings</h4>
<p>The central bank stated that it set a record of withdrawing funds from long -term savings accounts. If the owner of the long -term savings account will be fined if the fund is withdrawn before the time limit is agreed with the bank. The highest level.</p>
<p>As for the savings account that is easy to access, the owner can withdraw funds at any time, because this will not bring interest income to the storage households.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who have funds other than banks deposit funds into banks in order to use high interest rates. The funding return of the bank in one year is as high as 8.7%. In May alone, these deposits reached £ 4.9 billion.</p>
<h4>Call for the government to support</h4>
<p>Some people call on the government to provide assistance to the British under economic difficulties, especially real estate loan owners, their debt stages increased in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p>Nearly 25,000 people signed a petition, calling on the government to take the actions taken by the government in the 1980s and the 1990s, that is, deducting the monthly payment of house purchase debts from the original salary before deducting taxes. The revenue before the tax deduction is 4,000 pounds, and the monthly installment payment is deducted (within 1500 pounds), and the remaining amount will be 2,500 pounds. The remaining part is the national income tax. Essence</p>
<p>However, the government has refused to provide any assistance so far, claiming that any assistance means more borrowing and higher inflation. The government is trying to reduce this problem through a solution that is also the only solution, which is to increase interest rates.</p>

<p>Apple supplier Foxconn announced the withdrawal from Vedanta (Vedanta)A $ 19.5 billion investment project, which was originally planned to build a chip manufacturer in India. Some analysts said the news was a setback to the development of the Indian technology industry.</p>
<p>According to the BBC, Foxconn said that the decision to withdraw capital was reached by the mutual agreement with Weida. After exiting, Weidata will have the joint venture and stated that it will continue to support the "Indian manufacturing" ambitions of the Indian government. Wida, headquartered in New Delhi, said that it has cooperated with other partners to establish India's first chip foundry.</p>
<p>It is reported that the experts of the global advisory company Olblyt Shiqiao Group experts said that Foxconn's withdrawal from the development of Indian semiconductor is a big blow. This withdrawal is the lack of the development track of technical cooperation and joint venture, and both sides lack experience in developing and managing large -scale semiconductor manufacturing business.</p>

<p><strong> Logic of religious persecution </strong></p>
<p>In October 2019, Pan Yongguang led him more than sixty people in Shenzhen to leave from China. With the help of the American political and religious circles in the United States, he finally arrived in the United States after nearly four years of exile. This religious group has become the biggest persecution Christian group rescued in American history with the large number of people.</p>
<p>At the seminar, Pan Yongguang explained the specific method of the Chinese government's persecution of the church. "The priests will often be threatened by the National Security Agency, forced to move, restricted exit, and fined. However, they are usually not charged with religious freedom. , But punish the church with other other crimes. "</p>
<p>Pan Yongguang believes that there is a set of logic of the Chinese government behind these punishments. "One of the important reasons for the persecution of me is that I have received theological training of the Elderly Church of the United States Reform. In the eyes of the Communist Party of China, it is regarded as the anti -China forces that I am collusion overseas. "</p>
<p>At the end of his speech, he took the free clock that marked the independence of the United States as an example to call on the US Congress to continue to pay attention to the issue of religious persecution in China.

<p>Ima Hargi said that he left Xinjiang to learn the teachings of Islam abroad, but after Xi Jinping came to power, the Chinese government changed his policy and began to persecute people who were engaged in Islam.

<p>He emphasized that the U.S. government should closely follow the Chinese government's threat to freedom; he suggested that the US government should adopt economic means to fight against China's free threat. The standard is reviewed. "He also called on American consumers not to buy Chinese products, because many Chinese products were produced by those who were enslaved.Fu Xiqiu proposed that not only should we hold a seminar like today, but also the news of spreading religious freedom to China, because truth can make people free.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T16-15-17/1-1689176027.png" />U.S. President Joe Biden (right) and Israeli Prime Minister Neitanahu (French media)</p>
<p>The New York Times published an article by reporter Thomas Friedman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/netanyahu-israel-judiciary.html">Analysis article</a>The article explores the tension between the Israeli Prime Minister Neitana and the US government.</p>
<p>Friedman emphasized the tensions between Tel Aviv and Washington by answering the three interconnected questions, which summarized the causes of crisis and their most prominent performance.</p>
<p>These three issues are: why is the Israeli government trying to suppress the country's Supreme Court? Why did US President Biden claim that the Neitaniahu administration is the most extreme government ever in Israel in an interview with CNN? Why does the United States Ambassador in Israel claim that the United States is trying to prevent Israel from "derailment"?</p>
<p>Friedman said that the brief answer to the first three questions was that the Bayeng government believed that the extreme right -wing Israeli government led by Neitanahu was under the guise of judicial reform to conduct unprecedented extremeism, which destroyed the United States and Israeli The common interests and values between them have changed the most important common opinion of the parties on the status of the west bank of the Jordan River. This is a factor to maintain their remaining peaceful hope.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T16-15-17/1-1689176083.jpg" />Israeli Prime Minister Neitanahu</p>
<h4>Why is the role of weakening judicial institutions?</h4>
<p>In many cases, the tension between the Israeli government led by the United States and the Jewish polarists, such as the response of the Government members of the Neitaniahu government on Biden's above -mentioned Israeli government extremist speech, National Security Minister Itemart Ben Ge Ge Verr said that Biden must realize that "Israel is no longer another star on the American flag."</p>
<p>In the article, it is the longest -term prime minister with Israel's long term with Israel's Prime Minister Neitanahu, which is shocked by political talents and wisdom. People leaders endanger the relationship between Israel and the United States and global investors, and make Israel's possibility of the civil war. As a result, it is just to continue to power with a group of nationalist extremists.</p>
<p>Friedman explained that when Neitaniah's governing alliance adopted actions to change the long -term deep -rooted power balance between the government and the Supreme Court, the common values between the United States and Israel began to collapse, and the Supreme Court was politics to politics to politics The only independent checks and balance of power.</p>
<p>Friedman said that Jewish settlers hope to weaken the role of the Supreme Court so that they can establish a settlement site on the west bank of the Jordan River and easily swallow the Palestinian land. One party forced their children to serve in the Israeli army and impose the teaching of English, mathematics, science and democratic values from their schools. As for Neitaniah, he is seeking to weaken the role Politicians who want to hold important positions.</p>
<p>The author said that the Nitanahu government has begun to propose a bill to the Israeli parliament this week that will prevent Israeli judicial agencies from using the reasonable principle of rationality established in Israeli law, which makes the Supreme Court has the right to review and overthrow the cabinet and cabinet minister And some other elected officials believe that reckless or immoral decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-12T16-15-17/2-1689176127.jpg" />The Israeli government shortens the settlement procedure</p>
<h4>annexed the west bank of the Jordan River and threatened Jordan security</h4>
<p>Friedman believes that people generally believe that Israel's occupation of the west bank of the Jordan River is temporary. The two countries will one day realize. This is one of the most important common views of Israel and the United States. There are more than 500,000 Israeli settlers, and the Palestinian population on the west bank of the Jordan River is about 2.9 million. When both parties reach an agreement, there will be two states: some people will leave and some people will stay.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the United States has always stood on the side of Israel and defended Israel in the United Nations and the Hague International Court. Based on its occupation of the West Bank of Jordan is a permanent and temporary fact, Israel is facing various decisions and rulings.</p>
<p>Friedman said that the Israeli government is doing its best to eliminate this view, which is also a factor in Israel's winning time. Since taking office in December 2022, Neitanahu has approved the construction of more than 7,000 new houses, of which large of which is large, of which large, large of which Some are located deep in the west bank of the Jordan River.</p>
<p>The Neitanahu government also revised a law that enabled the brutal settlers to return to four settlements expelled by the Israeli army, which violated Israel's previous thing to make such as the former US President George W. Bush Bush. promise.</p>
<p>The author believes that Neitanahu continues to destroy the general view of the plans on the west bank of the Jordan River and the two countries, and now it brings real problems to other common interests in the United States and Israel, because this threatens Jordan's stability and forces Israel with Israel The so -called "Abraham Agreement" took a step back.</p>
<p>Friedman said that Israeli President Azak Herzog will visit Washington next week and meet with the US President. Biden stated in this way that his problem is not the people of Israel, but in Neitanahu's Extremeist government.</p>
<p>The author finally concluded that he had no doubt that Biden would convey such a message to the President of Israel: When the gap between the interests and values of the government and the Israeli government is getting larger and larger, it will inevitably re -evaluate the relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>Although the NATO Summit ’s communiqué expresses its willingness to unite and respond to China's threat, Weng Luzhong believes that at present, its symbolic significance is greater than substantial significance. "How to implement it must be followed. For example, whether NATO has to set up an office in Japan; whether these countries are willing to have a closer connection with Japan, South Korea, and even Australia and India on security issues. The power will be higher. "</p>

<p>Curtis also believes that there are different opinions in NATO's internal focus on the new focus of China and India. "But it can be foreseeable that China will continue to become part of NATO discussion. Considering Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as long as China and Russia continue to enhance the connection This will make people even more doubt about the purpose of China. "</p>

<p>The reward mechanism shows that if the public has repaired the heels, it can apply for a subsidy of 7 euros (about S $ 10) from the authorities; if you repair your clothes, you can get 10 to 25 euros. Related expenses will spend from the 154 million euros of funds from France from 2023 to 2028.</p>
<p>Kuyar invited all sewing studios and shoe makers to join this ecological organization "Refashion" system, and labeled the old clothes and shoes that gave "new life". The "remake" organization is appointed by the French government to engage in the sustainable development of the industry.</p>
<p>Kuyar added that "our goal is to support those who do maintenance," including sewing studios and brand vendors who provide maintenance services.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-07-12T20-21/000000.png" />In addition to the best -selling game "The Call of Duty", Activision Blizzard also has other best -selling games such as "World of Warcraft", "Dark Destroyer" and the mobile game "Candy Legend". In other words, if Microsoft really successfully bought Activision Blizzard, it may really be just around the world. (Reuters)</p>
<h4>Microsoft (Microsoft Corporation) (Nasdaq Stock Exchange code: MSFT)</h4>
<p>Software giant Microsoft finally ruled out the main obstacles to acquiring video game manufacturers. American judges have agreed with the $ 69 billion in transactions overnight. The British regulatory agency, which had previously objected, also began to hint at this time it was open to re -examining the transaction.</p>
<p>Microsoft's acquisition plan is not only the biggest transaction in the company's history, but also the largest transaction in the history of the video game industry. Because of this, it has previously aroused strong opposition from the United States and Britain. After the good news spread overnight, Microsoft's stock price rose 0.64 US dollars, and the closure of the market was $ 332.47; the stock price of Dynamic Blizzard soared a 10 % increase, and the closed market was $ 90.99.</p>
<p>Jacqueline ScottCorley, Judge Judge in San Francisco, rejected the argument of the Biden government. This means that this transaction is equivalent to giving Xbox game machine manufacturers Microsoft, which will use the right to use the best -selling game in the market, thereby harming the interests of consumers. These best -selling games include "Callof Duty".</p>
<p>At the time, the Federal TradeCommission also argued that if the acquisition of Activision Blizzard was successful, Microsoft would be able to use the survivor Blizzard to exclude game console competitors such as Nintendo and SonyGroup. In addition. But obviously the judge Koly did not agree with this statement.</p>
<p>Corley said: "After the Federal Trade Commission did not clearly explain that the consolidation of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, the best -selling game" Call of Duty "will be removed from Sony's PlayStation. The competitiveness of the game market. "</p>
<p>The court allows the Federal Trade Commission to appeal to the decision before Friday (14th).</p>
<p>Shortly after U.S. judges issued an order, the British Competition and MarketsAuthouse also then announced that the bureau is now preparing to consider Microsoft's proposal to solve the British antitrust issue, and even hints that the two parties may reach a solution.</p>

<p>In fact, in addition to the best -selling game "Call of Duty", Activities Blizzard also includes the best -selling "World ofwarcraft", "Diablo" and the mobile game "Candy Crushsaga" (Candy Crushsaga ". game. In other words, if Microsoft really successfully bought Activision Blizzard, its position in the global gaming market will be greatly different.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, of the 35 analysts of Tipranks, 30 are given "buy" rating to Microsoft shares, four are given "holding" rating. It is $ 350.29.</p>
