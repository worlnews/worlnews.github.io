 South Africa Cape Town TheEewaterSkloof Reservoir
(Voice of Germany) based on a study published on Thursday (May 18), more than half of the world's lakes are shrinking due to dryness. A international research team published their research results in Science magazine and found that the main reason was global warming and human activities.
Only about 3% of the water sources on the earth are freshwater. Among them, the freshwater of natural lakes and reservoirs accounted for 87%. The report emphasizes the demand for water resources management solutions.
According to the research led by Fangfang Yao, a water writer at the University of Colorado, since the early 1990s, large lakes and reservoirs in the world have been reduced. The expert group said that in the past three decades, some important freshwater resources in the world have been lost at a cumulative rate of about 22 a year.
"More than half of the loss is mainly due to human consumption or climate warming." Yao Fangfang said that he pointed out that climate warming contributed "a larger share."
Researchers have also found that the changes in rainfall and runoff, the effect of deposits and temperatures have led to a decline in global lake water levels.
 The fourth largest lake in the world is now like this
Lake change data for the years of 30 Years 
The research team measured the water level of nearly 2,000 lakes and other water bodies in the world, and made a report based on satellite data collected from 1992 to 2020.
In the United States, Made Lake lost two -thirds of water storage during the 28 years.
The study also found that unsustainable human consumption caused the lake to dry up, including the salty sea of Central Asia and the Dead Sea in the Middle East. Afghan, Egypt, and Mongolia lakes were affected by rising temperatures, resulting in an increase in surface evaporation rate.
Scientists say it is necessary to control global warming within 1.5 ° C to avoid the serious consequences of climate change. The world is currently warming at a speed of about 1.1 ° C.
* #####: Is it dried up in Europe?

France has not rained for more than a month. This is the longest drought period since the meteorological records began in 1959. Western European high -voltage bands are squeezed by rain and clouds are the main causes of this phenomenon. Climate change may cause long -term existence of such drought weather. The longest river in France has almost dried up.

energy shortage 
In early March, Lac Duchambon Reservoir's water level in the Alps in France was seriously insufficient, so that the hydropower station was no longer able to run normally. Hydropower accounted for 15%of French power supply, and people began to worry about the situation of power shortage. In 2022, France was forced to turn off some nuclear power plants because the low water level caused the nuclear power plant to be unable to get enough cooling water.
* #####: Is it dried up in Europe?
The prospect is dim 
The Gatailan River near Turus has almost dried up. The supply of tap water in some parts of France has been interrupted. Paris has ordered emergency measures to prepare for serious drought again this summer. Some areas are no longer allowed to irrigate private pools or cleaning vehicles. The national water emergency plan is expected to be officially introduced within this month.

Stranging Gentola 
Beginning at the end of February, the Gentola cruise ship shuttle in the streets of the city of Venice had been caught in a muddy riverbed. However, the situation has improved in recent days. Last year's severe drought caused severe apology for agriculture in northern Italy. People are generally worried that the situation will be worse this year.
* #####: Is it dried up in Europe?
The drop in the water level has dropped sharply? 
Throughout the northern Italy, serious droughts appeared: local media reported that the water level of Mal Jiao Lei Lake was only 38%of the usual usual. The snowfall in the Alps in Italy in recent months is only half of the previous years. Last year, it has just experienced the worst drought in the northern part of Italy in the past seventy years. This year's situation is not optimistic. People are worried that drought will also affect the local tourism industry.
* #####: Is it dried up in Europe?
The lowest water level in 30 years 
"I often walk by the river, how can there be no wet shoes." -Walking from Lake Garida to Sanbiagio Lake island, tourists' shoes are really wet now. Due to the serious insufficient rainfall, the water level in Lake, the largest lake in Italy has dropped to the lowest point in the past 30 years. The Italian government has also taken emergency measures to deal with serious water shortage.
* #####: Is it dried up in Europe?
"Climate change in step by step" 
The large river bed of the Rhine in the River in the River section of the River in Laifan, Germany has exposed. Due to insufficient precipitation and the sharp decrease in the amount of snow melting in the Alps, the Rhine's water level is much lower than usual. The German meteorological department said that this is the twelfth warm winter, and Meteorological expert UWEKIRSCHE told the German News Agency: "Climate change is still pressing step by step."

 The BBC Georgia cargo ship is anchoring at the port of City, Schtlison, Germany, and is repaired by the Strela Shipyard
(Voice of Germany Chinese) The Baltic International Shipping Association (BIMCO), headquarters headquarters in Bagoswed, headquarters near Copenhagen, reported on Wednesday (May 17): "From 2023 to 2032 More than 15,000 ships with more than 600 million tons are recycled. "According to BIMCO analysts Nielsrasmussen, this is more than double the recovery volume in the previous decade.
According to BIMCO, in the past ten years, 7,780 ships with 285 million tons in the world have been recovered, most of which were built in the 1990s. The association reports: "In the next ten years, the ships built in the 2000 will become the main source of recycling." And pointed out: "Compared with the 1990s, the ship's loaded tonnage built in the 1990s was more than twice that of the time at the time. It is expected that this will promote the growth of recycling and utilization. "
stricter carbon emissions regulations 
BIMCO believes that the current shipping industry is more stringent Regulations are also one of the reasons for increasing recycling demand. According to the association, the vast majority of ships are scrapped and re -processed in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in Asia. The international non -governmental organization's "Shipbreaking Platform" has condemned this approach to repeated cases such as environmental destruction, infringement of human rights, child labor, and death.
In fact, the harmless and safe demolition work of the environment should have been regulated globally. According to records, since 2009, there is an international agreement related to this, and Germany has approved the agreement in 2019. However, this so -called Hong Kong Convention (all named Hong Kong International Security and Harmic Environment Demolition Convention) will only be approved in at least 15 countries to join, and the total tonnage of the total commercial ships of the contracting parties will be Effective. BIMCO also announced that it would be optimistic after signing the convention in Bangladesh, saying that the effective date of the convention may soon come.

How can the US debt limit affect the global economy?

Description: Biden's economic adviser warned that even the "short -term" default will cause US economic losses to lose 500,000 jobs. The "long -term" default will cause the US GDP to plummet 6%, which may seriously weaken global trade and cause deep recession in other parts of the world.

 The US government's breach of contract may seriously weaken global trade and put in a deep decline in other parts of the world.
(Voice of Germany) If the US Congress fails to raise the debt limit before the end of the month, the US Ministry of Finance may not be able to pay government bills. What if this happens, how will the global economy be affected?
What is the upper limit of the US federal debt? 
The U.S. Congress first introduced the debt limit in 1917-refers to the national debt amount that the US Finance can bear. This measure means that the government no longer needs Congress to approve the issuance of each debt. The public debt bill was passed in 1939 and 1941.
Over the past 70 years, the upper limit of debt has been increased by 78 times, including 2011, when the United States failed to reach an agreement on the new upper limit at that time, the S & P lowered US sovereign credit rating and triggered an increase in loan costs.
In January of this year, the US government encountered the current debt limit of $ 314 trillion, but the Ministry of Finance took great measures to allow it to continue to provide funds for government activities.
The next critical period is the upcoming June 1st, and Congress must increase the upper limit again, otherwise the US government may start exhausted funds and arrears debt.
The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are conducting fierce confrontation. The Republican Party hopes that the White House agrees to comprehensively reduce public expenses and carry out other reforms.
Republican senior leaders met with US President Biden at the White House last Tuesday (May 9) and tried to resolve the dispute, but the talks did not make major breakthroughs.
What are the consequences of the US government's default? 
US Finance Minister Yellen warned last Sunday that the deadlock was actually "a gun pointed at the heads of the US and the US economy."
She said that if the debt limit cannot be increased, "financial and economic confusion will follow."
-This move will have a profound impact on the United States and the global economy.
The shortage of funds will force the US Treasury to save expenses in order to first pay debts and interest.
This may mean the salary of delay payments including tens of millions of public sectors, including teachers.
Social security and medical subsidies for older and disadvantaged Americans, including veterans, may also be suspended.
Although any non -repayment debt may be temporary, Biden's economic adviser warned that even the "brief" breach of contract would cause US economic losses to 500,000 jobs.
They believe that the "long-term" default will cause GDP to plummet 6%and cause tens of thousands of enterprises and about 8.3 million jobs to lose-almost as much as during the financial crisis in 2008.
In the worst case, the United States will have to completely stop lending before July or August, which will further impact the global financial market.
Investors will subsequently question the value of US bonds. For a long time, US bonds have been regarded as one of the safest investments and the cornerstone of the world financial system.
The US government's breach of contract may seriously weaken global trade and cause deep decline in other parts of the world.
More serious default will lead to a sharp depreciation of the US dollar, the chaos of exchange rates fluctuates, and pushes the price of oil and other commodities.
Global inflation is likely to rise again. Due to the lack of trust in the financial system, the supply chain problem that has been affected by the epidemic may be worse.
 ### What is the progress of the U.S. Party negotiations? 
The Speaker of the House of Representatives McCarthy and the Republican Party refused to reduce the budget in an incomplete reduction Essence
Republican's House of Representatives voted in late April to decide to reduce the proposed budget bill worth about $ 4.8 trillion. The bill will cancel the tax reduction and exemption of clean energy investment and overthrow Biden's plan to remove student loan debt.
However, the bill cannot be passed in the Democratic Senate.
Bynden has refused to negotiate so far, saying , Then he cut out the possible budget.
Biden hopes that Republicans will publicly promise that the United States will not breach contracts and be able to pay all the bills by continuous borrowing.
During Biden's tenure as Vice President in 2011, the Obama administration was forced to make pain to the Republicans to avoid breach of contract, and Biden hoped to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
Biden's budget plan will be reduced by nearly $ 3 trillion in ten years, mainly by increasing taxes to the rich-Republican Party is unlikely to agree with this.
After the talks between Bayeng and the senior leaders of the Republican and Democratic Party last Tuesday, McCarthy estimated that the two sides had only two weeks to reach an agreement that could be passed by Congress.
However, some analysts still believe that the expiration of the debt limit should be postponed to September 30 to avoid the risk of breach of contract immediately.
Can Biden quoted 14 amendments to the Constitution? 
Theoretically, the president can quote Article 14 amendments to the US Constitution. The amendment stipulates that "the effectiveness of the US public debt authorized by law ... must not be questioned."
Some analysts believe that Biden can argue that he has the constitutional obligation to avoid breach of contract, so he can break through the upper limit of debt and continue the expenditure that Congress has approved.
However, this move almost definitely leads to long -term legal disputes, which may disrupt the financial market.
Republicans warned that Biden could not act unilaterally and the solution must pass through Congress.
This week, a public sector worked and workers' unions sued the Minister of Finance Yellen and Biden, asking them to ignore the debt limit in accordance with the constitutional obligations.
The lawsuit tries to ensure that the income of workers' income will not be punished because of breach of contract and preferential repayment of debt. (Agence France -Presse, Germany)

 (Voice of Germany Chinese) The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned on Wednesday (May 17) that it is expected to be the hottest period of records in the next five years. The organization said that the comprehensive impact of greenhouse gas and El Niopy phenomenon (a natural weather phenomenon) will lead to soaring temperature from 2023 to 2027.
Petteritaalas, Secretary -General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: "It is expected that the El Nino phenomenon that will warmer the earth in the next few months will combine climate change caused by humans to push global temperature to unknown fields."
El Nino and Rana are climate models that promote extreme weather in many parts of the world. Generally, the El Niopy phenomenon will push up the global average temperature, while the La Nina phenomenon has a cooling effect.
"The World Meteorological Organization is issuing an alert, and we will temporarily break through the 1.5 ° C level in an increasingly frequent way." Tallas warned that this will have a "far -reaching impact" on health, food safety, water resources management and natural environment. Essence "We need to be prepared," the professor warned.
This new report was released before the World Meteorological Conference held from May 22nd to June 2nd. The conference will discuss how to strengthen meteorological services to support adapting to climate change.

 Russia has become India's largest crude oil supply country
(Voice of Germany) caused Western sanctions in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in Moscow, forcing Russia to sell crude oil at a discount, India has become the main buyer of Russia's oil in the past year. According to data from Vortexa, a ship tracking company, the oil imported from Russia in South Asian countries exceeded its historical record in April.
In fact, Russia became India's largest crude oil supply last last month, and its supply exceeded the sum of Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Before the outbreak of the Ukrainian war in February last year, India had rarely purchased from Russia.
However, as the sanctions cut off the connection between Russia's major banks and most Western payment systems, finding the way to pay Russian crude oil became a challenge. In the past year, Indian importers have been buying Russian oil and other products with India's rupee, but the restrictions on the currency initiated by the West means that Russian companies cannot convert rupees into currencies in Western countries such as US dollars or euros.
Russia is worried about a lot of rupees ** 
At the same time, the opportunity to buy discount crude oil has expanded India's huge trade deficit in Russia.
According to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India, in the first 11 months of fiscal 2022-23, India's imports from Russia were close to $ 4.1.5 billion, while exports were only $ 2.8 billion. This led Russian Petroleum Corporation and Banks to leaving billions of Rice in their Indian bank accounts-they are worrying about using this pile of cash.
"I think this situation will not last long," the New Delhi Observer Research Foundation(ORF)Researchers and Russian experts, Nandanunnikrishnan, told Germany, "If the two sides cannot solve this problem, it will not only affect the purchase of oil, but also affect all problems."
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov recently commented on the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Conference in Guoa, India. Bloomberg reported his speech: "We need to use this money. For this reason, these rupees must be transferred with another currency. Now we are discussing this issue."
The close relationship between India and Russia makes the West worry 
According to Bloomberg, the uncertainty of the payment mechanism also hinders India's weapons imports. New Delhi and Moscow have a long -term political and military connection.
India is the main buyer of Russian weapons. Although it has been working hard to make its military equipment diversified, in recent years, it has shifted more and more to the United States and France to buy it. According to Stockholm International Institute of International Peace, Russia has accounted for $ 8.5 billion among New Delhi's $ 18.3 billion in weapons imports. The two parties are also negotiating on a free trade agreement.
So far, Essence New Delhi has repeatedly voted for the United Nations' resolution on Moscow. However, it calls for a conflict through dialogue.
At the same time, Western countries are worried about strengthening the trade relations between India and Russia, because they are worried that this will destroy the severe sanctions effect on Moscow.
 The Russians are sorrowing how to use a lot of Indian rupees
Is RMB a solution? 
In addition to India's rupee, the UAE currency Diram and RMB are regarded as potential currency options to resolve the trade between India and Russia.
"Russia wants to have a currency that can be used to buy the goods needed for its economy ... The question is how to find this currency." UNINECIINANA said, "Russians will be happy to use RMB." He also It is pointed out that the bilateral trade volume of Russia and China is calculated by 100 billion US dollars.
In 2022, Russia and China trade reached a record high of 190 billion US dollars.
But Unikrigan pointed out that New Delhi will not be willing to allow trade settlement with RMB. Reuters also quoted Indian officials in March this year that the Indian government has demanded that domestic banks and enterprises avoid using RMB to pay Russia imported goods.
Another choice is to use the UAE currency Diram to pay India imported from Russia, but experts said that this may not be a practical long -term solution due to the sensitivity of the currency on Western sanctions.
Unikriganan emphasized that India and Russia can propose alternative solutions, such as effectively investing in rupees in joint ventures, and producing products that are useful or exported to other parts of the world in Russia. "There are many ways to use these huge sums of money, and the two parties only need to show the political will that can reach the agreement."

 Children usually start to learn English when they are 4 years old
(Voice of Germany) According to the recent research, South Korea is a country raising a child in the world with the highest cost in the world. This discovery explains the country's fertility rate and an imminent population crisis.
According to the Korean "Korean Daily", the annual research report of the nursery and population research think tank in Beijing has listed South Korea as a country with the highest cost of childcare. Its cost is 7.79 times that per capita domestic production value (GDP). This is equivalent to 365 million won (equivalent to 251,562 euros or $ 271,957).
Followed by Germany (3.64 times) and France (2.24 times).
At the same time as parenting expenses rose, South Korea, as the 10th largest economy in the world, was born in another direction. Data released in March show that the country's fertility rate is 0.78, which means that only 78 babies were born in the lifetime of every 100 women. This is the world's lowest fertility rate. Compared with South Korea ’s fertility rate in 2000, 1.48 decreased significantly. In 1980, South Korea's fertility rate was 2.82 and 5.95 in 1960. Experts warn that South Korea needs to maintain 2.1 fertility to maintain population stability without relying on immigrants.
 South Korea's fertility rate is the lowest worldwide
The biggest cost is extracurricular tuition class 
For Koreans, the biggest cost of a child comes from educational costs other than conventional public school education. "Korean Daily" pointed out that in 2022, It is equivalent to 524,000 won (361.53 euros) per child.
Han Yejing, a lawyer of a 31-month-old daughter, said: "South Korea is a society that pays attention to education. For most families normal."
Han Yejing told Germany that the tuition class was called "Hagwon" in South Korea. Children usually started to go to such schools at the age of 4 and usually learn English during playing.
She said: "This is currently a major trend of Parenting in Seoul. People spend a lot of money for these English kindergartens every month, because they think that children are easier to learn language when they are young, and this is a very important skill."
Han Yejing admits that when she meets with her friends or family, she often talks about the choice of education. Her cousin's daughter has just entered an English kindergarten recently.
Another factor decided to send their children to the extra -curricular tuition class was that there were a large number of mothers in South Korea, and the tuition class also provided the children with a place to take care of.
Although private kindergartens also provide sports, music or other art courses, they pay more attention to English and mathematics. Han Yejing believes that most courses are English and mathematics-the study of these subjects is to ensure that children enter good middle schools, and then they are good universities so that they can find good jobs in the future.
"A good private education outside the conventional public school is to ensure that the child gets good results and can enter the best university." Han Yejing said, "Entering a top university is important, it means a good job, ensuring that it is a good job to ensure that The success of life. "
Dr Park Sain-in, an economist at the National University of Seoul, also believes that a large part of Korean family income is used for education, but he does not believe that the impact of this "competition" on young people is positive.
"In my opinion, Korean education is too competitive, especially in college entrance examinations."

Since 1942, Jewish students have been dropped out of school -what is often faced to concentration camps and deaths.

Insufficient teachers 
One of the major problems facing elementary school today is insufficient teachers. It is estimated that by 2025, there are about 26,000 teachers. One of the reasons is: Compared to other school forms, elementary school teachers have low paid. Therefore, the attraction of choosing primary school education majors is not great.

### plunder of parents 
A Social Pioneer of the "Korean Daily" also accused the operators of the tuition class "using (parents) anxiety to plunder" and encouraged them to pay huge costs to keep up with the expectations of society.
The newspaper stated that parents have to pay for many years of additional tuition fees, "no wonder South Korea's birth rate is so low." Dr. Park Chengren has no children. He hopes that Korean society will gradually change, and no longer emphasize school learning, so that children have a more relaxed childhood.
"This will not happen soon, but I hope this is a change that may be seen one day in the future." He said, "I believe that good education is important, so that children can go to college and find good jobs, but many Koreans-including myself-I think the cost of private education has gone too far, and we need a better balance.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) China Internet Information Office (referred to as the Internet Information Office) released on Sunday (May 21) that the product of the US Semiconductor Corporation, Micron, "has more serious network security issues", which is for China. The supply chain of key information infrastructure constitutes a major risk and affects national security. Therefore, the online security review fails, Essence
According to the China Network Information Office, reviewing Micron is a "necessary measure to maintain national security" and said that foreign companies "as long as they comply with the requirements of Chinese laws and regulations", they are welcome to enter the Chinese market.
New measure may affect limited

Micron's production of DRAM and NAND flash chips, which has a competitive relationship with South Korea's Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Toshiba of Japan.
 The chip became the core of the US -China science and technology war. The picture shows the US President Biden signed an administrative order on a critical supply chain in February 2021, holding a microcroof chip in his hand.

The China WeChat public account announced on the evening of this Sunday. The review found that Micron ’s products have more serious network security issues, causing major security risks to the supply chain of key information infrastructure in China and affecting China’ s national security. Therefore, the Cyber Security Examination Office makes a conclusion that it does not pass the network security censorship in accordance with the law. It also said that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the "Network Security Law", operators of key information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing Micron's products.
Ms. Chen, a semiconductor industry who is unwilling to disclose her identity, said during the inquiry of this station on Monday (22nd) that the United States, Japan and other countries restricted high -end chips and some semiconductor materials to Chinese companies: "Micron is also executed in China that is also executed by China. US policies will not sell high -level nano -chip and high -tech to China, which are controlled by the US government. This time the Internet Information Office prohibits domestic companies from buying Micron's products. Micron's sales in China will decline, but Chinese companies buy Micron The cost of similar products will rise. "
Forbidden to buy similar products to similar products is more expensive 
Ms. Chen also said: "For example, the most common dynamic random access to memory, flash memory and other products are currently urgent needs in the industry. Now you need to buy from other foreign companies. The price may be more expensive. It may seem more than 'eight thousand' now. "
Agence France -Presse reported that Miguang issued a statement saying that the China Internet Information Office notified the above review conclusions.

When the reporter asked Meiguo if he would appeal, the Meiguo spokesman said: "We look forward to continuing to discuss with the Chinese authorities."
 Micron Technology Company(Micron Technology Inc., MU)(Reuters) [] Micron ranked sixth in the global semiconductor company last year. Last year's revenue reached 30.8 billion US dollars, of which about 10%came from China. However, analysts pointed out that many products sold in China are purchased by foreign manufacturers. At present, it is unclear whether the decision of the Cyberspace Office will affect these foreign buyers.
Forbidden Micron's sale in China to see it for domestic people 
Li Ang, who is concerned about the development of China's semiconductor industry, said in an interview with this station that Micron's key products have long stopped selling to China, so the ban in the Internet Information Office has no practical significance. He said: "People Americans have long said that they will not provide chips to China. If you say that before you say that in the United States, I think you (China) may be resisting him. It is just a posture, mainly because it is done See it to the people in the country, it gives domestic people a explanation. "
China needs to import a large number of chips from foreign countries to produce electronic products such as mobile phones, drones. Last year, China used to buy chips from foreign countries to hundreds of billions of dollars, which was the same as the amount of purchasing crude oil and natural gas.

 At about 3 pm on the 19th, Hari Budhamagar climbed to the top of Everest. After successfully reaching the summit, he had retreated to the base camp and would return to Kathmandu tomorrow.
The 43 -year -old Magar, who was in Afghanistan in Afghanistan in 2010, was unfortunately stepped on the Bridde of Gurkhas. Gurkha brigade is composed of the Nepalese who was recruited to the British army.
There are currently two mountaineers with amputation under their knees to the top of the Virgin Peak, namely Mark Inglis in New Zealand and Xia Boyu in China. The two completed feats in 2006 and 2018, respectively.
In the past, Magar, in addition to the rowing of Isle of Wight, has also climbed to the Mount TOUBKAL of Morocco and the Bennevis Mountain in Scotland.(Ben Nevis), Europe's Mont Blanc and other famous Yue.
Because Nepal has the laws that ban leg amputation and blind climbing, Margal has been unable to challenge the top of the Virgin Peak for many years.
When the Dirin peak climbing at 8849 meters in the year, the law had not yet taken effect. Under the pressure of Magal and others, the Supreme Court of Nepalese revoked relevant regulations in 2018.
Magar said before going to the base camp last month, "As long as you can adjust our lives due to time and local conditions, we can do anything we want to do. There will be no limit except the sky."
Margal uses "no legs, no limit" on his website as a promotional slogan.
Among the top 10 peaks of the world, eight are in Nepal. Every year, when the spring weather is warm and usually gentle, hundreds of climbers will visit.
Government Tourism Bureau official Bigyan Koirala said that this year's climbing season has nearly 450 climbers who have successfully reached the top of the Virgin Peak.
The Nepalese authorities issued 478 to foreign climbers this year, and each mountaineering permit cost is $ 11,000 (NT $ 337,300).
As most climbers need a guide, this year it continues until the climbing season in early June, and more than 900 people climbing the Virgin Peak will write a record.
This year's climbing season, 9 people have broken the Virgin Peak.

 Radio of Liberty Asia
Moderator: Hello everyone, this is "point of view", I am Tang Qiwei. Today's viewpoint, the guests we visited were Mr. Yan Jiaqi, a famous Chinese scientist in China. Mr. Yan Jiaqi was originally born in physics. In his opinion, the "Yuan History" of human society is a historical process that is not by accidental interference and follows the inevitable path and direction. As early as the early 1990s, Mr. Yan Jiaqi proposed the Federal China idea, hoping to provide a reasonable and possible choice for the future Chinese national structure. How should we look at the changes in contemporary China from "Yuan History"? Will the concept of Federal China split China as some observers worry? Let's listen to Mr. Yan Jiaqi's point together. 
Reporter: In the 1990s, you proposed to use federal methods to solve China's national problems. Your ideal is to hope that China will become a federal China?
Yan Jiaqi: The federal system can have many forms, which are the main body of mainland China. The Han part of it has the characteristics of the federal, but it can be closely connected together. This cannot be said to separate it. It is impossible to separate Jiangsu Province with Shanghai and separate Beijing and Hebei. It is one and Guangdong. It cannot learn the United States like the United States. But for Tibet, Xinjiang or Hong Kong, it can adopt many characteristics of the federal system, and it can also be called Federal China in name. I am such an idea. 
Reporter: Some opponents believe that the federal system is to split China. Your response?
Yan Jiaqi: The federal system is not split in China, the Federation system is to split China. I never agree with China to establish the Federation. Union is the union of many countries, and the Federation is a country. The United States is the federal country and Australia is a federal country. Therefore, the federal system must be compared. 
Reporter: But the United States used to be an independent state before the United States, and later united into a country, but China was originally a unified China. If ...
Yan Jiaqi: There is no need to copy people, how good China is, but it must admit it in essence. If China wants to be unified, it must be achieved in peace and unity. It is absolutely necessary to oppose. 
Reporter: Some observer said that many Chinese people do not like the Communist Party of China, but at the same time they do not want a four -point China. They believe that from the perspective of geopolitics, a split China is more in line with the interests of the West. I don't know what you will look at (this statement)?
Yan Jiaqi: It is very simple China will not split, and China will not become a cracked country. Because it is the 21st century, railway, transportation highway and economic connection make it impossible for China to split, hoping that it will not be split, and it is completely different from Russia. And it may also be a democratic China, Mongolia joined China, and Mongolia returned. This possibility exists completely. Therefore, China is facing a peaceful way to achieve China's unity in a peaceful way, but it is unreasonable to threaten Taiwan forces. 
Reporter: Some former U.S. officials pointed out that since the Mao Zedong era in 1949, China has a century -old plan that surpasses the United States to become the world overlord. I know you used to work for the highest level of the CCP power. What kind of observation do you have?
Yan Jiaqi: It is wrong to communism to spread communism in the world. This (ambition) has Mao Zedong, and Mao feels that Xi Jinping has inherited him. It should be said that Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao did not, but Xi Jinping had it again. This is an impossible thing to implement communism around the world, and it is a mistake in Marxist theory. The Chinese have not been fully recognized. As a big country, it is inevitable that it is necessary to rise in the world. It is impossible to not rise. It has 1.4 billion people, and China has some cultures that are different from the West. Civilization must coexist, different civilizations, and Confucian civilization can also play a good role in the middle of Christian civilization Islamic civilization. It is a civilized system in the middle of a harmonious coordination. So Confucianism can play a good role. 
Reporter: Some observers believe that even if China is a democratic country, from the perspective of geopolitical politics, it will also become an opponent of the United States. What about your observation?
Yan Jiaqi: This problem is very simple. Look at the historical history of the world. The relationship between the country and the country does not depend on democracy and democracy and the autocratic authority. The previous countries are not democratic and it has international relations. The first characteristic of the country is that it is a plant that has geopolitics and geopolitics is crucial. China and the United States have a Pacific Ocean, and the relationship with Mongolia with China is very different from North Korea, with different relations with Russia. The second country is an animal, what is the animal? It has some rationality. It is not as high as human rationality and is as high as humans. It has no feelings without human feelings, so the state puts national interests first. The existence of this contradiction is a good solution, that is, the relationship between Britain and the United States, and there are contradictions to solve it. 
Reporter: Recently, Xi proposed a slogan, which is Chinese -style modernization. The Chinese official explanation is that the modernization of Chinese -style is a myth that breaks modernization equivalent to Westernization. I do n’t know how you will compare the modern Chinese -style modernization of Chinese characteristics.
Yan Jiaqi: China has a modern way in science and technology. This is certain. China's development economy can develop, and it is related to the system that China has joined the World Trade Organization and absorbs the Western economic management system. It is also inseparable from the efforts of many Chinese economists. However, in the political field, China has reached the level of the Chinese Empire. Chinese politics is ancient, and China's economic science and technology have been on the road of modernization, but it has been hindered in these aspects of the Internet. Because it is hindered by politics, in fact, China's modernization has great obstacles. This obstacle does not belong to West belongs to itself. 
Reporter: After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Xi Jinping tried to play the mediation person between the Russian and Ukraine War. Recently, he has frequently shot international diplomatic order. How do you observe?
Yan Jiaqi: He is useless. His big problem is wrong, that is, it is very important to deal with international issues. To talk about credibility. The state's commitment cannot be changed, and government commitments can change government policies and change. The state's commitment to another country is the responsibility of the country, and the head of state represents the country. The formula of the joint statement of Hong Kong Sino -British is to eliminate this promise. 
Reporter: Now Xi Jinping has tried to be a mediation person in the Russian and Ukraine War, what impact will China's status in international geopolitics?Reporter: On the one hand, China is criticized by the international community in the Xinjiang issue on the one hand. On the other hand, we see that like many Muslim countries in the Middle East maintain a very good relationship with China. Therefore, some critics have pointed out that not following the democratic value of the West is the statement that runs counter to universal values. In fact, it is the continuation of the attitude of Western colonists. I don't know how you will respond?
Yan Jiaqi: This problem is an important issue for China. This universal value exists, and China also provides good universal value. Like Master Kong, do not do what he wants to do, this is a universal value. But this benevolence is not a universal value. Mencius said that it is the idea of the initiative to implement benevolence. Therefore, there are many good things in the thoughts of Master Kong, and we have always done this as a Chinese. Democracy has no distinction between East and West. What is democracy? Just look at the definition. Look at the meeting of the 3,000 people of the National People's Congress. Democracy is not democratic? It is not democratic. This is a basic fact. There are many different opinions in the U.S. Congress, splitting into different opinions, which is a manifestation of democracy. But as a decision -making efficiency, it is affected, but it prevents the occurrence of very large disasters. This is always a good thing for the democratic system and will not change. Democratic power is restricted by the government's power, the rights of the people are guaranteed, and the government's power comes from the people, but China does not have this. 
Reporter: You are a political scientist. You said that politics is a science studying the national non -political approach. You say that the less people care about politics, the better. Why?
Yan Jiaqi: I am not a political scientist. I understand a little politics. I was in the early studies of physics, and I believe in great physics. And when I go to the political field, my goal itself is to hope that a country is less politically. Therefore, I made a speech at the establishment of the Institute of Political Science. I said that the fundamental goal of political research in the Institute of Political Science is to pursue the path of non -politicalization of a country. What is non -political? The nationalization of the army is non -political, which is the first. In addition, judicial independence is also non -political, do not regard trials as a political phenomenon. China's trial has become politics, and this judicial independence is non -political. Chinese officials should not care about politics. Generally, he does it in accordance with the law and is called non -political, but government officials should care about politics. Politics means that he has a policy direction, or to Xi Jinping or Wen Jiabao. He has a different one, or he is biased towards the Democratic Party. This is a political appointment official, but most officials do not need to care about politics and work in accordance with the law. Now all officials (China) are concerned about politics. If they are not loyal to Xi Jinping, what should I do if they leave? Originally, officials, the civil servant system was like this. There are many fields of such fields. This is political science. Everyone in a country does not care about politics. This is a good country. Everyone cares about political issues. Everyone cares about politics. 
Reporter: Just now you said that you are not a political scientist, how would you define yourself?
Yan Jiaqi: I define myself that I am a scholar of Meta worldview. What is Meta? There are four META, the first Metaverse Yuan universe, and the second name is Metabolism. This is called metabolism. It should actually be turned into metabolism or metabolism. People who firmly believe in the history of the Yuan Dynasty. This Yuan History's Marx's historical view is wrong, and there is also a problem with Hegel's historical view. Higgel's Yuan history put Prussia first, and Marx's communism was first. Yuan History itself has its importance. The fourth Metaphysics, Metaphysics Chinese flipping and going to school. Now I want to write a book called "The World View of Schools", that is, the rigidity of the isolated and still rigidity of Mao Zedong, and I will look at the world like this now. This is a basic ability to treat human society and the development of China in the long run. Dialectics can only watch it for two days to watch for three days, three days, five days to watch, so I will think of hitting Taiwan. This is called Dialectics. This dialectical law is not good, there is no dialectics in the logic, and dialectics is a sophistry, so I never engage in natural dialectics. 
Reporter: I actually talked a lot just now. I also saw in your memory article. You said that you have not planned in the United States for a long time, and you always want to return to China in a few years. I know you can't go back to China now. I want to ask you that you still have this idea now. Do you want to return to China? And you have lived overseas for so many years. In fact, you also talked about it just now. What is your identity?
Yan Jiaqi: What is actually called civilization? Civilization is the biggest identity of a person's pursuit called civilization. The Islamic civilization of Christian civilization, the Confucian civilization, is the biggest and most large recognition of a person's pursuit. It is called civilization. This is not what I say, but Huntington said, so I have such a basic view of civilization. I don't agree with the view of benevolence. It is the foundation of authoritarianism, but I have a lot of Confucian things on my body, and I cannot throw it away. So my culture is still Chinese culture, and it still has the characteristics of Confucian culture. But I accept Christian culture at the same time, and I accept Christian culture. In fact, in this case, if when China was properly evaluated in June 4th, when Zhao Ziyang could get correctly evaluated, June 4th could flip the case. When the mother of Tiananmen was taken care of, I was willing to (no matter) how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old, how old is it? To return to my hometown, I want to see my loved ones, my sister I haven't seen for decades, I want to see my brother. My brother has just (dyed) the new crown virus died. I want to see my loved ones who do not care about politics Essence I miss my colleagues, and I have feelings for the Institute of Political Science, Academy of Social Sciences. I hope I will return to my land. But I did n’t hope in Xi Jinping's era, although I knew Wang Huning without any hope. I hope that after China changes, I want to take my poor wife back to my own hometown happily. I love the United States and China, France in the United States is good for us, I will always put it in my heart ... 
Moderator: In the memoir, Yan Jiaqi wrote: "‘ French poet Pooh in the 19th century said: “The strong created the incident, and the weak was subject to the incident that God arranged for him. Ordinary people obey their destiny, and only people with great character are fighting. 'I do n’t have a great personality, but I do n’t want to obey my destiny. I have been seeking truth and justice in my life. I must see the June 4th recovery of the truth. Be sure to see the sun in China. And hometown. "I am Tang Qiwei, thank you for watching, next show, we will be again!

Eagle is different.
Dragon is polite. You can see that this agricultural standard is standardized in your variety show!Go up to the weather and go down to the agricultural machinery, as long as you can see it, you can control it!
Eagle, are you boasting or scolding? We are very different. Our regulations are just to prevent pollution and protect environmental safety!
Dragon, we are also to maintain safety!
What is the safety of eagle?
Dragon National Security!Steady food to protect!
I am too naive. Is this environment unsafe, where is the unsafe of leadership?
The dragon is through!
Eagle can't stand it!In addition, after the agricultural management came up, he retreated to the forest and returned to the forest. The tens of billions of green projects were pushed down under a dismissal. It is also said that the faction of Chao Ling Xi can only be planted today, and it can only be planted tomorrow. Our laws and regulations are in the environment, but your regulations really exist for "managing people"!
What does Long Lao say, the Long family needs to control it!But don't talk about anyone, you don't have the festival in various places there. What supermarkets are not allowed to sell non -local agricultural products. Isn't it tossing the people?
Eagle we are grass -roots autonomy. The town council and the city council decide the law on their own. The local people agree that the government has no right to interfere!
Dragon is clever, and we are also placed at the grassroots level!Modern democratic countries are still similar!
The eagle face is quite big. We are power at the grassroots level. You are a civil servant of the grass -roots party state under power, and then transfer to the society with one hand. This can not only save time and effort and effort, but also solve the re -employment of Dabai before the social leisure. It's you!
Long Hey, the prize!For so many years, the advanced management technology we have accumulated always allows farmers to enjoy it!
The eagle coincides with "land reform", "hukou", "commune", "shelter", "temporary residence permit", "urban management", and "cleaning the low -end population". Do farmers miss it?
Dragon is not regrettable, this time there must be no one!

 (Voice of Germany) The clue of the survey from a 15 -meter sailing boat parked in the Baltic Sea called Andromeda. North Germany's Will Radio, West Germany Radio and South Germany, and Swedish newspapers Expressen, Poland's online magazine FrontStory and Danish Daily Berlinske conducted the survey.
A German television report said that multiple new clues point to Ukraine, which is extremely sensitive to politically.
Essence
"Leather Bag Company"? 
The joint investigation by German and international media partners shows that the above Polish company seems to be a travel agency. According to Polish business registration records, the company is located in a address of Warsaw, and the address has more than a hundred companies. A woman confirmed there that the company was indeed in the address, but she did not have a phone call from the company, only email.
The survey shows that the so -called travel agency does not have a website, and it seems that it may be just a bag company. Judging from the company's information, it has not been worth mentioning in the past few years. It was only a sudden income of 2.8 million euros in 2020, but the reasons for income were unknown.
According to the information found from the Internet, a blonde middle -aged woman is a company holder. On the phone, she hesitated that it was the company's holder, but hung up the phone without answering any questions. The same woman also appeared in the list of two other companies. But what is doubtful is whether she is just a "scarecrow".
A German TV report said that the intelligence department sometimes uses leather bag companies to cover up secret operations. Perhaps this travel agency is only used to rent and pay the Andromeda sailing boat. But the real situation cannot be confirmed.
 Beixi pipeline leakage location
A Ukrainian man 
Another clue from the sailing boat was that the person who leased the sailboat submitted a passport. One of them is a Romanian passport, named Stefanm. And this name does have their own, but according to the information of the German Federal Criminal Bureau, when the Beixi pipeline was blown up, it was almost certain that the person was in Romania. The reporter learned that German investigators believed that at the time, it was possible that a 20 -year -old Ukrainian man may be holding this passport. And the reporter learned the name of the person.
Pictures on social media show that the man is sometimes wearing military uniforms and obvious tattoos. He had served in Ukrainian infantry. A man of the man told the investigation reporter on the phone that the man was still serving in the army and sometimes called. But the relative said the man did not leave Ukraine last fall. Ukrainian officials have not responded to the investigation reporter's inquiry so far.
Other possibilities 
However, there are currently other theories for the truth of the Beixi pipeline. Some are equipped with small submarines or underwater drones.
A German TV report said, but so far, the German security department circle stated that there is no evidence to prove that these Russian vessels have indeed participated Essence At the beginning of the year, the German Federal Attorney General Peterfrank said that Russia was unable to confirm Russia's behind -the -scenes controller. But "the survey is still in progress."

 Director Director of WHO Tan Desai
(Voice of Germany). With the People's Republic of China obtained the power of China in the United Nations in 1971, the Republic of China government was forced to withdraw from the United Nations and the United Nations institutions including the World Health Organization. The 25th World Health Conference (WHA) in 1972 decided to formally replace the seats of the Republic of China in the World Health Organization by the People's Republic of China. Since 1997, the Republic of China has tried to re -participate in the World Health Organization and the World Health Conference in different names every year, but has been rejected by the WHO Secretariat. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was allowed to participate in the World Health Conference as an observer. But since 2017, This conference is no exception.
On Monday (May 22), the 76th World Health Conference General Affairs Committee and the plenary decision respectively, rejected the Taiwan Friendship St. Vinson and Greanine, Belis, Sverland and Tawaru. The proposal of "inviting Taiwan to participate in the WHO as an observer" was included in the agenda.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry: Only the election government in Taiwan can represent 23.5 million people in Taiwan 
Regarding this result, the Taiwan Foreign Affairs Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a statement issued on May 23. "" China has repeatedly regarded politics to the world's health and security public interests, which harmed the relevant practices of the people's health human rights. The arrogance has made proper arrangements for Taiwan's participation in global health affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has spurned the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The people; the health human rights of the Taiwanese people are guarded by the Chinese government, and the Chinese government has no right to work. "
On May 21, Xue Ruiyuan, the Minister of Health and Welfare, said at a event organized by the Geneva News Club, stated that "excluding Taiwan outside the WHO has not only endangered the health rights of 23.5 million people in Taiwan, but also severely destroyed WHO's WHO Organization to realize the efforts of national health. He warns that excluding Taiwan outside the WHO will hinder the quickly and effectively sharing information, and this information is necessary to prevent or effectively deal with the next popular threat. He is worried that Taiwan is worried about Taiwan. It will become the gap in the international epidemic prevention system that will be popular in the next time, and "has a terrible impact on the entire world." According to Taiwan media reports, Xue Ruiyuan led the WHO Action Team to visit Switzerland on May 19th. Officials.
China Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 'International Epidemic Prevention System Gaps' is nonsense 
"Dipping State" engaged in Taiwan -related proposals. "Before the opening of the conference, nearly a hundred countries specifically let the WHO and issued a statement to show that they adhered to a Chinese principle and opposed the position of Taiwan's participation in the WHO."
The spokesman also said, "the Central Government of China attaches great importance to the health and well -being of Taiwan compatriots. Under the premise of a China principle, it has made proper arrangements for participating in global health affairs in Taiwan. The notification of the epidemic has exceeded 500 times. In the past year, health experts in Taiwan have been approved to participate in 24 batches of 26 batches of technical activities in WHO. There is a contact point for the International Health Regulations in Taiwan to obtain and report the information of emergencies in time. The gap in the international epidemic prevention system is simply nonsense ... We once again advise the DPP authorities that public opinion cannot be contrary to the fire, and we must not help themselves when playing fire.
Washington warning 
Washington has recently issued warnings on the WHO's exclusion of Taiwan. The United States delegation in Geneva tweeted on May 20, saying: "As we continue to cope with new health threats that appear around the world, Taiwan isolate Taiwan outside the 76th World Health Conference ... Tolerant global public health cooperation. "
In this regard, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs severely warned on May 22 that "China also urged individual countries to do not understand the confusion, stop politicalization of health issues, stop using Taiwan issues to interfere with the Chinese internal affairs, and stop 'Taiwan system is stopped by Taiwan system.

 Data photo: Chinese rights protection lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife Xu Yan Twitter/Yu Wensheng's wife Xu Yan @xuyan709 After more than a month of disappearance of Chinese rights protection lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife Xu Yan, the family members officially received the authorities notice that the two were arrested for their provocation. The informed person revealed that the official could not pass the annual inspection of the lawyer and could not represent the case of the Yu Wensheng couple.
* * *[ Foreign Minister's visit to China Yu Wensheng and his wife were detained by many rights protection lawyers.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gf-04172023070738.html)Chinese rights protection lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife Xu Yan disappeared after being forcibly brought to the police station in Beijing in mid -April. According to different sources of sources, the two have been approved by the police with a provocative trouble, and the authorities have sent people to notify Yu Wensheng's brother.
Yu Wensheng friends: Family members believe that they can not speak or find a lawyer to be released, but in exchange for the arrest notice 
Yu Wensheng, who was inconvenient to disclose his identity, told the station that when the police took Yu Wensheng's husband and wife last month, they told their family members that as long as they did not find a lawyer and did not speak out, the two were closed or can go home for 37 days. Brother Yu Wensheng was waiting for news from other places to Beijing last week, but he received the police notice on Sunday (May 21) and officially approved Yu Wensheng and Xu Yan.
Yu Wensheng, who is not convenient to disclose his name: "As far as I know, after Yu Wensheng was taken away, he had a greater resistance to the authorities. When his brother knew that the husband and wife of Yu Wensheng had been arrested together, he had expressed unacceptable, but was being police. No, his brother tried to take a picture of the arrest notice and was also stopped by the police. The family members of Yu Wensheng now need to find a lawyer to help, but many lawyers have been warned by the authorities that the family members do not know how to deal with it. "
Inspector: The official will warn the lawyer who cannot pass the annual inspection threat to the case that the lawyer cannot represent Yu Wensheng's husband and wife 
Mr. Shi, a person familiar with the matter, said that during the arrest of Yu Wensheng and Xu Yan, the authorities not only warned their families that they could not speak or find a lawyer, and also warned that lawyers and law firms that might be possible for the case through different methods.
Mr. Shi: "Without asking their children to find a lawyer to sign the attorney, the police also said that Yu Wensheng didn't want to ask a lawyer. Xu Yan had asked two lawyers. Later, the police went to find a law firm to put pressure on the director. Beijing The Justice Bureau also pressured, saying that this year's law firm suspended annual inspections and needed to be rectified, but whether the annual inspection was suspended in the end, it is not clear now. You can not know until early June. "
** Yu Wensheng's friends approved the authorities to arrest the couple's two -person house under house arrest.
Another friend of Yu Wensheng, Mr. Qin, said that he was worried about their situation and even worried about Yu Wensheng's adult son. He said that for more than a month when Yu Wensheng's husband and wife were disappeared, their sons have been strictly taken care of and are not allowed to contact others. Friends want to visit, and their parents take care of them. Mr. Qin criticized that the approach to the official arrest of the couple at the same time was unreasonable.
 Chinese rights protection lawyer Yu Wensheng took a photo with his wife Xu Yan (Twitter/Yu Wensheng's wife Xu Yan@xuyan709) [] Mr. Qin: "I don't talk about Chinese law anymore, because the law is not respected by them. For the arrests of husband and wife, they may feel that one of them can be caught, and the other may be an appeal outside to save people who enter prison. This effort will bring some noise, but is this noise enough to fear them? This approach is to completely destroy the family, and he has such a small child. No one takes care. At least he should consider it. For the protection of children, the continuous breakthrough of this kind of bottom line is wrong. "
Overseas lawyers refer to the official who is hard -stopd to intervene or have been tortured with Yu Wensheng's husband and wife. 
Wang Qingpeng, a lawyer who followed the situation of Yu Wensheng, who followed the situation of the Yu Wensheng, said that the authorities were concerned about whether the authorities had prohibited the lawyer's acting case and whether the husband and wife of Yu Wensheng had been tortured.
Wang Qingpeng: "The authorities will worry about acting cases, and will reveal Yu Wensheng's situation inside, which has attracted the attention of the international community. Many lawyers have received warnings and cannot represent the case of Yu Wensheng. In view of the lawyer Yu Wensheng, before the lawyer Yu Wensheng was before The torture he received, as well as many lawyers such as Xie Yang, Wang Quanzhang, Chang Weiping and Zhou Shifeng, were treated by torture. We have reason to believe that Yu Wensheng and Xu Yan may be treated in it. More outside attention and rescue. "
Wang Qingpeng said that now only through Yu Wensheng's brother, he knows that the two are arrested for provocative trouble. From now on to the trial, the authorities may change the charges of accusations and make them worry about the heavier punishment. The situation is worrying.
Wang Qingpeng: "According to Chinese laws and regulations, the crime of provocation will generally be sentenced to less than 5 years in prison, detention or control. At present, Wang Aizhong has been sentenced to 3 years in prison for provocation and may be as a reference. For example, the crime of instigating the subversion of state power has no way to predict, but the current domestic situation is worrying, and there will be more serious situations. "
Wang Qingpeng said that recently, the authorities have upgraded the surveillance and pressure on 709 lawyers such as Li Heping, Wang Quanzhang, and Zhou Shifeng, but it is not clear that the action is only targeted at 709 lawyers or extensive rights protection. She urged the outside world to pay attention to human rights defenders who were arrested in China, and believed that the voices of overseas could put pressure on the authorities and reduce the possibility of torture to the arrested people.

 The total investment in Germany has been announced in foreign countries to US $ 25 billion, and most of them come from the US semiconductor processing company Intel (Intel)
(Voice of Germany Chinese), despite the energy crisis, the level of foreign investment attracted by Germany is still stable, thanks to a strong interest from the United States, Britain and Turkish companies. In the past year, there were 1,783 new registered branches in Germany and extended business in Germany. Although this decreases by 23 than the total amount in 2021, it is 101 more than in 2020.
Roberthermann, general manager of Federal Trade and Investment Agency, told Reuters on Monday: "In view of the current unfavorable situation -Ukraine War, Energy crisis, and sequelae of epidemic, it is successful."
This is also reflected in foreign companies' investment in future technology -such as semiconductor industry, battery manufacturing and recycling industries. About 15%of international companies hope to set up production lines in Germany or conduct research and development.
The countries that have the most investment in Germany are still the United States, and 279 investment projects come from US companies. "This is a phenomenon worthy of attention. After all, after the United States introduced the so -called" InflationReDuction Act ", it strongly supports local investment," Herman pointed out.
The second and third ranking is Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with 208 and 170 investment projects. "Both countries do not belong to the European Union, but they hope to stand in the European Union market, and often choose Germany as a foothold."
"The new crown epidemic must have a certain impact on this," Herman said. During the implementation of strict zero -epidemic prevention policies in China, business travel between China and Germany was almost impossible, which has created difficulties for enterprises to achieve transactions, which will cause project progress to delay or even hinders.
Turkey ranks fifth with a record of 139 investment projects.

These new jobs created in German investment projects reached 33,500, an increase of about 10%. The announced total investment has reached US $ 25 billion, most of which come from American semiconductor processing company Intel. However, Herman also pointed out that even if this investment is planted, the remaining total investment is 8 billion euros, which is 1 billion euros than the level in 2021. He said, "This is a very good number."
In terms of attracting investment, the channels of renewable energy have become increasingly important, such as wind and solar energy.
"Whether it is Microsoft, Apple, or a smaller data center operator or battery manufacturers like Northvolt -renewable energy is an important reason for them to choose." Achimhartig said, In 2022, the proportion of German renewable energy in total energy consumption increased to 46%. By 2030, this proportion will increase to at least 80%.
In contrast, the lack of land area is a disadvantage of Germany. "The availability of the factory area is a problem." Herman, the general manager of the Federal Trade and Investment Department, pointed out that large companies like Intel or Tesla in Germany often need to cover 100 hectares of land or even larger entire land, and while, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and a larger entire land, and larger, the entire land, and the entire land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the entire land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger land, and the larger, the entire land, and the larger land,,,,,, Such industrial land, especially in western Germany, is almost impossible. The scarcity of professional and technical talents is not a factor to prevent enterprises from investing in Germany, "because all European countries have this problem," experts Haltich pointed out.

 Ten teachers in Sanmen Gorge in Henan protested that the news of no wages and preparations was also popular on the Internet recently. Weibo
The three -year epidemic has hit the Chinese economy, and the issue of labor rights and interests has become increasingly prominent. According to the statistics of labor organization, China has erupted at least 130 waves this year, more than three times that of 2022. At the same time, there are ten teachers from Sanmenxia, Henan, to protest without wages and preparations, and have recently circulated on the Internet. Some experts pointed out that China is entering the epidemic tide "new era".
After the epidemic, China Change: Public Opinion is changing On May 17, workers at a fresh air factory in Xiamen, Fujian broke out. This is one of the nearly 30 workers' protests this month.
With China's abandonment of zero and zero measures and reorganization of factories, the number of strikes across the country has also surged at an alarming rate. According to the non -governmental organization "China Labor Communication(CLB)"Statistics, in the first five months of this year, at least 130 factory strikes in China have occurred, which is more than three times the whole year of 2022. The organization also estimates that this accounts for only 5% of all collective labor litigation incidents in China. -10%.
The British "Guardian" also pointed out that most of the Chinese tide is a small scale. Because there are no official statistics, the statistics of "China Labor Communication" outline the outline for the strike in China.
At present, the political relations between the United States and China are constantly deteriorating, which is also reflected in the economy. Chinese officials conducted monthly surveys from 3,000 factories showing that in April, all 13 economic activities indicators including new orders and prices declined. At the same time, in April, the "added value of industries above designated size" increased by only 5.6%year -on -year, far lower than the 10.6%increase in market expectations.
The fundamental reason for most of China's strikes is money. Due to the shortage of funds, many factories have adopted the practice of not paying or arrears of workers' salary, and even trying to find ways to dismiss workers without paying the dismissal fee, or move the job to the place where the workers cannot go.
The Guardian quotes Elli Friedman, a professor at the School of Labor Relations at the University of New York(Ie friedman)It is said that China seems to be entering the "new era" of the "post -epidemic" factory this year.
Ironically, the Chinese Communist Party is known as a representative of the working class, but it does not allow the existence and operation of the independent union. All Chinese workers have the right to join the union, but they must belong to the official institution of the China Federation of Trade Unions. JeffreywasSserStrom, a professor at the History Department of the University of California, also pointed out: "This is the same as a communist system that supports consumerism, it is ironic."
In addition to workers' strikes, Chinese public institutions also frequently broke out. Recently, a collective hunger strike and related photos of 34 teachers in Sanmenxia City, Henan Province have been circulating on the Internet. According to the protests, these teachers participated in the teachers' recruitment examinations directly under Sanmenxia City in August 2019, and passed the complete examination procedures, and were admitted to the municipal direct -office teacher after being qualified. In the past four years, these teachers have carefully fulfilled their teachers' work, but they have not been implemented so far. Even labor contracts have not been implemented, and wages, social insurance, medical insurance, and provident funds have not been implemented.
 
However, the staff of the duty room of the Sanmenxia Education Bureau told the "Red Star News" that the preparation and related treatment issues of 34 teachers are still being solved. The relevant procedures are being advanced, and other circumstances are inconvenient to disclose.

 EU and Chinese banner Associated Press picture Not long ago, I went to Denmark to participate in the Go Benhagen Democratic Summit and went to Germany by the way. In these two countries, I visited some politicians, think tank researchers and civilians related to the formulation of European policies in Europe. Wherever I go, I can hear such a voice: Europe's policy of China is changing, but it is currently at the crossroads and is confirming the new development direction. We can also understand the meaning of this sentence: European countries generally recognize that in the face of Xi Jinping's global expansion situation, the Western countries have indeed been adjusted in the past two or three decades of China in the past two or 30 years, but how to how to adjust it, but how to how to adjust it, but how to how to adjust it, how can it What is the strength of adjustment and adjustment, and where the direction of adjustment is, is obviously hesitant for many European countries. This can be seen at this year's G7 meeting.
After the three -day meeting of Hiroshima, Japan, on May 20, the leader of the Seven major industrial countries issued a joint statement, which is the "Hiroshima Vision". In the statement, a warning of China's military -oriented acts in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, reiterating the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is an indispensable part of the international community's security and prosperity, urged peace to resolve cross -strait issues, and resolutely oppose the status quo on one -as -the -way change with force and coercion. The British Financial Times pointed out that the statement is the strongest condemnation issued by G7 to China to respond to the threat of Beijing. This shows that European and American countries' vigilance of the CCP's global expansion has achieved consensus. This consensus is a direction at the crossroads.
But at the same time, what we see is that the statements in economic issues seem to show a completely different trend from international security issues. The statement of the seven major industrial states proposed the economic security issues from China, but the method is "reducing risks" rather than the "decoupling" advocated by many scholars. At the same time, the statement also called on China to "maintain a stable and constructive relationship" with China. And look forward to "a China that complies with international rules and grows in line with global interests." Frankly speaking, such a cognition is actually in the past in the past, hoping that the CCP can abide by the rules of the game is a wishful performance. The statement on economic issues is obviously the result of a compromise between Europe and the United States, because the relevant positions in the United States and Japan are relatively tough, and the comments published by British Prime Minister Sunak after the summit warned that China is global security. The biggest challenge of prosperity, and China has the means and attempts to reshape the world order, which is obviously different from the theme of the statement. In other words, EU countries led by France and Germany have a large differences with the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom in terms of policies against China, and the result is that the latter has made a concession to some extent.
The reason for this is complicated. First of all, the most concerned about European countries at present is the Russian and Ukraine War. This is understandable, because the crisis is at their doorstep. For this greatest concern, many European countries hope that China can be used as a mediation person. Therefore, the pace of adjustment of China policy has obviously paused. Secondly, I think European countries are very confused. They still have the old Cold War thinking, which is very vigilant for Russia, but always feel that Chinese behavior will be different from the former Soviet Union and today's Russia. At the same time, EU countries still have European and American complexs. Not long ago, the French President Macron's speech on not following the footsteps of the United States is the representative. I think that for the challenges from China, they do not know, but they can't find a better way to deal with it. They simply buried their heads in the sand, pretending not to see it, and bypassing this topic.
In my opinion, some major European countries still have some fantasies about the CCP, and they are still very hesitant to decoupn with the CCP. There are interests in interests and cognitive errors. But I believe that the real morning and evening will force them to face this topic. I also believe that once they are forced to face this topic, they have no choice but to stand with the United States and Japan. In other words, their awakening still needs time.

 On May 10, 2023, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, led the prime minister Li Qiang and other senior officials to inspect Xiong'an New District. (Video screenshot/CCTV)
On May 10, 2023, Xi Jinping appeared in Xiong'an, and he hugged and hugged. The news itself is surprising. Because, as we all know, the so -called Xiong'an New District has become one of the major rotten projects in Xi. Xi Jinping has no taboo and publicly appeared in this abandoned place full of weeds? What is even more surprising is Xi Jinping's speech. Not only did he not acknowledge Xiong'an's failure at all, but he also praised himself: "In 2017, I came to Xiong'an for the first time and stood on a field plan. In, from scratch, from the blueprint to the real scene, a high -level modern city is rising, which is a miracle. "
Small 800 billion!Which land can't smash a new building? Even in the desert, Gobi Beach, and no man of no one, you can simply hit a large high -rise building -the so -called high -level modern city, commonly known as "ghost city" (such as Ordos, Inner Mongolia). What miracles are at all?
Xi Jinping also said: "The functional positioning of the Xiong'an New District is the first to dissolve the concentrated bearer of Beijing's non -capital functions. This is the original intention and mission of building the Xiong'an New District." The locals all said that this was a layman. Because Beijing is the capital, and the establishment of Xiong'an is to relieve Beijing's capital or some capital functions; as for non -capital functions, it is economic activity, people's livelihood guarantee and social space that every city has. Citizens also need to work and eat.
When it comes to many units and millions of people in Beijing and the relocation to Xiong'an, Xi Jinping said: "You can't rely on your own or evil, you need to move. . It can not be added by the way to set up a second -level unit in Beijing and other methods. "
What is the collective good and evil behind Xi Jinping's decision -making? If there are collective good and evil, then many units and millions of people refuse to migrate, isn't it the collective good and evil itself? And the so -called "good and evil", Xi Jinping's decision to make his head is precisely his personal "self -ordered", which can not represent any collective good and evil.
Xi Jinping's words seemed to make some reason in the small circle. In addition, no one dared to return to his mouth, which caused the effect, as if he was authoritative and mastered the absolute truth. But carefully weighing, but just: abnormal people say abnormal words. Personal expansion and head fever. Not only is it out of reality, but also from reality.
Xi Jinping claimed that the construction of the Xiong'an New District was a "millennium plan", and did not say what is so defined? Is there any Xi Jinping, Xi Jiajun and the Communist Party after a thousand years? Just say how much do you need to invest in this millennium project? Party media revealed: 3 billion trillion!It is now 800 billion yuan. It's just a zero, and it has to be smashed.
It was ten years in the Xi era. It was precisely the most lack of money after Mao Zedong. The overall economy declined, and all provinces and cities and autonomous regions bankruptcy; civil servants were reduced in salaries, teachers' wages were arrears, and older white -haired elderly people were cut off for medical insurance; foreign investors have evacuated one after another. , The production line and the supply chain transfer to other countries, foreign exchange reserves void; Chinese society has entered a high unemployment, and the younger generation generally lie flat ... Just when the most money is lacking, it actually has to continue to build a huge sum of money. The Xiong'an of the Internet!
Can't help but remind people of the Qin Dynasty and Qin Shihuang. After unifying the world, we must build a huge project, the Great Wall and the Afang Palace, and do not hesitate to exhaust the human resources and financial resources of the world.
Qin Shihuang was self -superstitious and thought that since he could attack the Six Kingdoms and unify the world, there was nothing that could not be done, because there was nothing more difficult than attacking the six countries, including longevity. As a result, the Afang Palace had not been completed, and Qin Shihuang had already brought back to the West. The Afang Palace was torch and turned into ashes by the uprising. The Great Wall has become a thousand -year -old decoration to marry clothes for others (other dynasties). The Qin Dynasty itself died, only fifteen years before and after.
Xi Jinping has self -superstition and thinks that since you can win the victory of power struggles, there is no incomparable thing, because it is not more difficult than flattening the party (that is, the rush to seize power, the party's power, the uniqueness, the power of one person)) The incident, so it was forcibly clearing the zero -sealing city, strengthening the Xiong'an, strong engaging in the Beijing Stock Exchange, Qiang Lai toilet project, and pushing the Belt and Road Initiative ... Xi Jinping said the thousand -year plan, and he had the taste of Qin Shihuang. Although, no one thinks he has Qin Shihuang's dominance and prestige.
Xi Jinping inspected Xiong'an and brought three members of the Politburo Standing Committee: Li Qiang, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and the Xi family. It seems to finally realize the world. It is rare to bring three members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Among them, psychology has both derogation and high. Degraded Li Qiang, Cai Qi, and Ding Xuexiang, which caused their status to shrink the status of the Standing Committee. The subtext: The Standing Committee of the Politburo today is Xi Jinping's follow -up. Xi Jinping has been raised, and today's general secretary is beyond the members of the Standing Committee, and it is no longer a one -person super leader. It is no longer a collective leader of Qilong Water or Kowloon Water.
However, the logic of psychology is that they have degraded others and reduced themselves. Xi Jinping thought that he was already at the peak state of "it will be the top of the top of the mountain". I don't know? In the world's population, Xi Da has become a classic figure of "Wu Dalang's opening".

After the game, he also said in an interview: "As a Chinese, I am very proud and proud!"

He said that the Taiwan authorities said that Taiwan's "democracy and freedom" and "freedom of behavior" were "free" in various aspects. "But is there really freedom of speech? Does he agree with the sound of opposition? If he agrees, then he should not be able to stop us from speaking or doing this."

 (Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Business Daily" commented that the summit may become an important turning point for Western policies for Western China in the 21st century. This article entitled "The Turn Point of the West to China Policy" wrote:
"Compared with the tough wording of all parties before the same summit, the description of the China policy in the summit statement may be too gentle, balanced, and blurred. The stressful relationship between the host Japan and China may be one of the reasons why this summit focuses on Chinese issues. For speaking, Western democratic countries have never condemned Beijing's military and economic expansion with such a clear wording, and formulated the basic outline of common strategy to China under the theme of "risk", reaching consensus on this issue on this issue The speed of speed is shocking.
Strengthening the statement of foreign investment control and protecting sensitive technologies marked the fundamental change of Western trade policy. For China, it is a red cloth, [] On the issue of dealing with China, a new realism is occupying the upper hand in the West. The seven western nations have finally realized that the era of globalization has ended, and an era with the main line with each other in the West and China is coming. The world economy will not become more open in the future, but will become more blocking. This new era will be more uncomfortable than the era of open markets. But it also provides opportunities for the West. China is becoming an increasingly destructive country, which is not only manifested in intimidation of Taiwan or sovereign disputes in the East China and South China Sea. "
Comments point out that the new strategy for China will never achieve the expected results in the short term, but Western countries do not have better choices.
"Of course, the new strategy will not be smooth. [] Essence The metaphor of Su Liwen, President Biden, is just right. He said that the seven Western countries are the "Guiding Committee of the Liberty World". The Seventh Kingdom Group is evolving from a debate to a political machine that promotes Western decision -making. At the beginning of the G20 mechanism, some people asserted that G7 was in the end of this life. But now, the G7 may have become unprecedentedly important. "
 Seventh Kingdom Group: We have no intention to hinder the development of China's economy.
For the G7 summit just closed in Japan, the Frankfurt Report published a comment:
"Some of the expressions in the statement are bland, but their significance is not small. The Seventh Kingdom Group's statement stated that the goal of the Seventh Kingdom Group's policy is not to harm China. 'We have not intentionally prevented China's economic development and economic progress. 'Especially Americans have also participated in this statement, which is particularly noticeable. After all, the export ban on chips and chip manufacturing equipment introduced by the United States is precisely because of this purpose: to prevent China from replacing the United States as the number one economic power in the world. Factory policy. Whether it will be eased in the future still needs to be further observed. But the corresponding signal has been issued.
It is hoped that Germany's upcoming Chinese strategy will continue this spirit. It is correct to reduce dependence on China and drugs in the fields of raw materials and drugs. Due to national security considerations, the significance of doing so in Germany is strictly reviewing the Chinese state -owned enterprises in Germany. However, the German government should never go to the pressure of the United States and isolate China with high -tech products in the West. Because this does not meet the fair game principles in international trade. "

Which countries are prohibited from TIKTOK? What is the reason?

 (Voice of Germany) Tiktok has more than 1 billion users around the world, but in many countries, it is considered a security risk. Essence Although Beijing has denied it, the short video platform is still restricted in some countries.
U.S 
The U.S. government under Biden banned its staff from using the app on government equipment. More than half of the federal state, as well as the US Congress and the military also have such regulations. What is currently reviewing is whether the platform can be banned throughout the United States.
Essence Since 2024, Tiktok will no longer be allowed there to "prevent citizens from being monitored by the Communist Party of China." However, users who have installed the APP will continue to use them.
Canada 
Canada is banned from using TIKTOK on government equipment. The reason is that the video app can get a lot of content on the mobile phone. However, there is no evidence to date that the secret information of the Canadian government has been stolen.
 The concerns about the security of Tiktok are the reasons why most countries restrict the use of the APP
Europe 
The three most important agencies in the European Union: the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Parliament banned employees from using Tiktok on work equipment at the end of February 2023, because they are worried that the Chinese government may obtain data on the equipment. The European Parliament is also prohibited from using Tiktok on private devices.
Since then, many EU countries have followed this regulation that government personnel are prohibited from using the app on work equipment. These countries include Belgium, Estonia, Latvia and the Netherlands.
In Germany, the federal government has no principled regulations to use Tiktok on work phones, but government equipment neither pre -installed the app nor download.
, Tiktok is prohibited on the working phone.
In addition to banning civil servants from using TIKTOK on work equipment, France also prohibits the use of Twitter, Instagram, Netflix and game CandyCrush. The reason is also the lack of security and concerns about data protection. According to Agence France -Presse information, this affects 2.5 million civil servants in France.
Ireland recommends that civil servants do not use Tiktok on their working phones.
Denmark banned the staff of the Ministry of Defense from using the platform.
The Swedish military prohibits the platform on work equipment.
Non -European member states Norway prohibit government personnel from using Tiktok or Telegram on work equipment because they are worried about the stolen information.
Non -EU countries Britain also prohibits the use of Toktok on government mobile phones, because the "sensitive government data must be ranked first." The country's public law radio institution BBC also told employees: "If you are not for Tiktok for business reasons, you should delete Tiktok." However, BBC itself has several channels on the platform.
Oceania 
New Zealand also restricts the use of Tiktok in March. All devices that can access the parliamentary network are prohibited from using the app.
The reason is that the APP collects a large amount of user data, which constitutes a significant risk for security and privacy.
Asia 
Afghanistan has completely banned Tiktok since 2022. In 2021, Taliban, who came to power after the country withdrew from the country, came to power, the platform made young people go astray.
Disabast 
India has banned the platform since 2020. At that time, the Sino -Indian army conflicted at the Himalayan dispute border, and 20 Indian soldiers died. Soon after that, India announced the ban saying the APP endangered India's sovereignty and security. The Indian video platform MOJ and Josh were replaced by great success.
Jordan has banned Tiktok from December 2022. At that time, the country broke out due to the sharp rise in fuel prices, causing a police officer to die and more than 40 security forces injured. A government spokesman accused the platform of release a large number of videos "call for murder and chaos". It is reported that Tiktok and the Jordan government are still in negotiations.
tiktok in Taiwan: The unified "pioneer" on both sides of the strait?

 President Tsai Ing -wen hosted the "governance for seven years, re -defined Taiwan, and let the world see the press conference in Taiwan again. Provided by the Presidential Palace of Taiwan Taiwan's president Tsai Ing -wen recently delivered a seventh anniversary of the governance, reiterating that "war is not an option" on cross -strait issues. As the Taiwan elections approach and the threat of the Beijing authorities have become increasingly upgraded, the prospects of the situation in the Taiwan Strait have attracted public opinion.
English 520 Speech: War is not an option * 
On May 20, the president of Taiwan Tsai Ing -wen was in power for seven years. Tsai Ing -wen held a press conference for this and delivered a speech. In the speech, when Tsai Ing -wen talked about the issue of cross -strait issues, it emphasized that peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait is a global consensus: "Faced with Chinese civil attack and martial arts, the people of Taiwan are calm and unreasonable. It is not an option. No one can change the status quo in unilaterally in a non -peaceful way. Since my administration, the government has a firm position. Will not yield under pressure. "
Cai Yingwen pointed out that although Taiwan is in risk, it is definitely not a risk manufacturer, but a responsible risk controller. At the same time, she also called on cross -strait differences through dialogue. Tsai Ing -wen said: "Peace is the only option between cross -strait. To maintain the status quo as the largest number of constraints is the key to ensuring peace."
Bonnieglaser, Director of the Indian Marshall Foundation (GMF) in the Washington Think Rugates, told reporters in an interview with this station on Monday that Tsai Ing -wen's speech consistent with the policies performed in the past 7 years: "Cai Yingwen's policy It has always been very clear. She pursues maintaining the status quo of the Taiwan Strait, strengthening the relationship between the United States of Taiwan, seeking more international support for Taiwan, and strengthening the Taiwan economy. She is very successful in many aspects. "
 President Tsai Ing -wen hosted the "governance for seven years, re -defined Taiwan, and let the world see the press conference in Taiwan again.(Provided by the Presidential Palace of Taiwan) Scholars: The lack of communication mechanism on both sides of the strait is in Beijing 
In the speech, Tsai Ing -wen appealed that the two sides should solve differences through dialogue. However, it is generally believed that since Tsai Ing -wen took office, Beijing has closed the effective communication mechanism on both sides of the strait.
In this regard, June Teufeldreyer, a professor at the Department of Political Department of the University of Miami, analyzed in this interview that the lack of a direct dialogue mechanism on both sides of the strait was in the Beijing authorities: "If one party refuses to recognize the other party's position, the two parties want Communication is ridiculous. When Tsai Ing -wen first started the first term, she said that she accepted the historical facts of 1992, but Beijing refused this statement and said that Cai Yingwen 'unfinished test papers'. I need to accept my position, and I have to talk about your position. Of course, it is difficult to happen to negotiations. Although the two sides have communication channels on both sides of the strait, Beijing refuses to use them. "
Raymondkuo, a political scientist of the United States Defense Research Consultation Institution, also said: "In the past seven years, the communication mechanism on both sides of the strait has declined significantly. I hope that these agreements can be continued after changing the government. But since Tsai Ing -wen has won the presidential election, most agreements have been terminated. "
Guo Hongjun also pointed out that cross -strait should negotiate specific issues, but it may be difficult for both parties to solve cross -strait problems if they want to fundamentally solve the problem of fundamental solution: "The Taipei government will want to restore the existing agreement and talk about the interaction between the cross -strait sea patrol in Beijing. However, if you talk about the fundamental issues of both sides of the strait, the space on both sides of the strait can be negotiated very small, especially after the suppression of the protests in Hong Kong in 2019, and the self -identification of Taiwanese people. The political space that allows the two parties to talk to each other is very narrow, almost no extent without space. "
 President Tsai Ing -wen hosted the "governance for seven years, re -defined Taiwan, and let the world see the press conference in Taiwan again.(Provided by the Presidential Palace of Taiwan) poll: Nearly half of the Chinese people do not support Wu Tong Taiwan 
At the same time, the international journal "Journal of Contemporarychina" recently announced a latest poll that shows whether to support Wutong Taiwan, only 55%of Chinese people support comprehensive attack, and 33 %Of the people oppose. Another 22%of the public said that the two sides of the strait do not have to be unified. The outside world noticed that the above results and the Chinese government's argument, that is, the so -called "all China wants Taiwan to return", which is quite different.
Guo Hongjun said this: "In this article, the public will consider human rights, economy, politics, life costs, and the possibility of intervention in the United States. Analysis of rational cost benefits will be made on the topic. "Kim Defang believes that in all the "unified Taiwan" options provided by the above polls, the proportion of the public's support is quite close to (about 55%), which shows that the public does not special attention to Taiwan issues: "This obviously does not support Xi Jinping without supporting Xi Jinping Emphasize 'The whole country is eagerly looking forward to Taiwan's return'.

Column | Night Talk Zhongnanhai: Is Xi Jinping the victim of the Cultural Revolution or the beneficiary?

 A business in Beijing is pulling a banner that depicts Mao Zedong's review of the Cultural Revolution in 1969. Photo on May 16, 2016. Associated Press Information Picture On the 19th of this month, the New York Times Chinese website published an article titled "China Can't Wit In the Cultural Revolution Ten Years", because there is a phrase "Xi Jinping himself is the victim of the Cultural Revolution -he is said to be betrayed by his mother. , Exiled to poor rural areas. "Several Chinese websites reproduced this article expanded the title to" Xi Jinping himself that the victim China cannot erase the Cultural Revolution for ten years ".
After the article was published, some readers explained why Xi Jinping was "victim of the Cultural Revolution" explained why he would lead China to "erase the Cultural Revolution for ten years", such as "children who usually grew up in domestic violence, and they will be adults. "There is a tendency to violence"; "with the old daughter -in -law for many years, it is a truth. After being abused, he thought about how to abuse others, and take it as a joy." Ah. Only I have suffered, you are happy, then my suffering is not for nothing ", and so on.
At the same time, readers have the opposite view. For example, the content of a comments is: "It's too Low in New Year. Didn't you even have a person who studied? Xi Jinping can have today, is the beneficiary of the Cultural Revolution?!Can there be today? Not a matter of political views, this is the most common logic. ".
Another example is the comments published by a net name "Timberwolf": Lao Mao said, 'Thank you Japanese aggression in China.' Because Japanese invasion of China has given Lao Mao, so you ca n’t say that Lao Mao is Japanese invasion in China. victim. In the same way, Xi Jinping took his own cultural revolutionary experience as an asset, so Xi was a profitable of the Cultural Revolution rather than the victim. This also illustrates why Xi is going to implement the Cultural Revolution alone. "
Regarding whether Xi Jinping is the beneficiary of the Cultural Revolution or the victim, he can read the words of everyone on the Internet. An introduction of an article signed by Peng Xiaoming's "Xi Jinping Cultural Revolution" is: The middle school unification textbook of Beijing People's Education Press has made a fundamental modification of the narrative of the history of the Cultural Revolution, involving Mao Zedong's error motivation. Delete. And this has a catastrophe of the people of all ethnic groups of urban and rural areas in the country, renamed the hard -to -discover period of the ups and downs of the ups and downs. This lightly described strokes are completely different from the historical resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Cultural Revolution is "a historical conclusion that Mao Zedong mistakenly launch and leadership". Today, the victims of the Cultural Revolution are still alive, and the Communist Party's government leadership group led by Xi Jinping has blatantly cut textbooks and denies historic resolutions. What is the Cultural Revolution in Xi Jinping's mind? At that time, the people of all ethnic groups in the country were struggling in suffering, and the Cultural Revolution in his head of his pen was another matter. There are various articles touted with Xi Jinping's life experience at home and abroad. We might as well go to pseudoly consciousness and do a rigorous screening and analysis.
Regarding Xi Jinping's father Xi Zhongxun's history of 1962 before the "Cultural Revolution" broke out, it was not detailed here. Xi Zhongxun left the deputy prime minister's position in 1962. He was internally reserved and still retained public office. He was not arrested and detained, and he was repeatedly told by Zhou Enlai to "don't think of (suicide)." He was arranged to "learn" (for review) at the West Palace Institute of the Central Party School. Xi Jinping's mother had worked in the party school in unison. In fact, the couple were in the party school.
The next step is the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution". From the perspective of personal and family, the Xi Zhongxun Xi Jinping family of that year did have suffered a lot of twists and turns and suppression. However, from the background of the entire China and the Cultural Revolution, especially compared with the Hu Feng's counter -revolutionary group case and the Peng Lu Luoyang anti -Party group case, the disposal of Xi Zhongxun's case was relatively mild. The Hu Feng case involved 2,100 people, and 92 people were arrested. Many people died in prisons and labor reform. Many people were crazy, and only a few people lived.
When Xi Zhongxun was abandoned by Mao Zedong because of the use of novels, the Cultural Revolution had not erupted. On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, Xi Zhongxun transferred to Luoyang, but was fortunate to escape the Beijing catastrophe. Essence At that time, Liu Shaoqi himself died of illness, Wang Guangmei was imprisoned for a long time, his eldest son committed suicide, and the remaining children were persecuted. Peng Dehuai and Tao Zhu were detained for many years and died ... Xi Zhongxun was not sentenced to prison, retaining his identity, traveling, batching, and only deaf ears. In contrast, he was still lucky.
At that time, Xi Zhongxun was decentralized to Luoyang, and the whole family did not follow. Peng Xiaoming's article analyzed: Xi Jinping, born in 1953, is still impressed by all the tragic political movements before the Cultural Revolution. Adolescents of the same age should generally have the impression of hunger and food, but the abdomen of the great famine, but at the time, Beijing and provinces and cities had corresponding nutritional special supplies.
When the Cultural Revolution transferred to the cow ghost snake god (cracking down on the ground) into the crackdownist, the Xi family was also impacted. However, in comparison, the impact of the family members who did not follow Xi Zhongxun's family to Luoyang was not serious. According to the analysis of Peng Xiaoming's article, because the time was later than the crazy climax of "Sweeping Four", about 100,000 families in the climax were driven out of the streets and escorted the rural settlement. The Xi Jinping family was far from being so miserable; they were arranged to move into the Central Party School and live in the place where Xi Jinping's mother work. Of course, there are no telephones, secretaries, and guards in the high -dry dormitory in the party school, but it is basically normal for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Compared with celebrities such as Lao She and Chen Mengjia, some capitalists and small owners' families, the Red Guards used their belts and hot water. Many people were killed on the spot. The Xi Jinping family was lucky.
The author agrees that the conclusion of "Xi Jinping's family is still lucky" in Peng Xiaoming's article. Of course, this "luck" is relatively speaking. For example, Deng Pufang, the eldest son of Deng Xiaoping, was forced to jump off the building to death by the rebels. For example, compared to the non -human treatment of Mrs. Liu Shaoqi and their children ...
Experience about "Cultural Revolution" Xi Jinping ". According to the introduction of "Xi Jinping's Biography", Peng Xiaoming's article said that Xi Jinping had been hit by the Cultural Revolution. For example, after being detained, after the escape, the mother did not dare to retain, and took the initiative to send him back to the section, and was listed at the commissioned conference.
Peng Xiaoming believes that it may be that Xi Jinping himself also has an excessive action of participating in the linkage, shouting the slogan against Jiang Qing and the Central Cultural Revolution. Students have physical conflicts ... After all, all the targets of the arrest and linkage were all children of the Gaogan family, and there were no disadvantages. At that time, Xi Jinping's excessive words and deeds should be known to his mother, so he fled home, and his mother did not dare to retain, and still sent him back to the location of the detention.It is also this "New York Times". As early as 2015, it published an article describing Xi Jinping's "Cultural Revolution", the title was "Xi Jinping coming out of the Cultural Revolution".
In the text, when the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution broke out, he was still a 13 -year -old boy with a thin figure, talking about the temperature and classical poetry. Two years later, in the process of wandering in Beijing, where the red guards who were in the wind, Xi Jinping became strong and became a fighter who survived in adversity.
This article in the New York Times quoted the content of an interview published by Xi Jinping in 2000 during 2000. Xi Jinping recalled that he was stunned by the rebels because he was unwilling to be bullied. He thought I was the head. "He said.
The New York Times at the time of this article also said: By the end of 1968, Xi Jinping's resistance was enough to let the above ordered him to send him to the children who were knocked down. However, Chairman Mao recently issued instructions to let the city youth go to the mountains and go to the countryside, so that he would avoid the fate of being detained.
The description of the New York Times is roughly described by the interviewers before Xi Jinping's work in the central government. That is, he was only interrogated by the rebels before "going to the countryside", not a real "detention".
As for Xi Jinping's experience of "being detained" that year, the cause was not that he had participated in the so -called Red Guard Organization at the time "and" smashed and snatched ", but he was forced to go to the countryside to escape back to Beijing and be regarded as" Blind flow "closed into the shelter". The so -called "mother's heart dare not take" the romance of the fart.
The fact is that all the "urban knowledge youths who were forced to go up to the countryside at that time were" "urban knowledge youth" before leaving to be canceled the city residence, that is, Xi Jinping at that time from the West At the beginning of the train, his Beijing city residence has become a rural residence in Yan'an, Shaanxi. In this way, whether he is Xi Jinping or other "knowledge youths" who have been forced to "go to the countryside" to return to the original city, they will be regarded as "blind flow" by the local public security. "Original". The "nationality" here refers to the "household registration", which is the place where the household registration at that time.
According to Xi Jinping's public resume, the initial time he went to Liangjiahe, Shaanxi was in January 1969, and the time to leave there was October 1975, and the full beam was all six years and ten months. After all, with the official official statement of the so -called "seven years of Liang Jiahe", Xi Jinping himself also said "the more than 2,400 days and nights with our farmers' brothers that year."
However, when Xi Jinping said this after the General Secretary, it was obviously forgotten that when he was still working in Fujian in 2000, he was interviewed by reporters as follows. Forced to go, there is no long -term concept. Others go up to the mountain every day, but I am casual, and the people are very impressed with me. A few months later, I returned to Beijing and was put into a "study class". After half a year, I was released. I saw my old revolutionary uncle and aunt. They said that the city is not easy now. What do you do here (Beijing)? Every day, let people treat people as a population? At that time, the "reverse" population was often cleaned up in National Day, but after cleaning up, we did not let us go back. They were closed at the police station first and four or five months after entering. And it is not to let you sit in vain, but also let you work hard. The sewer pipes in Haidian Street are buried ...
Xi Jinping's "National Day" here should be the National Day in 1969. Calculated that Xi Jinping returned to Beijing's house from the northern Shaanxi area in mid -1969. This "two times after returning to Beijing" dictatorship "has added for eleven months, that is, that is, that is, it is He said that he was forced to return to Liangjiahe, Shaanxi during the early 1970s to mid -year. Even if the process of seeing his uncle in Beijing has only been seen between the "dictatorship" in Beijing, it is only one day. Six years.
It is more important to emphasize that shortly after Xi Jinping returned from Beijing to Liangjiahe, perhaps before returning to Liangjiahe, his uncle and aunt of his old revolution had revealed to him the "About the Admissions of Tsinghua University of Peking University in June 1970 (pilot Tsinghua University (pilot pilot pilot ) Report ", the report states that after three years of the Cultural Revolution, Peking University and Tsinghua University have already had enrollment conditions and planned to start enrollment in the second half of this year. The enrollment method is combined with the recommendation of the masses, the approval of leadership, and the school review, that is, there is no need to take the exam after entering the university. According to Peng Xiaoming's article "Xi Jinping's Culture League Examination", Xi Jinping's mother at that time wrote to the Liangjiahe Party branch to ask Xi Jinping to pursue progress. This "mother's letter" is an early pavement of Xi Jinping's recommended care in the future. It not only said hello to Xi Jinping, and is not as ugly as other educated cadres and parents who are verbally or written in writing. Before the Xi family restored its reputation, it was just right, and it was not sick. The small cadres of the party branch of the production team and the commune party committee were all flattered and felt that Xi Jinping was not the same educated youth. Since then, striving to go to college has also become an important driving force for Xi Jinping.
"The Cultural Revolution" Mr. Song Yongyi, an authoritative person in the Cultural Revolution, said in an interview with the New York Times reporter: A person's attitude towards a political movement often goes on the whole, that is, it depends on whether he is in the middle of this political movement, or it is damaged or damaged. many. As far as Xi Jinping is concerned, he is more beneficial and less damaged. In the early days of the "Cultural Revolution", Xi Jinping studied in Bayi School, Beijing's Bayi School, and was a school of the children of military cadres. This school has two characteristics. One is that there are many sisters and some high -ranking children. Xi Jinping was sent in because of poor homework. He is different from Bo Xilai. Bo Xilai reads Beijing No. 4 Middle School and is the best middle school in China. It was taken in. So why did Bo Xilai look down on Xi Jinping, because everyone in Bayi school rely on parents' relationships, and did not pass the examination of admission.
Mr. Song Yongyi said: What is Xi Jinping in the "Cultural Revolution"? Soon after the "Cultural Revolution", Xi Jinping got off his hometown. After he got out of his hometown, he became a rural branch secretary, and soon he was recommended to enter Tsinghua as "workers and peasants". After entering Tsinghua University, it was basically smooth. According to Xi Jinping's level, can you enter Tsinghua? The graduates of the first Bayi school of the "Cultural Revolution" rarely admitted to Tsinghua.
What needs to be supplemented here is that Bo Xilai not only entered the men's fourth middle school before the Cultural Revolution. After the "Cultural Revolution", Bo Xilai also entered Peking University by the college entrance examination.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))

Reading in one minute: 
The Federal House of Representatives passed the bill in mid -May in the middle of May, which aims to counter the decision of China to try to obstruct Taiwan's participation in international organizations by trying to obstruct Taiwan. The bill refers to the resolution of the 2758 of the United University to deal with the issue of China's representative power and does not involve Taiwan. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the China State Council criticized the US proposal errors and ridiculous, claiming that the decision of the United University No. 2758 resolved "the issue of representative rights of the United Nations, including Taiwan, including Taiwan".
Through the original text of the 2758th decision of United University, and visiting international law scholars and professionals, the Asian factual investigation laboratory believes that the resolution of the 2758 UNAC has not resolved the "whether Taiwan is part of China". The decision and unilateral claim of the resolution.
Deep analysis: 
The 76th World Health Conference (WHA) was held in Geneva, Switzerland from May 21st to 30th. Taiwan has not been invited for seven consecutive years. The U.S. government and Congress have taken action to participate in Taiwan. US Secretary of State AntonyBlinken passed [] on the 9th It is said that the United States strongly encourages the WHO (WHO) to invite Taiwan to attend the WHA this year as an observer; Brosky also pointed out that the United States supports Taiwan to participate in appropriate international activities, which is in line with the Taiwan Relations Law, the United States and China Bulletin, and six guarantees as the standards as the standards. of" "" ".
On May 16, the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee passed The purpose is to counter the decision of China to try to obstruct the discussion of Taiwan's participation in international organizations by the decision No. 2758; The representative rights of the organization did not show their position on the relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, nor did they include any statement related to Taiwan's sovereignty.
China State Council spokesman Ma Xiaoguang on the 17th Responsive the above -mentioned US actions. He said that regarding Taiwan's participation in the event of the WHO, China's position is consistent and clear, that is, it is necessary to deal with it in accordance with the principle of China. This is also the fundamental principle confirmed by the UNU No. 2758 and the WHO No. 25.1 resolution.
In response to the contents of the bill passed by the US House of Representatives, Ma Xiaoguang pointed out that the decision of the United University No. 2758 completely solved the problem of representative power including the United Nations, including Taiwan, including Taiwan, and the procedures. Essays repeatedly on the resolution 2758 of the United University, either ignorance or ulterior motives. Any attempt to distort or even deny the authority and effectiveness of the UNU 2758 resolution is futile.
What is the resolution of the UN General Assembly 2758 ? **
After the Civil War of the Communist Party of China in 1949, the Republic of China government of the Kuomintang retired from Taiwan. Since then, the People's Republic of China established by the Communist Party has tried to obtain a seat of the United Nations representative "China". Since 1950, the Soviet Union and other countries have successively proposed the "Chinese representative rights" at the United Nations. In the early days, most of the pro -American countries, the proposal was not approved. Until 1971, the United States made concessions to the People's Republic of China to fight the Soviet Union, accepted the People's Republic of China, and enabled it to obtain the power of the United Nations. The United States has proposed the idea of dual representative rights to try to promote the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China to have the United Nations membership at the same time, but it has not been successful.
On October 25, 1971, the UN General Assembly passed the decision No. 2758: restore all rights of the People's Republic of China, acknowledge that the government's representative is the only legal representative of China in the United Nations, and immediately brought Chiang Kai -shek's representatives from the United Nations organization and it. Exit from the seats illegally occupied by all institutions.
 UN Convention No. 2758 Original text (screenshot of the United Nations official website)
Fifty Many years later, there are still controversy 
The resolution of the 2758 United University of the University only handled the "Chinese representative power", and the original text did not mention the Republic of China or Taiwan. However, Beijing believes that "the decision of the 275th University of the United Nations University has resolved the issue of the representative rights of the United Nations, including the whole China in Taiwan", and cited this resolution for many years, saying that Taiwan is part of China to oppose Taiwan's participation in international organization activities.
Rebuting the Chinese discussion many times refers to the resolution of the 2758 UN General Assembly that only handle China ’s representative power in the United Nations. Therefore, the resolution did not solve the problem of the people of Taiwan's participation in the United Nations.
JulianKu, a professor of international law at the University of Hofstra University, replied to the Asian factual investigation laboratory's interview with an email. He said that the 2758 resolution of the United University's 2758 did not solve the problem of part of China in China; The resolution did solve the problem that the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China as the legal representative of the United Nations, and believed that the People's Republic of China should represent China in the United Nations, but the resolution did not involve the sovereignty of the Republic of China or Taiwan at all.
Davidkeegan, former deputy director of the Taipei Office in the Taiwan Association (AIT), told the Asian factual inspection laboratory. China.
China's error interpretation of the Ledu University 2758 resolution? 
Ge Tianhao pointed out that China is distorting the 2758 resolution of the United University because it helps Beijing to pressure Taipei and accept the uniformity of Beijing; Beijing uses the distortion of the agreement to isolation in Taiwan, directly or or directly or or military security in economic, diplomatic security, and military security. Indirectly caused damage to Taiwan, and the US Congress's proposal was to counter the decision to counter China's error interpretation of the UNU No. 2758 and use this error to interpret damage to Taiwan.Gujulun believes that over the years, the U.S. government has not actively counterclaimed China's interpretation of the resolutions of the 2758 of the United University, because they want to avoid unnecessary conflicts with China, and because the Taiwan government itself (under the leadership of Chiang Kai -shek and Chiang Chingguo) No objection to this interpretation; but in the near future, the United States and Taiwan are more worried that China will take military operations against Taiwan, while the UNU resolution will be used to restrict foreign support from Taiwan.

South Korean Unified Minister, Quan Ning Shi, urged North Korean leader Kim Jong -un to examine the current surrounding situation and return to the road of dialogue.
The Yonhap News Agency reported that Quan Ning Shi Monday (May 22) held a first anniversary of the Journalist Symposium in the North -South Talks Headquarters in Seoul. At the meeting, he pointed out that Kim Jong -un has advertised "with the people as the heaven" and "the people's primaryist" in his first speech after he took power, and determined to make the people live a rich life, but this is in stark contrast to the current economic dilemma of North Korea.
Quan Ningshi said that South Korea has no hostility to North Korea and does not pursue the status quo by strength. Any issues that the DPRK cares can be placed on the dialogue table. He hoped that Kim Jong -un stopped provocation and isolation and embarked on the road of Huinan livelihood and promoting cooperation.
Quan Ningshi reviewed the past year's evaluation that North Korea's nuclear threats and provocations continued, and the situation on the peninsula was not alleviated, which was regrettable. However, the government's correction of the policy framework that has no vinegar and the designated sustainable advancement is worthy of recognition. The most important thing is that the government has established principled South Korea -DPRK relations to do what to do. In the future, he will continue to work hard to strive for substantial results.

The EU privacy regulatory agency claimed that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, violated the previous court ruling and transferred EU user data to the United States. Therefore, it was a record of 1.2 billion euros (about 1.746 billion yuan) of Meta's record.
Comprehensive Agence France -Presse and Reuters reported that the Irish Data Protection Commission made the above -mentioned fine decision on Meta on Monday (May 22) and asked Meta to stop transferring user data to the United States within five months.
Luxembourg fined 746 million euros in Amazon in 2021. The amount of fines faced by Meta this time was almost twice that of Amazon.
In the statement, Meta stated that it would appeal to the decision, including "unreasonable and unnecessary fines" and seeking a suspension of execution orders through the court.
"If there is no ability to transmit data from cross -border transmission, the Internet will be risked into the islands of the country and region."
The Supreme Court of the European Union made a decision in July 2020. The EU-American Data Transmission Agreement Privacy Shield (PrivacyShield) passed in 2016 was invalid, and pointed out that domestic laws in the United States obtained and used data transmitted from the European Union to make personal data from the EU, so that personal data Limited protection means that the data of EU citizens is not safe.
The European Commission said on Monday that it is expected to finalize a data transmission agreement with the United States before this summer to ensure the stability and legal certainty of the EU-US data transmission.

 FOOTLOCKER's double -digit decline in the turnover, cracking down on the Group's stock price over 27 % last Friday. (Agence France -Presse)

Following Target, TJ Maxx, and Wal -Mart's major retailers last week announced a series of performances that exceeded expected, market investors inevitably look forward to FOOTLOCKER's performance. But the disappointing Foot Locker's performance may now be a sign of the retail industry's next downhill.

The executive also said that the group must also actively launch various promotions to persuade consumers to spend disposable income to buy shoes and clothes in order to reduce accumulated inventory.

Previously, Foot Locker's executives predict that non -GAAP's profit per share will be from $ 3.35 to $ 3.65, but now they have reduced this forecast number to $ 2 to $ 2.25.
Foot Locker's disappointing performance also worried investors to retailers who will release their performance next. This week's performances include: Kohl ’s, American, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren and Gap and other retailers. According to Bank of America, 45 % of companies in the retail industry have not yet released financial reports.

The Malaysian Ministry of Health is ready to submit the "Tobacco and Smoking Control Act 2022" again.

When the Minister of Sanitary Minister Kelly first submitted the bill in the Congress in October 2022, it caused controversy because the bill was fined RM 5,000 (about S $ 1480). At that time, Congress disbanded on October 10, so the bill was not completed. After the opposition, it agreed to submit the bill to the special committee of the Congress, and then submit it again by the Ministry of Health.
Hillmi said that the Congress Special Committee made a number of amendments to the original bill, including the proposal that the government's fines of the offenders were reduced from the original RM5,000 to RM500 to avoid constituting a financial burden on the offenders. He said that the committee also suggested that the punishment options include community services, which shows that the purpose of the government to formulate this bill is education rather than punishment.

The frequent occurrence of the American campus shooting has aroused concerns about domestic teachers and students and parents, but also attracted the attention of technology companies. Existing technology companies urged the school to use scientific and technological means to prevent campus shooting.
Robe Elementary School in UVALDE in southern Texas suffered a large -scale shooting last year last year, causing 21 people to die. This kind of large -scale shooting tragedy has stimulated the needs of American schools for technical security systems.
Reuters reports that the electric shock gun manufacturer Axon Enterprise proposes the idea of developing "non -lethal" drones for the school, saying that drones can be launched by an artificial intelligence (AI) -driven monitoring system.
However, this idea triggered a moral uproar, and the AI Ethical Advisory Commission of the AI Ethical Advisory of AI announced its withdrawal from the company to protest. This also reflects whether the US society is increasingly worried about whether the security tools that technology companies actively sell to the school have moral considerations and effectiveness.
The former principal of the Roanoke School, Virginia, recalled that she had often received sales calls including drones, AI -driven monitoring cameras, and weapon detectors to block all related numbers.
For some experts and school security officials, new tools based on technology are only one of the practical means to solve the violence of campus.
Companies such as Omnilert and Zeroeyes have provided gun detection technology, and suggested that the school installed the company's products on the campus, thereby discovering and controlling threats faster and more effectively to prevent shooting.
Johnson, director of the Security and Health Campus Center of John Hopkins, said that the school can use the crown disease relief fund and other government funds of nearly $ 200 billion (about S $ 269.1 billion) to purchase such tools. Now more schools are now With ample funds and strong departments to promote these technologies.
However, the national campus security and security service company seriously questioned the efficacy of such tools, saying that the school has become a very underdeveloped AI software fertile soil, and was regarded by technology companies as small rats. More and more educational institutions are attracted by gorgeous technical solutions, but they have forgotten basic measures such as how to train teachers how to deal with shooting events, improve structural improvements in buildings, and maintain the habit of lock door.
Johnson also commented that these AI technologies lack of peer review. Although it may help accelerate the response of the school, it is unlikely to stop the gunner.
Johnson also pointed out the moral defects, saying that students should be classmates in school, rather than potential criminal suspects.
Johnson and other experts are worried that the monitoring plan for campus violence is likely to create atmosphere of distrust and doubt with each other, which encourages the hostile environment that is not conducive to learning, especially for some students from the black communities and other over -control communities.
This is also the main points emphasized by the AI Ethical Advisory Committee of AI AI Ethics in the resignation letter. The members of the committee wrote in the public letter that the monitoring of the drone plan will cause harm".
In addition, from the long run, how much such security tools can produce are also questioned by American schools.

The Global Vaccine Immune Alliance (Gavi) on Monday (May 22) stated in a report that cholera was outbreak worldwide, and the shortage of cholera vaccines may continue until 2025.
Reuters reported that last year, the cholera disease spread to some conflict and highly poor areas, and the number of cholera cases and the number of deaths surged. The World Health Organization said on Friday (19th) that there were 24 countries reporting the cholera epidemic this year, and only 15 last year, and the mortality rate was higher than expected.
In order to cope with this serious situation, WHO and institutional partners temporarily change the choice vaccination policy, from previous inoculation of two doses of vaccine to only one dose. But the vaccine reserve was still exhausted in December last year.
Henry Gray, the person in charge of WHO, said that the prospects were very dim, and WHO could not provide sufficient vaccines. Among the 18 million doses of cholene vaccines this year, only 8 million doses are available.
Gavi pointed out that 48 million doses of cholene vaccines have been used in the past two years, more than 10 million doses over the past ten years. There are currently enough doses to meet the emergency needs for cholera, but it is not enough for preventive use.
Gavi also emphasized that considering the increase in existing manufacturers and new companies entering the market, the supply of cholera vaccines should be improved by 2026. Gavi calls for better planning for cholera vaccines to ensure that vaccines are used in the most needed places such as prevention activities.
Chilen is transmitted by contaminated foods or water. Although it usually only causes mild symptoms or asymptomatic, in severe cases, acute diarrhea can be caused. Without treatment, patients may die within a few hours.
Safe water and sanitary facilities are very important for preventing cholera diseases, but at the same time, vaccination and rapid treatment are needed.

Description: (Agence France -Presse, India, India, 22nd) India held a tourist meeting in the Kashmir region with controversy in sovereignty today, and deliberately diluted strict alerts. Due to the continuous violence conflict of Kashmir for decades, New Delhi has tried to show the local normalization image.

 The Muslim population, Kashmir, is divided by India and Pakistan, but both claims that they have the entire area sovereignty. Pakistan and India also have territorial disputes in G20 member states China both condemned India to choose to hold the meeting in Kashmir and absence against resistance.
Kashmir's local rebellion seemed to be independent or merged into Pakistan, which caused tens of thousands of civilians, soldiers and rebels for decades. New Derry canceled the limited autonomous power enjoyed by Kashmir in 2019, changed to direct control, and implemented a long -term blockade.
Since then, the rebellious forces have been hit, and the number of deaths every year has also dropped from thousands of to 253 last year, but local young men continue to be armed.
Kashmir has magnificent mountains, and India is now promoting local sightseeing. The airport slogan is called "paradise on earth." Last year, more than 1 million Indian tourists visited Kashmir to benefit local tourists. The Indian government wants to use this G20 tourism conference to show the return of Kashmir to "normal and peace."
However, Indian objections have been violated repeatedly, and the media's freedom and public demonstration have also been limited. Critics pointed out that these are examples of New Delhi tightening citizens' freedom.
The three -day G20 tourist meeting was held on the bank of Dallake, the capital of Kashmir, the capital of Kashmir. The Indian police only stated last week that "any terror attacks may occur during the meeting." It has strengthened security alert; Slina and armored vehicle deployment has also appeared today.
However, many inspection whistles originally covered with metal grids and thorns mesh have been demolished last night; some quasi -military police also hidden in the G20 publicity board to stand behind. These look like measures to minimize the exposure of We'an.
The PEOPLE's Anti-FascistFrontfrontfront, which was rushed to the Kashmir new rebel group after 2019, condemned the meeting and threatened to "deploy suicide bombs." The statement wrote: "Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, it is coming."
The Indian government will have two ministers attending the meeting, but several Western countries will only send diplomats stationed in India to attend the meeting. Except for China, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are expected to send representatives.
